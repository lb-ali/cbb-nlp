# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Mark Turgeon, Texas A&M University. Your
opening comments.  
COACH TURGEON: Happy to be here. I've been walking around here a little bit
easier than the first year. I think I was kind of trying to figure everything
out last year. I'm looking forward to this year. Everybody at this point likes
the team. We've worked hard. We've stayed relatively healthy. To this point
we've had a good spring, good summer, a good fall.  
And we're still a little upset the way our season ended the last year, we
thought we let one get away, so had a pretty good chip on our shoulder working
throughout the summer.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could talk about Josh Carter and what you've seen from him
in terms of stepping up his leadership ability, because knowing the void that
was left with Dominique Kirk, Joseph Jones and Beau leaving?  
COACH TURGEON: If you know anything about Josh, he's a quiet person. To get
him to say anything sometimes is difficult. But he's a smart kid. He's tried
really hard. We've only had one practice so far that wasn't good.  
And he really tried to get after the guys, encouraged him to practice harder.
I think he's done a nice job in the locker room.  
The thing Josh has done a tremendous job is with his work habits, work ethic.
He's been really driven since the season ended last year. I think you'll see a
big change in his game whether it's dribbling or passing or hopefully shooting
the ball the way he did his sophomore season.  
He's led in a couple of different ways. So I've been really pleased with Josh
and his development over the summer.  
  
Q. For a lot of years people said that the Big 12 needed a national
championship in men's basketball got one last year with Kansas. Can that help
the league or does that most benefit Kansas?  
COACH TURGEON: Oh, no, it helps the league. There's a lot of things that have
helped our league. Our television package increased with ESPN. I think that
helps your recruiting. Kansas winning. We've had teams in the Final Four,
quite a few teams.  
That helps. One team in the league can do it, it lets everybody else think
they can do it. So, no, I think it was great. I think it was great for the Big
12. Of course, we want to be the team, not just the Jayhawks. Of course, I was
partial to them last year when they won it, it was great.  
But it was tremendous. And it lets the rest of us know that we can get it
done. And it will give us credibility, too, I think. If you look through all
the things that the Big 12 has done in the last few years -- I'm not an expert
because I'm new in the league -- but I think we've had the second-most teams
in the Final Four, maybe the most over the last five or six years. We've had a
lot of teams get in.  
But when you have a national champion, coming off a great year, I do think it
gives you more credibility going into the next season, which might help us as
the season goes on and on Selection Sunday.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the strength of the conference in general this season
and then the depth of the Big 12 South in particular?  
COACH TURGEON: I just thought that league was so good last year. Two teams in
the Elite Eight. Some other teams that could have advanced further in the
tournament. We had teams that got better as the season went on. I think the
depth was pretty good last year. A team like Nebraska, the strides they made
as a basketball program.  
I thought it was a tremendous league. I think this year's league, which will
be exciting for the fans, will be more wide open. The only thing that's --
what you're getting at, the depth of the South, it's kind of scary. So if you
win the league out of the South this year, you've had one heck of a year.  
And Oklahoma obviously is going to be really good. Texas, I think, is going to
be great again. Baylor's got everybody back but one guy, and they've tasted it
now. So they're going to have a great season.  
I don't want to forget somebody. Oklahoma State, new coach. Good players,
really good players on their team. So I know they'll be excited. I know Pat's
excited about his team and I'm excited about my team.  
So the South is really tough. And I was looking through the commitments so
far. I think 23 of the top 150 rivals commitments in 2009 are going to the Big
12 and 17 are going to the South.  
So South's going to continue to be good. So but with that said, I think the
North's getting better too. I think Colorado second year is going to be
better. I know Coach McDermott, I've watched him. I know he's going to build a
great program. Doc has done a great job. Frank, K-State is going to do well. I
think the whole league is going to be better, which should help things in the
end.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on the adjustments you've referenced earlier from last
season, what was difficult and how much more comfortable you feel in the
position this year?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I'm used to being the most well-liked guy in town
everywhere I've been. And it wasn't always the case last year. I followed a
guy that did a heck of a job at Texas A&M. So that was different for me. And
so I had to adjust to that.  
I didn't know the players that well. They didn't know me that well. Now I feel
like they know my personality and I know their personality. We know what to
expect.  
Last year I inherited some new coaches. I was teaching the coaches and
players. I think where we are now in practice seven compared to where we were
last year at practice seven, how much more comfortable we are with everything
we're doing. And we had a heck of a year last year. Third most wins in our
school history and we're an eyelash from a Sweet 16.  
But day-to-day just everything is better. Everything is better. Familiar
faces, not walking up what's his name again. You know names, you know people.
It's just day-to-day life is so much happier. Family is happier, not in a
rental house anymore. Things like that.  
So whether we can have another great season remains to be seen. We have to
stay healthy. But I just know day to day it's a lot more fun.  
  
Q. Can you tell me what life -- how much better life can be with a seven-
footer on your roster than without one, and this one in particular?  
COACH TURGEON: Who are you talking about, I don't have any seven-footers. I've
got 6'-11" guys. Which guy are you talking about?  
  
Q. James.  
COACH TURGEON: James Blasczyk. He's still growing. I just didn't know if
anybody knew about him. We signed him so late. That's a good question. I think
it all depends on the seven-footer. I've been pleased with James. James is a
guy we took late. He's a local guy we took late when DeAndre decided to go
pro.  
Signed at TCU, they had a coaching change. Watched him in the spring and felt
like he could help us. James' best days are still ahead of him. He's got a lot
to learn about the game. He came in at 255. Got him down to 225. His body
weight was all water.  
And so we got that down. Now we're building him back up. The thing I like
about James is he fights through fatigue. A lot of big guys will stop. He
fights through it, which will give him a chance to be a player some day.  
So he's got some skill. Like most freshmen he's got a long way to go
defensively and a lot to learn, but eventually he'll help our program.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the other two freshmen, you're about five practices
in Dash Harris and David Loubeau?  
COACH TURGEON: I think Dash is much further along than David right now. Dash
is a pass-first point guard, really fast, very good defender, going to help us
tremendously. Yesterday in practice alone he had 11 assists and one turnover.  
We're trying to change the way we play. We're trying to play faster. We
weren't able to do that last year, and Dash is going to help us do it. We just
have to have somebody to run with him. I love his decision-making. Great on-
ball defender. He's just going to help us. He's going to help us and be a part
of the rotation and he's a winner.  
David Loubeau is a 6'-8", long wing span. Probably the thing he does best is
he really rebounds the ball well. Offensively he's a 15- to 17-footer, face-
up, knock down those shots and he has a good back to the basket game. Right
now his head's spinning. It's going way too fast for him. And we need him to
be part of our rotation this year but he's got a long ways to go right now as
of today to do that.  
But he's got a lot of pride and he gets a little bit better every day but he's
got a chance to be a really good one for us down the road.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Coach Bill Self from Kansas. Welcome, and your
opening thoughts.  
COACH SELF: Well, opening thoughts, I think this is an exciting time for all
coaches and everybody's excited about their team and everybody's undefeated
and has high expectations, and certainly we fall in that category. And it's
been a good off-season and we've added some nice players into the mix and we
needed to because we lost so many guys.  
But it's going to be, I believe, a fun year for us. I'm excited about working
with these young guys.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you describe what your life has been like these past few months on
the tilt-a-whirl and are you glad to be getting back to the business of doing
some coaching?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, I am. My life has been hectic, but there's a lot of guys and
ladies out there whose lives are hectic and have a lot going on. And we've had
a lot of things going on, but there's been a lot of worthwhile things we've
tried to squeeze in to do since there's been more opportunities this past six
months than there maybe has been in other times following the season.  
But it's been wild but it still beats work. And I hope I'm busy every off-
season like this. That means we probably had a pretty successful run.  
But it is nice to get back to coaching your team and you know where you're
going to spend the night every night and that kind of stuff, because I'm
probably less busy now coaching our team than I have been the last six months
as far as trying to cram so many different things into the day.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what benefits come to your program with the national
championship, some tangible things, and then more broadly what sort of
benefits that could have for the Big 12?  
COACH SELF: Well, I think for the University of Kansas, I think there's been
many benefits. I think our interest level is at an all-time high at a place
where the interest level has always been very high.  
I think because of us winning it, it helps spearhead improvements, major,
major improvements in facilities that would have gotten done, but it probably
accelerated that. And also from a recruiting standpoint. I don't think winning
it guarantees you anything, because you still have to be people -- more times
than not on their turf recruiting.  
So we've still got to go to LA and USC and Southern Cal, you've got Chicago
and Illinois and Michigan State and Notre Dame there. You've got to go
different spots and you're in somebody else's turf, but I think we're in the
game and I think that's certainly assisted us in being in the game.  
And from a league standpoint, from my vantage point it's ridiculous that the
Big 12 had to validate the play of our league in men's basketball when you've
had so many teams in the Final Four and Elite Eights over the time that the
league's been in existence.  
But I don't think coaches felt that ever. But from the outside of the media
perspective, it's something that probably needed to be done just to validate
that, hey, this is as good a basketball league as there is anywhere.  
  
Q. I'm sure you had some idea before you won a national championship of what
you thought it might feel like after the fact. Now that you've had a chance to
reflect on it, what did it feel like to win a national championship, and also
was there a time last year when you thought Byron Eaton was playing as well as
anyone in the league?  
COACH SELF: I thought that for one 40-minute period when he played Kansas,
that's for sure, because he kicked us pretty good when we played at Oklahoma
State last year. I thought Byron was fabulous.  
But certainly the feelings of winning the championship, I think, is the only
time that I've ever felt the win felt better than the losses felt bad. The
only time.  
I've never had a game where I felt that winning that game felt as good as bad
the losses hurt. And that was like you could add all the losses up and it
definitely still feels better.  
The thing that I probably underestimated in winning it, because I hadn't
thought about it, was the internal satisfaction that you get that's non-
public-related for your players and for everybody that's just joined in and
played a role in helping a group get there.  
And that could be, you know -- you just realize there's so many people that
take just such great pride and played a role in helping you coach your team,
helping put you in a position to even be in that game and those sorts of
things.  
To me it's pretty humbling because there's a lot of people that have given
their heart and soul to this profession and we had an opportunity to
experience as good as it possibly can feel. So we feel pretty blessed and
lucky with that.  
  
Q. With you and Kansas State losing so many underclassmen early, how much do
you think the balance of power swings back down to the South this year?  
COACH SELF: I think if you talked to the coaches in the South, they'll say
that the balance of the power has been in the South for a while. If you talk
to the coaches in the North, they think the south coaches don't know what
they're talking about.  
But I do think on paper the South appears to be very, very strong. I'm not
saying the North does not appear to be strong. I'm just saying the South
appears to be very strong, when you have Oklahoma and Texas and Baylor, who is
picked 1, 2 and 3 in the league. So obviously I'm not the only one who feels
that way.  
But I will tell you this: Expect the unexpected. I mean, that's always the way
it works in our league. You're going to have guys step up and that are -- from
my vantage point, from your vantage point, how could you not think that
K-State and Kansas would take a step backwards based on what they lost? How
many have been to practice so far and know what we gained when we lost guys?  
So, I mean, K-State may not have Beasley and we may not have our guys and that
kind of stuff, but there are nice pieces to replace them. And sometimes the
pieces can lend itself to becoming very, very good teams. And that's the goal
is not to have the best teams, the goal is to have the best team, which the
best players give you the best chance.  
I do think that the league will be as competitive as it is every year and
history certainly played out to be true in that regard.  
  
Q. From what you've seen in practice, is there a reason to think that you're
better than some people might believe?  
COACH SELF: I don't think we're very good right now at all. I do think we have
a chance to get good, because I think we have some nice pieces. There's much
less margin for error. Last year Darnell gets hurt, you put Sasha in there or
-- so there's much less margin for error.  
But I don't think that we should just look at what we lost, because we did get
some nice players coming in, and I do think we'll be very competitive, and I
think we've got a chance to be good. I just don't know when that time frame
will occur.  
But hopefully it will occur before conference play begins, but there's no
reason why we shouldn't be very competitive this year.  
  
Q. Among those new faces, has anybody caught your eye in particular in only
a week?  
COACH SELF: I would say. I think Tyshawn Taylor is really a nice player and
he's a guy that nobody would know of him because he was the third or fourth
leading scorer in his high school team. Of course, his high school team that
won the mythical national championship, but he only averaged 10 a game in high
school. But he's good. And he's going to be good.  
And Marcus Morris is going to be very good. Markieff Morris has a chance to be
very good. Mario Little, Travis Releford are guys that I think can play most
places.  
So to me it's not going to be as much from do we have good enough guys, it's
going to be a situation can we just get them to understand and buy in in what
we're doing and can we get them to become a team, because we're not even close
to becoming a team. I don't know if I've even had a team become a team until
December or January.  
But certainly this group has a chance and it's kind of new and it's fresh and
there's that youthful exuberance or whatever that's kind of refreshing,
because it takes us an hour to do something last year's team took five minutes
to do, but still, yet, they work hard that entire hour at it and they're
trying. So I think that's exciting.  
  
Q. Based on what you've seen in practices so far, how are guys reacting to
the extended 3-point line?  
COACH SELF: I would say we have probably a little bit of an advantage over
some schools, because we went to Canada. And I thought Canada, without us
emphasizing it at all, we didn't emphasize it at all, but we took a lot of bad
shots. We took a lot of two and a half pointers because them just not knowing
the geography of the court as well.  
I do think it's going to have an impact. It won't have an impact with some
guys, like Abrams. He doesn't ever shoot on the line anyway.  
But there will be a majority of guys, that that 19-9 shot that was a decent
shot for them now becomes a poor shot. And something else nobody talks about,
side out of bounds is going to become a big factor, too, because guys try to
posture themselves for a 3 in the corner even though it's not like the NBA
line, that extra foot you're going to see a lot of guys stepping out of
bounds, too.  
So there will be things like that trying to position themselves to shoot a 3.
So there will be things like that that occur that I think it will take a year
or so before players really get totally comfortable.  
But makes you go down. I just can't believe that you can move it back. It
becomes a harder shot. And that does not occur. So I do think it will impact
our game.  
  
Q. You say it makes you go down, but do you think maybe it would deter
people who aren't that good at it and then just the good shooters take the 3
and it doesn't impact the percentage?  
COACH SELF: Well, in other words, coaches are going to start telling them who
can shoot and who can't shoot. Yeah, that could become true. We would never do
that at Kansas (smiling), but we would never take a guy's confidence.  
But I do think that there will probably be more of that. But when you say
makes go down, then you have less attempts. So percentages are not going to go
up, I don't care who is shooting them.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Doc Sadler from Nebraska. Opening comments.  
COACH SADLER: Thanks for coming out this morning to talk a little bit about
basketball last year. We've got a lot of things to talk about but this year I
think it's just basketball. So let's talk a little bit about our team. A lot
has been made about our size, a lot has been made about the guys that we had
sitting out in our program. A lot of things have changed a little bit I think
since we talked a year ago, we don't have the size we had with Alex.  
I really do like our basketball team. It's been the hardest-working basketball
team that I've ever coached or been associated with and we've got that quality
of people that are willing to come in and give their best each and every day
we have a chance to be successful. And that's what these guys have done.  
It's been the hardest preseason and probably it's been even the hardest five
or six days of practice through the team. So they've answered the bell. We've
got a couple of injuries, but as far as just coming and competing and getting
better, they've done that. As far as the size is concerned, I'm not really
concerned about that. I think we have to understand that our defensive
rebounding is going to be important. But other than that I think the things we
can do offensively and defensively can make up for maybe not having a big guy
there in the middle.  
The red shirts, we had four last year, all of them I think will contribute at
some point this season. Two of them have been injured. One hasn't practiced at
all. Alex Chapman and the other one Brandon Richardson has only practiced for
a few minutes. So Toney McCray and Alonzo Edwards are continuing to get
better. I do think as the season goes along both those guys are going to be
major players and help us win some basketball games.  
But saying all that, probably the greatest strength that we have is our
seniors. We've got four seniors that understand what it takes to win and more
importantly understands the work that needs to be put in to give yourself a
chance to win. And when your seniors are your four hardest workers, then I
think good things are going to happen for you and that's what we're looking
for too.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Doc, you think that you're going to have the players this year to play
the game you like to play and given the transition that many of the programs
are going through this season, do you see an opportunity for your guys to make
a move?  
COACH SADLER: Well, again, I do think we do have the players that I like to
coach and that's highly competitive people that can shoot the basketball.
We're going to be a good defensive team, there's no question in my mind. But
the thing that I've been a little bit surprised about is how well we shoot the
basketball.  
So with that, yes, we're going to get up and down a little more. We'll press a
little bit. Probably a little different than some. It's more a control type
situation, but it's one that our guys are going to like to play and it's going
to give us a chance to be competitive with our size.  
The transition, I don't know that just because we graduate some great players,
I think the year before they graduate some great players, the league did. So
this league's always going to be good. It's going to be one of the top two or
three in the country each and every year. And at least it has been the last
few years. So just because our guys that aren't here there's going to be some
new guys that some of you already know about that's going to be new in this
program.  
But I do think it gives us a chance with the four seniors that we have to
compete to maybe get in that top half now. And if we can do that and then
we'll continue to take steps in the right direction.  
  
Q. When you look at especially the North and then the Big 12 as a whole do
you see it maybe more wide open than it's ever been, the program like yourself
to maybe step up and get to the Kansases and Texases?  
COACH SADLER: I think that question was asked a little bit earlier. Obviously
we all want to get to where Kansas and Texas have been, especially where
Kansas was last year. I think the league is going to really, really balance.
But at the same time, Kansas graduated a lot of guys, but if you look at the
roster that they brought in, those guys are pretty talented, too.  
And I think I heard Bill say the other day that maybe two or three years ago
you didn't know that much about some of the guys that just graduated, and that
may be the case here.  
I think Missouri, with all the guys they've got coming back, could be a team.
I think it's a little bit more balanced. And so, therefore, the importance of
every single game is going to be really, really important. You're not going to
be able to end up at the end of the year looking at who the maybe 10th, 11th,
12th finishes are, not where we all think they're going to finish, but where
they're at, you don't need to have slipped up and let one of those teams beat
you twice or maybe beat you once, or you're not going to be up there where you
need to be. And that's what we are.  
  
Q. Couple of your receivers, JUCO last year, can you talk about the process
they had last year and at what point are they this year?  
COACH SADLER: I think that you get a chance to visit with a lot of people and
I think everybody knows how close I was to Coach Haskins, and Coach always
told me if you recruit a junior college player, do it with the understanding
it's going to take them eight or 10 games to get ready to play at the level
that they need to play at.  
And I think that was the case last year with Steven and Cole, I knew how good
they would be. We stuck with them. And I would say the last 10 or 12 games of
the conference play those two guys were as good as anybody that I would like
to have.  
So I think he saw the shooting percentages go up. Their scoring averages go up
and I haven't seen anything but to see that that's going to continue to
improve. I think they're ready to have a great year, but the season that they
had the last half was probably directly related to the success that we had.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Greg McDermott is now joining us, Iowa State coach. Your
comments.  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Good morning. It's nice finally for a season we have some
returning guards in our program. And that's been obviously an issue of both
our first two years, we started over with new guards, both in my initial
season and again last season. And sometimes those guys can have such an impact
on your practice, because of their understanding of your system.  
And just to have Diante Garrett and Bryan Petersen and Sean Haluska back in
the fold, and Lucca Staiger, even though he was not eligible last year,
certainly has an understanding of what we were doing.  
Things have gone a lot smoother to this point, and we're trying to break in
seven new faces into our program and those guys have done a terrific job of
making that happen. And then in the front line to have Alex Thompson, who
played significant minutes for us a year ago and then Craig Brackins who
showed signs of -- hopefully of what's to come in the future last season, and
now we just need him to be a little bit more consistent.  
So we're a very young team, 11 of the 15 are freshmen and sophomores. But love
their work ethic, love their attitude and have been really impressed with
their chemistry in the early going.  
Now we just have to continue to try to move this program forward.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you just look at where you might fit in in a league where there are a
lot of young teams? Kansas lost a lot. Missouri has seven new faces.  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Certainly in the North there are a lot of young faces. And I
think with young teams, the first thing you have to try to do is to try to
protect your home floor and that's something we didn't do a great job of at
times last year that has to improve this season.  
I feel like Hilton Coliseum is one of the best places in the country to play.
I think we have a terrific home court advantage because of our fans are so
loyal.  
So we have to take care of our home court first and then learn how to win on
the road. And we weren't able to get a conference road win last year. And we
had a couple of close calls, and we need to get over the hump in that regard.  
But I certainly would hope that we could move out of that bottom tier, the Big
12 and get to the point where the games we're playing at the end of February
and early March are meaningful games.  
  
Q. When you look at the overall Big 12 a lot of teams getting first place
votes. Teams like Kansas very young, as you mentioned. Is there maybe an
opening this year maybe more so than in past years where there's not that
dominant team?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I don't think there's a team that you can look at that
returns so many players that was one of the top couple teams last year that
you look at and say they're going to fill that spot.  
Certainly a team like Baylor, when you have that much experience in the guard
court and you bring all that back, I think it gives you the upper hand. I
think Texas, the returning group that Texas has, even though you take D.J.
Augustin out of the mix, he's a very talented player, but what he had around
him last year was very talented as well.  
So I think there are a couple of teams and then certainly Oklahoma with
Blake's decision to come back to school, he's one of the premiere players in
the league. So those three, at least in my mind, and then Kansas, sometimes
success breeds success. And Sherron Collins is a winner and Cole Aldrich got
some significant experience last year, although limited at times, that he's
ready to step into the role of the guys he was playing behind. And I know that
the group of guys that they brought in is a very talented young group.  
So I don't think there is an A team that you can slot in there, but I think
there will be four or five that can compete for it.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how difficult it was for Lucca Staiger to sit out
last season and what kind of threat he poses for you on the perimeter?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Well, it was extremely difficult. Part of it was we didn't
really see it coming. I had coached and recruited from that program in the
past and hadn't had any problems. So I didn't see any issues with Lucca's
situation. So because of that we appealed it all the way to the end which
really got to the beginning of the season.  
So there was always hope there that we could at least get the suspension down
to five games or eight games and hopefully have him have some sort of season.
And when it finally came down it was very difficult for him and his family.
But fortunately we're at a place where our fans care a great deal, not just
about our team, but about the individuals on our team.  
And they went above and beyond to try to make him feel at home at Iowa State,
and that is the sole reason he stayed. He could have packed his bags and gone
home and started a professional career back at home, but he decided that an
education was important to him and he was committed to Iowa State, and we're
excited to hopefully get him back on the floor.  
He's having his knee scoped tomorrow. We'll find out the extent of his knee
injury, but he certainly is going to be a big part of our team if he can play.  
  
Q. Given Kansas' title, the season Texas and some other teams had, big year
for the league, is there a trickle-down effect to all the programs in
recruiting after a season like that?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Without question. I think the success that our league had
nationally in the non-conference portion of our season last year is a big plus
when you're competing against the other BCS conferences and having success.  
And certainly the deep runs that our teams have made into the NCAA tournament
is a huge boost in recruiting, as well as the number of players that we have
drafted in the NBA draft. All those things, when you combine them, becomes a
very attractive -- the Big 12 becomes a very attractive place for kids to play
from all over the United States.  
And certainly our partnership with ESPN allows our recruits to watch games all
over the country. And that's a big plus and it certainly has affected us.
That's the positive. The negative it's a little harder for teams that are
trying to catch up and build a program to get there as quick as you'd like.  
  
Q. When you look at the Big 12 now and there's so many one-and-done guys,
play one year, it's hard to keep up with who's got what and everything. Does
it make preparation more difficult versus knowing a guy is going to be there
for four years and who's got what back with every team?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Certainly changes. And as I mentioned earlier, in the North
this year there's a lot of new faces throughout our half of the league.  
So from a personnel standpoint, it does change. The good news on a lot of
different fronts is that there weren't any coaching changes in the North. So
the system doesn't change.  
So at least there's some consistency as to how you prepare for that system and
style of play. And in my opinion there's too many coaching changes that happen
throughout our business each and every year, and it seems to have trickled
down to the lower levels of Division I and that's unfortunate.  
So it's good to see that in our league there was only one change last season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of the newcomers you've been impressed the most
with through the first few days of practice?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: Probably in the early going, Dominique Buckley and Wes
Eikmeier, probably in the guard court, have shown that they may be a little
bit more ready than I thought they would be. Dominique, his strength and
decisions with the basketball, I think he can come in and have an impact at
the point guard position immediately. We were a dismal shooting team last
year.  
And Wes Eikmeier hopefully can help us solve that problem. He's a prolific
scorer, shoots with great range and has probably shown me that he has a little
bit more off the dribble than I probably anticipated.  
He played at a small school in Nebraska. You don't know how that translates
from small high school basketball to the college level. But he's been able to
find his way into the paint and get his shot off in practice pretty
consistently.  
And then our three front-line freshmen have done a nice job in different ways,
but Justin Hamilton's probably separated himself somewhat the last five or six
practices. He was hurt most of the summer. So we didn't get to see a lot of
him in the summer and even our fall workouts. He's back on the floor and
hasn't missed a practice. 6'-11", almost 260 pounds gives us something we
really haven't had and I've been impressed with what he's done so far.  
  
Q. The fact that one or two players that you recruit can make such a big
difference in that year, do you think that's led to the unwillingness of
schools to wait like they might in football, and that that has led to quicker
turnover in basketball?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: You know, possibly. I mean, I think if you're going to build
a program with staying power, with a foundation, it takes time. There's no
quick fix to that.  
You have to get the right leadership in your program. And now we're moving in
a direction with our particular program where Bryan Petersen and Alex
Thompson, Sean Haluska have been in the program for a number of years and
they're teaching this group of freshmen how to lead.  
And that's a difficult thing, because if coaches have to do all the leadership
on their own, it's tough to build a team. And because we've had so much
turnover, we haven't been able to develop that leadership in our program. And
now I feel like we're moving in that direction.  
But without question there's a lot of different ways to build a program. And
my belief is you do it the majority of high school kids, you get people in
your program for four and five years, and my hope is that some day that the
program will be strong forever. And that's what we're trying to do. We're
trying to clean up some other problems in the program.  
There's a lot that goes into that that people don't understand. But without
question it's easier to fix a basketball program than it is a football
program. You can hide a deficiency on the basketball court. It's very
difficult to do on the football field.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, welcome. Coach Frank Martin from Kansas State. Your
opening comments.  
COACH MARTIN: Thank you. Obviously when Mike Beasley doesn't play for you you
end up being the first person up at 8:00 in the morning and everyone's half
asleep because no one's got anything to ask you anymore.  
So I don't have the opportunity to speak to most folks that cover us on a
regular basis. I just want to say thank you for last year.  
I was real pleased I thought as a whole the media was extremely fair in how
they treated us and just the way they covered us. And I was really
appreciative of that. But our team is fun. We've made unbelievable strides
from this time last year to now. Last year we had nine first-year players that
seven of which were freshmen, two of which enrolled on December 26. Six of
those freshmen played major minutes for us during the course of the year. And
that's never easy to do. This year we've got nine guys coming back.  
That core of guys that understands how we want to play, that understands how
we have to practice every day, that understands everything that a 17-year-old
does not understand before he goes through a process, that path is a lot
clearer now. It's a lot better understanding. Our approach is tremendously
better.  
Also, the other part of that equation, with me being a first-year coach it
wasn't so much what I could and couldn't do, but the other part of that
equation, which is the important part, is that I had never coached those nine
first-year players before and they have never played for me. So now we both
understand each other better.  
Players understand what I want, our staff understands what I want. And I
understand what they can do as players a heck of a lot better than I did at
this time last year. So it's a lot easier for us as a staff to put them in
situations that they can be a little bit more successful on the court.  
We're excited. We really like our team. It's a fun, fun group to coach. And I
can tell after six days of practice I'm even more excited about our team than
I was when we pulled them back in August.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how not having Michael, not having Walker helps or
hinders these young guys you just talked about in their development, in the
way they have to step their games up?  
COACH MARTIN: The part that everyone forgets is just because Mike and Bill had
such tremendous seasons for us last year, and the fact that they both got on
to become professionals, which I knew both of them would, we didn't go into
last year thinking that Mike and Bill were going to be in college for three or
four years.  
We prepared assuming that they were going to leave after the year. That's the
assumption we had from day one. So we prepared our team. We forced a lot of
guys to play a lot of minutes. That's why a guy like Darren Kent, a guy like
Jacob Pullen, a guy like Fred Brown, a guy like Ron Anderson, we went through
some bumps and bruises sometimes because we have to play just a lot of youth.  
There was a time we were playing in the NCAA game, we had five freshmen on the
court at the same time. That's not easy to do, especially that kind of a game.
Part of the reason that we are that much better of a basketball team right now
is because of that experience and the understanding that those kids have that
we worked pretty darn hard last year yet it wasn't quite good enough, so
they've understood that we've got to be a little bit better this year.  
  
Q. Your impressions of the Big 12 after going through the season, looking at
this year, and of course you sunk the Oklahoma teams last season, your first
year?  
COACH MARTIN: I've said it since I got here. After my first go-through of the
Big 12, you know, any time you have a conference where your feature coaches
and Bill Self and Rick Barnes, those guys have proven that they've won league
titles and been to NCAA tournaments coaching at all the other leagues. And
they're here and they've shown how good they are by the way of their programs
are performing, not over a year but over X number of years.  
And then you couple the fact of the incredible venues that we have in the Big
12. It's the most underappreciated basketball conference in the country. Top
to bottom, there's not the a better league in the country. And Kansas winning
it last year was something that this league deserved, because we had had more
Final Four teams over the last 10 years than any other conference in the
country. We had the best winning percentage against other BCS conference
schools than any other conference in the country.  
Yet my three -- two years and change here, for whatever reason, we're just
never recognized nationally as one of the premiere basketball conferences in
this country. And I think as time continues to go and this coming season now
you're starting to see a lot of coaches that are in their -- two years ago we
had a lot of turnaround in the league.  
Now you're starting to see a lot of coaches going into their third year.
Programs are starting to take their personality, their direction, the players
really understand what those coaches want and vice versa. And I think top to
bottom, you know, what makes it impossible to win in this league are the
venues, not only that are well-coached, good basketball teams, but the venues
that you've got to go play in. It makes it extremely difficult.  
  
Q. You talk about the improvement of those kids, those new kids, second-year
kids with Michael gone and Bill gone who are going to be the go-to guys and
can you talk about Jacob Pullen and what more you expect of him?  
COACH MARTIN: Even last year, the people don't know about Mike Beasley, two
years ago, when he was a junior in high school, he was an after-thought on the
offensive end. He shot the ball whenever he grabbed a rebound. That's how he
played.  
The other guys on his high school team at Oak Hill Academy, those are the guys
who shot every ball. Mike was never the go-to guy on offense. This is
something that's fairly evolving with Mike over the summer before his senior
year that kind of dealt with it as a senior in high school and finally
accepted it last year.  
But who is going to be the go-to guy? That's up to the players to determine
that. We as coaches have to make that read. It's what players are willing to
take on that responsibility. I know we've got guys that are willing and able,
but yet we've got to go out in the game and perform that way and we've got to
have players.  
It's a lot easier to do it in practice than it is in front of 13,000 people.
And we'll start finding that out when we start playing. But I've got all the
confidence in the world in our nucleus of guys that we're going to have more
than one guy be willing to step up to that challenge. And Jacob has been
great.  
What makes him great is how he accepts coaching. He wants to be a good player.
He doesn't walk around thinking he's a good player. He wants to be a good
player. He has a lot of Mike Beasley when it comes to that. He's like a
sponge. He wants you to coach and he wants you to push him and give him
direction. Then he goes out and works. Last year he was a pudgy 17-year-old
freshman. Now he's starting to become a Big 12 athlete.  
And that's a credit to him to how hard he's worked.  
  
Q. Do you like the way your schedule lays out a little bit? You obviously
have a little bit of testing games but seems like you're able to ease into the
schedule a little bit, do you like the way that sets up for you with the guys
who have to develop and accept different roles?  
COACH MARTIN: Yeah, I mean, it's not as hard a schedule as we had last year.
Yet, you know, I think it's three games in. Some guys know their schedules day
to day to day as far as game schedules go. I don't pay attention to that. I
look at it as a non-conference slate and conference and post-season. That's
the way I look at it and approach it.  
But it might look as an easy schedule to some folks on paper. Cleveland
State's picked to win their league. We have to play at Cleveland State. They
returned their whole team. Oakland is picked to win their league. They
returned their whole basketball team. We have to play at Cleveland State, at
Oregon, Kentucky on the neutral site, West Virginia or Iowa on a neutral site.
That's a hard, challenging schedule early in the year for not just a young
basketball team but any basketball team.  
It's one that our guys are excited about. We want to take on those challenges
and that's only going to make us a better basketball team, which you better
become one and you better be hardened if you have any chance whatsoever to
compete in the Big 12.  
  
Q. When you look at the coaches poll this year there's four different teams
getting first place votes. Is there a favorite in your mind, or is this maybe
as wide open as maybe it's been in the Big 12 in a while?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't know how you -- Jeff Capel has done an unbelievable job.
For him to take over Oklahoma under the circumstances which he did and for him
to have kept that thing together to have dealt with all the injuries he dealt
with last year and continue to find ways to win games, he's just, from afar,
done an unbelievable job. They've done an unbelievable job in recruiting and
attracting some big-time players there.  
So on paper they probably look like the favorite. With that said, it's hard to
vote against either Rick Barnes or Bill Self. They've proven over years and
years and years that their teams are always going to be right there at the
final, at the end of the line. So we'll see. I think the league's extremely
balanced this year. I think top to bottom it's going to be a hard-fought year
for all of us.  
  
Q. Last year expectations were incredibly high for such a young team. How
did that affect some of those young players and how do you assess expectations
this season?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't think that -- we never allowed the outside expectations
to really affect us. We go in there every day and we demand that our guys
compete at a certain level. And I think the only expectations that were, I
don't want to say difficult, but were something we have to deal with, was the
normal expectation of a high school senior making the transition to a college
freshman thinking that it's going to be a lot easier than what it really is.  
And that's the one hurdle from an expectation standpoint that we have to make
sure we clear. And we cleared that, and we got better for it and we've been
able to move forward after we as a whole understood that.  
As far as this year goes, what matters to us is our expectations, what we
speak about as a basketball team, the goals that we set. That's where we try
to keep our focus on and what we're going to shoot for. And when I got here a
little over two years ago, the first things that we talked about that team the
Cartier Martin, Lance Harris and that group of guys, was compete for the Big
12 championship. We're not going to change our sights. That's where it's going
to stay at and we're going to work and do everything in our power to try and
achieve that goal.  
  
Q. We're going to assume that any coach would love to have two NBA first-
rounders on his team. But might it be even enjoyable as a coaching experience
to work with five guys who have comparable talents and don't have that mega
star that you had last year?  
COACH MARTIN: Give me five of those guys. Give me five of those guys. It's a
heck of a lot easier to win with five NBA guys than five not-NBA guys. If you
don't have pros on your team, your chances of beating Texas and Kansas are out
the window. Two years ago we played about as hard as any team I've ever been a
part of could play. We had no chance to beat Kansas.  
And that's because we didn't have -- Bill does such a great job of just not
recruiting but coaching them to play as hard as they can, that if you don't
have guys that are talented as they are, you can match their intensity level,
you're not going to beat them.  
And it's just one of those things that I don't know from our team if we're
going to have any pros. Heck, everyone in this room, other than me, was saying
Bill Walker wasn't a pro and he's proven to be a pro.  
And it's just one of those things that I'd much rather coach pros. To win in
this league, you better have a couple of those guys. If you don't have them,
your chances of competing for the league championship probably aren't going to
be there.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Pat Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18927)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Pat Knight from Texas Tech University. Welcome,
and your comments.  
COACH KNIGHT: I really don't have any. I'm here for you guys. So let's just
open it up for -- I kind of do things a little different. What do you want to
know? That's what I'm here for. I'll answer anything you want to know.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Talk about your two junior college kids. If I'm correct, they both came
from winning situations and what kind of an impact do you see them having?  
COACH KNIGHT: They're both going to start for me. I can tell you that. We
don't recruit a junior college kid unless he can play for two years. He's
either a starter or first guy off the bench.  
And we needed some help, I thought, when I took over for my guard situation
and obviously size. And Nick Okorie comes from South Plains Junior College,
was an All-American in junior college, won the national championship. And
those are some things that are hard to come by.  
You want kids that come from winning programs, have been coached. His coach,
Steve Green, is actually a good friend of ours since we got to Lubbock. But he
knows how to coach. I don't have to do a lot of things with this kid to teach
him. He knows the fundamentals.  
He knows my personality. He can take an ass-chewing, which is important in the
way we go about things at Texas Tech. So there's not a lot of things I have to
teach this kid. He comes in knowing what to expect and can play right away.  
And then Darko came from Seward County, went to Hutch, the nationals, finals,
big kid. We like all our big kids to be able to shoot. He can shoot from the
3-point line, spreads out our motion offense. He brings a personality we
haven't had a long time from a really big guy. He's an energetic kid. People
really enjoy him when they come to practice.  
My assistants kind of wish I'd tell him to calm down a little bit, but I'm
letting some things go because I like that energy. I like that personality.  
He brings something to practice we haven't had. I mean, guys are actually kind
of scared when we do rebounding drills now and when we do our screening
drills. And so game time I will have to have a talk with him because he'll
foul out in the first two minutes.  
But I really like those two kids. And for us to be successful at Tech we have
to recruit junior college. I understand the situation we are at. We can get
very good high school kids, but I don't think we can get enough of them just
to recruit solely high school kids.  
Plus, I like the junior college kids. They come with a chip on their shoulder.
They haven't been coddled, haven't been playing summer ball. They kind of
appreciate what you have to offer to them. They haven't been flying on private
planes to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, to New York. They're not influenced by the
shoe companies, and so you'll always see me every year probably signing
anywhere from two to three junior college kids.  
  
Q. Expounding on your approach to recruiting, how different will your
program be under your guidance and your father's and the manner in which you
play everything just about?  
COACH KNIGHT: Recruiting-wise, I'm out all the time. I'm actually more out
more than I ever was as an assistant. And I think that's going to help the
program a lot. Not that my dad didn't go out. But it gets to a point where you
coach 40 years, you're burned out and you don't want to go out.  
So our recruiting has gotten better every year. That's been our goal. I don't
try to compare my recruiting to what my dad did. We did a good job at Tech. We
got better every year with the recruits we've got.  
I have to compare myself to the guys in this league. So I don't get caught up
in that. I think our recruiting will be good underneath me because I do go
out. They want to see the head coach, and so I'll be out like I was as
assistant. But it means a lot more now that I have the title.  
So I don't think we're going to miss a beat at all in recruiting. I just
expect our recruiting to get better every year like it has been since we got
to Texas Tech. And just from the standpoint of how things will be different, I
don't know. I really don't think about that. I have to have a focus of winning
games. That's my concern.  
I actually -- when we met before practice I promised my team I would not make
a decision based -- if my dad would do it or I need to do this because he
wouldn't do it.  
That's going to get me in trouble. Every decision I make has to be made is
this going to help my team win. My dad was good with me before I took over
these last couple of years. I studied a lot of guys. Why were guys successful
taking over for guys and why were guys not.  
And I came up, I think there's two type of guys that were unsuccessful. One is
the guy that tries to just be just like the guy he took over for. And then the
second is the guy that tries to do everything different and try to forget
about the guy he took over for. So I think you have to have a fine line.  
You have to respect why you got there. I know why I'm here, because my dad.
But then, again, I can't be him because I'm not him so there will be things I
do different. So I have to have a fine line to be successful.  
I think there will be things that I do you'll be like, hey, that reminds me of
your dad: greatest compliment I can get. But, naturally, there will be things
he would never do that, which is fine too, but I have to ride a fine line. I
can't get caught up on either or because that's going to sidetrack me and I
won't be doing these press conferences anymore, I'll be not in coaching very
long.  
  
Q. Looking at the Big 12 South, seems to be deep and wide open this season.
Can you talk about the challenges playing in such a tough division conference
and what it would take to emerge from that victorious?  
COACH KNIGHT: Gotta win on the road. First, you've got to protect your home
field, per se. You've got to win your home games, but you've got to find a way
to win on the road. We didn't win on the road at all last year. We only one
once up in Colorado. And we've got to find a way to win on the road.  
We're trying different things. We scrimmage in our practice gym where the
acoustics aren't very good trying to make them uncomfortable. We're going to
go play at SMU in a closed scrimmage.  
But we've got to do better on the road. And the teams that have done well, not
just in the South side, even the North side, they win some big games on the
road. And for us to make a break-through this year we've got to win on the
road.  
Because everyone plays well at home. It's not a given but you're more
comfortable at home. We're trying to figure out a way how can we play better
on the road. And so to me that's the key. Whoever wins on the road is going to
do the best.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: At this time we'd like to welcome Travis Ford from Oklahoma
State. Welcome. If you'd like to make an opening statement and then we'll take
questions from the floor.  
COACH FORD: Excited to be here. Excited to be part of the Big 12 and anxious
to get started. We've been going about five days and guys are working hard.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. For a long time people have said that the Big 12 needed to have a
national championship won. You've been in other leagues that have had national
championships. Can you just talk about what benefits the Big 12 could see from
the fact that Kansas won a championship last year?  
COACH FORD: I don't know if there's any question it's a huge benefit. That's
something that even myself being new to the Big 12, that's something we have
sold in recruiting.  
When we go into recruits' homes, we sell the Big 12 as an elite basketball
conference. We obviously get into the national championship that Kansas won
and the success that the league has had lately. So there's no question that it
just validates the strength of this league.  
And we've definitely probably talked about as much about Kansas as ourselves a
lot of times in our recruiting. But no question, it helps the whole league.  
  
Q. Talk about, again, taking over the legacy of the Sutton family, what
that's meant to you, what you'll take into the program and a dramatically
different looking style of play for OSU?  
COACH FORD: No question it means a lot to me. I've said it on several
occasions that I probably would never have wanted to come to Oklahoma State if
it hadn't been for what Coach Iba and Coach Sutton have done for Oklahoma
State basketball. They've made it what it is today. They've built an
incredible tradition at Oklahoma State. The record speaks for itself.  
What I'm trying to do is try to build on that tradition. But Sean has been
great to me and has really helped me through the process of taking over this
program and Coach Sutton is somebody who I knew when I was playing high school
basketball in Kentucky when he was coaching at Kentucky. Got the to know him a
little bit through there.  
But it means a lot because Oklahoma State I believe is one of the premiere
basketball programs in the country, and they are a big reason for that and a
big part of that.  
  
Q. How about the style of coaching?  
COACH FORD: It is different. People like to talk about it a lot when I got the
job, how different the style of basketball is going to be. But I've really
realized it and I think the players have really realized it the last five days
how different it is.  
It's funny, any time you take over a job when you take over and you come in,
you work with the players the first couple of days, you can see how they were
taught one thing and you might believe another thing and not necessarily right
or wrong, but they've formed so many different habits, they've got a great,
obviously, background and fundamentals. They're very good at it. Their
approach is just a little bit different.  
But one thing I've seen that these guys really understand how to practice, how
hard you have to practice. But it really sets in once you get on the court
with these guys and you're not talking about it anymore, it's actually putting
into play how different this style of basketball really is.  
  
Q. When you look at your guys that you've got and plus the guys you're
bringing in, how long do you think it's going to take to change any kind of
mentality, just the difference of style, is that something that's going to
happen in this season, mid-season, do you know?  
COACH FORD: You know, we're hoping that hopefully by conference play we're
starting to understand it better. Right now we're really struggling with it.
There's no question that our guys, not that they can't do it, it's just a
different concept. You run into different areas. So, again, we're five days
in, and we're really far behind.  
We're still with the very basic of trying to introduce our offense and
defenses and things like that. We're a pretty thin basketball team, very thin
basketball team right now. We only have 10 scholarship players that are even
practicing right now.  
So things are going very, very slow. As the season continues, as you
mentioned, as we recruit players that fit this system a little bit, they'll
catch on.  
But their attitudes have been absolutely tremendous. This all started back in
the summertime when we asked our players that they're going to have to be
dedicated and be in the best shape of their life in order to play our style of
basketball. They bought into that, on their own voluntarily they came in,
worked with our strength and conditioning coach and did conditioning this
summer.  
Once school started, we started preseason conditioning program, I'll be
honest, I've made it harder than I've ever made it just to set an example of
what we're going to do. And these guys never questioned. They never asked why.
They did it.  
And they are in great shape. You'll see Byron Eaton today. Byron reported June
1st, first day of summer school, he reported June 1st at 246 pounds. As of
yesterday he was 210 pounds. These players have made the effort physically to
get in shape to play our style. Now they've just got to understand the Xs and
Os of it. That's going to take time.  
I hope they fully understand by conference play, that may be a little soon,
but the time we get to our first real game, we probably won't have 50 percent
of the things we need to have in. That's how slow it seems like it's going
right now.  
  
Q. With the guards being what you have most of, and you're most experienced
there, would you be comfortable using, say, four guards and one big guy, or
you want to have two big guys for the sake of court balance or have you
thought that far ahead?  
COACH FORD: Oh, we've talked about it every day after practice as a staff. We
talk about lineups, because we're trying to figure out how to get our best
players on the court. And right now it probably will be a four-guard lineup a
lot of times.  
It would easily see Byron Eaton, Terrel, James Anderson, Obi, Thomas, throw
Marshall in there as well. I'll tell you right now Nick Sidorakis is playing
great and we've talked about figuring out how to play five of them at times.
We really have. The strength of our team, there's no question, is our guard
play. And there's been surprises I think with Nick Sidorakis, who I think is
playing great basketball right now, little Keiton Page is coming along. I
don't know how well he'll go.  
We've been playing a lot of different lineups. Just yesterday in practice we
experimented a lot with a lot of different lineups, having guys play positions
that they haven't played before. It might be Terrel Harris at a No. 4 spot.
For us it's not that big a deal really.  
We'll have to figure out how to rebound out of those lineups and defend bigger
people out of those lineups, and we'll come up with some different ways to
camouflage it.  
But right now what I'm trying to do, I keep telling my coaches I need to
figure out how to get my best players on the floor. And we're going to try to
figure out how to get nine good players to put on the court. Whoever they are,
we're not really concerned about it right now until we go out and recruit and
get the players we need, we're just going to figure out the best nine, figure
out how to play them and in that case scenario, last four days we think it's
going to be a lot of 3s taken, that's for sure, a lot.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Terrel Harris and what, getting him back acclimated
back to basketball after being reinstated?  
COACH FORD: Terrel has probably been our most consistent player to this date.
He's been playing terrific basketball. He was the best at preseason
conditioning, won every single drill we did. It wasn't even close.  
He seems to be very focused and very motivated. From what I understand, more
than he ever has in his career. I think he's very appreciative of kind of this
second chance that he received and he's trying to make the most of it.  
We just hope he continues with the progress he's got right now. But as far as
the leadership ability and as far as basketball play, Terrel, with Byron a
very close second, have been our two best. Obviously your two seniors. So
that's what you want. But Terrel is playing great basketball right now.  
His head seems to be in the right place. Again, he seems to be very, very
focused on what he needs to do to be successful. So we hope he continues with
that progress.  
  
Q. You mentioned Byron's weight. What do you want his target weight to be?  
COACH FORD: About 210. He's where it's at. For me, his weight is where it
needs to be. He could even probably be 215, because Byron is big anyway.  
Now it shifts more to conditioning. We had to get his weight down for him to
be able to be in great condition. Now, if he can be at 215 and play for 35, 38
minutes, which we're going to need him to do then he can play at 215. But 210
right now seems to be a pretty good weight for him. He's spent so much time
trying to lose the weight through us putting him on a nutrition plan, putting
him on a very specialized workout plan that you can probably talk to him that
he probably didn't like that motivated him to lose some weight.  
Now he's shifting more towards getting his body in great condition. His cardio
part of his workout. So now we just need to get him to play as hard as he can
for a long extended amount of time. And that's one thing I've seen with Byron
in practice, Byron likes to pick and choose at times when he plays hard.  
I don't know if it necessarily has anything to do with shape right now more
than it has to do with the mentality he's developed in the past as far as his
weight, his not being in great shape so he would play hard for maybe four or
five minutes then choose to rest, because he wasn't in great shape.  
Now we've got to get him out of those habits and get him to understand he can
only play one way and that's hard all the time. There cannot be any rest. Only
during timeouts.  
And that's a process for him. And that's something I'm staying on top of him
every day in practice, the moment I see him not pushing the ball he wants to
take one or two steps as far as walking and then push it, that's not how we
play.  
It's from the moment he touches the ball, it's at level five. And he likes to
play at level three sometimes.  
  
Q. Recruiting, of course, is always full time. Your impressions of a new era
recruiting people, Oklahoma high school basketball talent?  
COACH FORD: Obviously, this senior class is very strong. I think like many
states it runs in cycles from coming from Kentucky and born and raised in
Kentucky and seeing -- knowing that background very well, very similar to
Kentucky, that it runs in cycles.  
What I've seen -- I've gone and spoke at many coaching clinics at Oklahoma and
had a lot of coaches come to my practices already. We've got a coaching clinic
coming up this weekend already have 200 high school coaches signed up for it,
already presigned.  
What I've really noticed is that the high school coaches are very, very good,
they're very involved with their players and they want to get better and
they're anxious to learn. And I think that has a lot to do with a lot of times
the talent level and how much talent is in the state is how well they're
coached.  
So I've been very impressed with the coaches in this state. But you look at
this year, it's probably the best senior class Oklahoma's had in probably a
while. But the junior class and the sophomore classes, there's some players,
probably not quite as strong as the senior class, though.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Scott Drew from Baylor University.
Welcome, and your opening comments.  
COACH DREW: Media Days is always an exciting one for me. Last year my wife
gave birth to a baby boy named Peyton, and this year it's my birthday.  
So I do know one thing, someone commented and said "you have a voice." And the
good thing when you have five seniors and great leadership, you don't have to
talk as much in practice and they do a great job setting the tone and getting
across what needs to be passed on to our younger players.  
So without further ado, any questions?  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Judging by the preseason poll, the coaches seem to project this as a
pretty wide-open race. Obviously, being picked third in the conference, that's
good for Baylor. Is this wide-open race good for the league overall?  
COACH DREW: I think definitely fans are going to really enjoy this season. The
a number of teams can win at any given time. The last few years we've always
had one or two teams that seemed like they were head and shoulders above
everybody else. This year it's not that way.  
And, again, I think it's going to make for a great season and fans are really
going to enjoy it.  
  
Q. Scott, given the number of players that you've got returning the
flirtation that you had playing at a different level last year, is this team
ready to take a significant step now?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think last year we achieved -- I mean, only the fourth
20-win season in 102 years, the second time in the NCAA tournament in 58
years, first time ever ranked in back-to-back weeks in the top 25. So we took
a major step forward last year.  
I think the big thing is goals changed after went to the NCAA tournament. Once
we left there, the players realized that we had a great year. But now our goal
isn't to make the NCAA tournament but it's to have an opportunity to get back
there and win some games.  
So I think our seniors, their sights are a little higher this year.  
  
Q. Any worry or concern at all about your team performing under these new
expectations for this season?  
COACH DREW: Coaches always find things to worry about. So you don't have to
worry about that. No pun intended.  
But as far as expectations, I think that's a good sign. Means your program is
heading in the right direction. At the same time, at the beginning of the year
coaches always -- there's two things we're always concerned about: the first
one are injuries and the second one is the team chemistry. You never really
know how those are going to pan out until the season is over. But if we can
stay injury free and the chemistry can be good, then definitely we feel it can
be a very special year for us.  
  
Q. Kind of a variation on the same theme. You guys were such a great story.
How much has that changed your program, do you think, in terms of just the
national perception, the local perception and the Big 12 in terms of maybe
getting you in some doors that you weren't able to get into before?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think recruiting-wise it's made things a lot easier when
we call and talk to recruits. I think they're a lot more interested. I think
as far as our scheduling has become easier as far as getting games on TV and
national TV.  
And then I think the big thing, though, is with our players, their mind-set
has changed from the standpoint that we're ready to take another step. And,
again, I think every team you can have goals, but I think once you have been
to a certain step and a certain place, just like raising kids, once they've
crawled, they're ready to walk; once they've walked, they're ready to run.  
So I think we're on that step now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about five years ago you were playing walk-ons, starting
them, and how your program has evolved since then?  
COACH DREW: Well, practice is a little more competitive. And I do know at
times our staff will joke about our first couple of days at Baylor when our
first recruiting trips were around campus trying to find anyone over 6'-5" who
could play on our team.  
Now we go to practice and we have a lot of talented players, a lot of
excitement. I think most people around campus know who the basketball players
are now. Where before they were students we were just grabbing out to be part
of the team.  
So very pleased with how far we've progressed. I think, again, the big thing
is coaches realize we're only as good as our players and we've been very
fortunate to bring in some very talented players that are good people and have
represented the program in the right way.  
So as we know, the jockey never carries the horse across the finish line.  
  
Q. You relied a lot on the 3-point shot last year. Moving it back a little
bit, does that affect your team at all? And was that a good rule change for
the game in general?  
COACH DREW: At the time I felt it was a good rule change. We'll see how it
affects our team this year and how it affects college basketball.  
I know with our team I don't think that line is going to have much effect. In
fact, a couple of our players I wish would just look where it's at and try to
get near it instead of shooting so far out.  
But in our situation this year, that line shouldn't have much effect. I think
different teams, different players, a lot of coaches, we have front-line
players that can flirt with the old college 3 but now we might not allow them
to shoot that because that extra foot.  
  
Q. Kansas winning the national championship, what does that do for the
conference and the perception of the conference as a basketball power?
Obviously you did an awful lot of things but you never had the national
champion before?  
COACH DREW: I think that was the icing on the cake from the standpoint in the
last seven years we've had more Final Four teams than any other conference,
but until you win it all, a lot of people can always bring up the point, well,
you've never won it all.  
So I think by Kansas doing that, definitely has helped with our conference and
passing on just the excellent play and as far as the number of NBA players and
just the great accomplishments we've been able to have. I mean, last year, you
look at it, and the best winning percentage in the NCAA tournament. We had
nine players drafted from the Big 12. So just a lot of positives.  
  
Q. In today's college game with so many guys jumping in the NBA, it's sort
of unusual to have the number of seniors that you guys have this year. How
much of a benefit is that and how different is that from previous years?  
COACH DREW: For us, it's something new from the standpoint most of these guys
when we started to build our program all played major minutes as freshmen and
as sophomores, juniors, and now they'll be seniors. But I think that's what's
helped with the parity in college basketball, so -- because teams that are
junior and senior laden and have that experience tend to fare better than
maybe some teams that have one- or two-and-done players where it takes time to
build that chemistry.  
At the same time, I don't think any of us college coaches that will turn down
one-and-done players, but it does help with the parity of the game.  
  
Q. Everybody knows about your strength in the back court. As far as front
line goes this year, you can rely on some new guys there or...  
COACH DREW: One thing we did was improve the athleticism in our front line.
Quincy Acy, 6'-8", from Mesquite, Horn High School, top five player in the
state of Texas, is somebody very athletic and plays very hard around the
basket and I think will excite a lot of our fans with his spectacular play
down low as far as dunking. Now we have someone besides Kevin Rogers for the
highlight film with those dunks. But Quincy will help our team.  
And Anthony Jones at 6'-10", versatile, can handle the ball and shoot it long.
Another good athlete, so that helps with the front line. And then we a
transfer from Michigan, Ekpe Udoh, 6'10". He's somebody that won't play this
year, but every day he will make our team better, because he Chris Webber's
block shot record as a sophomore at Michigan and a great defender and somebody
that challenges our front line every day.  
  
Q. What type of improvement do you think we'll see from Tweety and Dunn this
year?  
COACH DREW: I think both of them have improved. Tweety has gotten faster,
quicker, lost a little more of the body fat that he came in with. He's really
worked hard in the off-season.  
So I expect him to take another step forward. LaceDarius will move better than
he did last year. He had a meniscus injury most of the season last season he
played with. And he's moving much better now that that's fixed and he still
shoots it from anywhere at any time. But I was going to say now he can play a
little better defense.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Jeff Capel is here from Oklahoma. Opening comments.  
COACH CAPEL: Glad to be here in Oklahoma City. Really excited to have the Big
12 tournament back here. We thought it was a tremendous success overall a
couple of years ago. I thought the fans here did a great job of coming out and
supporting the tournament, and we're just really excited to have it back. I'm
excited to be able to be in practice mode right now. We've had five really
good days of practice.  
I really like our team. I like the guys we have returning and the guys we've
added. It's going to be important for us to continue to work hard every day
and stay together. Guys focusing on being great teammates. And if we do that,
I like our chances of becoming a really good basketball team.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Talk about how far the regard for your program has come in so short a
period of time and what are the factors that have to fall into place for you
to achieve what folks expect this season?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, I was asked the question earlier this morning: Did you see
this maybe happening when you first got here, in two years being at this
point? And I said no. I'm not one of these guys that looks too far ahead. I
try to focus on the moment.  
Certainly we wanted to be at a point where we felt like we had a chance to
compete for conference championship. I probably started thinking that when we
got Blake, when he committed and we signed him, that there's a real
possibility that that could happen.  
The big thing, obviously, was when he decided to come back for a sophomore
year. Then we started thinking about it even more. What has to happen for us
first and foremost we have to stay healthy, that's the big thing. We have to
stay healthy. And then we have to stay together. And we have to earn the right
to be a really good basketball team.  
And you do that by how well you practice, by how well you take care of
yourself, both on and off the floor. And we have to stay together. And we have
to defend at a high level, rebound at a high level, and we have to be able to
score.  
If we do that, then, like I said, I like our chances of being right there with
anyone.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the depth of the Big 12 conference in general
this season and then the difficulties of playing the Big 12 South, just such a
loaded division?  
COACH CAPEL: I think this year is up for grabs probably more than any year
I've been here. The past two years you looked at Kansas and Texas being the
two schools that were probably a little bit better, more talented than
everyone. And I think this year you look at those two teams again but Baylor I
think is talented as anyone. I think we're a pretty talented basketball team.
A&M has some guys back. Missouri has some guys back. Oklahoma State,
especially in the back court, are very talented.  
And so I think it is up in the air for everyone. And everyone has a chance.
And I think that's what makes this year really, really exciting for everyone.  
  
Q. Talk about Willie Warren, would you. He's probably one of the most high-
profile kids coming into the league, how his play will affect your
expectations.  
COACH CAPEL: Willie is a really talented young man. Most people know about his
ability to score the basketball. And he's certainly shown in five practices in
the workouts that we've done that he can really score. And he can do it in
different ways.  
The thing that we've tried to get him to understand and focus on is to become
a really good defender. I think he has the ability to do that, because of his
size, his strength and athleticism. And that's probably the thing I've been
most pleased with.  
In the six practices that we've had, in five of them he's been at a really,
really high level on both sides of the ball. And that's something that's
really difficult for freshmen, also a guy that's scored his whole life to
understand how important it is to defend.  
And so I think he's been willing to do that and willing to listen. I think it
really helps that he has a guy like Blake Griffin as a teammate that's kind of
been through some of the things he's been through. To have a guy like Tony
Crocker, who started and played a lot as a freshman, to have a guy like Austin
Johnson who started some and played a lot as a freshman to kind of help him
with this experience.  
Also, I think it helps -- and this is where it's different from Blake -- where
he's not looked at, Willie is not looked at to be the guy. When Blake came
here as a freshman, he was kind of anointed by everyone as the guy.  
We need Willie to come in and be a big part, but we don't necessarily need him
to be the guy. And I think that's going to help him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the big guy, Blake's maturity, how his game has
matured? Because he's added a bit of length to his shot. He can maybe get a
little further from the basket now.  
COACH CAPEL: I think he's matured as a person, which has helped him as a
player. The experiences that he went through last year, you know, both on and
off the floor help. You're talking about a kid whose life changed probably in
late December, early January, to where he was mentioned like the rest of
those, like a Rose and like a Beasley. When he came in, not many people
nationally thought of him that way. We certainly did.  
But I think he thought of himself as being as good as those guys. But it was
really after that West Virginia game where people started to take notice.  
And so the young man's life changed completely. And all of a sudden he was
forced to make a decision that could impact the rest of his life. And I think
he made the right decision in coming back, because I think the experience that
he'll go through this year is going to help him so much for the rest of his
life.  
Obviously his game has matured. He's in better shape. He knows how to be more
prepared for a season. I think he's grown a little bit, if that's possible.
But I think because he's in better shape, I think he's a little bit more
explosive, and I think he's a better basketball player.  
His IQ has gone up. He's shooting the ball a lot better now. And he's just
more mature. Little things don't bother him as much as they did maybe early in
the season last year.  
And hopefully with all of that I definitely think it's going to make our team
a lot better.  
  
Q. Talk about your point guard play, what you think that will look like as
the season develops.  
COACH CAPEL: Well, for us, last year, when Austin Johnson played well, we won.
And he's going to be a big key this year. Obviously, you can have Willie
Warren there at the point sometimes for us. And then Omar Leary is the guy in
our program that's probably the only true point guard. Will probably have more
of a lead guard the majority of the time out there.  
Omar has played really well in the practice and the workouts. We've been
really pleased with his progress going into his second year.  
But as anyone knows, it's the most important position on the floor. And we
feel like we have three guys that are capable of doing that for us at a very,
very high level.  
  
Q. How surprised were you that Blake decided to come back? Were there any
tense moments, and in retrospect, is it a more impressive decision given how
many kids decided to leave?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't know if I was surprised. He's a really unique kid. When
people ask -- I mean, he's really unique. And certainly there was concern.
There was great concern. Right after we lost to Louisville last year, when we
got back to Norman that night, I remember sending Blake a text and I said to
him, look, we need to get together and talk.  
There are a lot of rumors flying around out there about both of us. And I said
let's take a couple of days and let's just kind of let this die down a little
bit, the season, the sting of how we just lost and let's get together.  
We got together. The first thing I said, I'm going to support you in whatever
you want, I want you to do what you want to do. If you want to turn pro, let's
turn pro. Let's go. I assured him at that moment that I wasn't going anywhere.
But I didn't want him to base his decision on that. I wanted that decision to
be on what he thought was best for him.  
And after about two weeks, it was actually right after I got back from the
Final Four is when he told me that he was going to stay.  
And so I don't know if I was that surprised by it. Like I said, because he's a
unique young man. And I think because of that that's why -- he's a kid that
doesn't follow the norm. He doesn't follow kind of what everyone else is
doing. He makes decisions based on what he thinks are best for him.  
I think that's one of the reasons why he chose the University of Oklahoma over
some of the other places that were recruiting him, especially at the time in
which he chose.  
When he made his decision to come to us in May, he committed in May, we still
hadn't gone in front of the infractions committee, so you didn't know what was
going to happen.  
But he made the decision based on what he felt was best for him. Like I said,
it's one of the things that makes him really, really unique.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Jeff Bzdelik from Colorado. Opening comments
and then we'll take questions.  
COACH BZDELIK: With only one senior and one junior on our basketball team,
obviously we're very inexperienced and extremely young. That makes for a very
challenging season ahead of us, but there's a very bright light at the end of
the tunnel, because it bodes well for our future.  
We haven't lost vision of how we want our basketball team to be in a few
years, and we're headed in that direction. So I feel good about that. Any
questions?  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. What's the biggest challenges to teach young guys your system?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, just how to read defenses, and you can drill that, but
once the defense is out there, you have to execute under duress. And that's
the biggest challenge.  
But the young players that we brought in have a high basketball IQ and a high
skill level and they've picked it up extremely well.  
  
Q. Jermyl is in a unique position as the only senior in the program. What's
your vision for his role this year?  
COACH BZDELIK: Just his energy, intelligence. He's a very intelligent player.
He understands the offense. He rebounds well, which was a big short-coming of
ours last year. He defends well. He can defend a variety of players out on the
court because of his athleticism. He's an excellent offensive rebounder and
provides great leadership with his example, with the way he prepares himself
and the way he practices.  
  
Q. Based on the preseason poll, looks like the coaches kind of predict this
to be a pretty wide-open race in the conference. Is that the way you see it?  
COACH BZDELIK: Exactly. This league -- I was just saying to someone prior to
coming in here, I've been coaching 32 years. I spent six years in the Big Ten
back when, gee whiz, they had Lute Olson, Coach Knight, Judd Heathcote, Eldon
Miller, Jim Dutcher. It was a great, great league. And I spent 17-plus years
in the NBA. And I find the Big 12 to be the most competitive situation I've
ever been in in basketball.  
Obviously you had the different levels, but take those levels aside, the Big
12 is just an awesome, awesome league. That's why, when I had an opportunity
to partake in it, I said I'd like to do that, because it offers a challenge
that to me is unlike any other in basketball.  
So it's just a great league with great coaches, great programs, great
traditions that you have to strap it on and be ready to play every single time
you throw it up, regardless of what others might think of your team.  
  
Q. In light of what you just said about the competitiveness of the league,
what did Kansas's win of championship do for the league's reputation and
everybody else? It's the old rising tide raises all ships type of thing?  
COACH BZDELIK: It just gave great testimony to the power of the league and
obviously helped Colorado, for example. I'm just going to talk about our
school. It's helped us in recruiting.  
We had a very good recruiting class last year, and we feel good about the
prospects for another excellent recruiting class and why: We can offer a young
student athlete a chance to play in what we think is the best league in the
nation, and as we recruit internationally, in the world.  
There's tangible evidence as to why. Well, our national champ is from this
league. And there's many other reasons why this league is so good
statistically it's been put out by the Big 12 office. And, again, it helps us
so much in recruiting and interest in our league.  
  
Q. You talked about the challenges of implementing your system with new
young players. Where do they stand as far as are they on schedule for learning
that or do you have to pick it up a little bit?  
COACH BZDELIK: We are so much further ahead than we were last year. The reason
being is we have some players who have been through it that can help the
learning curve of the younger players coming in.  
But most importantly the skill level. People will talk about the fact we lose
Richard Roby and Marcus Hall, two of our top scorers. Well, we're scoring the
ball much better right now, because we can shoot the ball at every position.
And that really makes the offense go. And we have a willingness to pass the
basketball and the skill to shoot it, the skill to drive it from all
positions.  
And so I think that really kind of ties up all the loose ends. Last year we
really only had two and a half shooters out there. This year we do a drill
where we have six players, three balls and five minutes see how many 3s they
can make. We have six players that when they do it together they shoot
anywhere -- they make about 130 3s from the new line in five minutes, and
these are from all positions. We couldn't do that last year.  
So we've improved our ability to shoot the ball and that's really going to
help us.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the new line? Will it make a big difference in the game
or are guys more comfortable shooting from 20 feet as they were from 19?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, shooters who can shoot will shoot and make them. Those
who can't won't regardless of where the line is.  
Our philosophy is we had the vision of where we want to be and hopefully it's
going to happen sooner or later, but our vision is to have a team that can
shoot the ball at all positions from beyond that arc and shoot it well. And
that provides good spacing and the ability to post up big guards or take
people in a post for a mismatch or be able to drive the basketball and
defenses have to extend.  
So from our standpoint I like the line being back, and it hasn't changed our
recruiting philosophy. We want to be able to shoot the ball at all positions
from beyond that arc and shoot it well.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Rick Barnes from the University of
Texas. Welcome, and your opening comments.  
COACH BARNES: I'm ready for questions.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Rick, just take a broad look at the league this year, something of a
transitional year from probably the league's best year to in between another
year when a lot of big-time recruits are coming in. What do you see this
upcoming season?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think every year, when you go into it, right now we all
probably really don't know what to expect I think as we start putting our
teams together.  
But as I look at the league, I just know -- obviously as I look at the South
division, I look at Oklahoma and certainly a team that I think is going to --
got better throughout the year, had a good year last year.  
And you go down from there, Oklahoma State, I think they're going to be a
better team with what they have returning. A&M has been very, very good. And
so you go through the whole league, and then I think Kansas, Kansas won't be
short of players and talent.  
But I think our league will continue to get better as we play games this year.
I do think that. I think as we -- conference play is always tough. Conference
play is tough with every league, but I do think you'll see teams within our
league improve as the season goes along.  
  
Q. Could you go through kind of the first week of practice, what you've
noticed and what stands out to you?  
COACH BARNES: Well, there's a lot, really. I think there's been some really
good things. In fact, this team that we have is a team that, one, I think they
like each other, respect each other. The chemistry's been really good.  
The work ethic has been really, really good. Obviously you take two players in
Connor Atchley and A.J. Abrams, who have been around seems like forever now,
with the fact that we've lost guys early to the draft, these guys have been
with us a long time now. And those guys are playing like you would expect
fourth- and fifth-year players to play.  
And there's not one guy on our team that hasn't improved from last year. I
think that the last two days has been very physical. We've really tried to
stress our defense and our rebounding and worked really hard the last couple
of days oppose defense. So it has been very, very physical.  
But really been happy with two guys I think that have really jumped out and
probably -- I'm not sure I'd say surprised, one of them was probably surprise
is Varez Ward, the freshman that came in. He's well beyond -- physically might
be the most impressive player as a freshman physically that we've had in a
long time, just the fact of his stamina and he's got great instincts. You
wouldn't know he was a freshman with the way he's able to fight through the
fatigue of practice and the physicality of it.  
And Dogus Balbay, our point guard from Turkey, the last couple days has really
done a nice job. And for the first time I've put him with I guess you would
say the first group, and he was pretty impressive.  
So I feel, again, after just a couple of days, I think as a staff we feel that
our guard play is going to be solid. Our perimeter play will be solid, and
then I do think our inside game will continue to get better and better each
day, because we've got guys that are working at it.  
But overall, after, what, five or six practices, we're pretty pleased with
where we are.  
  
Q. For a long time people said the Big 12 needed someone to win a national
championship. Kansas did it last year. What was the impact of that how can
that help not just Kansas but the league?  
COACH BARNES: We've had so much success as a league basketball-wise, that's
just a question that had to be answered and Kansas did answer it. So we'll
give everybody a chance to come up with another question to ask now. What do
we need to do now?  
And I think that any time that -- the Big 12, I mean, you think about it.
We've got the defending national champion in our league now. We've got a lot
of football teams ranked up there in the top 10. The Big 12 can arguably talk
about being the best conference of all.  
In a short time it's certainly had great success when you talk in a lot of
areas whether it's football, basketball, swimming, track and field. If people
wanted to start comparing numbers over the last 10, 12 years, we would be
right there with all of them. And the fact that Kansas finally did win the
national championship in basketball, I don't know if it's going to change the
way people view our league. I don't know if that will happen.  
Our league has gotten better. Over the last -- the time I've been in it, I've
watched every facet of our league get better from the quality of players we
bring in, the officiating, you go all the way down. Our league, we can hold
our own with anybody.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the new 3-point line, any factor in the game at all or
are shooters going to keep taking the open shot regardless of where they
are?  
COACH BARNES: I really thought as we began planning for this year that the
line would be a factor, moving it back a little bit. And my original thoughts
were that we would probably play a little more zone. But after being in
practice and really being there with it, I'm not sure if it's going to be that
big a factor. I'm just not sure.  
I know it hasn't affected our guys that really use it in terms of A.J. Abrams,
Connor Archley, Damion James, any of them. I don't know. I just don't really
know the answer. I thought it would. But, again, after being in practice with
it, I'm not sure it will be that big a difference.  
  
Q. What do you think will happen with the balance of power in the conference
with so many players leaving early in the North?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know. We've lost guys in the past, and really that's
what makes the college game what it is. When guys leave, it opens the stage,
the platform for someone else. And our league, there will be some stars coming
in to it this year, guys we might not know about. It's going to be exciting.
It is every year.  
But, again, I think that we all -- again, speaking from when we've lost
players, you just take what you have and you really recreate a different team
with what you have. And I think Bill's lost some guys obviously but he's got
some good ones there, some good ones coming in. It's a matter of taking this
group you have and trying to make it the best it can be.  
But this year there will be some guys that maybe we think and we know about
but because they now have the spotlight on them, they'll step up and become
the kind of people that players, stars, if you want to use that word -- that
they'll get some recognition that maybe they haven't gotten in the past.  
  
Q. If you look back to the new 3-point line, do you think it can actually
help percentages by deterring the posers, that only having the good shooters
take 3s now?  
COACH BARNES: So far up to this point in practice, I mean, Matt Hill is a guy
that we're going to let shoot 3s and making some 3s in practice, but he's the
only guy on my team that I've had to say to him you're not going to shoot the
ball with your heels on that line. There's an area there that's a low
percentage area.  
And he hasn't played in a while, but he's the only guy that's had a tough time
-- if it is a tough time, I guess exactly knowing where he is there at that
point in time.  
But, again, I don't know. We just haven't approached it any different. We're
telling guys to shoot it. And we've always had an NBA line down on our court,
our practice court. We practiced from there. We've always done that using the
NBA line as just as a practice tool.  
But really it hasn't -- other than Matt stepping on the line a couple times,
either with his toes or his heels, he's the only guy that I've had to say one
word to about the 3-point line up to this point.  
  
Q. How has your team adjusted to having a new point guard and also not
having a player like D.J. on the court?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think our program is at the point where, because we have
lost guys, I think their attitude is, okay, it's just the way it is and we're
going to take what we have. And we've used A.J. at the point a lot, and when
we recruited A.J. he was a point guard coming in. And he's done a really nice
job. A.J. can really pass the ball. He's got great vision.  
I've said before he's one of the smartest players, if not the smartest player,
we've had at Texas in terms of his basketball IQ and the things that he sees
out there.  
Justin Mason has worked at the point, will bring a different style there with
the way he would play it. Dogus is as fast as any player we've had at Texas
since T.J. Ford. When he comes in a game it is a high -- it's really fast.  
And so all three guys bring a little different I guess style, pace to that
position. But in terms of how our team has reacted, we move on. We don't talk
about it. We haven't talked about it when we lost any of these other players.
What I was trying to allude to earlier, when you lose guys, I don't think you
dwell on it. You just take what you have and you go with it.  
But our team, we don't talk about replacing guys. We just take what we have
and we're going to make it work here. I don't have any problems at all or any
concerns at all with how we will be at the point position.  
  
Q. Going back to that NBA line on your practice court, what's the thinking
there? Is that a little like swinging the leaded bat before you go to the
plate?  
COACH BARNES: Probably, same thing. We've used it there for years and years.
And maybe as a motivational tool telling those guys they want to get to the
next level they better be able to make this shot too. I guess it's the
overload theory to get them to use their legs more. But they will shoot it,
and some guys can -- they don't need any lines. They think any time they're
out there they're open especially way out there.  
But I think it helps us, I do. And I think our players like having it there.
Sometimes we obviously use it for spacing purposes, with our offense. But,
again, it's been there for every year I've been at Texas we put it down and
we've used it.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 23, 2008

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Coach Mike Anderson from Missouri. Your opening
thoughts.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I'll tell you what, it's an exciting time for me. This
is year three with the Missouri basketball program. And I'm certainly excited
about the seven newcomers we have, and we've got six hold-overs from the last
couple of years.  
And so it's a nice blend of experience, as well as -- there's one word to
describe it. I think it's kind of refreshing with this group. Now, like you
guys have nametags, I think I had nametags at the first practice, but needless
to say, I'm really excited about this year.  
And I think we really have some guys that are excited about being Missouri
Tigers and I think they'll play -- we may get a chance to play the brand of
basketball that I really, really want to play.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. You have a couple of freshmen recruits from Kansas City. Can you talk
about how they might play this year, might be red shirted or do you expect
immediate impact?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'll tell you what, one of the things that took place for us
before school started we had an opportunity to go to Canada. So we actually
had a chance to practice with our team five days prior to going to Canada.  
And so I got a chance to really try to expedite these guys at practice, and so
I had an opportunity to go play an exhibition over in Canada. We got a chance
to see what these guys could do from a basketball IQ standpoint.  
And I'll tell you what, Marcus Denmon is one of those young men from Hogan
Prep high school, scored a lot of points in high school. You always wonder how
it will take place at this level here. And needless to say, I think he got a
chance to have a tremendous future at the University of Missouri.  
Second game he played 13 minutes. He had 23 points. And so there are some guys
that -- I always say there's some guys that are practice players and there are
some guys that, when the lights come on, boy, they're different players.
Marcus is one of those guys. When the light comes on, he starts to shine
offensively as well as defensively.  
Steve Moore, 6'-9", about seven-foot wing span. He has made tremendous strides
since the Canada trip as well as into practice right now. Gives us a guy with
a big body. Has a lot of girth. He can bang a little bit and block shots.  
I think he has a very good future as well. But those guys are doing, they're
doing a great job so far.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on it, but is this the first year you feel like you
have the talent and depth to rotate around to play the style of basketball
you've really wanted to at Mizzou?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think you're absolutely right. I think with this team here,
just from what I've observed thus far, I think we're going to have more
options.  
I think when you talk about having options and having depth to play the way we
want to play, one of the things we always have been able to is we've been able
to score.  
But our nemesis has been not stopping people, especially the way I want to
play. And so with that being said, now I think bringing in some depth and some
quality depth. These guys have been recruited to come in and play a certain
style of basketball.  
First of all, I like guys that are used to winning. So those guys are going to
do the little things that it takes to win. I think we have more of those kind
of guys.  
But not only that, I think we have some guys, this is their third year. A guy
like Leo Lyons, coming in, I'm a new coach to Leo Lyons, so now -- and of
course there's that adjustment period. But I think Leo has matured and now he
understands what his role is.  
A guy like DeMarre Carroll, who's the Newcomer of the Year in our league last
year, played on a hurt ankle all year. So now he's in his fifth year. He's a
senior now. So I think those guys, as well as Matt Lawrence, my first year
with Matt Lawrence, sophomore year leading 3-point shooters in the country.  
So now we bring in an influx of new guys to go along with the group we have
coming back. J.T. Tiller, third year playing for the same coach. Now you've
got some guys that are more experienced. And understand their roles a little
bit more.  
Hopefully one of the big keys is going to be the leadership. And that
leadership should come from guys like Leo Lyons, DeMarre Carroll, Matt
Lawrence, and, of course, a guy like J.T. Tiller.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is a team that can kind of surprise some teams,
maybe in the North and in the Big 12, kind of jump into that upper half and
get competing with maybe the top four we see in the preseason poll?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'm really excited about the team. When I get excited that
means there's good things on the horizon. Number one, I'm used to winning.
And, again, this team is going to be young, but I think we have a nice
mixture. And I think a lot is going to depend on how these guys come about,
how they come along.  
I think the Canadian trip, it gave me an idea the potential of this team. And
so now what we've done now is just we roll up our sleeves. Went back in the
gym. We've been doing two-a-days they like that because I cut that out, this
is the last of two-a-days but they've been working extremely hard. This team
is going to be one of those teams, they're going to bring their helmets to the
game every single night. I think when you bring that you'll give yourself a
chance.  
With that being said, I think we've got a chance to really develop this year
and with our schedule we've got a lot of different kind of tests.  
Early on we play in the Puerto Rican shootout, opened up against an Xavier
team that was in the Elite Eight in that tournament and also is Southern Cal.
Memphis, Seton Hall. You name it, you've got some great teams. Virginia Tech.
So those are going to be some tremendous tests for us early on, and we'll get
tested.  
California coming into the Mizzou arena. I'm excited about that. The Border
War series, every year against Illinois and of course we play on the road
against Georgia. So I think the development of our basketball team, hopefully
with that schedule, it will get us really, really ready for the Big 12, which
I think is going to be good this year as well.  
  
Q. Based on what you've seen in practice so far, how are guys reacting to
the extended 3-point line?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think they still want to shoot it, I know that. They don't
make it much, but they want to shoot it. No, I think those guys -- and that's
what you do, I think, in practice.  
You work and we do a lot of scrimmaging. We find out those guys that really
are effective in terms of shooting it behind the line. A guy like Matt
Lawrence. That line won't be a factor for him.  
But some other guys it might be. A guy like J.T. Tiller that may be. Maybe
it's something he worked on in the off-season. But it shouldn't be that much
of a factor.  
  
Q. Your front line, I know you're going to count on those guys, Leo and
DeMarre, but in the guard play who are you looking at especially to run the
point? Is it J.T.? Is it young guys like Denmon and Paul? Do you think they
can step in right away?  
COACH ANDERSON: That's going to be the big question mark with our basketball
team. I think our front line is -- you've identified Leo Lyons, a proven guy.
DeMarre Carroll. With those guys, Justin Safford along with a guy like Keith
Ramsey, junior college All-American. They give us a tremendous line.  
So the arc play is going to be important. I thought J.T. did a great job with
what he did last year when he started. Pick a guy like Zaire Taylor. I think
he's going to be a guy that's going to come in demand the point. What I like
about him he's a big guard.  
So now we get bigger guards that can do a lot of different things, and Zaire
Taylor, a transfer from Delaware who sat out last year. We're looking for him
to come in and if there's any indication what took place in Canada, then I
think he's going to be one of those guys that people are going to be talking
about when the season is all said and done.  
But no, question, Denmon, Miguel Paul, Kim English, all those guys are going
to factor into how good our team can be and their development is going to be
very, very important.  
The thing I like about it is our practices, even as we talk about it right
now, they're very, very competitive. Very, very competitive.  
And so what that does, it sets the stage for the games. We really get after
them in practice. So guys that compete, they're competing for playing time.
That hadn't been the case since I've been there.  
And so with that said, now you are developing that depth that you've got to
have to play the way we want to play.  
  
Q. I know it was your rival who did it, but can you talk about what Kansas's
national championship means to the conference overall? In terms of your
ability to recruit and attract attention.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think it tells you the state of the conference. I think the
Big 12, I think this is, what, the 11th, 12th year of the conference. You've
got a national championship team. And the funny thing about it is that I think
-- I don't know, did they win the conference? I think it was like co-champions
last year. So it just tells you this conference is really emerging.  
And I had an opportunity to be in the Southeast Conference, and of course we
were in there when Arkansas actually first went in there. And at that time
Kentucky just dominated the conference in everything. And, of course, Arkansas
and South Carolina came in there I think it was in '92 and before you know it
now all the other teams really start getting very, very competitive in terms
of recruiting.  
So won a national championship in '94 and look what happened. I think the next
couple of years Kentucky won one. So hopefully, again, I think the Big 12, I
think there's some great years ahead of the Big 12.  
  
Q. Following along those lines, Coach, do you feel like this is maybe more
wide open than the Big 12 has been in the last couple years with maybe not the
national championship-caliber team right at the forefront?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think you've got a lot of teams that were making that push
anyway. So it just kind of opened up the door. I mean, when you look at I
think Jeff Capel, some pretty good talent there. They played well last season,
a lot of guys returning. You talk about Texas. Rick, he has a stable of guys
returning. So you've got some guys that are returning.  
So on paper, I mean, you look and you say, okay, these guys here should be --
Baylor has a lot of guys returning, but I think the funny thing about
basketball is the paper doesn't play. I think the guys play, and I'm sure each
and every coach that comes up here, they're trying to prepare their team to be
the best team they possibly can be.  
And on any given night a lot of things take place. Took place last year. It
will take place this year, too.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Yori from Nebraska. Coach, your
comments about the upcoming season.  
COACH YORI: Well, I always hear coaches talk about how excited they are at
this time of the year. That holds true with me as well and the kids in our
program. I get a lump in my stomach when I start thinking about the schedule,
not only the Big 12 schedule but the non-conference schedule.  
I think we've put together a great schedule but I think we have the players in
our program who are able to accept that challenge and perform well. And been
quizzing a lot of people in Lincoln, Nebraska, saying if there's a team that
returns four starters from a regular season league championship, where would
you expect that they would be picked in the preseason poll.  
And, of course I'm talking about K State and everybody's saying, well, they'd
probably be picked first and second. Because of the nature of our league and
how great everybody is and how tremendous the coaching is and how many great
players we have in the league, being picked eighth is nothing to feel bad
about because we feel we've got some great players in our program and we have
a chance to have a really good year.  
PETER IRWIN: Earlier they were talking about the coaches becoming rock stars.
Which instrument do you play?  
COACH YORI: The comb and wax paper.  
  
Q. Your schedule is pretty serious. You alluded to it. Why did you do all
that stuff with your schedule with like the LSU? Are you insane?  
COACH YORI: Well, some people might say that. And there's probably going to be
a rubber room available for me if things don't go well.  
But our schedule is enormously difficult. If you haven't looked at it, I'm
sure most of you have, but there's a good chance we'll play six teams in the
non-conference that won NCAA tournament last year, three of them on the road
plus a couple other teams that went NIT, that won one games in NIT.  
But we've played the last couple of years as good a schedule as anyone in the
Big 12.  
And I want to remind my AD about that and remind everyone out there we're
playing a great schedule. But it does prepare us. The idea is and the
intention of scheduling as well as we have, we hope it gets us ready for those
early season Big 12 opponents that we're going to see.  
We felt last year that helped us early in the Big 12 season, and we hope that
that will hold true for us this year as well.  
  
Q. With the rules change in the men's game with moving the 3-point line back
a foot and the number of players you've rotated, have you noticed amongst your
guard players early on that there's been some sort of confusion with the
women's line and men's line, and they've been playing that maybe deeper now
because of the rule change in the men's game?  
COACH YORI: It's a funny thing because last year we were one of the worst
3-point shooters in the league, so now our kids are trying to shoot from 22
feet, so that's probably not a good thing. But you're right, I think it has
been a little difficult for our players to pick that up, but I think it will
get better as we get going.  
  
Q. Talk about Kelsey Griffin's off-season and what you need as far as
leadership from her and maybe the lack of respect or lack of knowledge of her
abilities on a nationwide scale?  
COACH YORI: Well, unfortunately, from our standpoint, Kelsey is out of
commission right now. She's been out for nine weeks with an ankle injury, and
we hope that we have her this year. It's a big question mark on our season.  
And with the difficulty of our schedule, we don't have her. I think it could
change our season a little bit. So number one we've got to get her back
healthy for us to have a good year, and she hasn't done anything in our
practices, hasn't really done anything in our conditioning other than be on a
bike and swimming pool.  
It's important we get her back number one, and those who know Kelsey, she was
picked as one of the top five players in the league, and I would agree
wholeheartedly. I think she's one of the best players in the league. I think
she's a player that's been recognized by the Big 12 coaches as one of the best
players the last few years. But hasn't been recognized necessarily on a
national level, and we hope that she continues to have a good year, we
continue to have a good year, that's going to help us and obviously that's
going to help her to gain some of those accolades.  
  
Q. Your first five or six practices, Connie, who do you think is your most
improved player from last year? Anybody who has been eye-opening for you that
you didn't expect to be?  
COACH YORI: We played 10 players essentially double-digit minutes last year
and nine of them are returning for us. And really pleased with the improvement
of a number of our guards. We were really young at the guard. Now we've seen
definite improvement especially from our guard play. Dominique Kelley who is
here with us today and Kaitlyn Burke and Kala Kuhlmann. Yvonne Turner is
playing good basketball.  
We're playing better at the guard spot. And we have been a team that a year
ago as well as this year would have played guard by committee and played a lot
of guards and haven't relied on three or four players. We relied on six.  
So it's pleasing for me to be able to answer that question and say we've had a
number of kids that have improved.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the fact that you've put together two 20-win
seasons back to back for only the fourth time in Nebraska history? What has
that done for the program and your recruiting class?  
COACH YORI: Winning helps. The more you win, the more recognition you get. The
more recruits take a look at you. We feel it's definitely opened some doors
for us in the recruiting process.  
Has it allowed us to solidify top 50 recruits? Maybe. Not necessarily. But
it's opened doors for us, and I think it's the first step. It's been a
process. I think there's a lot of coaches in this league who are great coaches
who are going through the same process.  
And we made another good step last year which we have had those folks out in
the, high school kids recognize that, so that's been real positive.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Cindy Stein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14283)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Cindy Stein. Would you like to make an opening
comment or two?  
COACH STEIN: We're looking forward to, obviously, coming back to Oklahoma City
for the Big 12 tournament. We're very excited about the season. I was trying
to prepare for what was going to go on today, because you hear about so many
different things that are always going on throughout the summer, coaches.  
It amazes me, with women's basketball, because we always talk about fashion.
So we're either talking about like what Kim Mulkey is going to wear, Sherri
Coale's stilettos. Now I hear Coach G has her own clothing line.  
I thought what I was going to do was I thought about coming naked because I
thought that would be the only way I'd get any attention, but they wouldn't
let me on the plane.  
But we wanted attendance this year to -- we wanted our attendance to go up, so
that wasn't going to help us. We are excited about being here. I brought two
outstanding young ladies here: Shakara Jones, a sophomore, returning starter.
And Alyssa Hollins, another returning starter, senior.  
And they both have been providing such great leadership this year for what we
plan on being a very, very good year for the Mizzou Tigers. Why do we say
that? We returned all our starters. We returned 99.9 percent of our offense
and 99.9 percent of our defense.  
And now we've added four freshmen. Three of them are 6-3 and bigger. The other
one is six foot. And they're very talented freshmen. We're very excited. We
feel our depth is so much better. We feel we have seasoned veterans coming
into play and we obviously can't wait to get things going.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Want to ask you about the size. You brought in a lot of size. Obviously
Shak did a lot of yeoman's work as a little bit of an undersized post player
last year. How much is the size going to help you overall and maybe help Shak
also?  
COACH STEIN: The biggest factor with our size right now is just the fact that
Shakara is about 6-1 going up against 6-5, 6-3, 6-3 in practice, which never
happened at all last year, unless one of our guy practice players happened to
be bigger.  
She's able to go up against bigger kids which is making her actually finish
around the basket probably better. She's so much more comfortable inside. It's
no longer an eye-opener when you see somebody coming up bigger, and especially
like a Courtney Paris type player, she was going to have to play in the post.  
She's no longer threatened and has a lot more confidence going into that. I
think that that's one of those things. Plus, the depth. I mean, we had Nicole
Wilson last year who was a volleyball player, hadn't played collegiate
basketball. And just the kids coming in off the bench now will be players that
have more basketball skills, probably more basketball knowledge. Even though
Nicole did a great job for us, these kids are just going to keep improving.  
Their shot blocking abilities and scoring abilities just give us so much more
depth inside. We probably went from one of the smallest teams in the Big 12
last year to now I would put us in the top half.  
  
Q. You've got everybody back. You talked about 99 percent of your offense
and defense. Out of all those returners, who is really stepping up? Who have
you seen like a whole new part of their game?  
COACH STEIN: It's interesting, because I feel like everyone's returned better
in some way. Obviously I think that -- I was a little surprised in individual
workouts this year, Alyssa making some of the moves that she did, because I've
been talking to her about being a little bit more physical going inside and
getting to the basket a little bit more.  
She's doing all those things. And so she had a couple of moves earlier
individual workouts, just she's pulling something out of her pocket again and
playing extremely well. And you're talking about your best player on your team
coming back better.  
Obviously I talked about Shakara. She's just so much more comfortable inside.
She's stepping out on the perimeter now and hitting some 3s. She's doing some
other things.  
Jessra Johnson has always been somebody, she just scores and she rebounds. But
Jasmyn Otote has come back better, more consistent shooter, working harder on
the defensive end. RaeShara Brown was going to play her mainly at point or
back-up point depending on how she did. She came in playing the wing really
well for us, being very physical, another tremendous rebounder, defender.  
So I could go on down the line. I think that they've all come back better. Toy
Richbow has come back better. It's just, you can just name them.  
  
Q. You had three overtime games last year, the biggest being the Oklahoma
game, talk about what your kids took away from that.  
COACH STEIN: The Oklahoma game I think was big on the fact that we were very
disappointed in our season up until that point. And we knew that we had some
close games that we had lost and we were hanging in there. But no one wants to
hang in there. You want to have something.  
So I think the Oklahoma game gave us some confidence. It gave us a reason to
kind puff out our chest, say we're going to be a lot better next year. But at
the same time we also understood that the Oklahoma game meant we needed to
make sure we were doing all those little things in the summer to return
better. I think that's what it did the most.  
  
Q. Following that, you guys nearly beat Oklahoma in Columbia, basically down
to the last minute and then you beat them. Not to ask you to give away all
your secrets against Oklahoma, but why were you so successful against them and
what do you think about them being picked number one, although a lot of teams
got votes for number one, about them being picked to win this year?  
COACH STEIN: I think Oklahoma is a good pick for number one. They returned
everybody. As many of our conference teams do, I think that when we ended the
season last year, I looked at the Big 12 and knew that we were returning
probably 80 plus percent of our best players in the league. And, of course, I
was hoping they were all graduating.  
So it just put a little more emphasis on what we needed to do. But as far as
our play against Oklahoma, I think it just had to do more with our players
being a little more aggressive. And that's something that we got better at
during the year, but defensively, especially. In the Big 12 you can't sit
around and wait for things happen. You've got to help make things happen. And
against Oklahoma I think we probably always did that better in those games
than some of the others. It's just playing all out defensively a little bit
more aggressive.  
For us to compete in the Big 12 we have to be a highly aggressive and intense
team.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Patterson from Kansas State University.
Coach, welcome, and your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I think coming off the heels of a season in which the
Big 12 qualified eighth for the NCAA tournament, it's exciting to think of the
challenges that rest ahead for all of us in this league.  
I think we coaches have a great deal of pride in the fact that this is the No.
1 team in attendance, No. 1 team in RPI, and always look forward to the
challenge of game-by-game facing the best coaches and players in this country.  
I think it's exciting to see the fact that a program like Oklahoma in one
preseason publication is ranked No. 1 in the nation. I think that brings great
attention and validity to the framework of the season ahead.  
So all great things. And I know at Kansas State our players are very much
looking forward to raising it up and getting after it again.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Last year you didn't have a very successful non-conference season, didn't
play very well at all in non-conference but then turned it around and ended up
winning the Big 12 regular conference title. Is non-conference overrated or
what was the factor there and how important is it that you get off to a good
start this year?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the non-conference slate for our program last year
just helped prepare us for our runs through conference, so I think that non-
conference schedule is very important. I think you have an opportunity like we
did a year ago to learn a lot about yourself, about what might be working,
what's not working. And certainly our basketball team used the non-conference
to teach all of us how to be a better basketball team as we transitioned into
Big 12 play.  
And I think it's a very essential element. I think ours is always a non-
conference schedule that has enough challenges that we begin to stretch
ourselves like we will be stretched in Big 12 play. But then also provides us
with opportunities to get our feet on the ground to learn a little bit about
combinations and personnel.  
And then our success from non-conference to conference play last year was a
tribute to the resiliency and persistence and toughness and the competitive
disposition of the team that we had on the floor last year, with great leaders
and great chemistry.  
  
Q. Do you have any comments or any thoughts about Kendra Wecker joining the
coaching staff over at OU?  
COACH PATTERSON: No, I think it's great. Any time a young person that's
established a great collegiate career has the opportunity to make that
transition into the college game at any level, I think anybody that has a
heart for coaching the game and continuing on their basketball careers, it's
great for women's basketball. And we wish her the very best in her endeavors
along the lines of becoming a coach at the collegiate level.  
  
Q. We talked about this a little bit earlier, but talk about you won the
conference last year and you lose one player and your preseason ranking in a
tough conference, granted, but how you and your team felt about that, and also
highlight maybe some newcomers you think can make an immediate impact?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the way we look at this league and the great coaches
and players that are part of it, the preseason ranking to us isn't significant
in a lot of ways. It's strictly -- I think just speaks to the toughness of
this league and the talent of the coaches and players in it.  
We approach every season sort of as a blank page. We understand we'll be
developing a new team. Kimberly Dietz was absolutely phenomenal last year for
us and was a big piece of our success. But I love the core group of players we
have returning. They've got great experience at winning under their belt and
all the intrinsic ways they've learned a lot of lessons that will carry over.  
So I'm very excited about the core group of players we bring back and they're
very excited about their season, and none of us are preoccupied with preseason
picks. We understand that it's game by game you establish who you're going to
be, once you transition into Big 12 play.  
With our freshmen group, I think we've got a group who is pretty young this
year. Because of the quality of our core, it will be surprising to me to see
any of those freshmen this year make a major break through and impact in our
program. But I'm definitely open to the thought of it and open, certainly, to
anyone that wants to bust through that door and rattle the cage and find a way
to be an impact player.  
But I think it's probably more a reflection of the quality of returners that
we have that that will be a very tough step for them to take. They're walking
into a gym with great leadership and great talent around them and certainly an
environment in which they can learn and develop a great deal about the mental
and the physical aspects of becoming great players. So that's exciting to me
for them.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Welcome Coach Mulkey from Baylor University. Opening comments and
then questions from the floor.  
COACH MULKEY: Good morning. Appreciate you all being here. I'm glad I am here.
It is bad weather. I don't have an opening statement. You guys just ask me any
questions.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. You've talked about the returning players and the new players that you
have, kind of that mix. Do you have a timetable for when all those players
have to be on the same page?  
COACH MULKEY: I wish I had a timetable. I've learned real quickly it's been a
long time since I've had five freshmen and seven new-comers, I'm not sure I've
ever had that many to begin with.  
Every day is a challenge because you can't move forward until they're on the
same page that particular day or that particular play or that particular
offense. And I don't know when it will be. I know that when it does happen
they could be a very special team.  
  
Q. They tell me, Kim, Gail Goestenkors has come out with her own clothing
line. When are you going to get your own clothing line?  
COACH MULKEY: I'm not as popular as she is. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you fill in for Angela Tisdale, who is going to be
your floor leader, or is that going to be something by committee or you see
one person doing that? And could you talk about having Jhasmin Player back.
That was such a tough loss for you guys at the time, especially, it came last
year.  
COACH MULKEY: Losing only one player off last year's team, expectations within
our program are no different. But what you did lose is you lost an All-Big 12
performer. You lost our leader. You lost a young lady that was capable of
scoring a lot of points for us from the point guard position.  
What we will replace her with is Kelli Griffin, a sophomore who got
significant playing time as a freshman last year. We have Cherrish Wallace,
who is a freshman who will be fighting for some playing time and I could play
Jhasmin Player at the point if I need to.  
And it is good to have Jhasmin back. Her leadership ability on the floor is
contagious. When she's on the floor, it's like the entire team picks itself
up, because they understand Jhasmin has been in the program a while and she
just has a lot of energy and enthusiasm.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the strength of the conference this year, five
teams get first place votes in the preseason poll and Texas A &M and Elite
Eight team is fifth. Can you talk about the strength of the league?  
COACH MULKEY: Preseason polls never cease to amaze me in this conference. I go
back to when Sophia Young was not good enough to get freshman of the year, and
it amazes me when I watch how we as coaches vote and you guys vote as well, I
don't know where we come up with some of the things we come up with.  
It's a league where my opinion is going to differ from the next coach's
opinion. And I think it's out of respect for all the coaches in the league and
all the teams, this is just a league that year in and year out it's tough.
It's tough.  
And I go back to the year we won the national championship. I don't even know,
we might have been picked sixth that year. It's great motivation for us
because we're always picked pretty much lower than we think we're able to
finish. So I'm sure A&M and all those guys will use it as great motivation as
well.  
  
Q. You've got a strong front line coming back, but with the two transfers
who might be able to provide kind of an immediate impact for you, having
Morghan, having Whitney, could you just talk about maybe the roles that they
might have for you going forward?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, if you go back to last year, guys, we were one game away
from winning the Big 12 conference and basically we had seven players. And I
look back and reflect on that year and the job those players did. It's pretty
special.  
Now you're going to add two players, one that has significant college
experience in Morghan Medlock when she played at USC. She brings a toughness
in the paint. She brings another body in there.  
And she's going to play lots and lots. Now Whitney Zachariason transferred to
us from University of Arkansas, will not be eligible until the middle of
December. What Whitney brings is a post player that can shoot the perimeter
shot face up and you can take her outside the paint a lot.  
And we've got a freshman also in the paint in Ashley Field. So we've got a
five-player rotation at the post that is a luxury but could probably be a
headache for you as a coach because now I have choices to make.  
Last year I didn't have those choices. We had to go with what we had.  
  
Q. I know we just visited about Lindsay Palmer, but talk about her game and
what she's going to bring to your program eventually?  
COACH MULKEY: Lindsay Palmer is a perimeter shooter with great range. And as I
tell all great the shooters, some of your best games may be the mere fact that
you go stand in the corner and they have to guard you and worry about you so
our posts won't have any double and triple teams in there.  
So Lindsay spreads the floor for us offensively. She's like all freshmen in
this will her toughest year in basketball because she has to learn a new
system, she has to learn new things. Yet, at the same time she's got the
ability to shoot the basketball and that's something that coaches always look
for.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now ready for Colorado. Coach, welcome to the Big 12 Media
Days, and your comments, please.  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Thank you. It's good to be here. Always good to be
back in Oklahoma City having spent five years in the state before I arrived at
Colorado. There's always usually a warm feeling here but unusually cold today.  
But it's good to be here. And I'm always excited when Oklahoma City hosts the
Big 12 tournament, the tournament that they hosted a few years ago was one of
the best I've ever been a part of. So it's good to be back here and be exposed
to fans that truly love the game of basketball and really support the women's
game.  
As far as Colorado goes, I would say that this is by far going to be my most
challenging and hopefully most rewarding coaching experience coming into this
season, of course, the graduation of Jackie McFarland, and trying to evaluate
this team and evaluate where our strengths are and exactly what Colorado
basketball is going to be like this upcoming season as a result of the players
that we have.  
Came into it with a thought of Whitney Houston as our point guard coming off
of a strong run in the WNIT early on in the preseason workouts tore the ACL.
So for us there's no doubt that we've got more staff meetings. We've got more
conversation, more film watching, and the one thing I have to say is that I am
truly going to be challenged this year as a result of the players in our
program.  
Very, very talented players but not the typical prototype position players
that I'm accustomed to having as far as having a strong 5, a solid athletic 4
or the point guard that can run the offense. We've got some basketball players
that can pretty much play any position and we've got some players in the
program right now that we feel like we can put five pretty good players on the
floor that may not be the position that they typically have played or the
style of play which is typical of that position.  
So we've spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks and the past month
really trying to find the niche of these players and what their strengths are
and what they do well. And the one thing we know is we've got some players
that can score. We've got some players that can shoot the ball. We've got some
players that bring some more athleticism and really have no idea what Big 12
basketball is all about but give us a youth and an energy that every day we
walk out of practice and there are times that we say wow. And sometimes it's a
really good wow and sometimes it's a really bad wow.  
But only in that we know that we've got some more work to do and that we're
thankful that we've got a couple of weeks before the season starts. But the
challenging wow is how do we keep these five that have never played together
to gel and to mold and to do the things that we need them to do.  
We've got our challenges on the inside as far as lack of experience on the
interior. I think Kara Richards, I really think is our leader right now. She's
our strength. She's the one that the players turn to.  
She's the one that they look up to and they listen to and fortunately for us
she's saying all the right things and she's doing all the right things. And
when you have a good leader on the floor in the first three years that we had
Kara, Kara's personality is more of a pleaser.  
She's one that takes care of people. She's one that coddles, she's one that
makes sure that everyone is where they need to be on time. I think for the
first time I've seen Kara really taking care of herself making sure that --
it's like an older brother or older sister. I have to get all my stuff done
before I start taking care of other people.  
That's where she is right now. That's been the difference between her and our
interior. We've got a true center. We have a center that loves to be around
the basket. A center that loves to play with their back to the basket and
extremely physical. We've got to keep her on the floor as most of you have
seen her play she's pretty foul-prone and likes to mix it up a little bit but
composure is going to be big for her.  
Now, the players that we put around her, I think, Kara is going to be very
pleased that she almost never, like Jackie McFarland did or some of the posts
did in the past, can or will be able to have double coverage. We've got
players that can score, shoot, put the ball to the floor and get to the rim
and make Kara look very good.  
That's the wow that we've seen these last couple of days in practice and that
we're really excited about. Brittany Spears has returned, the one thing we
talked about in post-season meetings with her is when you're a freshman, the
hardest thing is to come back after averaging 13 1/2 points, 7 1/2 rebounds
and repeat that your sophomore year.  
But she has come in. We scrimmaged yesterday and that's exactly what she came
up with, eight rebounds, 14 points, and she's returned better than we
anticipated. So she's in the mind-set where she knows she's got to take her
game to another level.  
Some of the newcomers, Kelly Jo Mullaney, player out of Minnesota is a true
warrior and a player that spent the year with us last year and her red shirt
year and saw glimpses of it, but knowing how difficult a red shirt year is,
has some challenges sitting out but has come back every day in practice and
proven why she's one of the toughest players that are going to play at
Colorado from a mentality standpoint.  
She's physical. She's aggressive, and she's just got a lot to her game that's
truly going to help us. Bianca Smith has returned, good condition, 3- point
shooter, gives us depth and range. Another newcomer Alyssa Fressle, Player of
the Year, Gatorade Player of the Year in Colorado. Felt very good about her
commitment to Colorado. Came, spent the summer with the players, went to
summer school. Did a great job and has jelled in every aspect of her game and
has really added to this team.  
So right now we feel like we've got about seven players that we could
potentially start. I wouldn't prototype anyone into a position with the
exception of Kara. But we just know that we're going to put five players on
the floor that can score, five players on the floor that can make plays and
we're going to put some basketball players out there that are going to put us
in a position to win.  
We're really excited coming in, but lots of challenges. And as coaches this is
what's fun. This is what you love. You've got to find a way to get this group
exactly where you need them. The one thing about this team that I don't have
to worry about is the chemistry on and off the floor. It's very good. And that
starts with the leadership of Kara.  
So that's very exciting for us. The schedule, non-conference schedule, going
back to Virginia, I've played there back in the late '80s and so I'll return
there for the first time as a coach or the first time in Charlottesville as a
player. We've got Minnesota coming to our tournament, playing against Hawaii
and Pepperdine in the Hawaii tournament at Seton Hall.  
We've got a tough non-conference schedule but most of us know the non-
conference schedule is about wins and making sure everybody builds and gets
better, because come January we know what's around the corner in the Big 12
and we know what that's all about.  
So for me and our staff, it's been a challenging off-season in that we went
into the season feeling one way about who was going to lead this team, who our
point guard was going to be and right now it's a totally different look and
the biggest challenge is right now depth, not necessarily position.  
But it's an exciting team and one I think our fans are going to definitely
love to watch.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could expand a little on Kara when she had the injury
situations and then you said personality in some ways, has it been conducive
sometimes for what a center has to be, but there's a history in this league of
players really coming around their senior year and having the best year of
their career. Does she have a chance to do that this year?  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Kara and I have talked about this. Her freshman year
she and Jackie played side by side. So they basically mirrored each other
their freshman year with points and rebounds. And then my first year Kara was
hurt. So Jackie emerged as the go-to player in a very, very short time
averaging 17 or 18 points.  
So I think that personality that we're talking about where -- I love having
unselfish players, but that year that she came back, which was my second year,
was almost detrimental to Kara's development in that she wanted what was best
for Jackie. She wanted Jackie to be successful and she was supportive and did
everything, where now you take Jackie out of the equation and I'm seeing what
we saw her first year. I'm seeing a leader. I'm seeing a player that finishes,
a player that huddles them up, a player that not only takes care of themselves
but takes care of what she needs to take care of on the floor and really
communicates that to some of the younger players.  
As good as Alyssa Fressle is, as good as Kelly Jo Mullaney is or Brittany
Spears, they still look to her for guidance. And this is the first year I
actually hear her as opposed to walking over pulling them aside. It's a
leadership that she's not afraid to give anymore.  
And as far as coming in her senior year, she knows what this team needs of her
and that unselfish side of her says that's what I'm going to give.  
  
Q. Talk about what you're going to need from Bianca and Brittany this
year.  
COACH MCCONNELL-MILLER: Well, like I said, with Whitney Houston out of the
equation, our biggest concern at that spot, what Whitney brought was, of
course, her ability to run the point guard spot. But is depth, whether it was
Britney Blythe backing her up or Kelly Jo Mullaney or Melissa Fressle, there
was so much depth.  
Now we're looking at these book ends we're looking at Brittany Spears who can
shoot the 3. She can go off the bounds. She can do a lot of great things.
You've got Bianca Smith who has elevated her game where she was great for 16
minutes a game. Now we feel like we're going to use her 20 to 24 minutes a
game. So they stretched things so much. There's no way that teams can play us
and not guard either one of them.  
And a lot of times it was either Brittany or Bianca on the floor so their best
defender would match up with one of them. With both of them on the floor, you
really have to guard them. Their shooting percentage, the amount of shots they
get up in a night when Coors is shut down and they're coming in, turning the
lights on is astronomical.  
They get in the gym more than any two players I've seen as far as shooting the
balls and getting a lot of reps in. So they have to be guarded which is going
to allow Kara single coverage. It's going to allow Kara really some movement
on the block and our offense, a lot of times whether we start that way finish
it that way or see it a great deal, we're going to have four guards on the
floor a great deal of the time.  
So I think having those two on the floor is really going to stretch defenses.
A lot of players that don't shoot the ball as well the ability to penetrate.
It's going to allow Kara and any other interior players the ability to do some
things on the block that in the past they've doubled Jackie and pulled off
some players, whether it was Whitney Houston, whether it was Hannah Skildum,
they pulled off players and Jackie was constantly double covered. That was our
objective from last year to this year is to put five players on the floor that
can score so that does not happen.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We have Coach Henrickson here. If you'd like to make an opening
comment or two, and welcome to the Big 12.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Other than our trip started like our season, a little bumpy,
we're good. That's why we got here safely. It's good to see everybody. It's
hard to believe we're back at it again. Excited to be back at it again.  
Obviously a quick -- excitement, and for those of you from this area, and
Angel Goodrich, a player from Tahlequah, a young lady we're still obviously
excited about and a young lady who brought a lot of enthusiasm in a short
period of time to our program into Lawrence, Kansas.  
But we are fortunate that we've got great doctors and trainers and she will be
back. And just by design we have Monday off after it happened on Sunday. And I
think it was probably good timing and give everybody a chance to be sad and
upset.  
Yesterday she started her rehab and we need to start working towards not
changing our goals but reevaluating how we're going to get things done. We're
fortunate that I'm real proud of our returning players, they worked hard in
the off-season.  
We are individually player to player better. And in this league it's better to
get better every year. And we're fortunate we've got two returning point
guards that played that position all of last year, who for them it's an
opportunity, opportunity especially as a senior with Ivana to have the senior
year and get on the floor and be an impact player for us. But we're excited
Danielle and Sade who we brought here. Those two have really worked hard to be
better perimeter players. Krysten Boogaard who is an all-rookie, a member of
the all-rookie team, worked hard, played in the summer with her international
team. She played the Chinese Olympic team over in China three times this
summer.  
So she's had a great off-season. So it has been a little bit of a bump here
and a jolt to all of us. But we're committed to obviously having a great year.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of interest on Angel. Could you talk more about how you
projected her, how important she'd be for this team and about the injury?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, my projection for her, having watched her as long as
we have, I think first time I saw her was right after eighth grade year, play-
making point guard.  
I was asked to describe at our media day. She has a personality like Russell
Robinson from our men's team last year. Very, very quiet. Very reserved but
leads by example and in her own way communicates very clearly with her
teammates.  
But as a play-maker, Chris Paul, in the NBA, because of stature and you put
her and Krysten Boogaard next to each other it's nearly comical. Angel is 5-2
barefoot and Krysten is 6-5. For her to be in a position -- and we will in a
year, a play-making, good decisions, she throws things most kids don't see let
alone try to throw. She can score. She's handled the transition very well.  
Our strength and conditioning coach has ranted and raved about her performance
this summer and this fall. She handled that much better than I think she
thought she would handle it.  
On the court with her I was just so excited to be able to coach a kid like
that and how special she is and just I was telling someone when we walked in
about -- for a long time after late night where she made a great move to the
rim and scored, threw two great passers, scored on a jumper, and everybody was
so excited and she was so excited.  
I remember watching her being interviewed back by the locker room and I had
never seen her smile so big and talk so fast. As long as we've worked with her
and spent time with her and might have even talked faster than I do. And
she'll be back.  
And she loves it at Kansas and is excited about being there. But it's
disappointing, but she'll play again and she'll be better because of this
because of how tough she is.  
  
Q. Not that there's ever a good time for something like this, but that
you've got all of your practice in front of you, can you talk about that?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Exactly. And you're exactly right. If it had to happen, at
least it gives us a chance to regroup because quite honestly it would have
changed drastically how we would have played offensively because of her
ability to make a play and ability to make a decision to score.  
The two that play that position, it's not fair to run the same things for them
because that doesn't put them in a position to be successful, doesn't put our
basketball team in a position to be successful.  
So we will have retooled, sat down, went back to the drawing board about how
can we have those two still help us but still get the ball in Danielle and
Krysten's hands and it will be in their hands more. They still would have
gotten shots, I don't mean to say Angel would have taken all the shots, but
she would be in a position to be a play-maker, have the ball in her hands
quite a bit.  
  
Q. Does it change your outlook? You've got -- I imagine you were going to
feel pretty good about this team going in no matter what based on who you had
coming back?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Outlook in that, it will look different. And when we huddled
up right away and as I sent text messages to everybody when we realized what
had happen, we've got to take care of her and we've got to step up and our
goals don't change.  
And we've got 80 percent of everything coming back. And we have returners that
have improved and gotten better and really committed to training to be
successful and improving. So, no, that doesn't.  
And, like I said, we let ourselves be sad and upset. We had a day to do that
and once we regrouped it was we've got business as usual and work to get
better and try to get better every day.  
  
Q. Talk about Sade's role on the team this year?  
COACH HENRICKSON: It will be similar to last year as far as her ability to --
I think right now she's shooting a 3 as well as she has since we got her.
She's a great mid-range pullup jump kid. She gets to the rim. I want her to
get to the rim more. I want her to get fouled more. I want her to get to the
free throw line, because it's an 89 percent shooter who shot 30 free throws in
the league play last year, and for a kid who can put the basketball on the
floor and make a play.  
So she's got to be more aggressive. That's -- when you're talking about a door
that's opened for some with Angel's injury, but an opportunity for some or
expectation for a few to do more, and that will be her. That will be Danielle
and that will be Krysten.  
But day-to-day, the confidence that I think she should play with, the
confidence I have in her, I wish she was as confident in herself as I was in
her. I think she'd play more aggressively. I think she'd get to the free throw
line. I don't know if you could notice but she's put on about 12 pounds.
Always call her my pencil with ears. I can't say that anymore. We could
probably put 10 more on her. I think she's committed to doing what it takes to
do that and just eat nonstop. So her roommates say she does do that.  
So I think for her just to be aggressive and get to the free-throw line and
offensively create as much more than she did last year.  
I think the weight for her, because we got to a point last year where she had
lost a considerable amount of weight because she's got -- she's just got a
fire that burns and eats all that up. And she eats. We actually would sit and
have breakfast with her and lunch with her training table with her make sure
she was eating we couldn't believe she kept losing the weight. But she's
mastered that over the off-season. That for her she's running and performing
at that weight better than she ever has in her career to put on about 12 or 13
pounds. Now it's our job to make sure she keeps it on. She plays with a bigger
tank, just plays better longer.  
  
Q. Just talk about Danielle McCray and Krysten Boogaard and how you relied
on them so much for scoring last year, what they've done to improve and then
those around them?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Danielle went down and participated in point guard camp.
She's not going to be a point guard, but from a leadership standpoint, from a
basketball IQ standpoint, she's expressed an interest in it and we encouraged
her to do it. Ivana had went through it two years ago. Lindsay Bettors had
talked to Lindsay about how I thought it could help Danielle grow as a player,
as a teammate, and she is -- she's never been a bad teammate. Didn't mean to
say that at all. But she's embraced pushing her teammates since that
experience. I got 30 pages of notes on my desk and often go page through some
things to get some ideas I think they do a great job there.  
And she's a versatile player as far as posting her, putting her on the floor.
She's got to be better off the dribble, better decisions off the dribble. I
think we've seen that and it's quickly and briefly as we've practiced.  
But as I mentioned with Krysten, she's got a little definition now, she's not
huge by any stretch of the imagination, but she's supposed to be on the same
eating regimen as Da-Da is, but to put some weight on her and get some
explosiveness with her, her experience. We're able to keep her in summer
school in June and she trained and then went with her Canadian development
team in July and then had that experience over in China. And that was good for
her to play at that level. She played against -- again, their Olympic team and
their post player is 6-10 and that's great experience for her. You see a more
confident Krysten, a more self-assured Krysten. And that's been important.
Maybe not quite so stubborn Krysten. That's been a much improved.  
So her coachability is all-time high right now. That's a lot more fun to be
around. And that will help her in her development.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Hello, everyone. I'm Brenda VanLengen. I'm an analyst on the
Fox Sports Net Package for the Big 12 Conference.  
To build on what we did last year, having a student athlete roundtable to give
you a chance to get to know the players on a little more personal level and
have them get to answer questions in front of each other, which is always
interesting.  
But we'll start off by having each one of them introduce themselves, say what
school you're with and what year you are in school. If you want to start,
Taylor.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Taylor Hardeman from Oklahoma State. I'm a senior.  
SADE MORRIS: Sade Morris from Kansas and I'm a junior.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: Amanda Nisleit from Iowa State and I'm a senior.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: Jhasmin Player, Baylor University, and I'm a senior.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Alyssa Hollins from Missouri. I'm a senior.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Earnesia Williams from Texas, and I'm a senior.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: They're all comfortable with a microphone in their hand.
Let's start with Jhasmin Player.  
Jhasmin Player is the person you haven't seen most recently. Of course, she
had the ACL injury against Kansas State in the middle of last season, and,
Jhasmin, you talked to me about the fact that that really was a blessing in
disguise. Can you tell everybody what you discussed with me about that?  
JHASMIN PLAYER: As I said to you before, a lot of people don't know how it is.
Like I didn't -- I didn't know how it was for anyone who's ever been through
it. I've heard and I have seen players go through it all my life because I've
been playing ball, but until I went through it myself, I never knew what it
was like.  
At the time it happened it was at a time where I was playing the very best
basketball of my career. So when it happened I thought I was done for, that
there was nothing next for me. Had a great doctor and staff at my university.  
I didn't think it could get any worse, but the only time it made a turn for
the worst, my example was every summer we do something during our conditioning
phases where we run stadiums, football stadiums outside in the heat of the
day, Texas heat, we run football stadiums and we do it as a team. And so as a
team when someone thinks you're going to faint, you have another teammate to
build you up, tell you you can make it and do better.  
Well, after my ACL surgery, I was in rehab alone. And I was going up there
probably 5:30 in the morning, five days a week because I had an 8:00 class and
I had to beat that. So just being outside in that Texas heat, doing those
stadiums alone, to myself, was the toughest thing that I had ever had to go
through because I didn't have that person in my ear motivating me to do
better.  
It was something I had to want for me to do myself. It was something that God
was teaching me, you have to want this for yourself before having to want it
for someone else. It was a blessing in disguise. I got through it. I'm looking
forward to a great season. I feel like after I've gone through that I'm as
battle-tested as anything. For anyone who would go through it, I'd offer up
anything they'd need because it's that tough.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Just to follow up on that, something I thought that you
mentioned to me, all of you know, all of us know how tough the Big 12
conference is and how you go at each other night in and night out. But after
that happened, tell everybody what kind of support you got from other people
in the Big 12 conference.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: That's one thing about the Big 12, you'll always remember its
toughness. You'll remember the big games, when you upset teams on the road and
you'll always remember that.  
But personally one thing I'll never forget is I tore my ACL February 2nd at
Kansas State. We actually ended up winning that game, but no one in the gym
knew I had torn it. I knew it, Kansas State's team doctor knew it, and our
trainer and Coach Mulkey hadn't even known it yet. But they had two or three
kids on their team who had torn theirs.  
So after the game they walked up to me, tears in their eyes, we were the two
teams tied for the first in the league, tears in their eyes, they told me how
hurt they were it happened to me, how sorry they were that it happened to me.  
And I was already crying because it had happened too, but just to know that
they cared, it spoke volumes. I didn't think it could get any better than
that. I rode my whole flight home and cried the whole hour and a half. And I
got home and I do what college students do, I got on Facebook.  
And I had probably at least two Facebook messages from every team in the Big
12, from a player on every team in the Big 12. And that's when I knew that
it's greater than basketball. I've got cards from coaches -- like everyone
just showed me some support and showed me that they cared and shared ACL
stories.  
We have coaches sharing knee replacement stories with me just to kind of make
me feel better about my situation. And when that happened to me, Sydney Colson
from Texas A&M tore hers this summer and the first thing I did for Sydney was
send her the messages they sent me. Anyone from the Big 12, if you don't know
that I received your messages and your support, I did. And I learned from it.
And I really appreciated it.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Switch gears. I'm going to talk to Amanda Nisleit, and she
has a interesting story from high school that she was a finalist in the
national Got Milk competition. Can you talk about how that happened.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: Funny story. So I was sort of like interning/office aid for
athletic director to see -- I didn't know if I wanted to go into teaching, but
just to see what that all entailed. And one day I finished up what he had for
me and he gave me this little sheet of paper and it was to fill out this essay
about what our school would do with a thousand dollars and how we could make
our school healthier.  
So I wrote a rough essay, then a couple of weeks went by. I didn't think
anything of it. I got an e-mail and the director was telling me that I'm a
finalist. I'm like okay.  
So I guess I must have wrote that essay pretty well. But so I ended up
winning. And then a player from the NBA of your choice -- I picked a couple
and actually ended up being Fred Hoiberg who went to Iowa State, so it was
neat. And he came to our school and we got milk moustache pictures with him so
we got to drink the vanilla shake. A neat experience.  
And he talked at our school about being healthy and how important milk is, and
then our school ended up buying some equipment for the weight room. It was
kind of a funny story.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: And Sade Morris and Taylor Hardeman were high school
teammates. Interesting, they're sitting down there. Sade, tell everybody why
you have your name.  
SADE MORRIS: My dad actually decided to name me after the singer Sade because
his favorite song is Smooth Operator.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: You can hear it in the voice, can't you? It fits.  
You talked to me about the fact that the person that's had the biggest impact
on your basketball career is your dad. So why has he and how has he made such
an impact on you?  
SADE MORRIS: Growing up I used to follow him around when he went to play
intramural basketball. And since I was never old enough to play against
people, I always would just go on the side court and take a ball and dribble
it around.  
Then as I got older I'd always play him in a game of horse or pig. And till
about when I was a senior in high school I finally beat him in horse. He still
doesn't like to admit it. But I won.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Congratulations. Do you have any good stories about Taylor
from high school?  
SADE MORRIS: No.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Taylor, do you have any good stories on Sade?  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: No.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: None they're sharing. Well, Taylor, you and Shaunte' Smith
are part of the class that as a freshman were 0-16 and two years later you're
in the Sweet 16. Talk about that journey for the two of you.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Coming into the Big 12 and you don't win a game, it kind of
makes you think, hmm, is this the place for me, is this where I need to be, is
this right? And Shaunte' and I grew tremendously from that. That season I
wouldn't take back for anything because I learned how to play, how to play
hard and, yeah, maybe we didn't win.  
We took some teams to the end of the game. But it just didn't work out in our
favor. And I think that as a player, when you go through things like that, it
makes you want to work harder and say I never want that experience again. I
don't want to ever feel that again.  
And getting to the Sweet 16 this year with Shaunte', we were both ecstatic. We
work hard all summer, all year to get there, and finally when it was there it
was just like a dream come true to us and we both looked at each other and we
were just in tears because we never thought we would get that two years later.
And we're just really blessed to have the coaching staff that we do and my
fans, the fans that we have and the support from my teammates.  
Because without bringing in new people, we wouldn't have got there.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Alyssa Hollins from Missouri also talked about, like Sade,
the biggest impact on your career was -- you call him your daddy. So talk
about your daddy.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: My dad was the first one to put a basketball in my hand about
the third grade. I don't know. He always believed in me we used to play horse,
but I think I got him in about the fourth grade I beat him at horse. He always
tells me "I knew right then you would be a shooter." So I don't know.  
And I think a big thing my dad did, he didn't play college ball but he's a
real student of the game. So as I got older and my game began to progress and
he thought I was getting beyond what he could teach me, he made sure he put me
around people best of my game. And without his support and him getting the
ball in the first place, I wouldn't be here.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Earni Williams from Texas has also experienced the ACL
injuries that Jhasmin talked about. And through that experience you've learned
a lot about your body and you actually have decided to be a personal trainer.
So tell people what you've learned through this process and why you want to be
a personal trainer.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: I've been through -- like she said, I've been through a lot
of injuries, two ACLs and two arthroscopic knee surgeries. You kind of learn
your body. And just going through the experience, I just kind of kind of fell
in love with learning about the body. It just seemed real interesting to me.  
And I'd just like to help people get through their injuries.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Jhasmin, I know that you want to talk about your puppy.
Jhasmin has a puppy named Austin. Right away when I asked her about it, she
flipped out her iPhone and was showing me pictures. Tell everybody about your
puppy.  
JHASMIN PLAYER: That's embarrassing. I feel like the parent on the movie that
brings out the long list of kids. I have a puppy, Austin. I got him -- he's a
chocolate brown dog with curly hair, but they told me he was registered
Chihuahua. But he's two. I feel like a loser, but I really don't know how I
would make it without him. He licks the sweat off my face and -- yes, you
know, I always thought it was so nasty when I would see people in public
letting their dogs lick all over them.  
But I love him. I just love him. He's my weakness. You can lose by 20 and be
0-for-16 and 8 turnovers you go home, he'll be there just clueless, licking
you on your face.  
I love him. He's spoiled to death. Doesn't even know his name because I call
him Sweetie and Baby, anything but Austin. But outside this ball thing, he's
the sparkle in my eye.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Now, that's something I bet you never knew, right? That's
what this is all about. Amanda you told me you love to do scrapbooking and
it's not just the old-fashioned scrapbook cut out the articles out of the
paper and put them in, but you really put a lot of work into it. So with the
season you had last year, the ups and downs, tell us a little bit about the
scrapping you did last year.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: Every year since I've been here I've been doing a scrapbook. I
save it to the end. We have about a week off Coach gives us after the season
before we start post-season. So that's the time when I gather all the
pictures. And I save a couple of the back scores of some big games we came
back or ones we weren't expected to win.  
But I just like to document the fun memories because I never want to forget
them. And there was a snowstorm when we were leaving form Kansas and Coach
Fennelly and two of our managers had to push the bus, so all I could see was
Coach Fennelly pushing the bus from behind from the window from the snowbank.  
Just fun memories from different places we've been, the fun trips we've taken
and memories we've taken on the bus trips along the way with my teammates.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Sade, one of the questions I asked all of you, you're all
media savvy. You get asked a lot of questions all the time by the media. But
what's a question that you don't get asked that you wish you would? And your
response was: What do you do to build such great team chemistry with your
team. So what's the answer to that?  
SADE MORRIS: Well, every week we all get together and either go to a
teammates's house, will either watch a movie or play games. And then at least
every day we all eat together at training table and we all sit and talk and
have fun.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That's a big part of it. Thank you. And, Taylor, your older
sister Sunny played for Oklahoma, of course, and now you're at Oklahoma State.
The conversations around the dinner table have to be pretty interesting at
your house.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Not really. My sister is very proud of me and what I've
accomplished. And, yes, of course we have our battles here and there. But I've
got her in a black shirt with some orange on it so I think that's an
accomplishment in itself. My family is just happy for me and just knew that,
just knew when I went to Oklahoma State that's where I was supposed to be.
Just excited and blessed to be there.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: You talked about the impact your parents have, and the whole
story we talked about with the 0-16 to Sweet 16. Talk about the impact that
your parents have had.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: My parents went through kind of with Sunny during OU's little
shindig, whatever. My parents, they're always there for me. And my freshman
year I would sit there and cry on the phone to my mom and dad, just cry and
they were just there. And my sisters were there. And they just lifted me up
and said it's going to be okay, you're going to be okay.  
That's something that made -- made my family stronger because when those
things happened to your kids you don't want to see your kids cry.  
And whenever I have hard times I just look to them and they build me up. So
thanks Dad and Mom, love you.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Her dad is here getting this all on tape, right?  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Of course.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That's awesome. Alyssa, this summer I asked a little bit
about what have you done this summer for workouts and getting ready for the
season and what's different this year. You said you got a little ROTC action
at Missouri.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Yes, we had some of the military guys come out, put us through
a brutal workout. I've been through a lot of workouts, but it was so hard. It
was so intense, it was like seven, eight of us we were lifting logs over our
heads, curling logs, running logs down the field and back, doing rifle
pushups, everything, it was so intense.  
It was one of those things they come and you have immediate respect for them
and for what they do, because they talk about how if they fail it's death for
them. It's really intense.  
And you just can't go through something like that with your team and not come
back, come out of it a little more together, believing in each other more,
because it's one of those things where if anybody messed up everybody paid. I
was impressed with the girls, I'm not going to lie. It's just a real good
experience for us. I felt like it brought us together.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Earni, Coach Goestenkors, obviously an assistant coach on
the Olympic team this summer, and you kind of took advantage of that
situation, didn't you?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Yeah, and I gave her a whole bag of stuff to go over there
and get signed from her team. I think everybody kind of brought boxes when
they knew she was going over to Beijing. But she brought back a U.S.A. jersey
signed by the team, and that's just really cool for me.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: And did you get a chance with the team to watch any of the
games on TV or were you able to stay in tune with what was happening over in
Beijing?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Coach G was texting us back and forth about when the games
were, and they were on so early you tried to break your sleep and get up. But
I made some games, then fell asleep after the games.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Jhasmin, you have two Hall of Fame coaches on your bench
with Leon Barmore joining the staff. How has that been? I know you've only had
a few on-court practices, but what's it been like having both Kim Mulkey and
Leon Barmore?  
JHASMIN PLAYER: They're exactly like. Coach Mulkey is the spitting image of
Barmore, but it's like Alyssa said with -- but not that extreme. But when
coach Barmore walks in the gym and says a word, you have immediate respect of
his knowledge of the game. You know he knows so much. He taught our head
coach, and for us to have a practice and be taught by two legends of the game
you have no choice but to try to soak as much in as you possibly can.  
The first day he came to practice, he's a real quiet guy. The first word he
said -- you can hear everyone. You could have heard a pin drop. Everyone
wanted to hear what he had to say so badly. Coach Mulkey is at a point where
she knows how to push our buttons, she does it all the time. But Coach Barmore
hasn't started yet. When he does it, it's going to be tough.  
But right now it's just a lot of learning and learning as much from him as you
possibly can. You can see Coach Mulkey still trying to learn as much from him
as she possibly can. It's a great learning experience. A blessing, because I
don't know too many schools in the country that can say they have two Hall of
Fame legend coaches coaching and so it's really a blessing.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: There are only two other schools in the country, Tennessee
and Rutgers, that have two Hall of Famers.  
Amanda, you want to be an elementary teacher, but some of those activities
might interfere with practice time over the next few weeks. Can you tell
everybody what's going to be happening with you.  
AMANDA NISLEIT: Starting on next week, Monday and Wednesday I get to observe
and teach a kindergarten class. So in the fall I'll be doing kindergarten and
then in the spring I'll be doing fourth through sixth. And in the spring it
will be around tournament time, hopefully, post-season tournament.  
And then so I talked to Coach Fennelly and I told him on the way here, it's
like, by the way, I don't know -- I have to be at school from 8:15 to 3:45,
but of course his first reaction was don't worry about it, school comes first.
He's been good about being a student and then an athlete. We have some things
worked out where I can come after and figure out what I've missed.  
I'm really excited to get into the classroom. This is the first time I'm going
to be in the classroom to observe the students and start teaching. I'm excited
to get going with that.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Sade, your freshman, Angel Goodrich, highly touted freshman,
just tore her ACL this weekend. I know that's fresh in everybody's mind. How
is the team handling that right now?  
SADE MORRIS: We all feel bad for her but we can't feel bad for ourselves.
We've just got to get over the hump and we just have to have certain people
step up. We have to improve our game. Yeah, she's going to be missed but I
think we're experienced enough that we'll be able to move on without her. I
know she's still going to be great for us in the coming years.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: And we just see it too often. There's just way too many and
my heart goes out to all of you whenever that happens and your teammates and
so forth, but the way you pull together is just very impressive.  
Taylor, you didn't get a chance to talk about your other sister. You have a
very basketball-minded family. And Lacey played at the college level. I know
you have the OU/OSU thing, but talk about Lacey's impact.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: My middle sister, Lacey, she is 18 months older than me.
People get us confused. It's funny. The fans in the middle of the game think
I'm in the bathroom: Oh, you're playing great, you're playing great. My sister
looks at them like, what are you guys talking about? She's like, oh, you think
I'm Taylor. So we'll probably get a shirt made that says, yes, I'm Taylor's
sister or I'm not Taylor or something.  
But she played at Southeastern in Durant and she's a phenomenal woman. She
keeps me strong and she's kind of my angel, she's my girly girl, teaches me
how to dress and how I need to be and she actually got engaged this summer. So
we're working on that.  
But just love her to death. And she also had a big impact on me. She's pushed
me and we played together in high school. So it's awesome to play with your
sister in high school. And she definitely helped me be the player I am today.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Alyssa, when I asked what's a question you never get asked
that you really wish someone would ask, it's what have you learned from the
players that have gone before you or that have graduated from Missouri.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Something about being on a college team, coming in as a
freshman you have a lot of older girls that take you under their wing. I
learned a lot from LaToya Bond, obviously she's in the WNBA now, a lot about
footwork in general, Christelle N'Garsanet was a senior my freshman year. She
was so sweet to me. She taught me what it meant to a freshman, being nice and
just being open to them.  
Carlynn Savant, I don't know when she graduated but she was just so positive.
I can go down the list, and I'll do one more. EeTisha Riddle. I'll never
forget the look in her face. She could turn on the defense and be so hungry
and I learned the intensity at which we need to be playing at and how intense
it gets and where I need to be in order to be competitive and to win games. So
I learned a lot from a lot of people since I've been at Mizzou.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Earni, you told me off the court you're just a big kid. You
like to go out and -- tell some of the people what you like to do when you're
not playing basketball.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: When I'm not studying or playing basketball, I relax at
home, watch a lot of NetFlix, don't really watch cable, bunch of movies and
series. I'm a big kid. You might see me at Chuck E. Cheese by myself putting
coins in the games and stuff.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Laser tag?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Yes, laser tag.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Putt-putt, a little bit of everything. That's good.  
You can see not only are all these young women tremendous athletes and great
competitors on the basketball court, they're incredibly articulate,
intelligent, smart, and we're so glad to have this opportunity to get to know
you a little bit better. Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Texas coach, Gail Goestenkors. If you
would make an opening comment or two, we'll take questions.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I was thinking back to last year when I was here, and it
was just a whirlwind for me. Feels good to have a year under my belt. And I
feel so much better this year than I did a year ago. It was a whirlwind, my
head was spinning. I didn't know what to expect.  
And so now having been through it, I think for myself and my team, we just
feel like we're so far ahead of where we were last year they understand what I
want and need. I think I understand them as well a little better and know how
to motivate them as individuals and as a team and I really understand the big
12 better. It was difficult last year preparing for 11 new teams, 11 new
coaches, and I give my staff and my team a lot of credit, because it was tough
for us.  
But I think second round, when we got a chance to play some teams for the
second time we felt a lot better, more confident and more comfortable. So
we're looking forward to this year. We lost one senior. Earnesia Bailey. We
brought on three freshman that are all going to help us.  
We're excited about this year. I think we're already ahead of where we were
last year. I know we were ahead of where we were this time last year but I
feel like we picked up where we left off at the end of last season.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. You said what you picked up at the end of last year. Picked up not what
you felt like after UCON, or did pick up a little bit of what you felt after
UCON, which is ticked off? And the second part: How would you assess your post
game going into the season?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think we are picking up where we left off last year in
that I think it really worked out very well for us. Getting into the NCAA
tournament was really necessary and huge to have that experience for these
young ladies.  
Winning our first game against Minnesota, very beneficial. We felt so good.
Okay, look how far we've come. That's how we felt. And then playing
Connecticut getting trounced by Connecticut was actually, in retrospect,
probably good for us because it also said, okay, now look how far we have to
go. And it was a tough experience for us. We never want to feel that way
again. So I think heading into the spring and the summer, it couldn't have
worked out any better for me as a coach.  
I think if we would have played Connecticut close, the players might have felt
like, and the staff might have felt like, hey, we've arrived. We have not
arrived. We have a long way to go. It's going to be a long and difficult
journey, but heading into post season, to have their attention to understand
how much harder we have to work to get to that point, I think, it was very
beneficial.  
As far as our post game, this year I think it will definitely be better. We
have all of our post players returning, which we did not have depth in the
post. That was a weakness for us last year. We still don't have great depth.
We're going to rely a lot on Ashley Lindsey as we did last year.  
But adding Ashley Gayle to the mix, she's another 6-4 post player that's
bigger, stronger than Ashley Lindsey. She's also a shot-blocker. So she adds
to our depth. I will play them at times together. And then we've got Earni
Williams who played in the post. She's undersized. But she understands what it
takes now to play in the post.  
I'm also bringing her out, letting her be a big post-up guard for us this
year. I think we'll be more versatile.  
And then Kristen Nash has improved over last season. That was her first
season. She was red shirted the season before. So she knows more what to
expect this year and she's really improved.  
Then I'm actually playing Kat Nash at the post position as well. We did that
when necessary last year. It wasn't always pretty. But now I'm beginning the
season with her, understanding she may play some minutes at the 4. So that's
going to help us as well.  
  
Q. You were one of the eight teams that went 8-0 in the first round last
year. The league was considered by pretty much everyone to be the top league
in the country. Everybody's got three or four starters back. Has the slate
gotten better from last year?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Most definitely. That's what's scary. It's good. It's
exciting. It's also scary for us coaches. We know night in night out it will
be a war. I think every team is better in this league. I think it's going to
be such an exciting year.  
You look back, the rankings preseason, they mean absolutely nothing to any of
us. If you just look back last year at the preseason rankings you can see why,
because on any given night you just don't know what's going to happen.  
So I think it's exciting for all of us as coaches and teams, because we know
when we prepare for the Big 12 we're also preparing for the NCAA tournament.
And there is not a style of play we will see in the NCAA tournament that we
haven't already seen in our league.  
  
Q. Talk a little more about Earnesia and what you'll expect out of her as
kind of a change in duties this year.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I'm excited about Earni. She does a tremendous job. She
does whatever it takes. She's my warrior. She's somebody I know I can put in
and she will compete at the very highest level day in day out. She's the one
diving for those balls, taking charges, all those little things that make a
big difference.  
She's always wanted to play on the perimeter. She's been forced to play in the
post just because of our numbers, and so this year I feel like I'm going to be
able to allow her to play out on the perimeter a little bit.  
We'll also go with a four-out motion which lets her come outside. She's going
to be just a tremendous post-up guard. She's been working on her 3-point shot,
her ball handling.  
I'm real excited. She's healthy for the first time in a long time as well.
She's been playing hurt really every year of her career. So it's really nice.
She looks -- she's in the best shape of her life. Very athletic. She looks
really good right now.  
  
Q. You talk about getting more comfortable with the Big 12 and styles of
play. Is it, I guess is that something that the second time around were you
already more comfortable or what's that been like as far as because you know
when you're in the ACC so long you could probably tell what people are going
to do in your sleep. So what's that process been like?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It was really difficult the first round. Because every game
-- not only were we preparing for 11 new teams and coaching styles and
players, but they were different styles of play. And the ACC we tended to play
similar. Similar styles of play. Very athletic. Up and down. But it was very
similar.  
The styles in the Big 12 are so different depending on who you're playing. So
it was a tremendous challenge. And then I really did feel much more
comfortable coaching the second time around. I understood much better what
teams were more likely to do, what their strengths were.  
The coaching styles and who they would go to in crunch situations, all those
little nuances that when you're in a league for a period of time and coaching
against the same teams, I didn't have to do a scouting report on Carolina,
Virginia, Maryland. I knew exactly what they were doing without breaking out a
piece of paper or watching a tape. But it was much more difficult in the Big
12. So I'm really looking forward to, again, becoming more comfortable, but
certainly the second round was much better for me and I think for my team as
well.  
  
Q. Talk about the return of Erika Arriaran and how that's going to affect
how you play this year?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I'm so excited. We're all excited about Erika's return.
She's healthy, in the best shape of her life. She looks great. She could
always shoot. She can still shoot. And that really just changes the game for
us in that it spreads the floor out and will open up driving lanes for Earni
for Brittainey other players. Also opens up Ashley Lindsey to go more one-on-
one inside.  
So we're excited to have Erika back. She's also one of the best passers I've
seen. I don't think she gets enough credit for her passing, and has a
tremendous knowledge of the game. Knows where the ball needs to be in what
situation. So she's a tremendous addition to the team.  
  
Q. How is it going to help Carla play to her strength a little bit more? And
also maybe when you need to sit her, you weren't able to do last year. Having
Erika, how does that make Carla better?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Makes our entire team better. I'll tell you last year there
was a lot of pressure on Carla because she was our only point guard. And we
moved Brittainey to the point to help her a little bit. But really Carla was
it for us.  
And now it's amazing, because when we're running practice, we've got Carla at
the point. Brittainey now feels comfortable at the point because she got that
opportunity last year. Erika feels very comfortable because she played the
point the year before.  
And then my two incoming freshmen, Ashley Fontenette and Yvonne Anderson, both
played the point as well. They're combo guards; play 1 and 2. Went from having
one legitimate point guard, now we have five that feel comfortable in that
situation, which gives me a level of comfort.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: I'm Brenda VanLengen, analyst for the Fox Sports Net, the
Big 12 Package. We're going to use this opportunity to introduce you to the
student athletes from six of the schools and get to know them a little bit
better off the court so maybe you can do some features or other stories, but
try to dig into some stories and questions you might not otherwise know about
these young women.  
But we're going to start off by having each of you introduce yourself, what
school you're from and what year you're in school. If you want to start,
Danielle.  
DANIELLE GANT: Danielle Gant from Texas A&M. I'm a senior.  
KARA RICHARDS: Kara Richards. I'm from the University of Colorado. I'm a
senior.  
DOMINIC SEALS: Dominic Seals. I'm from Texas Tech, a senior.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Dominique Kelley, I'm a sophomore from the University of
Nebraska.  
SHALEE LEHNING: I'm Shalee Lehning. I'm a senior from Kansas State University.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Danielle Robinson, University of Oklahoma. I'm a sophomore.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: We're going to start with Danielle Gant. Danielle, coming
back to Oklahoma City, went to Putnam West High School. Her mom is here in
attendance today. And then finishing off the year last year with a Sweet 16
win and playing in the Elite Eight against Tennessee and this year the Big 12
tournament is here and a regional is here. Oklahoma City is a pretty special
place to you, right, Danielle? You want to talk about that a little bit?  
DANIELLE GANT: Just last year being able to come here and play in front of my
hometown and my family and friends is a great feeling, and just being able to
come back as a senior, my last go-around, and being able to play in front of
my family and friends like I did last year is going to be a great feeling for
me.  
  
Q. Talked about what happened last year when you played in the regionals
what kind of fan support did you have, what kind of friends, what did you have
to do to get ready for the game?  
DANIELLE GANT: I had to get at least five, six tickets from each teammate.
Because I had a lot of family and friends that wanted to come to each game. So
just being able to get those tickets for my family and friends was a great
feeling.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Shalee Lehning from Kansas State, I asked all these players
what are some questions, you're all media savvy, get asked questions all the
time. What are some questions that you don't get asked that you would like to
answer sometime? And Shalee talked about wanting to discuss what's your
personal experience been like at Kansas State and what motivates you to play
the way you do.  
SHALEE LEHNING: My experience at Kansas State has been a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity. I've absolutely loved every minute of it the opportunity to play
under a coaching staff that truly believes in us and challenges us every day
has been awesome. My teammates are my best friends, so I consider it a
blessing each day to play. And I play with a passion that my savior Jesus
Christ has given me. It's just a blessing to step on the floor every day, so I
hope every time I step on the floor I give him the glory.  
So overall it's just been a wonderful experience and I'll carry these memories
with me for the rest of my life.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: I understand you were out doing a little on camera work
before this. Tell us about that.  
SHALEE LEHNING: Yes. My major is broadcast journalism, so I'm hoping someday
to be maybe in your position. But I got to go around and ask a couple of the
girls questions and Coach Gary Blair, and it was just a great experience. It
was fun to pick their brains and be on the other side of being interviewed.  
And it's not an easy task. It's not easy to come up with these questions just
off the top of your head. It's a good experience, and, yeah, I'll hopefully
have some more fun with it.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: I might turn it over to you right now. Go ahead. (Laughter).  
Kara Richards from Colorado, I asked a question to all of you about what have
you done in the off season that may be different from the past, and you said
that you've done something called the pain train in the off season. You want
to tell people about that?  
KARA RICHARDS: Yes, our strength and conditioning coach had this great idea of
having the pain train. We would do buddy carries up our football stadium
stairs, and what it would be is I would get on my partner's back and she would
carry me up the stairs. She would get on my back and I would carry her up the
stairs.  
Then we would roll down the football field and back. We would bear crawl down
the football field and back. Then we would run once around the football field
and then we would do some more buddy carries. So in all we were supposed to be
taught mental toughness, and I don't know if it happened. We'll see.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: I would hope. I think you'd get a little mentally tough.
Then being in Colorado, you have the benefit of having some very beautiful
surroundings. And you talked about that you went to Glenwood Springs for kind
of a team outing, team bonding, biking and hiking, and how did that help your
team?  
KARA RICHARDS: It was our camping trip. We were supposed to go camping but it
got way too cold way too fast we stayed in a hotel room, six to a room, which
was a lot of fun.  
We went hiking up to Hanging Lake, which is in Glenwood Springs, and then we
went on a 14-mile bike ride. And it sounds like a workout but most of it was
downhill so it was pretty easy. And along the way we would stop every so often
and have a team bonding moment, where one of the girls would share an
experience, an obstacle, something that they had to overcome.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Wanted to go on to Dominique Kelley, one of the things you
said you wished people would ask is what kind of relationship do you have with
Coach Yori on and off the court.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: On the court Coach Yori is extremely intense as I'm sure all
of our coaches are. But I think the thing to remember is that she is human and
that she's a female on top of that. And she's, for me, I have found her very
extremely personable, somebody that I can talk to about, if I'm not
understanding something in regards to basketball, but also just personal life
and somebody that I can go to for advice or just how to handle different
situations.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That seems to be a theme because Danielle Robinson said she
wanted to be asked a question about how much time do you really spend as a
student as opposed to all your time as a basketball player and athletics, and
how much time do you spend with your teammates off the court?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: With our teammates, I spend a whole bunch of time off the
court with them, as much as I do on the court. And as far as being a student,
it's crucial. All the time you spend in study hall or all the time you spend
outside of the classroom meeting with other students for tests and all that.  
I think that's -- we came to college of course to play basketball but just to
get an education, I think the time we spend off the court, not only with our
teammates, with other students, it's crucial for the college experience.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Makes an all-around team. You all are student athletes.
Dominic Seals, you talked about that as well, wishing people would ask you
more about your time away from the basketball court. So what are you like off
the court and what are some of the places that you like to travel? That was
one thing you wanted to talk about.  
DOMINIC SEALS: Some of the places I like to travel, like last year we went to
Vegas. I've never been to Vegas. People say, you've never been to the Vegas?
And I was like, no, never in my life. Not during the AAU tournament or
nothing, but I thought that was fun last year because we had a lot of team
bonding and stuff. Like in our spare time we go bowling or play laser tag or
something, or Coach Curry even jumped in one time and played with us.  
So I just think people should ask more because we like to have fun outside of
the court, too. It's not just strictly basketball. We do have a life outside
the court.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That's true. And it's hard to see that from our side
sometimes because we only see you on the court. So that's why we're having an
opportunity like this to talk about it. So thank you for sharing.  
Danielle, you talked about the fact -- Danielle Gant, you talked about the
fact that I asked who had the biggest impact on your basketball career. And
you said it's your brother Ricky, why is that?  
DANIELLE GANT: Since I've been little he's been taking me to the basketball
courts nonstop. Every time we go out and play a game he will pick me over all
the bigger guys so they gave me a lot of confidence in my game since my high
school years.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: He didn't play in college but what about his playing career
after college?  
DANIELLE GANT: Right now he's in Japan with his wife. He got married and he
moved to Japan. So he's playing with the team on base. He's playing with them
and they travel a lot. They just went to Hawaii, and he just got an award for
being one of the best players. He's going to move to Alaska, which is weird.
But he's moving to Alaska with his wife in a couple of months.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Dominic Seals, you said that the biggest impact that
somebody had on your life was a guy that told you that you'd never play
college basketball, so you wanted to prove him wrong. Who is that guy, by the
way?  
DOMINIC SEALS: I can't remember his name, but he was like "you're too pretty
to play basketball, you'll never make it in college." I was like, "really?
Okay." So I just started going to Nancy Lieberman camps and just getting
better and now that I'm playing college basketball.  
I wish I could find him so I can laugh at him.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Shalee, you talk about your mom and dad being the biggest
impact for you. Why is that?  
SHALEE LEHNING: My parents have just been so supportive. They took me all over
the country to play in every tournament imaginable. They just were a great
support system together as a team.  
My mom was definitely the caring and "you did so great" no matter what
happened, and my dad would be the one that would sit me down and say "this is
what you need to work on, these are the improvements you need to make."  
It was a great combination. But just the support that they've given me has
meant a lot because it's made basketball that much more special to me it's
become a family event for us, and, yeah, it's been a total blessing to have
those two in my life.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Kara, you talked about your mom giving you confidence. What
is it that your mom has done that's made such a big impact on your basketball
career.  
KARA RICHARDS: My mom's a single mother. And the times when I was younger she
would always be there. And I am bigger than a lot of the other kids. And I did
get picked on so I would come home and she would always be there to comfort
me. I've always remembered that.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: And, Danielle, it was actually -- Danielle on this end,
Robinson, it was actually your high school coach who saw you at a very young
age. So talk about her impact on your basketball career.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It was actually -- she tells me the story all the time
about how I was in sixth grade and I was at Arch Bishop, my high school
basketball camp, and I guess I streaked down the court and called for the ball
and took it in one dribble from half court or something like that. And she was
like "I gotta have that kid on my high school team."  
And from then on I came to play AAU ball for her and she's just been the
greatest influence in my life, besides my family. Always supportive, but she's
just so open and honest with me that I can't help love her for who she is and
what she's done for me in my life.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Her name is?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Sue Phillips.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: You still stay in contact with her?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I talk to her every day.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Dominique Kelley, you talked about several people, three
different people that have had an impact on your life. Tell us about that your
basketball career.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: If I had to pick one person out of those three people I
would probably say my high school basketball coach, Rich Olson. Because I
think he's just taught me a lot about balance. His wife has been battling Lou
Gehrig's disease for 20 years, and I think how he handles his life with her
and how he treats people and how dedicated he was to me and the rest of my
high school teammates was tremendous.  
But he also challenged me in all aspects of life, not just on the court. But
also my walk with Christ and just helping me to be a better person off the
court and just academics and just all around as a person.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Now, I'm going to ask the same question of all of you. And
let's just go down the line, start with you Danielle Gant. Something about
your coach. Just remind everybody who your head coach is that maybe no one
else knows about that coach and you'd like to share with everyone in
attendance today.  
DANIELLE GANT: My coach is Coach Gary Blair. Outside of basketball he likes to
have fun. I know in Hawaii one of our assistant coaches -- his son had a
skateboard and Coach Blair thought he would get on the skateboard and ride on
that skateboard. And instead of rolling he actually hit the ground. So instead
of just basketball he likes to have fun outside of basketball.  
KARA RICHARDS: My coach is Kathy McConnell-Miller, and I don't know if you all
know this but she's got three kids and they are great. They're hilarious. And
whenever we have team functions or anything, they're always there to lighten
the mood, especially after a loss.  
DOMINIC SEALS: My coach is Kristy Curry. Coach Curry is funny on and off the
court. She likes to cook and she likes to invite us to her house and show us
like that she can cook and that she's a loving mom and she's a loving mom to
us.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: My coach is Connie Yori, and I think she is the most laid-
back and low-maintenance person ever. But I also think she really -- she tries
to take interest in things that we think are important, whether it's shoes or
clothes or whatever, she really like -- she tries to get really involved in
that and she just takes interest in asking us questions, have you bought any
shoes lately or why would you spend that much money on a pair of shoes, just
little things like that.  
SHALEE LEHNING: My coach is Deb Patterson. She's like Coach Blair. On the
court she's really intense but off the court she's one of the most caring and
inspirational people I've ever been around. But at the same time she knows how
to have fun.  
One of my favorite memories was we were at a baseball game, just one of our K
State games. The team was there. This girl had on roller skates. She got this
idea she was going to put these roller skates on and try this. Well, she
didn't fall, but Dani and I -- Danielle Zanotti and I had to run alongside her
to keep her from falling. It's neat to see how willing she is to try new
things and she's as competitive as they come. So it's been fun.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: My coach is Sherri Coale. I think she still thinks she's
playing college basketball. Last year we had like a throw-back day and we were
all dressed in like high school gear and short shorts and that kind of thing
for practice.  
And all of a sudden we see this figure run down the stairs into our practice
gym, and she has on her Oklahoma Christian college uniform, like tight and
short and just like little things like that. She was going around the gym like
breaking us down. I still got it, I got it.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That's impressive that she still fits in her college
uniform. I'm not even going there. All right. What about somebody -- I'm kind
of going off the script here. I didn't ask you these questions ahead of time
so I'm asking you to think on your feet a little bit. Somebody on your team
that people get to see on TV playing, they get to see as a player, they know
their name, but something about that person that others may not know anything
about. Can we start on your end Danielle, have you got one?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Nyeshia Stevenson. She can dance and sing great. A lot of
people don't know that about her, but she's just really outgoing, and you can
probably see it on the court how passionate she is. But off the court she's
one of the funniest people besides Rose Hammond on our team. But, yeah, she
can dance and sing real well.  
SHALEE LEHNING: My teammate Marlies Gipson appears to be very quiet and shy,
but she's one of those people once you get to know her she's absolutely
hilarious, kind of like her friend. But she's willing to try anything and
we've had some pretty funny memories when we've gone fishing.  
And nobody even believes this story but we went fishing last summer. We caught
the biggest fish we've seen ever. Nobody believes us. It got away, broke the
line. But it did happen. Marlies is one of those people on the court you think
she's intense and fiery but she's pretty outgoing and fun.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: My teammate Jessica Periago, sophomore from Toulon, France,
but English is not her first language but she is the best tutor in the world
in any subject. She will attempt to help you and she's really great at math.  
DOMINIC SEALS: My teammate would be Alana Rumph. On the court she's like very
fast paced and like nobody wants her to guard them, she's so quick, but off
the court she's so motherly to us. We go and be like "I'm going to get that
sweet tea" or something, "no, you need to drink water." You know, she's so
motherly like, so I appreciate her.  
KARA RICHARDS: I'd have to say Bianca Smith is probably one of the funniest
people I've ever met. You can name one movie and she can quote the whole movie
for you. And she's really intense on the court and then you know her off the
court and she's so laid back.  
DANIELLE GANT: I'm going to have to say Sydney Colson. Sydney on the court, as
you know, she plays very well, but off the court I think she's actually crazy.
I think she actually would jump in front of a car and start dancing out of
nowhere. Would probably go up to anyone, start singing to them even if she
doesn't know them. I think Sydney Colson.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Shalee, you get your chance here, if you have something to
ask of one of your fellow panelists here? Anybody that you play a lot or not
very much that you want to ask them something?  
SHALEE LEHNING: I had this question asked me the other day. I thought it was
pretty cool.  
If you had like a song -- anybody can step up and answer this. If you had a
song that would describe your life, what would it be? When I had it asked, I
was like, whoa, there's so many songs. But, Danielle, do you have a song off
the top of your head that you would want to describe your life?  
DANIELLE GANT: Kanye West, Welcome to the Good Life. Because since my high
school I've had a great life. That song represents my whole entire life.  
KARA RICHARDS: I'm going to go with Jimi Hendrix, Foxy Lady. (Laughter).  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Sexy Back by Justin Timberlake.  
SHALEE LEHNING: Mine would be Legacy by Nichole Nordeman.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Mine would probably be a song called Be Blessed by Yolanda
Adams.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Very nice. Well, again, as with this morning's panel, we
found out that not only are these young women very talented on the basketball
court but very articulate and well spoken off the court. We want to thank you
very much for your time. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We have Coach Fennelly and we'll have him make an opening
comment.  
COACH FENNELLY: Good morning. I want to thank everyone for being here.
Certainly appreciate the time and effort and energy you give to our student
athletes and our programs.  
There's no way we can continue to grow this league and continue to make it the
best league in the country without your support and your interest. And all the
kids that we coach sincerely appreciate, love seeing their names in the paper
and stories written about them and the coverage we get and we do thank you for
that.  
And we're excited like everyone else to start. This is a great time of year
with football getting going and the baseball and college basketball, all the
teams are excited to start practice.  
We've practiced five times. Like everyone else, we're not as good as we need
to be but we're still undefeated and excited to see what this team can do. So
thanks again for being here this morning. Look forward to talking with you.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. In reference to your funny statement a few minutes ago, in this league,
Kim Mulkey could get elected mayor of Waco and Sherri Coale could get elected
governor and Gail Goestenkors has her own clothing line. You guys are becoming
celebrities. But is that a good thing or a bad thing that women coaches are
becoming the rock stars that men coaches have been for a while?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think it's fantastic. It's taken too long. I think the names
that you mentioned, as well a number of others, are people that are extremely
committed to what they do. They're very good at it. And they're very good at
doing more than just coaching basketball. They've impacted their communities.
They've impacted our sport.  
And they've made a name for themselves in a national basis that's nothing but
positive. So I certainly think that the people that you mentioned and some of
the coaches that have left our league, like Marsha Sharp and Jody Conradt and
Marian Washington and Ceal Barry -- there's a lot of great people that have
done a lot of great things. And it's taken a lot of effort and time for those
coaches to get where they are and they certainly deserve all the attention
they get.  
  
Q. Even though you guys are returning everybody, shuffling the lineup
around, can you talk about the importance of getting the kids to buy into the
new roles and getting them to know them?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think it's the number one thing with our team. We have a lot
of returning players. Everyone's returning, and we added four freshmen.  
And the challenge for our team is to accept their roles as far as maybe less
minutes. Maybe new positions, new things that we ask them to do. And that's
the job of the coaches, to convince them that if they do that, we have a
better chance to be successful in the best league in the country.  
And, yeah, there's some gambles involved with it. But that's what we have to
do. So I like the mind-set of our team in the sense of I think they understand
it. But at the same time we have to be able to do that daily and understand
that from five seniors to four freshmen and in between, sooner or later every
coach talks about the team first.  
And this is going to be the greatest example of my time at Iowa State where if
we have all of our players put the team first, we'll be very good. If we
don't, then we're not going to do the things that we could do, and that
ultimately is my responsibility.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you have an almost an embarrassment of riches in the
post game, now maybe more than one post, talking about Wieben and Ross back,
but also you have a couple of high-profile nonconference games in the Pac-10
predicted champ and Stanford in the SEC predicted champ in Vanderbilt, could
you talk about those things?  
COACH FENNELLY: We have six post players on our roster, and we've never had
six post players. And I think all six of them can contribute. I think all six
bring something unique to our team. So certainly depth in that area has been
something that we've never had and could have used in the past in this league.  
When you look at the post players that we have to play against. So I really
like that group. I like how hard they've worked.  
We have some size with Joc and Nicky. We have some athleticism and we have
some experience. We brought Amanda with us today. If every coach got to coach
Amanda Nisleit they'd never quit and that's the kind of person that never gets
enough credit on our team and is someone that will impact our team directly
and allows me to come to work smiling every day.  
And as far as our nonconference schedule goes, it's by far the toughest one
we've ever played. Like you said, we played Stanford, who was pretty good, and
Vanderbilt, like you said. That's a home game for us. We'll be excited. We'll
play Iowa, we'll be picked to win the Big Ten and as well as San Diego State
got picked second in the Mountain West, a great basketball league.  
Our team will be challenged and I think, as I mentioned a second ago, someone
said where do you want to be when the conference season starts. I said my
answer was I hope we're still alive for a post season tournament. With that
schedule, you could put yourself in a really bad position coming into the Big
12 feeling like you had to win 10, 11 games to be in the NCAA tournament.  
So I think the challenge is use those games to make us better for the Big 12
but you better win some of them. And I hope that we can do our part as so many
other teams have done in the Big 12 to win some of those games because that's
what the national media -- everyone compares. How do you do against the other
conferences, and that's important to us. And certainly we have an opportunity
to do that with our schedule and we certainly want to do our part.  
  
Q. When you have everyone back from a very good team, people just assume
that everything's going to be there, the chemistry and everything. And it's
not just a flip the switch. Where as a coach do you get a feel it might be
working, and if not what do you do to try to change that?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's a great question. That's exactly right. There is no
flip of a switch. Every year you start over. We add four new players who have
never been through at Iowa State before. You bring back Toccara Ross and Nicky
Wieben who were -- have been on the team but didn't play on this team last
year.  
And so I think it's something that I've talked to them about more than any
team I've ever talked to about. It's the ultimate sacrifice of what do you
want to do for your teammates and give up minutes and maybe accept new roles
and whether or not they can do that we'll see.  
And I think you find out in practice early, to be honest with you -- to be
honest with you, the first three days of practice was fantastic. Monday was
absolutely a joke and terrible. And yesterday we started out just as bad as
Monday. And it was not a really pretty sight.  
But I think to answer your question a little bit, I think I've learned a lot
about our team because the second half of practice was as good as we've ever
practiced. They did that internally and managed to change the course of
practice, which means they have it inside of them.  
They're starting to understand. So that was a good sign to me. I've never been
more impressed with a practice in my time at Iowa State than I was yesterday,
because it went from that bad to that good in the same day.  
And you don't see that very often unless you have a team that's somewhat
talented and somewhat has an ability to figure out the moment. And we'll see.
I think specifically we'll see -- if we start out 1-4 which could happen, or
you're 2-5 and people are writing bad things and saying bad things, then
you'll find out for sure.  
But hopefully we can get to the point where we're getting better and getting
to the point where our team understands what it means to play and what it
means to play at Iowa State and what it means to play in front of our fans.
That's something we talk about every day.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about this league in terms of -- I mean, you've
got a team picked first that gets seven first place votes but there are three
other, four other teams that got votes. Texas A &M goes to the Elite Eight,
they're fifth. Can you talk about the strength of the league?  
COACH FENNELLY: The biggest thing is exactly what you just said. I've been
coaching a long time, I don't think I've ever seen a preseason poll where five
teams got a vote for first place. And they're five very different teams.  
So I think we have a lot of really good teams in our league. We have a lot of
great coaches. We have probably I think 80 percent of the best players coming
back from last year's all-conference and if you look through all the stats we
have a league that went 8-0 in the first round of the NCAA tournament.  
Everything you can measure quantitatively our league is as good as anyone.
From attendance to post season play to hall of fame coaches to All-American
players. You look at every preseason top 25 poll in the country, there's six,
seven teams in our league being mentioned, if not at the top. And I think it's
a year where we arguably have teams, if they stay healthy, get hot, have a
legitimate chance to be a national championship kind of contender.  
You put all that stuff together, I think it means you have a really good
conference that has a chance to impact the sport on a national basis, and
that's what I think our league has done in the past, but certainly we have a
chance to do something more unique this year.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Coach Curry from Texas Tech University.
Welcome, and your comments.  
COACH CURRY: We're excited. We have obviously a little bit different look in
our eye as far as experience. They know how to get from point A to point B on
and off the floor a little better and that's kind of nice to see.  
I don't really talk that much. Did I follow Gary Blair. No, that was Kathy.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this being your third year in the Big 12 and your
experience in the Big Ten, what you've learned from being in both conferences
and the differences in the leagues top to bottom?  
COACH CURRY: Wow, you know, it's definitely been a blessing to experience two
leagues. Women's basketball is a priority. Big Ten does a great job and Big 12
does. As far as the leagues, it's totally different. From being the Big 12
South, Big 12 North, puts a different spin on it. Not playing everybody twice.  
I think the biggest thing is the depth of the league. And I think obviously I
came into the Big 12 where the parity from top to bottom is probably at its
highest level it's ever been at. So certainly the Big 12 South night in, night
out is quite the challenge, along with the North.  
And so it has a totally different feel than the Big Ten as far as the depth
and talent and how good the league is. Not that the Big Ten isn't. I don't
mean that in any way but night in, night out, there's no day off. There's no
night off. There's no time to take a deep breath.  
And so I also see a different type of player, the Big 12 is so athletic,
transition game. The Big Ten is a little bit more big, corn- fed, a little
more as far as half court.  
So it's been a great experience because I have -- I feel like I've grown as a
coach. It's been a different challenge. It's been a challenge I've really
embraced and one that I knew coming in would be. So it's been great for me
because I've had to learn to be a little better in a little few different ways
than I have before. So it's been good.  
  
Q. Last year there were just times when you were just trying to find five
people who could play well together at the same time. You might have one here,
one there. Is that maybe something you're going to see more of this year? And
also in terms of your 3-point shooting do you feel that could be more
effective this year?  
COACH CURRY: Without question. Again, much more seasoned. The off season, the
commitment they made has been tremendous. Maria Moore's probably dropped eight
pounds. Obviously not just our 3-point shooting but when you see our team, I
mean, we've got to have that third and fourth player in double figures night
in, night out. We have to have a more well-rounded production from everyone.  
And I think at the top of our list, though, is prizing each possession and
taking care of the basketball. We're six or eight possessions away from being
one of the eight teams in the NCAA tournament.  
So it's a matter of taking better care of the basketball and finding ways when
things break down to make plays. And that's going to have to come from more
than just Dominic Seals for us to be successful.  
  
Q. You talked about your third year, the difference adjusting to the style
of play. Has it been tougher than you might have expected it to be?  
COACH CURRY: I think I knew coming in that we didn't inherit much. Coach Sharp
was pretty honest with me about that. I think the toughness of the situation,
I don't really think I realized how deep the league was from top to bottom,
from one through 12. So I probably thought one through eight but I'm not sure
I thought about nine, 10, 11, 12 night in, night out. Each night's a
challenge. There's no given wins. There's nothing that you circle on your
schedule, not that I ever really did before because I've always respected
everyone.  
So the challenge of the situation is one that I knew and I've embraced it. I
absolutely love it. As crazy as that may sound, I love getting up every day
and trying to get this done and we're going to continue to.  
So I don't think it was -- I think also, too, when you look at the league, I
realized that it was a different land. Things were different than maybe it was
when Coach Blair came in or Coach Budke came in. I knew we were coming in
probably as the sixth team in the Big 12 South and I knew everybody had
everybody coming back for a couple of years so how quick could we work our
magic. I wasn't sure but I know we're working relentlessly every day and I can
tell you that we're getting better.  
We're better than we were two years ago. We were better than we were a year
ago and that's all you can try to do is get better with each day, and we're
doing that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your incoming class and who you see you can get the
most production out of this season?  
COACH CURRY: I think it's too early to really answer that question. But I love
what they're doing so far. Kierra Mallard is a 6'-3" post player that really
can make us better. She's gonna see some time if she continues to work at it.
Obviously it's earned.  
I think one of the big questions folks had about her coming out of high school
was the pace, can she adjust to the pace. She's very talented, but does she
understand the pace. And she has adjusted Kristy Curry style really quick and
I'm proud of her for that.  
I think Jordan Barncastle, being a coach's kid and blue-collar and hard-nosed
and just an old country girl, she fits in so well in what we're about out
there and she's going to contribute.  
Both of those kids are 6'-2", 6'-3" and are versatile. They'll help us inside.
And Timilia Martin, a point guard that was Player of the Year in the East
Texas is going to help us as far as giving us a solid back-up, a chance to
learn a year from Maria, we're about to sign a freshman 1 that we're thrilled
about. It's a great situation to have T. Martin place to help and work with
Maria and learn and grow.  
And I'm concerned, we may end up red shirting Linda Kimbro. So we'll see what
happens with that. Her knee after she committed to us she tore an ACL and
retore her ACL her senior year. We're kind of having to take that slow. We're
not sure where she's going to fall here. But three or four can really help us
early and contribute and that gives us more depth and weapons and makes
practices more competitive. And nothing's a given. You've got to earn it. So
that's really helpful.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Coale has joined us from Oklahoma. We welcome you, and if
you'd like to make an opening comment or two before the questions.  
COACH COALE: I'm excited to be here. Thrilled to death that the Big 12
tournament will be in Oklahoma City again. We had such a phenomenal experience
here the year before last, and I guess it's easy for me to say since we got to
cut the net down.  
But I think every team that participated in it had a phenomenal experience
because of the way that the people of the city embraced the women's basketball
tournament. So I love the fact that the two venues are side by side and fans
can participate in both men's and women's tournaments and particularly excited
about our men's opportunity this upcoming season, their ranking and what they
might be able to do. So it's nice to have them right here in the same city for
the conference tournament. And I'll open it up for questions.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Talked to Gail earlier about when you have those special player or
players that are more to you than just a player; that it's tough sometimes
their senior year to keep that balance of the bittersweet and pursuing your
goal. Can you kind of talk about that. She had that with Alena Beard, having
that with Courtney and Ashley.  
COACH COALE: Well, if you do the thing right and if you recruit in the right
way and develop kids and they commit to the program and are immersed in your
mission not just as a program but as a university, that situation presents
itself with regularity. And I don't necessarily differentiate between one year
and another.  
I just think when kids have been in your program, particularly for four years,
certainly not to discount a junior college experience, because Rosalind Ross
came in and played two years for us, as did Jamie Talbert, and it was just s
tough to see them go as it was Stacey Dales or Dionna Jackson who had been
here for four years.  
But I think when you go through the development process with kids and watch
them grow and become, it's always a little bit difficult to let them go.  
  
Q. Pat Summitt and Geno have been sort of celebrity coaches for a long time,
but now you and Kim and Goestenkors have sort of reached that status, too. Is
that good for women's basketball?  
COACH COALE: I suppose if your question is having a multiple number of pseudo
superstars, I just can't even say that with a straight face. I'm from, Hilton,
Oklahoma, for heavens sakes. I think having a lot of recognizable faces in the
sport of women's basketball is great for the growth of our game.  
I think that there was a time, particularly when I was playing college
basketball in which Pat Summitt and Jody Conradt were the only two faces you
would recognize as Division I women's basketball coaches. So I think there are
lots of faces that flash across ESPN these days and readily unite the mind
with the sport of women's basketball.  
I think that's nothing but positive for our game.  
  
Q. I know high expectations are nothing new, but without cussing, what was
your reaction to SLAM Magazine picking you No. 1?  
COACH COALE: John, you would be the one that would need to stop cussing, not
me. (Laughter).  
Actually Coach Capel, Jeff, sent me a text message and said, where are you?
And I said DFW airport. And he said go to a newsstand.  
I said, why? Terrified, why? What's happened now? And he said go buy SLAM. I
said no because I knew what he was going to say when he said that. I went and
looked at it. I didn't buy it, put it back on the shelf. One of those things
where you go it's neat that there are so many teams now that can be
considered.  
I still think there's a handful, but there was a time when who's it going to
be, Tennessee or Connecticut, which one will be No. 1. Now if you look,
depending on however many polls are out there, there's a lot of different No.
1s and a lot of different 1 through 10s even. So it kind of gets spread around
a little bit. And I think it's an honor.  
We count it as a tremendous compliment, we're flattered by it, but at the end
of the day it doesn't really mean anything at all except we got in SLAM
Magazine, now we've got to go play and prove it.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea what your starting five looks like yet or does it
matter yet?  
COACH COALE: No, it doesn't really matter to me. You've covered me long enough
to know that's the answer I'm going to give you. We've got five days of
practice and they've been really, really good and I said a number of times the
air in the gym has been really good. It's been clean and clear and we've had
people working and learning.  
I think our freshmen have moved along really rapidly. And part of that is
because they were prepared and part of that is because our upperclassmen have
helped them be successful in the first five days.  
So I've just been really pleased with it and I think we have -- depth could be
-- and I want to emphasize "could be," because it depends on the continual
development -- but depth could be a strong suit for us. I think we could go a
couple deep in most positions and not lose much.  
It's hard when you look at it to say where is the line. These are the guys who
really get it and these guys have got a ways to go. It's hard to put a line in
there, and I think this early that's probably a pretty good sign.  
  
Q. Maybe as impressive as being picked No. 1 in the nation is being picked
No. 1 in this conference. Several coaches mentioned earlier today they've
never heard of a preseason poll where five of the league teams received first
place votes.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, it's crazy. You look at what this league has done last
year, eight teams winning in the first round of the NCAA tournament. I think
11 of 12 went to post-season play.  
What we do, obviously, in terms of attendance and what we've done for nine
consecutive seasons leading the country in attendance, this league is big-time
women's basketball. And what I think makes us so unique is the fact that every
year it's someone different.  
And even though it's not really important who is picked to win it at the
beginning, as the season goes through there might be three or four or five
different teams who are on the top spot for a little bit. And it comes down to
that last week.  
I can't remember the last time, I guess perhaps when we ran the table Courtney
and Ashley's freshman year, the last time that you kind of knew going into the
last week of the season who was going to win the league championship. The rest
of the time it goes down to the very last game that determines who the winner
is.  
So I think it does a couple of things for us in terms of post-season play. I
think you're prepared, if you're not worn out and beaten up, you're prepared
for what happens in the NCAA tournament. But you're not only prepared in that
you've been challenged, you've been challenged in a number of different ways
because teams in this league don't all play the same.  
We have some transition teams. We have some zone teams. We have some physical
man-to-man teams. You see a lot of different types of basketball and it only
bodes well for your opportunities in post-season.  
  
Q. Now that you've had time to reflect back on the end of last year, and
with the losses that you had toward the end of regular season in post-season
play, now that you've had time to reflect on that, what have you been able to
assess and learn from that and take into this season?  
COACH COALE: You know, I didn't learn anything new after a summer of
reflection that I didn't know when I was sitting there watching us lose to
Missouri and Kansas City last year.  
Our whole is not greater than the sum of our parts, period. We have to be
better together. We talk about that with teams all the time. You talk about
that with your team. It's not enough just to be talented, it's not enough just
to be just good players; you got to figure out a way to be great together.
It's that all just sounds like gibberish until you live through it.  
And the reality of our crumble in February last year was just that, that we
weren't real good together. And even though we had some fantastic parts, we
just weren't good enough together. And that's what team sports are all about.  
So we learned that lesson on our feet. We lived it. And it was obvious and our
players made an immediate and apparent commitment to try to get it right.  
And I think our play in the NCAA tournament was a reflection of that. We just
didn't have enough game experience in terms of really believing in one another
and being solidified together to be able to survive a really hot Notre Dame
team, but we played a lot better in the tournament than we did in the final
weeks and months of the season.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Whitney Hand and what she's going to bring to
this program.  
COACH COALE: Well, Whitney obviously has everyone's attention, preseason pick
for rookie of the year in our league. Just an uncanny shooter. Maybe the most
prepared player we've ever had in our program at the University of Oklahoma in
terms of coming in ready to make an impact.  
Some kids might come in, might have the intellect for it, but their bodies
aren't physically prepared for the rigors of physical play in this league and
at this level, or some come in and their bodies may be ready but their
basketball IQ is not. Sometimes they're very athletic but their skill is not
polished.  
So there's often some area of the game that keeps them from being really
prepared to make an immediate impact, and that's not the case with Whitney.
She's really sharp. She understands the game. She learns quickly. She's a big,
strong girl. She's capable of holding her own. She's in fantastic physical
condition. And her skill set is something that's truly special.  
So I think the league is in for a treat in watching Whitney Hand compete for
four years. Bill Fennelly and Gail and those guys might disagree, they might
not think it's a treat. But special kid.  
But I think our league has had a history of those. When you think about kids
came through K-State and Iowa State and Sophia Young at Baylor, go down the
list of some remarkably talented kids that we all got an opportunity to
witness playing special careers here in this conference. And I think Whitney
is in that vein.  
  
Q. There seems to be some surprise from Gail Goestenkors and other coaches
maybe that Texas was picked second after finishing seventh. Is there something
about that team that you've noticed that would lead you to believe that?  
COACH COALE: They kept getting better. The deeper the season went, the better
they got. That was the number one indicator. Plus, they're pretty talented if
you look down the roster. They have size. They have speed. They have skilled
positions. They have depth, their young guys are good.  
It was Gail's first season. The longer they played for her, the more they
played like her, the way she wanted them to play. And I think that will only
increase after having been with them in an off-season and starting this year.  
So I think everybody understands the talent level and the room for improvement
that those guys have together.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We'd like to welcome Kurt Budke from Oklahoma State University.
You all know Kurt. Kurt, welcome to the Big 12 Media Days. Opening comment,
and we'll take questions.  
COACH BUDKE: Great to be back. Hard to believe we're here already. Seems like
I just saw y'all just a little bit ago.  
But the girls are excited to be practicing. I think every team gets to a point
where they're tired of scrimmaging without the coaches in there and tired of
beating on each other and they're ready to start focusing.  
And obviously on our campus right now, with our football team doing what
they're doing, the excitement on the campus, I think every team on the campus
wants to be practicing and wants to be playing.  
And that's us. We lost two big pieces to the puzzle last year in Danielle
Green and Maria Cordero, two seniors that graduated that were a big part of
our team, our Sweet 16 run last year. Big part of our chemistry.  
We do have some questions. People ask me how do I feel about being picked
sixth in the league. I said being picked sixth in the number one league in the
country isn't all that bad, especially when we don't have everybody back. So I
think that's fair. We still are the best league top to bottom in this country
and nothing is going to change with that.  
We're excited. We have some good players back. We have one of the best players
in the conference back in Andrea Riley, who, trust me, didn't get worse over
the summer. She's still a pretty good player. Taylor Hardeman and Shaunte'
Smith are with me here today, two great stories because two kids who went from
0-16 to Sweet 16 and both playing extremely well right now.  
Practice is going real well and we're excited to get going with some games.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Women's basketball, Geno and Pat Summitt have sort of been superstar
coaches. But seems like more and more you coaches are becoming celebrities and
the face of your sport. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  
COACH BUDKE: I just want to stay a celebrity with my family. And that's all
that really matters to me. I'll let Geno and Pat and other people carry that
for us.  
You know, there is more attention to our sport right now, there's no question.
Television's had a lot to do with that.  
You know, it is nice going around my first year in Stillwater, go to the
store, nobody knows who you were, and now you go to the store and people are
suggesting plays to you. It is a little bit different now.  
It's good for our sport. Our sport is continuing to grow.  
  
Q. Talk about Andrea Riley, her impact on this program for you?  
COACH BUDKE: What was the last part of that?  
  
Q. The impact she's had on your program?  
COACH BUDKE: Obviously Andrea is a program-changer. There's not a lot of those
people out there. We were lucky to get her. We didn't think we were going to
get her. She called us on the night before signing day and told us she changed
her mind and wanted to come with us.  
So obviously that was a pretty good call that night. She is just someone
that's continuing to grow every year that she's been with the program. She has
shown more maturity, again, by far this year than she did her freshman and
sophomore year.  
She's being more of a leader. She's working harder every day. She's someone
that, again, she didn't get worse over the summer. This kid is going to have a
special year again.  
She had a special year last year, and they all got a taste of it again last
year of getting to the Sweet 16. And we felt obviously LSU was a great team.
LSU probably should have won the national championship last year. So when you
get beat by somebody like that, then you really think, okay, we probably did
go as far as we could have went.  
But we sure would have liked to play that game in Oklahoma City, too. But
Andrea, obviously, is one of the top 10 players in this country, maybe one of
the top 5 players in this country.  
  
Q. What are you going to need out of Andrea leadership-wise?  
COACH BUDKE: I think just continuing to grow with her maturity. We had some
moments last year. You all know this, that she let her emotions get involved
just a little bit too much. She's a heck of a competitor, and that's one thing
we definitely do love about her. But as a leader she's got to get that under
control better than she has in the past.  
She's shown that already this year in our preseason workouts and our summer
workouts. She's shown that kind of leadership way more than she has in the
past. So I expect that to carry over on the floor in big games, too.  
  
Q. You alluded to the fact that even though you guys were picked sixth this
league is pretty tough. Can you talk more about that and what do you think
it's going to come down to this year?  
COACH BUDKE: I think this is one year also -- I think OU was picked first,
right? I don't think anybody in here is totally convinced they're going to
win. I think that's how equal it is. I think there's probably -- how do you
pick A&M fifth? They've got two of the top players in this conference back,
won the Big 12 conference or tournament last year.  
I think there's easily five or six teams that can be in the mix this year, and
there is nobody -- I guess you gotta pick someone 11 and 12. But I promise
you, there's nobody that wants to go play 11 and 12 on their home floor
either.  
So it's just -- we won all eight games in the first round last year and I
don't expect anything different this year. I think it's a great conference.  
  
Q. Following up on that question, last year the league was considered
probably the top league in the country. This year everybody's got at least
three starters back. Is it safe to say maybe this league has even gotten
better than last year?  
COACH BUDKE: I think that is safe to say. Again, I go back to what I said a
second ago. You pick Texas A&M fifth, there's no way. I mean this league, top
to bottom, is as strong -- is stronger than any conference in the nation, and
I do think we are better. I think if you look at those teams that were picked
at the top, they basically have everybody back off the teams they had last
year.  
So they should have been picked as the favorites. It's exciting. And that's
what we tell recruits as we go across the country. Come play in a league where
you don't have a night off. Come play in a league where you get better every
night. That's what the Big 12 is.  
  
Q. Last year you guys really ratcheted up the Bedlam rivalry with the
quality of those two games, the crowd support. Can you talk about this year
with the tournament in Oklahoma City, a regional in Oklahoma City and you guys
in Oklahoma, just how -- what the rivalry is like and how important that is as
a step forward for women's basketball in this state?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, we had to finally do our part in the rivalry, in the
Bedlam. We had to do our part. Oklahoma has been there. They've been on top.
And we had to carry our end of it.  
And we did it last year and our fans did it last year. Our fans were
challenged to show up to that game and as we saw that out it was one of the
most electric atmospheres I've ever been a part of, and you'll have people
that have been going to Gallagher Iba for 30 or 40 years say that was the most
exciting night they've ever been at at Oklahoma State University.  
So now that we're carrying our end we expect that rivalry to be sold out at
both ends for years to come.  
  
Q. You arrived at OSU a couple years ago. You guys coming off of some bad
years. You really had to struggle to get anybody to pay attention to you guys
to come in for recruiting. How different is it now when you guys go out on the
recruiting trail, national TV appearances that you've had and the success that
you've had?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, obviously TV does change everything. When they get to
watching the in state tournament and Sweet 16 whether you win or lose you're
there. We're one of the two teams in the Big 12 still playing at the Sweet 16
level.  
So it doesn't finish the deal. But it does get you in more doors. People do
know as you go across the country, okay, we did see you on TV. We did see you
play in the Big 12 championship and the tournament.  
So it gets you in there but it doesn't finish it. But at least you're there.  
  
Q. Talk about losing Maria and Danielle and what you guys are going to have
to do to replace them.  
COACH BUDKE: I thought one of our biggest things last year was our chemistry.
And when you've got a sophomore averaging 20-plus a game you've got other
people that have to accept their roles. It's hard sometimes on seniors to
accept the roles when a sophomore is averaging 20.  
And I thought Danielle and Maria were very key in that. They just went -- it
was their night to get their 10 or 20, they did it. When it wasn't their night
they got their numbers, they played defense. They had great attitudes, and
that's going to be a huge key to this team again this year. Can we get the
chemistry level back to where it was, can we have some young kids.  
You know, when you establish a program now, at some point in time the young
kids have to come up when it's their turn. A Kristin Hernandez has to step up,
new girls like a Tegan Cunningham, Kelsey Hatcher have to step in and play
right away.  
We need a Megan Byford. Megan Byford came on big at the end last year, had her
best games by far when we got to NCAA tournament time. Megan has got to step
in and Shyvon Spears has to step in. That's where your program is either
getting better or not. Can your young kids come up and play when it's their
time. They paid their dues and set on the bench and it's their time to play.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 22, 2008

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Blair is now joining us at the head table. We'll let you
make an opening statement, but if it goes more than three minutes I have to
cut you off (laughter).  
COACH BLAIR: Good to be back here. I think last time we were here we were
fixin' to write a new story in the last five minutes of our ball game but it
didn't work out for us against Tennessee.  
But I think we learned a lot from it. I think we're a better basketball team
this year, because of the expectations and learning and knowing how to win the
big ball games.  
I like my basketball team. I like Oklahoma City. Maybe some of you will get to
try Mickey Mantle's tonight since you didn't have to use your per diem for
lunch and you can get over to Mickey Mantle's.  
But I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to see you sitting here covering
women's basketball. You're here because you want to be here.  
And I think that's the most important thing in women's basketball now is the
people that are covering us are not assigned to us, you want to be here
covering women's basketball. And that's a strength for our league and we lead
the nation in attendance.  
We lead the nation in exposure. And you are the reason. We appreciate you. I
made it under three minutes, so what do I win?  
PETER IRWIN: First question for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the strength of this league. You guys are
picked fifth, made the Elite Eight, you have almost everybody back. Does that
speak to how just tough this is going to be?  
COACH BLAIR: My players are probably not going to answer that question later,
but I'll answer the question. It's sort of like in football right now. You've
got four teams in the top eight in the country, and you've got a few more
knocking on the door.  
I think it's going to be this way for a long time to come. I think the Big 12
top to bottom is the best conference in the country. And I'm glad to be a part
of it. But we're not just a part of it. I think we're a legit top 10 to top 15
team and now it's up to us to live up to it just like it is for the other
folks in this league.  
Being picked fifth in the conference, that doesn't bother us. It amazes me,
whatever word you want to say. I think we're going to be pretty good. And I
like my basketball team. We've had six good workouts so far. We're taking
today off.  
This is the most depth that I've ever had in a basketball team, any time,
anywhere, and that's all the way back to the Louisiana Tech days.  
  
Q. What happened to coach-speak? The size of your girls' heads have got to
be about to explode. You're being very open and nice.  
COACH BLAIR: Coach-speak? Well, there's no more Lou Holtz in me, I guess. I
think it's time for us to become a power. You've got to think like a power.  
You've got to expect it every day. We used to really come to this media day
and all the way from Arkansas to here and we would want to be champions.  
I think we know the formula to be champions now. And it's not taking away from
the other teams at all. I'm talking about Texas A&M. We expect to be playing
in a championship game. We expect to be at the front. We expect to be in the
top 25 polls and in the magazines.  
We expect to get some of the top recruits in the country now. That's what this
coaching staff was brought in for. And I think we're delivering.  
And I like that role. So is poor mouthing over? No it will still be right
there before ball games, and I'll come up with some new lines and everything
like that.  
But at the same time let's give credit to the league. The league is pretty
doggone special. Eight teams made it. 11 out of 12 were in the NCAA or the
WNIT last year. What other sport do we have in the Big 12 right now that's
doing what we're doing? Women's basketball. That's where it's at.  
  
Q. You referred to A'Quonesia as your Energizer Bunny the last four years.
Does one person take on that role or is it spread out more among the team?  
COACH BLAIR: As most of you know, Sydney Colson blew out her ACL in June,
surgery in July. She'll be released to start practicing November 9th. And when
we get her back, it will be a great day in my life because Aqua's called every
play for me for four years. And Sydney is going to be our point guard when we
get her back.  
Right now, in practice, we cannot run an offense. Starks is having to play the
point right now until we get -- we've got our other freshman out with a
sprained ankle since the first practice. We're hurting right now.  
But it's making our defense look awfully good. But Colson will be there. But,
remember, when you're coming off an ACL, even if she plays well, she will only
be at 85 percent this year. And that's when we get her back. But I think she's
going to be very special.  
I think she's similar to Erin Grant when she played at Texas Tech. Same frame,
same type of attitude. She can create points. She might be a little more of a
scorer than Erin. Erin was more of a distributor. They're more similar to how
they play the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle? I can't imagine she did much in the off
season to become worse, but what role does she play now on this team?  
COACH BLAIR: She led our team in steals. She led it in field goal percentage.
She led it in free throw percentage. She led it in offensive rebounds. She led
our team in rebounds, average 14.7 a game and she's not first team All-Big 12.
I don't think she's gotten worse. I think she's gotten better over the summer.
And it's good to bring her back. This is her first media day and it's very
special to bring her back to Oklahoma City.  
I think you have her and Earnesia Williams both coming back, and I think
that's a tribute to the high school ball here in Oklahoma, what those two kids
have meant during their careers. Now they get a chance to play against each
other twice a year.  
But Danielle Gant is the hardest-working 5-10 player I've ever coached in my
life. Any time, anywhere, that kid comes to play and I think that next level
they're drooling for her. They really want her. But she's been out most of the
summer due to a scope on her knee at the first of August.  
So she's practicing but we're very limited with her right now. But we want to
save her for the real dance.  
  
Q. With eight girls returning and you got a big freshman class coming in,
it's early but how much do you expect to get out of those younger players
through this season?  
COACH BLAIR: This is one of our best recruiting classes that we've brought in.
I think you've got a lot of balance in it. I think Tanisha Smith is going to
be very good for us. She can play 1 through 4.  
Tanisha Smith is going to be a very good player. She's picked to be the new-
comer of the year. I hope she'll have the same impact that Seals had for Texas
Tech last year. I think she's very, very versatile. She's coming in, doing a
good job for us.  
I really like a girl that you hadn't heard a whole lot about, Skylar Collins.
She's out of Cedar Hill, 5-10, very physical. Great defensive player for us.
Energizer. And Adaora Elonu, the sister of Junior Elonu who will start for our
men's team at the post position. Adaora is one of those 6-1- 4 players, and
she's looking very well it will be hard to keep her out of the starting
lineup.  
Between those three, and you cannot forget about Tyra White, because she only
got to play four minutes of her freshman year. Former McDonald's All-American,
and she's just got the TK jump shot, Starks' jump shot except she's about four
inches taller. And she can get it off whenever she wants to.  
So we're excited about those kids, but at the same time the experience that we
just graduated Morenike and A'Quonesia, that's hard to replace kids that have
done it. These kids coming in have the potential to do it. But they haven't
done it yet.  
  
Q. One, seems like you've got an awful lot of the really good 5-9, 6-foot
athletes there, but outside of Micheaux you really don't have the post player.
I was wondering how that was coming together for you, the inside game. Second
of all, Kurt Budke wanted us to ask you about winning the long drive
competition in Dallas this summer.  
COACH BLAIR: Well, first, at the post presence, Damitria Buchanan is doing a
good job of competing for that starting position at the 5 this year. She
played well against Tennessee down the stretch, and I think you will see those
two, like a two-headed center.  
And then we're going to move the Assarian kid, freshman from Florida, scores
well in there. She sort of gets it done like Savant used to at Missouri or
Allison at Baylor, those type of players. But I think she's going to be good
for us. Yes, we need more scoring inside. If we cannot get it this year,
hopefully we can get it this next year on the recruiting trail.  
But that's all to be determined and we'll just have to see how all that plays
out. But I like my kids. You can win -- I think the bulls, if I'm not
mistaken, won about six world championships can anybody think of any post
player that scored more than eight points a game for them? Didn't happen. So
there's a lot of ways to win in basketball, in football or any sports. I think
Tampa Bay is playing tonight, aren't they?  
I love this quote somebody said: The whole team for Tampa Bay does not make as
much as Jeeter and Rodriguez for the Yankees. That's something. Now, about
Budke. To tell you the truth, when the long drive contest -- it was for the
Kay Yow Foundation. And my old mentor, Leon Barmore, beat me by a yard.  
Now, we do not drive it very far, but we got to hit from the senior's tees
because we're over 60. But it's also glad to have Coach Barmore being brought
back into the league because he mentored both Budke and I and Mulkey. And
Mickey Demoss at Texas. So he's meant a lot. But it's good to have somebody
back in the league older than me.  
So I'm excited. Budke, if I can't beat him on the golf course, I'm going to
retire from coaching. And that's a fact.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Mario Chalmers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13724)

### [Brandon Rush](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17071)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self and his
two student athletes, Mario Chalmers and Brandon Rush.  
Coach, we will come to you first with your assessment of today's victory.  
COACH BILL SELF: Very briefly -- because you could talk a long time about that
game -- that was one of the best games I have ever been a part of. I thought
we played great. I thought Texas played great. It was a game of runs and there
were some players out there making plays and these two guys to my right were
absolutely fabulous.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Sherron is kind of the unsung hero this game? He makes a
couple of big plays in about the last minute and a half that help you to seal
this.  
BRANDON RUSH: Yeah, I think so. I think Sherron was a big key to our win
tonight. He made plays for himself and for us by dishing out for open 3s.
Yeah, I think he was our unsung hero.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about just the way you both were shooting. This was a
hard-fought physical game, a game of runs, an opponent you knew all too well
and, yet, you were on fire from the three-point line and, Brandon, you were
making great plays. Can you just talk about, was this a game that brought
another level out of you?  
MARIO CHALMERS: Yeah, I think so. Yesterday Brandon stepped up big for us. I
mean, tonight everybody stepped up. We were talking about it yesterday, that
we were going to need a big game from everybody and I think everybody
continued to step up today.  
BRANDON RUSH: Yeah, I think the shooting tonight was pretty amazing. He went
8-12 and I went 6-9. And everybody stepped up and played pretty good.  
  
Q. First half was very much an up-pace, uptempo again, second half much more
of a defensive struggle. What was different?  
BRANDON RUSH: We wanted to slow them down and not let them get the open looks
and make them work for their points. We beat them on rebounding and that was a
key for our win (smiling).  
  
Q. Just wondering about the competition of this game today. It seemed like
one -- it was highly competitive games you have played, the one in Texas was
right there. Just the competition with you and Texas two of the best teams
obviously in the country.  
MARIO CHALMERS: Yeah, I mean, we faced Texas a lot at these times. We face
them three in the row for the Big 12 championship. We knew how they played,
they knew how we played, we were both two fast-paced teams. We just wanted to
slow them down a little bit and we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Brandon, you have taken some heat for not staying aggressively notably
from that guy on your left and some other people. Was it particularly
satisfying to come up so big and stay so aggressive?  
BRANDON RUSH: Yes, my main goal tonight was to stay aggressive, look for my
shot and look for other people to get open and it was about winning. That's
about it, staying aggressive.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you return to the locker room.  
  
Q. Coach Self, there was a lot of discussion when the Texas guys were in
here about fatigue and the disadvantage of playing three tough games over
three days. I wanted to ask you about maybe the advantages as you are getting
ready to go into the NCAA of having played some really good games against some
really tough teams three days in a row like you have.  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I think it is good for us. We desperately needed this
tournament because, you know, we really haven't played that many close games
in the league. We won one game in the league that wasn't double figures so we
needed this. The Nebraska game was perfect for us. They whipped us the first
half and made us play from behind. A&M took us to the last minute obviously,
two-point game with a minute left and we had to play great to win. And then
tonight, that's as good a team -- we can play -- I don't know. I know there is
other great teams out there, but the way Texas played today, I don't know if
there is any teams better than Texas.  
All we did was just match each other. It wasn't a 10-point game. That game --
if we played three more minutes they may have gone on another 11-0 run because
it was a game of runs. They go on runs, they go on a 18-3 run, a 11-0 run. We
were up eight. And the players were just making plays. We have great respect
for their players and their staff and I thought it was just a well-played
classic game with guys making some unbelievable plays.  
  
Q. I will ask you about the difference in the two halves and specifically
did you address anything specifically about that at halftime?  
COACH BILL SELF: It is pretty corny but at halftime I told the team in front
of Danny, I said that's probably about as good a half of basketball played in
Kansas City since the '88 championship basketball game. I said, "What happened
the second game?" He said the game slowed down and we guarded.  
I told the team we got to make a conscious effort to guard better because in a
horse contest, I don't know if you want to get in one of those with Abrams and
Augustin the way they shot it the first half and the way that obviously James
and Mason played.  
I mean, Mario and Brandon carried us but you just wonder, can you keep doing
it?  
We defended and rebounded the ball much better the second half and played
about as complete a game as we played to be honest with you.  
Second half last night against A&M and today was about as well as we've played
over a long stretch.  
  
Q. Brandon talked about Sherron's ability to distribute the ball. Could you
talk about Sherron's rebounding and his foul shooting, especially there within
the last couple of minutes.  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I tell you this, you are the only one that has ever
asked me about his rebounding. So I guess he got five tonight, so I guess
that's five more than he usually gets.  
You know, he's tough. He's tough and he has been a big difference in our team.
He adds a different element to our team. We're going to play those four guards
about the same amount of minutes, but it was hard to take Mario and Brandon
out today. They were on a roll. To be honest with you, Mario -- I mean,
Sherron got off to a rough start, didn't play that well early. But really made
some key plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Quite a few people talked about that first half, comparing it to the '88
game. What does it mean to have Danny there to present that to those guys?  
COACH BILL SELF: I told Danny before tip-off, I said, good, gosh, you get
bigger ovations than the players do still around here when they introduced
him. (Smiling).  
But, you know, I don't think there was one performer in the game, maybe D.J.,
the first half and maybe Mario, that would rival what Danny did individually
in that game. You know, I think back to that game, that was as well-played as
a game could be. And here we shoot lights out, they only have two turnovers
the first half. That he just had four turnovers for the game. It wasn't
because we weren't trying, they just do a good job taking care of the ball.  
It was a very well-played game that obviously lost some pace the second half
which always happens or usually happens. And then we just had some guys step
up and make unbelievable plays when we were down four. If I am not mistaken we
were down four under 7 time out -- or under 8 time out, and then from that
point forward, guys kept making play after play.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by Coach Rick Barnes from Texas. Coach your thoughts
on tonight's game?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Great college game. Both teams really went at it, played
really, really hard. Congratulations to Kansas. Really proud of the effort
that our guys put forth up here the last three days and we've got certainly
nothing to be disappointed about.  
We're disappointed. I mean, there is no doubt we're disappointed because we
like to think every time we go out, we like to win even though we know that's
not going to happen. But I'm really -- I'm proud of our team because they came
into a home environment today and hung around. That's what we wanted to do. We
wanted to have a chance with 4:00 to go in the game. We had that chance.
Couple turnovers hurt us there at the end, but they made free throws when they
had to.  
Again, congratulations to Kansas. And I'm sure a great game for fans to watch.  
  
Q. How much do you feel like Kansas's back court depth wore you guys out in
the second half?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I don't think they wore us out. I think two days wore us
out.  
I mean, we're not set up. D.J. played 40 minutes. I didn't want to do that.
But I don't think that -- but, you know, he's a great player. D.J., I can't
say enough about him. I mean, I think today he showed why he is what he is and
certainly one of the best players in the country.  
But they shot the ball well. We shot it well, too. I mean, we were right where
we needed to be. I don't think we were worn out. I think we made a couple
decisions.  
We didn't quite execute what we needed to on that one out-of-bounds play. If
we do that, I think things tighten up and I felt all along if we could keep it
close in the last minute, the crowd could work against them.  
But, you know, I think these guys are tired but I don't think we were worn out
by Kansas' players.  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by our Texas student athletes, D.J. Augustin and
Justin Mason.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at that the officials let you play as much as they
did, especially in the first half?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: I mean, you got to be prepared for that. You know, the
officials, they're going to call some calls and you just got to play through
it no matter what. That's what we did and that's what we got to do throughout
the rest of the year.  
  
Q. D.J., can you talk about that second half, what they did to limit you
after the explosive first half?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: I think they did a great job playing team defense on our whole
team, not just me. We didn't come out with the same intensity we did in the
first half, and we just got to play through it next time.  
  
Q. Justin, would you talk about how difficult it is to defend those guys,
Rush, Chalmers, Collins, it seems like they all hit big shots again and again
today.  
JUSTIN MASON: It's hard to guard them. They execute their offense well and all
of those guys can score. They're great guards, some of the best guards in the
country. It is just we had to -- we didn't execute as good on the defensive
end and they made us pay for it.  
  
Q. D.J., they're about as good as it gets as far as turning your missed
shots, turnover into a fast-break three-point shot.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: Yeah, we knew that going into the game. We knew not to turn the
ball over because they capitalize on turnovers and that's what they do and
that's what they thrive on so we tried to limit our turnovers. And I think we
did a pretty good job at that.  
  
Q. Justin, going into the game, was there a plan to get you more involved or
did that just kind of happen?  
JUSTIN MASON: No, there wasn't a plan to get me involved. I am always a threat
on the offensive end. Coach wants me to be more aggressive in this tournament.
I decided to be a little bit more aggressive to help my team out. And I would
just take my open shots when I had them.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk about how much the toll of the last two days
played on you guys in the last ten minutes of the game.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: It had been tough, but it's not an excuse. All the teams have
been playing a lot lately, and we just came out and tried to play hard every
night we played. And that's the main thing. We don't want to make any excuses.
We played hard tonight and we left it out on the court.  
  
Q. D.J., would you talk about in general what a great series this has
become.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: It has become a great series. Kansas is a great team. Every
time we play them, they give us a tough battle and we try to do the same and
it is a great game between both teams and they have a great team.  
  
Q. We've talked about the fatigue factor and maybe some of the negative
things that come out -- that play into this tournament. Talk about playing a
couple of very tough games against some very good teams and how you think that
might be a positive in getting y'all prepared for playing very good teams in
the tournament in the next couple of weeks.  
JUSTIN MASON: I think it will be a positive for us facing different styles of
play in back-to-back games against a lot of good teams in the Big 12. It could
be good for us because we're going to face a lot of different styles in the
NCAA tournament. I don't think the fatigue was a factor too much in the
tournament. We just got to get home and get some rest and be ready for the
NCAA.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you for coming.  
Questions a little bit longer for Coach.  
  
Q. Rick, can you talk about Chalmers and what he meant to them today.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, I'm listening to y'all's questions, again, understand
when you talk about Kansas and Texas, this was a two-possession game today.
Inasmuch as I can brag about their guys, I could sit here and talk about how
hard we were to guard, too.  
But Kansas and Texas, I said going in, I said it back, I thought that Kansas
is the best team we've played all year. I believe that. But I also know that
when I say that, that we're right there and today's game was no different. I
mean, it was -- we were in a position, but they shot the ball really, really
well.  
I will tell you this. I don't think 15 3s beat us. I think we got beat with
not rebounding the ball at crucial times. I think that we gave up too much
dribble penetration at times. But Tennessee made 16 3s and I don't -- again, I
don't believe 15 beat us today.  
I looked at where we were. We made 12. It goes back to we were in a position
to win the game and we just didn't quite get it done in those last couple
minutes there.  
Again, I can't say anything -- I think Kansas is a great basketball team. I
think Bill has done a great job with this team. They are very unselfish. They
are willing to make the extra pass to get -- turn down a good shot to get a
better one. They got an inside presence. That's what we needed today. We had
to work a lot harder, it seemed like, to score. But we needed to have some
things with back to the basket and we didn't really get any of that today, and
we need that.  
But I mean -- and I think D.J. said it, they're an excellent defensive team.
They've got different parts. Sherron Collins comes in, he is a game-changer. I
love their guards, Russell Robinson and the way he guards. I mean, I can sit
here and talk about them all day long. I like their team a lot because they're
a team.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about giving up dribble penetration. How effective
would you say your guys were at dribble penetration on the offensive end?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we needed to do that more at the end. I mean, we
needed to get to the free-throw line and we didn't. That's what we needed out
of a couple of those possessions at the end because they had extended their
defense and we needed to go in and put more pressure on the basket.  
But, you know, we played more zone than we wanted to for a couple reasons. I
mean, obviously we were trying to protect a few guys with fouls. And I never
once thought we would win this game in the first 20 minutes. We played the
whole game even when they were making the 3s in the first half, we said, "hey,
let's just hang around right here." We get down to 4:00. With that said, we
would have come up with a couple of offensive rebounds. Again, I think it
could have changed maybe the way the game was being felt by the players.  
But we weren't able to do that, and give them credit for running those down.  
  
Q. What did you feel like they did to D.J. in the second half to kind of
slow him down some?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, they got more aggressive on the ball screens. They
definitely started getting out, trying to, you know, get him to give it up.
They went out, tried -- again, I'm not sure they were double teaming as much
as they were trying to extend out. He is an awfully hard guy to double team.  
You know, you look at what he did, I mean, he shot the ball really well in the
first half. And look at his line, he had 20 points, 9 assists and 1 turnover.
I'm not sure -- you go back and look at it -- they did anything. I am not sure
he is going to score as many points in the second half as he did in the first
half. He was working hard to get other guys involved.  
I mean, he has played 40 minutes the entire time he was up here. There is no
doubt in my mind he is the best player in this league for what he means to our
team. I do think that he got tired, I do. And I was worried about that coming
in. That's why we played zone as much as we could to try to help him through
it. We had hoped to try to really get him a rest for a minute or two, but he's
played so much, I'm not sure that would be that big a difference to him.  
Again, I mean, he had an incredible day today. I don't think any of us thought
he was going to come out and continue to score the way he did in the first
half. It is hard to do, but that's not what he's looking to do.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Darnell Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13718)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by the Kansas Jayhawks and Coach Bill Self and his
two student athletes are Russell Robinson and Darnell Jackson.  
Coach, we will go to you, first, for your assessment of today's victory.  
COACH BILL SELF: I thought it was a fabulous college basketball game. I
thought there was some high-level stuff going on out there, especially the
last 10 minutes. We played great second half, and didn't guard like we should,
but we played excellent offense and we made shots and made some hard shots. I
thought it was a fabulous basketball game.  
  
Q. Darnell, I was going to ask you the question that Bill talked about a
little bit. Seemed like y'all played a great second half and needed every
minute of it. Would that be your assessment?  
DARNELL JACKSON: Yeah, we just had to come together as a team and just pick it
up, make sure we execute plays and make sure everybody boxed out and crashed
the boards.  
  
Q. Russell, can you talk about your layup at the very end when you were
milking the clock and seemed like you saw an opening there.  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: Basically just wanted to take as much time off the clock as
we could and get a good look. We got the ball to the side and had an easy
layup.  
  
Q. Darnell, do you feel like tomorrow's game determines who really was the
Big 12 champion since you guys have to go down and play that game in Austin?  
DARNELL JACKSON: No, I don't think we are worried about that at all. It is a
big game for us and it is a big game for the seniors and the juniors. We want
to go out there and try to win another Big 12 tournament.  
  
Q. Russell, talk about how well Brandon played today and how important that
was for him.  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: You know, when Brandon is playing well, everybody is playing
well. And he got us off to great start. He hit great shots. He kept us in the
game when we weren't doing too good on offense. Hopefully he can play like
that more often.  
  
Q. Darnell, the second part of that question I was going to ask you, what I
was trying to get at, as well as you played, A &M just wouldn't go away. Did
you feel like they just kept coming and kept coming back at you?   
DARNELL JACKSON: Everybody is saying that. Especially at the end with the shot
clock, when he threw it up and it went in off the glass, I was like, "Wow,
this is going to be a long, tough game." But we kept grinding and grinding
came out with a victory.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about playing Texas again in the tournament finals,
being the third straight year, and what your thoughts are about Texas at this
point.  
RUSSELL ROBINSON: It is going to be a great game and they got some guys. They
played us really well down there at home. We are just going to try to come out
and play with a lot more intensity and be more aggressive this time around.  
DARNELL JACKSON: Like Russ says, it is going to be a great game. I know a
couple guys on the team earlier said they had an eye out for us, they were
ready to play us in the championship game.  
So I guess it is just going to come down to us like it was last year and the
year before. So I know both teams will be ready to play and we will have to go
out there and compete.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you go back to your locker room. Congratulations on
your victory.  
Now we will go to questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question I asked Darnell: Do you like the fact you
get a chance to play Texas again? I know you don't care what people say, but
to prove who the true conference champ is, you had to play down in Austin. Do
you like the fact you get to play them on a neutral court?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, I don't know if I buy into the whole thing. Your
conference champion is determined over 16 games, not one game. And we tied. So
-- but from a pay-back factor, I think that we'll be excited to play because,
you know, they beat us the first time and the way they beat us was physically
they handled us a second half.  
So we'll be excited to play. I think it is pretty fitting, to be real candid
with you, that Texas and Kansas had played. I think these two programs have
had the best seasons and I think it's great for our league to have the two
best teams get a chance to hook up and play on Sunday.  
They've got a great team. You know, you go back the last three years, I mean,
there's been some unbelievable plays and some unbelievable performances by
guys on both teams. I would expect the same tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys hit Texas A &M in the mouth a couple of times and a lot of teams
would have folded?   
COACH BILL SELF: They didn't fold.  
  
Q. Talk about the stick-to-itiveness that those guys have.  
COACH BILL SELF: They did a great job getting their players to play. The way
we handled in College Station was probably great motivation for them here
because we were the better rebounding team in College Station. Today, there's
no question, they controlled the glass. I mean, numbers don't lie.  
But we needed -- we needed this game. We needed yesterday's game. These are
great games to play as long as you win. And they stink if you don't.  
But we needed to execute down the stretch. We needed to come from behind like
we did yesterday. And you really look at it, you take away the last 3:30 of
the first half, we controlled that game. The second half, we controlled the
game almost from the start of the second half on but they would not go away.
And they made big shots and they were tough. But it was good for us to have to
keep playing because we did execute fairly well down the stretch.  
  
Q. Bill, should the Big 12 tournament champion get a No. 1 seed, and your
position for a No. 1 seed irrespective of tomorrow's happenings?  
COACH BILL SELF: If we don't win, we won't get one. If Texas doesn't win, they
won't get one. I think I can go that strong. But I don't see how the winner
tomorrow wouldn't be under serious consideration to deserve one. You know you
look at the RPI numbers and things like that, I don't know if that's a true
indication who the best teams are, but, you know, you would say if you just
look at the RPI, that we may need a little help, both teams, to earn the No.
1.  
But the bottom line is this, the best team in this league is probably going to
be one of the best three, four, five teams in the country. And we get a chance
to determine who that will be tomorrow.  
I'm not going to campaign for it or politic for it because nobody's going to
listen anyway.  
  
Q. Bill, Brandon's made no secret he wants to play in the NBA. How important
was this game for him playing a very good talent out there for Texas A &M and
for him to have such a big game in front of a lot of NBA scouts?   
COACH BILL SELF: I thought Brandon was as good today as I've ever seen him.
We've seen him have some good performances. The thing that I am most proud
about, that I like about Brandon, is he didn't play at all yesterday. And for
him to come back from that, you know, I think is a good sign for him and he
needed -- I think you bring up a good point. He needs to have some breakout
games when it counts the most. And certainly this is one of those type of
games.  
Of course, we're going to need him to perform tomorrow as well. But, you know,
if we were watching an NBA guard out there today, and if he keeps playing like
this or close to it, then I can't imagine that this wouldn't be very
impressive for a lot of people down the road.  
  
Q. Bill, when you have a game -- one game a year against a team and then you
come back and you play them in a tournament final, do you zero in a lot on
that one game, the things that went right, the things that didn't go right?
And what stands out in your mind from the game down in Austin?  
COACH BILL SELF: What stands out is I thought we played very well the first
half when Atchley and James made shots and we still played well the first
half.  
We were fortunate that James had two fouls early because we saw what he did to
us in the second half from controlling the glass.  
So I thought -- I'm okay with not winning the game. I didn't particularly care
for the way we didn't win it, which was them beating us to loose balls and
outhustling us on the glass and things like that. That's what I remember of
the game.  
Also we got lucky in the game that D.J. didn't shoot the ball well. So there
was a lot of things that happened.  
But we'll watch that game. But the biggest thing is -- watch probably the last
three or four games to focus in on that because when we played them, that was
probably -- what was that? Five weeks ago or so. So they'll be doing something
a little bit different and having a few different tendencies.  
  
Q. What does it say about Kansas and Texas in a year when the league was so
good to play again in the finals?  
COACH BILL SELF: Well, you know, there's a lot of great teams in our league.
It's easier to have a great team than it is to have a great program. But you
look over time, at least since I've been in the league, Okie State had the run
the first couple years, but really it has been Texas and Kansas.  
We have great respect for them and the feeling is probably mutual. But I think
it is very fitting that we get a chance to play each other because, you know,
this is the way it's been the last three years and it can certainly change in
the future, but it's been a pretty good run for both programs.  
  
Q. Coach, you played a lot of good teams on your schedule this season, but
is it fair to say that Texas may be the toughest all-around team that you've
played all season?  
COACH BILL SELF: Not fair to say; they are. That's the best team we've played.
And I'll say the same thing tomorrow, regardless of outcome. That's the best
team we've played. I don't think that's going out on them too much because of
the teams we played, nobody is close to having the resume that Texas has had.  
So they played Tennessee and UCLA, so they may feel differently about us. But
it is the best team we've played.  
  
Q. Is this the best team you've had? And if so, what does that mean? What's
the comfort factor and why do you like these guys so much?  
COACH BILL SELF: I do like them a lot. I like them because they're unselfish
and for the most part they try hard.  
I don't think that we play as tough as what we need to play consistently, so
there is still an area of improvement. I like this team, I like the makeup. I
like the balance. We can play in or out.  
But, you know, you say the best team, we had -- you know, we had a guy last
year, everybody talks about (Kevin) Durant for Texas. We say he was fabulous.
We had a guy last year making pretty big plays for the Hornets right now, too.
I don't know if this is the most talented team, but I think this has been the
most consistent team. Last year when we played well, we were pretty good.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you. Congratulations again.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready for Texas A&M and Head Coach Mark Turgeon. He has
three student athletes today, Bryan Davis, Joseph Jones and Beau Muhlbach.  
Coach, we'll go to you, first, on thoughts on this afternoon's game.  
COACH MARK TURGEON: It was a heck of a college basketball game. For us to beat
Kansas, we got to keep the score in the low 60's and we weren't able to do
that today. You know, they shoot close to 70% the second half and make free
throws and really don't turn the ball over.  
It looks like a recipe for disaster but we are right there with a two-point
game with 50 seconds to go.  
To gun it up without Sloan, our point guard, the one guy that can break down
the defense for us, twisted his ankle and really didn't play the last 25
minutes of the game. I was really proud of our guys. We made shots. Beau had
some big shots. Joe hit a big 3 when we were down 7. We couldn't get them
stopped, couldn't stop them. They got an offensive rebound for a basket and,
of course, the lay-up right at the end. And we broke down defensively. It
shouldn't have happened, but it did and that was the difference.  
But KU was great and they have been great all year. And, of course, Brandon
Rush was phenomenal. We had no answer for him. He just kept making shots. He
was 2 for 9 against us and I think he played poorly last night against
Nebraska. I think he was 2 for 8. He had a breakout game tonight and that was
really the difference.  
  
Q. Bryan, how much -- how differently do you feel about this team leaving
town than you did when y'all got here?  
BRYAN DAVIS: I feel great right now. I feel that we came together as a team
these past three days and we are a better team today than we were three days
ago and we're going to get better.  
  
Q. Beau, can you talk about -- do you feel like you have been in a war the
last three days? And kind of follow up with what Bryan said about how good you
feel about this team going into the NCAA tournament?  
BEAU MUHLBACH: Yeah, in the Big 12, any game is a war let alone the
tournament. Just battling every night, do whatever it takes to win. I will
play with a broken arm, I just love to play basketball. I am sure these guys
would say the same thing.  
Same thing, we're just glad to be here and, you know, the team has just come
together so much these past three days. What we've been through, what our odds
are and just fighting when we're in the foxhole, we are just going to scrap
and play hard and get the job done.  
  
Q. Bryan, can you talk about your Harlem Globe Trotter shot?  
BRYAN DAVIS: I just threw up a prayer and hoped it went in.  
  
Q. Joe, how do you feel about this time right now after what you guys went
through this weekend and really seeing them come together?  
JOSEPH JONES: Right now, we feel real good. Like he said, we came together and
got better as a team and that's what it's all about, coming together, getting
better each and every day, each and every game out. We feel like we did a
great job these three days. Unfortunately we lost today, but we got better.
And that's what it takes for us to keep going further into our season.  
  
Q. When Sloan went down, I mean, was there anything said that was like,
somebody is going to have to step up even more?  
JOSEPH JONES: No, the only thing we said was keep playing. One man down,
somebody got to pick it up for us somewhere else. And Beau came in and did a
great job. And Dominique did a great job so we just kept going on. We never
missed a beat.  
I know it hurt us a little bit, but we find a way to pick it up.  
  
Q. Y'all took some real gut shots today from Kansas. They got on a little
bit of a roll. But you seem to come back from everything they threw at you.
Can you just talk a little bit about the resiliency y'all showed today.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: You said taking what kind of shots?  
  
Q. Gut shots. They hit you but y'all didn't back down.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: I just -- -- this program is built on toughness. You got to
fight through it. It is a grind. Like I said earlier, the Big 12 is a grind
every night, every game.  
We're down to fight and we're down to do whatever it takes to win. That's
being tough. To play in the Big 12, you have to be tough no matter how the
game's going, you have to play together as a team through thick and thin. One
player goes down, the team knows we have to step up and help that person.
That's what we did tonight, just came up a little short.  
  
Q. Beau, can you talk a little bit about where your confidence is coming
from right now because it seems like -- especially tonight, you were really
looking for your shot a lot.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: My whole deal is just to work hard and work hard in practice
and just waiting for the right opportunity for me to come. That's all I can
say. I work hard in practice, and these guys do, too. And it shows on the
court. That's all I have. Just being a good teammate, just helping other guys
and just staying focused with what Coach wants me to do and what he wants the
team to do. Just keep working hard.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you go back to your locker room. We'll take questions
for Coach Turgeon.  
  
Q. At what point did Sloan hurt his ankle?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: He hurt it pretty early. I think the first time I subbed
him out and I put him back in, I'm not sure if it was the first time -- I
think it was the first time -- and he said "my ankle hurts." And Sloan is
tough as nails. And I was like, do you want to play? And he said "let me try
it." His ankle was affecting everything; his game, his brain.  
So we took him out again, tried him one more time and he just didn't have it.
Took him out. So at halftime he said he was done. I said, all right. And then
he looked at me when they made that run, and he said, "Coach, I want to play,"
and obviously he wasn't ready to play. I think he hurt it in the first five
minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Do you think he'll be okay for next week?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Yeah, he'll be fine. It is a mild sprain. He'll get
treatment and hopefully we won't play until Friday. That would help us, an
extra day.  
Now, if we had to play tomorrow, he wouldn't have been able to play. But he'll
be ready for next weekend.  
  
Q. In keeping with the theme here, what happened to this team over the last
few days? I think everybody that's watched y'all sees maybe a different team
than they had in a while.  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Oh, I don't know. I think we've been awful critical of our
team this year. And the reason why is because we've had bad losses. We've had
losses where we didn't show up. So everybody has been really critical of me
and our team.  
We just had guys step up this week. Junior stepped up. Was sick. And Junior
stepped up. Bryan Davis stepped up. And obviously Beau stepped up. But we've
been getting better since the Nebraska game. We've had really one bad game in
that stretch, was at Oklahoma. KU whipped us pretty good at our place, but
we've been getting better.  
I don't know if it just happened this weekend, it probably happened a few
weeks before and we just kept coming together.  
Our backs were against the wall coming over here. We knew we had to win one
for sure, we felt like. And we got two and pushed probably -- maybe a No. 1
seed to the limit in front of their home fans. So we did a lot of good things.  
I don't know. Was it different? Yeah, yeah, and our sense urgency was
different. There was no quit in us. We might have folded our tents early in
the year down 7 or 8 in front of their fans.  
But we just kept fighting through it. And then we made a lot of big shots this
weekend, too.  
Teams go two ways at the end of the season. They either get going or they go
the opposite way. I think we're just getting going, so hopefully we can get a
lot better between now and our next game.  
  
Q. KU made a nice run, a 9-0 run at the beginning of the second half to
punch you guys in the face. And then you struck right back with the 10-0 run.
What did you say to them in that time out? And maybe the sense urgency for the
television cameras, but how proud were you that they were able to come back
and push KU all the way?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: I got on them pretty good. We just want our guys to play
with a little toughness and compete. We weren't playing with that. That's
basically what I said to them. Just compete a little bit harder. Let's give
them our best shot. Let's don't run out of here and look after the game and
say we didn't give them our best shot.  
We just challenged them to keep a little bit harder. It wasn't an X and O
thing. Then we made some plays, got some stops. We didn't get many of them in
the second half but we got some stops. It was all just about getting on them
to compete. I'm so proud of my group. Obviously I would rather have won,
rather gotten a stop and had a chance to tie it there instead of giving the
guy a wide-open lay-up. But to have Sloan go down, DeAndre sick all weekend
and not himself and just to gut it up the way we did against arguably one of
the better KU teams ever, we'll see what history is going to do for them down
the stretch here. It was just a great gutty effort by our team.  
  
Q. What did happen on -- what was the breakdown exactly on Robinson's lay-
up?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Well, we were switching certain screens, and then they had
a big, big switch. There was a lot of ball screens. So we switched on that
one. And then so -- I don't know if guys can follow this -- so then Bryan was
guarding the five man. We were switching one through four balls. That means he
was guarding the five. I wish he switched him. Our guard was expecting him to
switch it, and he didn't.  
But it wasn't Bryan's fault, okay, with what happened. He actually did the
right thing. So KU did a good job. They went small and did all the right
things. I just wish we'd made them shoot a jump shot over his head. That's the
disappointing thing.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Taylor Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18176)

### [Blake Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18196)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by the Sooners of Oklahoma and Coach Jeff Capel.
His two student athletes are Taylor Griffin and Blake Griffin.  
Coach, your thoughts on today's game?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: The game got away from us very quickly. I thought we did a
good job early. Going into halftime we knew we were right there. We tied it up
at 36, and very quickly got away from us.  
Texas is a terrific team. When they're making shots and 3s like they were, it
makes them an extremely tough team to guard. Abrams got loose and was able to
get some baskets, Augustin is a tough guy to defend. But we got some great
looks, we just didn't knock them down inside, some shots right at three-point
line, and when you are playing against a really good team like Texas you have
to be able to knock more of those down than we did.  
We're disappointed but we are excited about our post-season future, look
forward to tomorrow figuring out where we're playing and look forward to the
NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Blake, do you leave this tournament with a bad taste in your mouth after
your performances yesterday and today or do you still feel good and positive
about going into the NCAA?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: A little bit of both. We need to definitely learn from these
two games, learn what we did wrong and improve upon it. But at the same time,
we need to forget it and concentrate on whoever we're playing next and not let
how we played in this tournament affect us in the next tournament.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: I think when you lose, you should always have a bad taste in
your mouth. If you don't, then something is wrong with you.  
After not playing very well as a team yesterday and then losing the way we did
today, you know, it's disappointing. But at this point in the season, you got
to move on quickly. If you don't, your next game could be your last. So, yeah,
it is disappointing. But, you know, we still got a big opportunity coming up.  
  
Q. If you'll just address the fact that the game was even, looked like a
heck of a ball game there for a while, even into the early part of the second
half and then it just got completely out of control. Can you talk about how it
spun out of control?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it started just with us letting them play their game
and play the way they wanted to play. And when you do that and they have a
point guard like they do and shooters like they do and big ones like they do,
it can get out of control fast. And we didn't do a good job of getting back on
transition and slowing them down and stopping them.  
Once they got rolling, like I said, they're hard to stop.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: Same thing. They're a team that -- or it seemed like after
they started getting ahead, it was like they could do whatever they wanted.
They were getting the shots they wanted from the people they wanted and they
were knocking down shots. And at the same time, it seemed like we weren't
knocking down shots. With a team like Texas with that combination, then things
are going to get out of hand pretty quickly.  
  
Q. Blake, what was the difference today? Your 20 points, 13 rebounds.
Yesterday no factor at all.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think -- (laughter). I think today, you know, trying to stay
involved and run the court and I mean, rebounds kind of helped out a little
bit and also hitting some shots helped.  
At the same time, we didn't win so, you know, kind of wish I was a nonfactor
again today. And we would have gotten a win.  
  
Q. You guys get 7-0 run. You tie the game up; what was going on that didn't
continue as the game went on? Just simply not making shots?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: Yeah I mean, like I said, they were making shots and we
weren't. And, you know, they have the ability with the players they have -- it
seems like they have the ability to turn it on at any point, especially
Augustin. You know, like I said, it was a bad combination.  
  
Q. Both players, you played so well coming into the tournament against A &M,
Oklahoma State, Missouri. What's the confidence level now? You come in playing
well, you should be confident. Where's it at now?   
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: We're good. I mean, we got NCAA tournament coming up. We got
an opportunity to win some games there and, you know, I think with the
abilities that everybody has on this team, we can do -- we can get pretty far
in this tournament. So like I said, it is disappointing that we didn't play as
well as we know we're capable of in this tournament, but we know what we can
do and we know how we can play and we are going to go out and do that.  
  
Q. Taylor, you were here last year -- this time last year, your season was
done. Contrast now how you feel this year.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: You know, both Big 12 tournaments have ended in a loss. This
time it is not like the season's over and you're looking forward to the next
season.  
Like I said, we have a lot of good players on this team and we have a chance
to do something big in the NCAA tournament if we play together, if we play
with passion, if we do the things that each of us can do well and we do it
together.  
You know, last year was disappointing. It was an off-year for Oklahoma
basketball. We're back in the NCAAs and we're ready to make a statement.  
CHARLIE FISS: Blake, Taylor, thank you for coming. We will let you go back to
the locker room.  
And we will now take questions for Coach Capel.  
  
Q. Jeff, we talked about before, is it impossible for you -- you see the way
your team practices -- figure out how they are going to come into a game of
play?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Sometimes it is. I didn't have a great feeling coming into
yesterday because of practice. I had a better feeling coming into today, you
know, because I knew our guys would be ready to play Texas. I knew the
opportunity and we knew we had to play at a high level in order to have a
chance to beat them.  
Texas is awfully good. I think they're one of the best teams in the country.
They're making shots at a high rate, they're extremely difficult to guard
because of the pressure their guards can put on you and because they just keep
bringing bodies of post-guys in.  
The thing you don't know is how you're going to shoot the ball. I thought we
got good looks, we just didn't make them here in Kansas City. One of the great
things -- I could be out of line. I don't think there are any NCAA tournament
games up here so we will be in a different arena, so hopefully that leads to
us making shots.  
  
Q. Jeff, best-guess, what do you think your seed will be?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I don't know. I haven't really thought about it until you
just asked me. I have been concentrating on our team, so I don't know.  
  
Q. What do you think you deserve? You have been around the tournament a long
time.  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Never really played attention, though. I just go play the
games. That's all I've ever done, just go play the games. When you get to that
point, you are playing against good teams. So I keep hearing one of my
assistants the other day, and he gave me a list of 64 teams. So he picked the
field. I think he had us as a 7 or an 8 seed. So I will take Mark Cline's
guess and use that as mine.  
  
Q. Is 7 okay with you?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Hey, man, we're in the tournament. It's better than where we
were last year. Yeah, it's great with me.  
  
Q. Coach Capel, Al asked the question a little bit earlier of the player
what he felt like being in this position and playing; what do you feel like as
a coach not having made it last year and now making it, getting ready to go
into the tournament?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I will tell you what, as disappointing as this is, this one
particular game, you know, when you reflect upon this season for us and I know
I'll do it more when it is completely over with, I'm proud of our team. I
really am.  
We've overcome a lot. We've put ourself in a position where we are able to
finish in the top half of the league. We were able to get a bye. And we had
some really good wins this season. We've had some really good wins and we feel
like we have earned an NCAA tournament berth. So I am really proud of it.  
At the same time, we're not satisfied. Our guys answered that question, you
got to move on quickly. We can't do anything about this. We will be confident
going into the NCAA tournament. Texas is a bad match for us this season, last
year, too. I tell you what, they have been a bad match for everybody, just
about everyone.  
They are really, really good. They are very good. You look at their body of
work, I think they should be a No. 1 seed. You look at what we've done, who
they've beaten, they are really, really good. They will be a tough out for
anyone.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about coaching a guy like Blake Griffin who is so explosive,
yet hasn't played any and his ceiling is really high, yet I can see you on the
sidelines, see him make mistakes that make you want to pull your hair out but
you see that potential.  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Guys are going to make mistakes. The best guy that ever
laced them up made a lot, missed shots, turned the ball over. You know, as a
coach, I told Blake this from the beginning, the only time I get frustrated
with him is I don't feel like he is giving effort, if I don't feel like he's
playing as hard or playing every possession. One of the things where he has to
grow as a player which is going to help him become a special player, if he can
ever reach this -- I don't use that word a lot but I think he has a chance to
be one of the special guys to play -- is him learning how to play every
possession.  
Not many guys, period, do that. And the guys that learn how to do it, that's
what makes (Tyler) Hansborough so good from North Carolina. He plays every
position. I just think the sky is the limit for Blake. I love coaching him. I
love being on this team and I love the opportunity that I have and we have as
a University, as a program to help him, to help him grow and to help him try
to reach that level because I know he so desperately wants it.  
  
Q. Wasn't too long ago you were playing in the NCAA tournament. Now you will
be back coaching in it. How does that help you as a coach, your experience
playing, how do you tell it to your guys?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Well, I can use different experiences. I have coached in the
NCAA tournament, too, when I was at VCU. We lost to Wake Forest by 1 in
Raleigh. I have experience there. The thing I will tell them is just enjoy it,
let's have fun with it.  
But you have to really value every possession, you know, because you are in a
situation now, it is a one-game season. If you lose, you're done. If you win,
you get to play another game. But, also, have a lot of fun with it, too, enjoy
it.  
  
Q. Your players were asked about their confidence level now. I know you want
to be positive because you are going into the tournament, do you feel
confident about this team not only to appear in the tournament but win a
couple games in the tournament?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Absolutely. Those that have covered us this year, you've
seen us when we've been really, really bad. And all of you guys probably -- or
people counted us out, and this team responded. Whether it was coming back
from Nebraska, you know, the game right after that -- I don't remember exactly
who we played -- or when we came back from Colorado, those performances, when
we came back from Steven F. Austin, those are the three off the top of my head
where there were a lot of things said about our team, said about me, about the
direction we were going in and we've responded.  
This is one of those times. And I fully anticipate us responding. We'll have
fun tomorrow with the selection show and figuring out where we're going. And
then we'll get in on Monday and be excited. I want our guys to forget about
absolutely everything that has happened so far in this season. When you get to
the tournament, it is a different season. To really enjoy every second because
we've worked hard to get here, but also to not be satisfied just to be there.
We want to be a team that can advance, and we feel like when we play -- we
make shots, we feel like we can compete with anybody.  
It will be good to get outside of our league again. You beat each other up in
this league because it is so good. It will be good to play against someone
else and getting prepared to someone else. We look forward to it. I'm
confident. Our guys should be confident. Even though this is tough today, but
we'll be ready to go.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [A.J. Abrams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15572)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Alexis Wangmene](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18197)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Texas Longhorns and Coach Rick
Barnes and his two student athletes, A.J. Abrams and Alexis Wangmene.  
Coach, congratulations on your victory today and your thoughts?  
RICK BARNES: I thought it was a great team win for us today. I thought that
everyone that went into the game really made a positive contribution. We
obviously got great play from our bench.  
And A.J., I'm really happy for him because he's worked hard for so long. He
and I talked last night a little bit and I said, you've gone way beyond being
a guy that just has to make shots to be effective.  
I actually think back at the beginning of February when we really started
becoming a better defensive team, he was the key guy in getting that started.
And we're all happy for him bouncing back and getting things going.  
I thought D.J. was masterful today the way he worked the game. And Damion and
Justin Mason and Connor, they do what they always do for us. They care of the
details and the dirty work. Alexis came in and gave us a great lift. I thought
Dexter's minutes were huge.  
So, again, it was a great, great team win and I'm also here now to serve
Alexis' translator, if you have a problem. If I can't understand it, A.J. will
take care of the rest because he's with him in the locker room.  
  
Q. Can you just detail -- I mean it is nice of Coach to say you are really
good at defense, but it's hard to play basketball when your shots aren't
dropping, I presume. Can you tell us what you've gone through.  
A.J. ABRAMS: I just haven't been making shots. Like Coach said, he says I've
gotten a lot better of not just being a shooter on the court and getting lost
on the defensive end, I can contribute. Just playing defense and helping my
teammates out on that end. But, you know, he did a great job. We had a talk
last night and he boosted my confidence a lot for just the couple things he
said to me and what I do for this team. That really helped.  
RICK BARNES: You can't ask Alexis a question if you can't pronounce his last
name.  
  
Q. A.J., just talk a little bit about finally hitting some shots, though.
That has to feel good.  
A.J. ABRAMS: It feels real good right now, just finally knocking down some
shots, helping my teammates on the offensive end as well as the defense. But
my teammates did a good job of setting screens for me and D.J. did a great job
of penetrating and kicking the ball tonight.  
Fortunately I was knocking in shots.  
  
Q. Alexis, you are a wonderful man, I don't know how to pronounce your last
name but I am going to ask you a question anyway. Talk about this team, this
resurgence. Do you guys feel like going into the championship team and beyond
you can play with anybody in the country and compete for a national
championship?  
ALEXIS WANGMENE: I think we're able to play against whatever team in the
country because we have such a good player as D.J. and A.J. and we have a good
coach. So all we need to do is go out there and compete and play hard. Like
Coach always said, the person who played the hardest will always win, so ...  
  
Q. You guys have been close before, but just talk about how good would it
feel to actually come out and win this thing Saturday?  
A.J. ABRAMS: It would feel great for us. We have been working since the summer
and the preseason for this game. We took care of business the past two games
and got to where we wanted to be. So now it is just all about effort and
competing, whoever the team we play against. I think we just have to go out
there and compete and play hard.  
  
Q. A.J., they went on a 7-0 run there at the start of the half to tie the
game. You guys answered with a 11-0 run. Talk about the shots during that
stretch and just how big that stretch was to sort of kill their confidence.  
A.J. ABRAMS: The start of the second half, we didn't come out with the right
intensity and Coach let us know about it. And we had to raise the bar. We
needed to penetrate more and just lock in on the defensive end. I think that's
what we did. We kind of picked up our intensity on the defensive end, and that
translates to the offense.  
  
Q. Alexis, with Gary Johnson on the bench, did you feel extra pressure to
contribute?  
ALEXIS WANGMENE: You have to be ready to play, so we never know what's going
to happen during the game. So every night you just got to come out with the
right mind-set and go out there and compete so even Gary is not playing right
now. We got his back so we got a good thing in representing the bench.  
  
Q. You were a little more aggressive offensively tonight. Did you just feel
something there or was that something that coach had told you to do?  
ALEXIS WANGMENE: I just got a little confident and I got my tempo going, and I
figured out the guy, they weren't really guarding the big guys, so I used a
little bit. I got my confidence going and I made a shot.  
  
Q. Those post clothes you got, did you get those from Duncan or did you get
those after you moved here?  
ALEXIS WANGMENE: Probably. Some of the move --  
RICK BARNES: I actually got a time to get some more minutes here. You know
what you're saying?  
ALEXIS WANGMENE: We have been working on that all summer long and I have been
working with Coach Mack to use it during the game.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you very much. I will let you return to the locker room.  
Let's go to questions for Coach Barnes.  
  
Q. Rick, would you elaborate a little bit on what you got out of Dexter
tonight. A lot of rebounds? The defense, he helped slow Blake Griffin at
times, didn't he?  
RICK BARNES: He did and, you know, it's really -- there is no one to blame for
probably Dexter and Alexis and all those guys not playing more minutes than
probably me because I got to get them out there. And we actually went back and
showed them some foot age of us earlier in the year, the attitude we were
playing with in a couple early games.  
Actually, as I was watching it last night and Todd Wright put it together
about us being aggressive. I told him, the one thing I noticed watching those
clips you put together and those games, we played everybody. That's what I
told the team before the game. I said, I don't know how the game is going to
play but our thoughts are right now that we're going to try to get everybody
involved. You got to be ready. I thought yesterday when we called on Dexter, I
think he was a little bit surprised because he hadn't played very much.  
So I told him, I'm just telling you, those are our intentions. I don't know
how those games are going to shake out but you got to be ready.  
I could tell the difference in the way Lex came in the game and Dex came in
the game. I think it was huge with what he did.  
And we -- normally, we felt like we probably should play zone when he comes
in. But we actually said, hey, we are going to stay with our man and let Dex
go to work down there, see what he can do, and I thought he did a really good
job defensively. I thought he did a really good job rebounding the ball.  
  
Q. You guys have now beaten Oklahoma six straight times all by double digit.
Why the domination in this series of late and your thoughts on Oklahoma, are
they NCAA worthy --  
RICK BARNES: Oh, no doubt. I said back -- this is probably the hardest year
since I have been -- in the ten years I've been in the Big 12 -- to pick a
coach of the year because there are so many guys that did a great job and one
thing about Jeff Capel, he did an unbelievable job this year fighting through
the injuries, keeping his team where they are with the nonleague schedule,
everything.  
There's no -- Oklahoma is a NCAA team. But in terms of -- again, I don't think
it's dominance. I think obviously we've had some really good players in Texas
over the ten years I've been there. But in terms of what they do, they're hard
to play against. We got it going today. I mean, we really started shooting the
ball well. When we do that, we can be hard to guard.  
But, again, I have so many respect for what he's done in the short time being
there, but there is no -- there's no question they've got to be in the NCAA
tournament. They have to be.  
  
Q. D.J. has come up in the last six, seven games, he had a little slump
midway through the season, but it seems like he has picked things up even for
him in the last month. I wonder if you can talk about the leap he's given you
guys.  
RICK BARNES: I think where's really -- he's been terrific all year. But people
are going to look around and say, you know, we play him too many minutes.  
I go the other way and I think as a staff, our job is to get our best players
out there and he's gotten himself in a rhythm, too, and we don't want to break
his rhythm. Where he's really improved so much in the last month is his
concentration. In terms of understanding even more and more his teammates -- I
mean, he did an unbelievable job today knowing he had to come out in some way,
somehow get the pump primed for A.J. He made a conscious effort to look and
try to get him going and transitioned a couple times. He came down -- if you
were seeing him, his eyes were just darting.  
Again, there is no doubt he was looking for A.J. to get him going. And he's
done a great job of out of bounds situations, get guys talking more. But it is
just his concentration. Today, again, I thought he was masterful with the way
he worked the game for us.  
  
Q. If it does wind up being a rematch with Kansas tomorrow, any thoughts on
how that matchup sets up for your guys?  
RICK BARNES: Well, Kansas, I've said all along, I think they're the best team
we played all year. If that's what it gets down to, I am not going to assume
that's going to happen obviously because Texas A&M at their place beat us as
badly as we've been beaten all year. So regardless of who it is, we know -- I
mean, this time of year, it is ironic. We started out the tournament playing a
team we played a week ago and now we got another game tonight where I think
these guys played the same day, I think or maybe the day before.  
It will be a hard-fought game for either team.  
At this time of year, especially in your league when you're -- everybody knows
each other so well, it is really hard. It is really hard. But hopefully,
again, whoever it is, I just hope we can come out and put 40 minutes together
and see what happens.  
  
Q. Obviously you got your eyes on next week. What would it mean to you and
the upper classmen to get over the hump on Sunday and win this thing?  
RICK BARNES: Well, I think any time you go out to compete it means something.
Again, having a chance to win a conference championship -- and we've been here
a couple times. I'm not sure how many, but we haven't been able to finish it
off. Again, I don't think that's because of the lack of effort or want-to. I
think the ones we've been in, we've been beaten.  
But there's no doubt when you compete, you want to win and you really do want
to win. People will throw out there that, hey, next week these guys are young
enough, you don't think about next week right now. We haven't for the last
month and a half, I hope. But it is the next 40 minutes. It is a game of
habit. And so we've got a chance to continue to build to get better. That will
be our approach.  
Again, whoever the two teams end up being tomorrow, believe me, both teams are
going to go out there and play as hard as they can play and try to get a
championship.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, your thought on today's game?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: We lost again to another great basketball team and we
played Texas three times. All three games were very close, even in the last
minute, two minutes of the game.  
They found a way to make plays down the stretch and that's what great teams
do. And I thought a big key today was we let Damian James really get going
from the three-point line, and then we had a hard time ever getting him under
control. Finishes with 23 points and 11 rebounds.  
He hit back-to-back 3s against our zone when Marcus Dove was out of the game.
I thought that was a big point in the game to get his confidence going because
Terrel was matched up on that side of the court in the zone with him, and
Damian is just 4 inches taller. He is able to shoot over the top of him and I
thought that really fed his confidence and the way that we start the second
half, we didn't come out with the same energy level and they took it to us
right off the bat on that 12-0 run and playing uphill the rest of the way.  
They made the plays once we got down to 3. James made a great play to push it
back to 5. And then I think it was a 5-point game again, he blocked Terrel
Harris's shot in the corner that looked like he would get a wide-open look
with the possibility to cut it to 2 points. I thought he came up huge.
Augustin played a great team as well.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach. Let's go to questions for the student
athletes.  
  
Q. Ibrahima, can you discuss the start difference for you between the first
half and the second half? Scoring?  
IBRAHIMA THOMAS: The first half, I just do what the coaches ask me to do. I
mean, like make a couple shots, took a couple shots from the three-point line.  
In the second half, we just didn't come out with the same intensity we came
out in the first half and make a good run.  
  
Q. Obi, what happened in the second half? You guys went in with all the
momentum, Terrel hit a three-pointer. You come out and you guys just seemed
not to be able to score. What happened?  
OBI MUONELOO: We just -- we went flat. I felt like in the second half, we came
out, like Thomas said, with no intensity. Defensively, we didn't have the
intensity we showed the first half and let them get off to an easy start,
making two quick buckets. I guess they went on a 12-0 run. That's what they
said in the locker room, and I think that really hurt us.  
  
Q. Ibrahima, what got into you in the first four minutes of that game; I
think you scored 16 of the first 21 points including 10 straight?  
IBRAHIMA THOMAS: Just like I said, I just do what the coaches asked me to do.
I mean, the lane was open and I just -- the shots was going in, we were
playing well.  
  
Q. Obi, if this is the last game of this season for you guys, just how would
you sum up the season for you, how would you characterize this year?  
OBI MUONELOO: Some of the season -- this is a team that never really showed
what they can really do. All of us know that we're capable of more than this,
all my teammates, the coaches, we know we're better than our record shows.
That's really how I sum up the season.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you return to your locker room with. We'll keep Coach
here for a little while. Now we'll take questions for Coach Sutton.  
  
Q. Sean, what are the prospects of post-season tournament for the Cowboys?
Have you thought about that yet? And maybe sum up the season as well.  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I haven't because our whole focus and concentration was on
winning this tournament. I felt like the way we were playing, I knew we would
have to play well today to beat Texas, but I thought we were capable and
really thought we'd win the game. So I've not given it much thought on terms
of the season.  
I told our guys afterwards that I was really proud of them. They've grown up a
lot. We started with not much experience and they've proven over the last four
to five weeks that we're a good basketball team. It is too bad that some of
these younger players maybe didn't develop a little bit quicker early in the
conference. We lost a lot of close games right off the bat. They kept fighting
through the course of the season and made a lot of improvements.  
I'm disappointed that we're not going to be in the NCAA tournament, but I'm
certainly not disappointed in their effort. They worked their tails off. And
the guys we have coming back, I think that team has a chance to have a heck of
a season.  
  
Q. I had heard your athletic director said CBI is out. It is NIT or nothing;
is that correct?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I think so, yes.  
  
Q. Also, during the game where you guys hit I believe 4 out of 7 straight 3s
and really got it back within a three-point game, it seemed like Texas was
content for a little while to trade baskets and run with you. Was the key of
the game when they decided, no, they won't match and James went inside?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, he called time out and they designed the play that
really overloaded the zone. And James Anderson did not cross the floor. He
basically had four guys on one side. And he was over here in his normal
position, and he didn't rotate over to take James and let a lay-up and pushed
it up to 5 at that point.  
And we came down, that's when James blocked Terrel's shot that would have cut
it to it. I thought Terrel was about to get a great look in the corner, and
James just made a spectacular play and blocked the shot. And then they came
back. Mason drove it in there late in the shot clock and got to the glass.  
So they made two consecutive plays to push it back up to 7. That's what great
teams do.  
As I've said, there's nobody that I respect any more than Rick Barnes and his
staff. I think that their team, because of the personnel they have, they could
play multiple styles. They can play fast. They can play slow. They can really
shoot the basketball and they also have an inside presence with James and some
of their younger post players.  
I think they have the ingredients to make a run and get to the Final Four.
They'll have to play well. You can't have an off game in NCAA tournament. But
they're certainly a really, really fine basketball team.  
  
Q. I know Byron only sat for a minute and a half after the fourth. Did
having four fouls take something away from him?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: I thought he came in and played well. It was a 12-point
game and 10:30 to go. And I felt like there is no use saving him over here. If
we are going to get back in the game, he is going to have to get back in the
action and play a part of it.  
While he did score a lot, he had nine assists and one turnover. I thought he
penetrated well during that stretch that we got back into it and got Terrel
Harris and Obi and some of those guys some open looks.  
He just wasn't quite himself at the offensive end. He couldn't knock down some
shots, but he made some great plays for his teammates. And probably limited
him a little bit defensively the last ten minutes because of being in foul
trouble. I didn't think it affected his offensive game.  
  
Q. Sean, your program has always prided itself on defense. Can you just talk
about moving forward without one of the greatest defensive players this
program has ever had in Marcus Dove?  
COACH SEAN SUTTON: Well, I mean -- he epitomizes, I think, what our program
stands for. He has got great character. He's got a lot of pride and passion
for Oklahoma State. He's somebody that was not a heavily recruited player,
yet, made himself into a very good college basketball player.  
I would put him as maybe the best defender that we've ever had in our program.
We've always taken a lot of pride in defense, and most years have had a
defensive stopper. And Marcus embraced that role early and having the luxury
of going up against Tony Allen and Joey Graham and John Lucas. But to win
back-to-back defensive player of the year in this league, I think says what a
great defender he is.  
Because of that, he's put himself in position to be able to play in the NBA. I
think he'll get a lot of looks and at some point, I'll be shocked if he is not
in a NBA team. He is so versatile. At that level, he will be able to guard
three different positions. At college level, he can guard five. The way he has
improved his offense, he would make the NBA just solely because he is such a
great defender.  
Always worked hard. Always played hard, very popular with his teammates and
certainly going to miss not having him around.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Bryan Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18161)

### [Dominique Kirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17779)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll joined now by Texas A&M and Coach Mark Turgeon, his two
student athletes are Bryan Davis and Dominique Kirk. Coach, we'll call on you
first for your comments on tonight.  
MARK TURGEON: Well, it's just a great win for us. Beating K-State in Kansas
City, you know, they got a great team, great players.  
They whipped us pretty good at their place, you know, and the sky was falling
in Aggie-land when they beat us the first time. So this one meant a lot to us.  
Dominique Kirk did what he did in the NCAA tournament last year, really
stepped up. Made two just -- we had nothing going. Their pressure was
something else. We couldn't get anything going. Dominique just made two back-
to-back big 3s. At the end we got the stops we needed. I thought we did a
great job on Beasley. The last eight minutes of the game we had more help on
him and we made him take tough shots.  
He jumps in and draws contact and we just talk to our guys about putting their
hands back all night and absorbing the contact and make sure the officials
knew who was making contact. We got just enough rebounds, made just enough
free throws, made enough shots and survived. It is great for us.  
We've won game in the Big 12 tournament in 11 years and we got two in two
days, we feel pretty good about ourselves.  
  
Q. Dominique, when you banked in that three-pointer to beat the shot clock,
at that point did you feel it was going to be your night?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, I knew the shot clock was going down. There was three
seconds left on the shot clock, and I was just trying to get it up there. It
was just a prayer. It went in, went off the glass and made it. I was trying to
go out there and just be aggressive.  
  
Q. Dominique, even though this was a close game down the stretch, do you
kind of feel like you had control of the game pretty much throughout?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I thought we had pretty good control of the game. They made a
great run on us. You just can't hold down a great team, if you got a great
player on their team like Michael Beasley, they are hard to hold down. We went
out there and just tried to execute every play. We just went out there and
just did it.  
  
Q. Tell me about facing Michael Beasley and then his shot toward the end and
all how that unravelled for you?  
BRYAN DAVIS: Michael Beasley is a great player. We just all try to come out
and play him as tough as we can and just so happy the last shot came out.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how sweet this is? I mean, this is your
fourth time to come to the Big 12 tournament. Obviously a lot of frustrations
in the past.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It is very sweet, you know. Can't really celebrate too much.
We got the Jayhawks coming in playing tomorrow and got to get ready for that
game. That will be another great battle for us and we got to go out there and
compete.  
CHARLIE FISS: Okay, we'll let you go back to the locker room. Questions now
for Coach? Congratulations on your victory.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the plans to try and shorten the game a little bit.
Was that part of the plan at all to hold the ball to drain the shot clock a
little bit?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, we have been playing this way for a while and, you know,
it was hard for us just to get a shot off. I thought their defense the second
half was fantastic.  
But, no, we're playing a little bit more deliberate. We have been in foul
trouble and just trying to survive games. They're so explosive, you know, we
weren't going to win an 80-point game. They're averaging 79 points a game,
79.6 or something like that. So we just told our guys if we are going to win,
it had to be in the high 50s or low 60s and that's what it was.  
You know, I thought defensively for the most part we were pretty darn good out
there. We rebounded pretty well. They average about 16, almost 17 offensive
rebounds a game. We held them to 11. And they got a couple right there at the
end.  
They weren't making as many jump shots. We played at their place, Bill Walker
and Beasley hit every jump shot; tonight they weren't. It makes a big
difference. There is a fine line between a lot of teams in college basketball.
Beasley's shot went all the way in and came out. It was our night and then we
made two free throws.  
We'll take it.  
  
Q. You've been to the NCAA tournament, Sweet 16 and you've played these guys
twice this year. Do you feel that this is a NCAA caliber team that you played
against tonight?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, yeah, there's no question. They are a heck of a basketball
team. They are not playing with the same confidence they played with when we
played them in January, not quite the same animal.  
But, no, they deserve it. Whenever you got a player like Beasley, you can beat
anybody. This time of year they're hard to come by.  
But, no, I think our league deserves a lot of teams in and they're one of
them. To win ten games in the second-rated league in the country, they deserve
in. They deserve in the tournament and I think they'll do well.  
  
Q. Coach, you will be facing Kansas for the second time in less and week.
With the quick turnaround in tournament play, does that help being familiar
with a team like that and just talk about what your team will need tomorrow?  
MARK TURGEON: All we're going to do is rest between now and 3:00 tomorrow.
Yeah, playing them a week ago is going to help us. We're not going to change
anything. They're not going to change anything. I'm a little concerned. They
didn't play well tonight for them. They're going to start with a lot more
energy than they did tonight.  
KU to me is all about energy. When they have high energy, they're good. They
had unbelievable energy at our place a week ago and we didn't play that bad. I
mean, people can say what they want, we didn't finish the game well and we've
done that a few times this year but I mean, we played well.  
So I'm a little nervous going into tomorrow knowing they will be a lot fresher
than we are. And we will have be to a little bit deeper and play with a little
more depth and our guys will have to step up and try to hang around. They
watched the same game you watched tonight so they're going to come after us
and pressure us and we got to be able to handle it.  
But we're looking forward to it. They whipped us pretty good on senior day,
especially down the stretch. So we're looking forward to hopefully giving them
a little bit better game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you told your guys in the last eight
seconds right after you made the free throws and what you were expecting them
to do?  
MARK TURGEON: Here's the deal. I played for a guy that always -- he always
communicated with the players and asked the players what they wanted.  
I grabbed Dominique coming off the floor and I said, "Dominique, do you want
to foul?"  
"What do you want to do, Coach?"  
"I want to do what you guys want to do."  
So he grabbed me and we went over there and we all huddled up and we were
grabbing each other, and the guys said, Coach, we can get a stop."  
So we subbed Beau, we switched all screens and we got a stop. We gave them one
too many shots but we did everything right until the offensive rebound. Then
the guy made a great play throwing it out.  
They're playing the game. They are out in the middle of it. Obviously if they
hit a 3 and went into the overtime and we lost, I would be taking the blame
and not be telling you this story. I will tell you the story now because we
won and I just wanted to know what they wanted to do.  
  
Q. Can you give us a health report on DeAndre?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, yeah, I mean, he ate a little bit today. He got some sleep.
His mom forced it down him, but he obviously didn't have it. We gave him a
shot. Hopefully he will be able to help us tomorrow. They are a much bigger
team and it wasn't really a great team for DeAndre to play against. Hopefully
he will get some food down him tonight and we will have him back for a few
minutes tomorrow.  
Beau is playing his tail off and Junior is playing his tail off and we've had
two great wins. So we'll see. But I hope we have him. We need a little bit
more depth tomorrow.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you. Congratulations.

### [Ade Dagunduro](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18183)

### [Aleks Maric](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13719)

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Nebraska Cornhuskers and Coach Doc
Sadler and his two student athletes, Ade Dagunduro and Aleks Maric.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
DOC SADLER: I think it was a game of two halves. First of all, I couldn't be
more proud of my basketball team. They gave me every ounce of energy and
effort that you could give. And that's what it's about. I mean, also we wanted
to win the game. We came into this game thinking that we could get it down the
last five or six minutes and have a chance to win.  
You know, the first 20 minutes went that way. You know a team as good as
Kansas that second half is going to come out and just try to knock you out
that first five minutes. And we just -- they hit us hard and we didn't respond
aggressively. That's when the game kind of changed a little bit.  
And, you know, physically, as you play 40 minutes and we're having to play
some different line-ups because Ryan Anderson really couldn't play tonight
because of his ankle, even though we tried, you're so small. And after 40
minutes, you know all of a sudden the offensive rebounds take place, the
turnovers take place. They're such a good basketball team, that can happen.
Again, I couldn't be prouder of the way we played.  
  
Q. Aleks, can you talk about comparing this game to the previous four games
you played Kansas. What was different and when did you realize that you could
play with these guys?  
ALEKS MARIC: I mean, it was a big difference. I think we definitely -- we
brought it to them in the first half. I mean, you know, we didn't take a step
back. We brought it to them and we gave it everything we had.  
  
Q. Ade, would you answer that question as well? People outside look and see
that you guys lose by 35 and 31 and you're ahead of these guys at the half and
take it to them most of the game. How does a team effect such a change?  
ADE DAGUNDURO: It was just a matter of us hitting them in the mouth before
they hit us. Coach told us we got to play with confidence and that's what we
did for the most part of the game, pretty much all of the game.  
And they responded well early in the second half and they took the lead and we
couldn't bounce back like we wanted to.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you go back to the locker room. Now we'll take
questions for Coach Sadler.  
  
Q. Did you do anything that was much different game plan-wise than the other
two games against Kansas?  
DOC SADLER: I think, again, going back to the Texas A&M game where I think we
started controlling and understanding tempo and things like that, when you're
playing against a team that is, you know, deeper and more talented maybe -- I
don't know -- and you have some success, you get that idea and then you follow
it up with some games.  
So I think it was easier, kind of like your question yesterday, the step --
you know, is there some positive steps? I think it is easier when you have
some success doing something that way for them to follow it and not lose --
not get impatient and understand that, you know, you may end up taking a bad
shot with two seconds but that's okay. It is a 40-minute game.  
And then, you know, the first half we hit some shots. More than anything, it's
not that we strategically did that much more, I just think that guys did a
better job in shot selection as far as time management.  
  
Q. Ade said we had to come out and punch them in the mouth. That's what you
wanted them to do. Did your guys play maybe a perfect game in the first half
and what happened in the second half?  
DOC SADLER: I don't think so. Again, you know, I thought we played well the
first half but I don't know that we played near perfect. But I thought there
were some big plays there that could have helped and we didn't make those
plays.  
The second half I mean, I think more than anything it's just a physical thing.
Those guys are so much more athletic and bigger and, you know, our guys got
wore down. We gave up four offensive rebounds the first half and 10 the second
half and we turned the basketball over quite a bit more often in the second
half. And we didn't shoot it quite as well.  
You know, at times, guys, we had four guys, 6' 1" or smaller on the floor. You
got to give our guys credit for fighting. Paul Velander was guarding Darrell
Arthur and doing a nice job because he is just tough.  
  
Q. Doc, you look at the stats, you make the same number of shots. In
essence, you lose it at the free-throw line. Is that part of a byproduct
sometimes of how aggressive your guys have to play?  
DOC SADLER: I think so, you know. Enough said.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the effort that you applauded earlier. From a
grander perspective, I guess, throughout the whole season, how much do these
guys buy into what you are trying to do and how much can they build on that
heading into next year?  
DOC SADLER: I don't know. I mean -- I think that -- I think we're playing
pretty good basketball right now, so obviously I think they've bought in what
we're trying to do up there.  
We're not close to being where we need to be. But I do think the guys we have
in the program understand what toughness can do for you and so we'll be all
right. We'll be all right.  
  
Q. If there were ever a loss that you feel good about, would this be it?  
DOC SADLER: No.  
  
Q. Why is that?  
DOC SADLER: I'm not one of those dudes that get much out of losing. We didn't
come into this game tonight to play close. So, you know, so ...  
I'm sure there are some people that look at a close loss and what we've done
from January to whatever that date was to now as that we've improved as a
basketball team, but we've got to get to the level that no matter who we're
playing we want to win. We don't want to play close. So ...  
Appreciate y'all. Thanks so much.

### [Sherron Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17030)

### [Sasha Kaun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15569)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self and his
two student athletes, Sherron Collins and Sasha Kaun.  
Coach, congratulations on your victory and your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH BILL SELF: Me first? I thought the second half we played a lot better
than we did the first half. But I thought Nebraska was -- and I think these
guys would agree, did a great job controlling pace the first half. We turned
it over. I think the stat was they had 15 points off our turnovers and we had
0 off of theirs. So that's, in large part, why they controlled the first half.
And defensively we weren't horrible. They only had 27 or so the first half.  
But second half we played with much better energy. You can ask these guys
this, I thought we played tight the first half. And second half, you know, the
ball got in the hole a couple of times and kind of loosened us up and played a
lot better.  
  
Q. Sherron and Sasha, at what point at the end of the first half did you
feel there was a turning point? Was it when they were reviewing the play? It
just seemed like the energy picked up right there at the end before the half
where you guys just looked at the game a little different or the energy level
went up. Can you kind of describe when you felt things turned for you guys?  
SHERRON COLLINS: During the first half, we knew we just had to change from the
first half. We just came out -- like Coach said, we are a little tight and
things did go our way and we turned the ball over.  
During the game, I think we had a small little run and got the lead down to
five. I think we went into the locker room, a little bit momentum on our
shoulders, we knew we had to change it anyway.  
SASHA KAUN: Like Sherron said, I think after the last media time out we came
out from the huddle and we played a little bit more with energy. Coach said we
have to cut the lead and that's what we did and it helped us go into the
second half.  
  
Q. It looked like you were never going to be 100% this year but you looked
very close now. How is your health and how long have you been feeling this
good physically?  
SHERRON COLLINS: I'm feeling fine right now, feeling good. I have been feeling
pretty good since about the K-State game a few weeks back. Just been doing a
good job, getting treatment and trainer has been doing good with me and giving
me a lot of treatment and getting me to this point.  
And I think I am real close to 100% and I won't look back. I don't think I
will be bothered with any of my injuries.  
  
Q. Sherron, do you think when you've had as much success as you guys had
against the team like Nebraska this year, do you think maybe that's why you
get off to a slow start? Do you kind of look ahead when you have beaten them
so bad the first two times?  
SHERRON COLLINS: I think that's half of the reason. The other reason is
knowing Kansas and we basically play with a target on our back. We're going to
get everybody's shot. You know, this is the Big 12 tournament. For some
people, it means a lot to them. They got -- they are going to give us their
best shot. We didn't come out to match their intensity. We didn't match the
energy. We were flat. And we just didn't come out ready to play.  
  
Q. Sherron, it looked like it got a little interesting at the end, got a
little chippy. What was going on out there?  
SHERRON COLLINS: I feel the last foul that he made, I just feel he didn't go
for the ball. I just felt that -- a little cheap shot. I shouldn't have lost
my cool. I should have kept my composure a little bit more than I did. I just
start chattering with him, and I shouldn't have did that.  
  
Q. Sherron, it looked like early in the game you were really into being a
leader and emotional. Do you feel like this is a time for you to really put
your personality on this team?  
SHERRON COLLINS: Yeah, I think it should have been done. But I know I was
bothered with injuries and stuff wasn't going right. I kept good attitude
during that, but I think sometimes when I'm out there, somebody needs to talk
and speak up and I try to be the one to do it if nobody else is doing it.  
I know we needed a boost, and I just tried to keep encouraging my teammates
when things are going wrong or not our way.  
  
Q. Sasha, how much do you get up for playing Maric? You are both seniors and
this is the last time you are seeing him?  
SASHA KAUN: It was definitely an exciting game for me, especially after this
past summer, I got to know him a little bit better and kind of going -- become
little bit of friends and just fun playing against each other. He is a great
player. I love playing against him. It was kind of sad it was the last time
for us to go against each other. But definitely it is a lot of fun.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you for coming. Congratulations on your victory.  
  
Q. Bill, those two guys coming off the bench the way they're playing right
now and Sherron being 100%, it seems like it gives you a hell of a boost going
into the tournament?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think so. You could make a case that tonight those were our
two best performers. I don't think there's probably any doubt about that. You
could make a case that Sherron has been as good a performer as we've had the
last two to three weeks. Sasha has been rock solid off the bench. You know,
one thing tonight, coaches role the dice. When Sherron got his second foul. I
pulled him and we lost a little bit of energy when I pulled him.  
You know, coaches have to have trust in their players playing without fouling.
And he starts out the second half with picking up his third just like that
(snapping fingers). Maybe it was a smart play, I don't know. Those two, Sasha
is a stabilizer and Sherron is the guy that is the boost -- energy boost.  
You know we definitely need those guys. When those two aren't playing well, we
almost have to go five for five. When those two aren't playing well, we can go
five for seven and we are in still pretty good shape because you can have five
guys that are productive out on the court all the time.  
  
Q. Bill, how frustrating has it been for Sherron not to be at full speed all
year and what kind of lift does it give you guys when he is at 100% like it
seems he has been at the last couple weeks?  
COACH BILL SELF: He is the as best the player we have, period. You could make
a case that Mario or Brandon or Shady (Darrell Arthur) or Darnell at all
points in time during the season have been our best player. Sherron has played
as well as anybody in our program has played during their hot stretches. He is
as important as anybody we have.  
But one thing about him, he lives for ball and it's been a very, very
frustrating, humbling year for him because he's done what he's supposed to do
to get himself back but he just hasn't caught many breaks. But, you know, if
he's healthy when it counts the most, then, you know, really what's happened
up until this point, we're not going to remember that much. It is going to be
from this point forward.  
So it is nice to have him at full strength.  
  
Q. At the end of the game when Sherron gets the technical, he just said he
should have kept his composure. But time and score you were comfortably ahead.
It was a cheap shot. As the coach, do you have a problem with the way he
reacted there or does it bring a spark to your team that shows he will fight
back and not take that?  
COACH BILL SELF: I think you can show a spark and not fight back without
getting a technical.  
The one thing about being a player, a mature player, is always next play.
There's a point in time where you can do that, and you say cheap shot. I don't
-- he fouled him. The foul was called. I mean, that happens. Hard fouls happen
sometimes. So maybe it was. Maybe it wasn't. Who knows, but there's a way to
conduct your business and get your point across without getting T'd up. I
didn't like it. But I know what you're saying. But I love the fire, he just
has to do a better job of controlling it.  
  
Q. With the way Sherron is playing and the play of Russell and Mario, as you
go forward here, do you do anything subtle with the minutes for those three
guys, as you give more to Sherron?  
COACH BILL SELF: There is no doubt we will. But he's got to also play without
fouling. Against A&M he played 32 minutes. He's a guy that without foul
issues, off the bench, he should be playing close to 30 a night. So if he's
playing well.  
The whole thing -- one of the great things about our team is all four of them
don't have to play great but it would be nice if three of them do. So whoever
the -- the three best playing guys that night, you can play the majority of
the minutes, but the way he's playing right now, I don't see a scenario that's
not -- he's not going to be out there more.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to your team at halftime? You were trailing by
five at the time. And it seemed like a complete difference in intensity from
the first half to the second.  
COACH BILL SELF: I will be real candid, I was very disappointed in our team in
the first half. I was disappointed how we got frustrated. I was disappointed
in our energy level. Not that we weren't trying, sometimes people say you play
with lack of energy, that means you don't care. That's not it at all. We
played tight. When you play tight, you don't play with as much energy.  
And we had a collection of guys not play particularly well and we started the
game off getting the ball two feet and we turn it over. It was just one of
those deals where things just didn't go well.  
But the thing I was most disappointed in, we are athletic enough that we
should be a great loose-ball team and they beat us to the loose balls. So to
me that's a sign of being sharp and being focused and energetic. We didn't
talk about Xs and Os. We just talked about getting back to who we are, if it
means as much to you as I think it does. And I thought they performed pretty
well the second half, especially starting out.  
  
Q. As you use this weekend to get ready for the NCAA tournament, is there a
better matchup for you tomorrow to start to get ready? Is it a team with
Beasley and Walker where you have to defend two guys like that or a team
approach that A &M would throw at you? Which is better for this team to get
them ready?   
COACH BILL SELF: You know, I don't know. Obviously K-State handled us the
first time we played them and played better the second time.  
A&M, we played our best road game of the season probably down there. But we
know they're capable of playing with us and having a great chance to win, if
they perform.  
I don't know which is -- I don't know which prepares you more. But I will say
this, both of them are great preparation games. I think they're both great
games because you are going to see similar styles in the tournament. You may
see a team that has one or two guys that score 60% of their points, you may
play a team whose leading score average is 12. I think they are both
preparation games.  
  
Q. When you guys came here in December and played, we talked and you said,
Sherron had this nagging injury and that it would fix itself at some point.
Did you ever give up and was like, "Damn, it will never be right and he will
never be 100%," and it seems like out of nowhere, wham?   
COACH BILL SELF: I will tell you, we didn't give up. We thought when he
bruised his knee the week before the Colorado game at home, we didn't see any
improvement over time. You know, if you watched us play Oklahoma State, he was
no factor. Iowa State, he wasn't much of a factor. Colorado at home, he wasn't
a factor.  
And then it was almost like one day he was able to run without it catching or
where he felt very little pain. So we talked about this, even the training
staff said he may not get back all the way this year. But I think he is. I
don't think there's anything holding him back health-wise right now.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Tony Crocker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18175)

### [Taylor Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18176)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Jeff Capel
and his two student athletes this afternoon will be Tony Crocker and Taylor
Griffin.  
Coach, congratulations on your victory. Your thoughts on the day?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: We felt very fortunate to get the win. Obviously, you know,
it wasn't a pretty game for either team, but we found a way to make some
plays, get some stops, maybe fatigue had something to do with it with Colorado
on some of those shots that they took.  
We found a way to get a win. At this time of year, that's all that matters, is
just winning. It doesn't matter how pretty it is. It is just a matter of
having more points than the other team, and we were able to do that today.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about just how -- even if it's Colorado, which no hope
for the NCAA unless they went out -- the tournament can be good for you guys
just preparing you for next week, tournament atmosphere, neutral court, that
kind of thing?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: You know, it is the closest thing you can get. You're not used
to not having any time to warm up really. You only get whatever amount of time
they give you. So, you know, it is just like the NCAA, and it is good practice
for us.  
But, again, we got to be able to get prepared better than we did today in a
short amount of time.  
TONY CROCKER: I think it's good for us. It is just giving us more game -- more
practice to work on stuff against other teams, giving us a chance to play
together more, like seeing how we're going to do with adversity. They fought
back today. They played a good game today, and it was just -- it is teaching
us how to overcome things and fight through it.  
  
Q. Tony, I want to ask you, the team had missed four straight free throws in
the final minute; you had missed two, you were short on both of them. What
went through your mind when you went up the next time you shot the free
throws?  
TONY CROCKER: Just take my time and get the ball over the front of the rim,
you know. I work in practice with Coach on just keeping it straight and
getting on my toes with my shoot to get it over. I just focus on trying --
just trying to make it for the team.  
  
Q. Guys, you got out to a 10-0 lead. It looked like it might be a pretty
good game for you and then things changed. What did change after you continued
with the hot start?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: I thought they started attacking more. We got out to an 8-0 or
10-0 start, and I thought they started trying to get to the basket more. And I
think we were kind of playing back on our heels a little bit. You know, they
came at us and, you know, that's one thing we talked about is getting off to a
good start and keep attacking.  
You know, we did get off to a good start but, you know, we let them be the
aggressor for however long that was.  
  
Q. Taylor, could you talk about what is going to be the key tomorrow against
the Texas team that you have lost to twice?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: You know, everybody knows they're a good team. They got one of
the best point guards in the nation. They got good athletes in every position.
We've lost to them four straight times over the last two years and it's time
for a win.  
We got to be able to defend them. We got to be able to stop Augustin and we
got to be able to put some points up ourselves.  
  
Q. Toney, I wish you would expound on that, talk about Texas. Taylor, I want
to come back to you, did you guys take a step back with the way you played
against Colorado?  
TONY CROCKER: Getting ready for tomorrow's game, you know, we just got to
forget about today. Of course, we know we had some slip-ups. We went on a
lead. We kind of set back and stopped going at them like we were and they came
back and that kept it close throughout the whole game.  
But going forward with tomorrow, we just got to work on their stuff, going
over trying to keep their guards in front. They got a great guard. Just work
on containing all of them and putting points up.  
  
Q. Did you take a step back with the way you played today in this game as to
how you have been playing prior to the tournament?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: We've had three pretty good games before this. I guess you
thought it was a step back. It definitely wasn't a good game for us as a team.
It was good in the fact that we won, but I don't think anybody played great,
maybe not even good. But it was enough to get the job done.  
But, you know, now it's over, we got the win, and we got a good Texas team
tomorrow.  
CHARLIE FISS: All right, guys, we'll let you go back to your locker room.
Congratulations on your victory.  
Now let's go to questions for Coach Capel.  
  
Q. Coach, back to the Blake Griffin question. He had 15 minutes, did he get
hurt in the game or what was the reason of him not being as big a factor
today?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: He rebounded well, but that was about it. You know, they
were doubling, tripling down in the post. And he was passing the ball back
out, didn't score as well as he had been scoring, as he scored for us all
year.  
We just had a different lineup on the floor. We had guys playing better, to be
quite honest with you, and we went with that group.  
  
Q. Do you like conference tournaments? You are not going to get rid of them,
but do you like them?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: They're fine. They're exciting, especially a tournament like
this. You have so many good teams in one arena. I think it is great for the
fans. I think it is great for our kids, for every team. You get a chance to
participate and it gives everyone hope, even teams that maybe have no post-
season hope, they still have a little bit, maybe a spark if something magical
can happen.  
You've seen that at different times throughout the years of college
basketball, or you've seen a team that has been a 10 or 11 or 12 seed all of a
sudden make it to the finals. So, yeah, they're fine.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Texas and what maybe you have to do
different and the challenges they present?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: Well, I think they're one of the best teams in the country.
I've said this before, if you look at their body of work and what they've done
all year, I think they're as good as anyone. I think they have the best point
guard in the country. They have two other all-conference guys in Abrams who's
quietly had a tremendous year. Damion James, second team all-league guy;
Connor Atchley, all defensive guy; Justin Mason, all defensive guy. They are
the epitome of a team. They understand who they are. They understand what the
strengths of their team are. They have great guards. Not good guards; they
have great guards and they can make shots. They can beat you off the bounce.  
I thought when we played them in Austin, I thought we did a pretty good job
defensively on everyone especially for Augustin. Augustin is such a tough guy
for anyone to cover, but for the game, I think Texas shot under 40%. I thought
we did a really good job at their place defending the three-point line. If I'm
not mistaken they were one or two for something for the game.  
So we defended them well enough. We have to be able to score points twice
against Texas this year. That was our downfall. At our place we had a lead and
I think at the 11-minute mark, 12-minute mark, it was a tie game. And we went
through one of those stretches where we couldn't score.  
Texas is a team we know is going to score. We have to be able to score and
still defend them at a high level.  
  
Q. Give us your evaluation of this game and your thoughts on how your team
played against the 12th seed?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I don't think we played well, but at this time of year, it
is about surviving and advancing. And that's what we were able to do. We were
able to make some plays. I thought we did some good things at times but we
couldn't be consistent with it. Hopefully what we did today was that we were
able to knock off some rust.  
I think you have to give Colorado a lot of credit, though. They're a hard team
to prepare for because of the style in which they play. You know, you have
Richard Roby who is now the all-time leading scorer in their program's history
right at 2,000 points, either a little bit below, a little bit above. Hall is
a guy that's scored over 1,000 points. They have two really, really good
players who are both seniors, who are older.  
But I just thought for us, we couldn't make shots. Hopefully we got that out
of us today. You know, we let some -- had some bad turnovers, some times when
we felt like we had a chance to stretch the lead. I think it was a 7-point
game and we missed four straight free throws from guys that are pretty good
free throw shooters for us, so we didn't play well.  
But I thought we did a pretty good job defensively. Held them to 34% shooting.
Like I said earlier, some of it may have been fatigue on their part. We knew
they had played a 50-minute game yesterday. And Robby, Hall and Higgins had
played 50, 48 and 46 minutes. So maybe that had a little bit to do with it.
But regardless, we found a way to win. So we're pleased about that. We're not
pleased about how we played, but I'm pleased that we won. It is certainly a
better feeling than what we had in Boulder.  
  
Q. You guys played pretty good team defense today. Do you think that's a
good launching point for Texas?  
COACH JEFF CAPEL: I thought we did some good things. We still gave up some
drives and our help side wasn't as good as it has been in the past.  
Like I said, maybe part of it with them, they missed some shots. They were
short on some shots late and that probably had a lot to do with fatigue. But
we know it is a tough challenge for us tomorrow but our guys have responded to
challenges this year. We'll be ready. We'll muster up some energy and we'll be
ready. We have to be. They're really, really good so we'll be ready.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Marcus Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15566)

### [Richard Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13912)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Ready for the Colorado Buffaloes and Coach Bzdelik and his two
student athletes, Marcus Hall and Richard Roby. Let's go to questions for the
student athletes.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk about how fatigued you were late in the game
after playing extended minutes in the double overtime yesterday.  
MARCUS HALL: Me personally I wasn't fatigued at all. I felt good. I have been
playing long minutes all year long. Other guys on other teams played long
minutes. I was prepared to come in and play our number of minutes. And fatigue
in my body was the last thing that hurt us at the end of the ball game.  
RICHARD ROBY: I don't think it affected us really. I think you got to give
Oklahoma credit. They did a good job defensively on us. You go to a basketball
game, you have to be mentally prepared for anything.  
  
Q. Marcus, you said fatigue wasn't a problem down the stretch. What was the
problem down the stretch?  
MARCUS HALL: Rebounding, you know, that was the biggest key. We said that
yesterday. That was a big key while we won the basketball yesterday. We knew
we had to come in today and rebound and we gave up 15 offensive rebounds. I'm
sure out of those 15 opportunities, they probably scored 50% of the time.  
  
Q. You came to within one and two a couple of times. Do you feel like you
had a lot of empty possessions with the ball when you could have tied it or
taken the lead? Do you feel like if you could have gotten over that hump, the
momentum would have gone your way?  
RICHARD ROBY: I believe so. We just couldn't get over that hump. Every time we
would get within one or two, we would miss a shot or turn the ball over and it
would lead to a basket for them. So we were always playing uphill, climbing
uphill.  
  
Q. I know an emphasis this year that coach has talked about is changing the
culture in the program. How has it changed over the course of the past year?  
MARCUS HALL: I think it has changed a lot within this one year. I know I
learned a lot just about the game itself. Me, personally, like I said, I've
always wanted to win, willing to do anything it takes to win and that's what
it's about. I think those -- the guys that are coming back, you know, are
realizing that you got to do the little things to win ball games.  
RICHARD ROBY: Yeah, I believe the culture is changing every day. You know,
everybody learned a lot this year and it was a learning process for a lot of
guys, even veterans like myself. There is still a lot to be learned.  
And the young guys have to know how hard it takes to win ball games and
nothing is gonna be easy. Winning is never easy.  
  
Q. Rich, can you talk about what reaching the scoring record means to you.  
RICHARD ROBY: When I look back on it in a few days, I'll probably be -- it
will be a great feeling. Right now trying hard to sink everything in that this
is the last game I'm playing in a Colorado uniform. There is a lot of
different emotions going on right now for me to even think about that.  
  
Q. Rich, did you even hear the announcement that you had set the record?  
RICHARD ROBY: Yeah, I heard the announcement. You know, but I was just trying
to stay focused on the game and pulling out this win. That's the only thing
that was on my mind at the time.  
  
Q. Rich, you said you are feeling a lot of emotions right now. What are
those emotions?  
RICHARD ROBY: Just kind of at awe that this is the last time I'm going to be
in a Colorado uniform, be teammates with guys like Marcus and Marcus King-
Stockton and to what the future has to hold for me.  
CHARLIE FISS: Okay, guys, we'll let you go back to the locker room. Thanks for
coming. We will take questions for Coach Bzdelik.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about your team getting so close and like the
players said, not being able to carry it to the next step and get over the
hump.  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Frustrating but successful people are only momentarily
frustrated, and that's how we feel. The experience is a great teacher.  
As these young men said -- first of all, I would like to just back up and
congratulate my seniors, all three of them, on their leadership, their effort.
They've represented this great university extremely well both on and off the
court and that's a credit to them as people.  
But, you know, as they talked about, we've been in a lot of ball games this
year with a chance to win. But we didn't block off several times tonight as
Marcus Hall said. We yielded 15 offensive rebounds. We never culminated our
defense by rebounding the ball.  
Offensively, this offense takes great energy. Our lack of depth and the fact
that I thought we were a little fatigued from yesterday -- and, again, we're
not about excuses or explanations, not at all. But this offense takes great
energy to score without the ball. And today we just tried to score with the
ball.  
And so we never really got into a flow. We had opportunities. I know with 3:45
left in the game, if I recall correctly it was 46-44. We missed a free throw
and then defensively we fell asleep on the weak side. We were not where we
were supposed to be and we yielded a lay-up. So really from a one-point game,
it then became what? A four-point game. So little plays like that throughout
the course of the game really hurt us and then we spot them a 10-zip lead
right out of the gates. So we were always trying to fight back.  
But I applaud the efforts of our team. We never quit. We always believed and
we kept battling.  
  
Q. Was spotting them that 10-point lead, what were the factors there and you
guys not getting the fast start that you wanted?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Boy, I wish I knew (laughter). We got up this morning, we
went to one of the local colleges, we watched film, we walked through what we
wanted to do. We even shot a little bit. Shot some free throws, did the best
we could to get us -- you know, to be ready to play and to get off to a great
start, and we didn't.  
But, again, we fought back and we had our opportunities.  
  
Q. Jeff, what were your expectations of Rich, having played against him once
coming into this season and how would you evaluate how he did this year?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: He is very talented, obviously, to score the ball. He can
drive it. He can shoot it. He can post it. The one thing that I really never
knew about is what kind of young man he was, and I wasn't disappointed at all.
I mean what I say, he cares about the way he conducts himself on and off the
court. He's coachable. You know, I think the biggest thing is that he cares,
and that's a great quality.  
  
Q. Coach, did it surprise you that Oklahoma didn't have Blake Griffin in a
whole lot? And what did that mean to the game? What did you do in that
regard?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Well, I mean, we had prepared for them and, you know, I
mean, he's very talented, as you can see. He had six offensive rebounds in 15
minutes and we just didn't put a body on him the way we should have. Not only
do you have to put a body on him, but you have to drive him back. And that's
something we put an emphasis on and actually practiced for, but we didn't do
it.  
And he's a talented player. Again, with my basketball team or with any team,
your opponent really is yourself and how you play the game and, again, I go
back to the fact that little things are things that cost us throughout the
course of the year and that is the failure to consistently block off the
failure to consistently defend with the weak side awareness, to cut hard all
the time, to make the extra pass all the time.  
But, again, you know, I heard Coach Knight say, I think it was last night or
the night before, that really to be a good basketball team all your players
have to have the ability to score. And that's really when you become special.  
You know, we are limited in some regards with our ability to make shots. And
so that puts a lot of pressure on the guys who can.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked about expectations for this year a couple weeks ago.
Realistically with eight new guys coming in, what would be your expectations
at this point for next year?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Well, let's put it this way, whenever Colorado takes to
court, we expect to win. And that's not an arrogant statement, that's just a
statement of one's competitive spirit. There are no moral victories, there are
no excuses, there are no explanations.  
I'm so excited about the future. I was very excited about this game, and we
certainly had it within our grasp to win this game and move on.  
But, you know, when you take a hit, you dust yourself off and you get back up
and we're just going to keep working and there is a lot to work with with the
investment, as we've talked about so many times, the University is making to
not only men's basketball but to all the sports. And it is a wonderful,
wonderful time to be a Buff. I'm excited and looking forward to the future. To
be honest with you, Monday, I'll probably get the young guys that are
returning and, "Hey, let's start working."  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Michael Beasley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18192)

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Bill Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18191)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We are ready to begin with our Kansas State wildcats, head coach
frank Martin and his two student athletes, Bill Walker and Michael Beasley.  
Coach, we will call you on, first, for thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: That's what this time of year is all about. That's what
this conference, this game is pretty much a reflection of what this conference
has been like the whole year. It is every game so far in this conference
tournament has been an absolute grind. It's one of those things that at this
time of year, somebody's moment of joy is another group of guys', you know,
misery time. It's unfortunate.  
We fought hard. We didn't shoot the ball as well as we did the first time we
played A&M and that's part of our game plan going in, against them, is to be
able to make some shots. But we battled and battled.  
And even -- we dug a little hole and we stayed the course and turned it
around, took a lead and then what hurt us in the first half that we kind of
eliminated in the second half came back and bit us again at the end of the
game, which was offensive rebounds. That was the difference in the game there.  
  
Q. Michael and Bill, can you just talk about how you guys feel about your
performance in the Big 12 tournament.  
BILL WALKER: We lost today. We obviously didn't perform that well. But I'm
happy with the way we went out there and fought today. That's all you can ask
for this time of year, just not letting up, just continuously playing for 40
minutes. I think we did that today.  
MICHAEL BEASLEY: I think we went out and played our hearts out. Like Coach
said, we didn't rebound on either end. That kind of determined the game.  
  
Q. We know what happened to you guys last year with your record the way it
was in conference. Are there any worries now about the NCAA tournament?  
BILL WALKER: I'm not worried. We don't know if we're in. We'll know Sunday if
we needed this game or not.  
MICHAEL BEASLEY: I feel the same way. I'm worried. Like I said, we got to wait
until Sunday, you know.  
  
Q. Michael, can you -- do you feel that this team is ready for a NCAA
appearance?  
MICHAEL BEASLEY: Definitely. We can't play the way we played today. We got to
bring the intensity a little more. We got to rebound better. But on our best
day, definitely, we can be the best team in the country.  
  
Q. Mike, can you take me through that final scenario of the final shot that
rimmed out at the end?  
MICHAEL BEASLEY: It was a good shot, you know. Coach drew up a good play, and
we executed. It just didn't fall, you know?  
  
Q. Providing you go on to the NCAA tournament, you've now for two months
solid been getting Big 12 teams that have seen you twice, three times and
devised all sorts of defenses and triple teams and what not to come after you.
Are you looking forward to maybe taking on a few teams that haven't had months
and months to game plan for you?  
MICHAEL BEASLEY: I'm not really thinking about, you know, that right now. I
will leave it up to the coaches. They play how they play and Coach come up
with a way to get out of it.  
CHARLIE FISS: All right. We'll let you go back to the locker room. Questions
for Coach?  
  
Q. Frank, obviously Michael has meant so much to your team. Talk about the
play, the final scenario and your thoughts when you see that ball rim out at
the end.  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: I mean, you know, guys went out, they executed what we
drew up. A&M guarded it. They're a good basketball team.  
Here's the part that -- excuse me. Here's the part that -- because I listened
to some of the questions that are asked of the kids, here's the part that's a
little kind of -- you know, I sit up here and when the conference --
preconference season was over, do you guys remember what Texas A&M was ranked?
Who remembers?  
  
Q. Tenth.  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: Tenth. So all of a sudden they start in the Big 12 and
they stink? I mean, this conference is high-level basketball. There's not a
team in this conference that gets out of your way and let's you win.  
Nebraska, the team you guys saw playing out there the game before, that's a
team that beat Arizona State 25, beat Oregon. This conference as been what you
guys just saw in our game; Every single game you line up and play. Tonight, we
took some shots and didn't make them and the difference between this team and
the first time we played A&M is that we made some of those shots.  
You know, so if playing 16 games and then one conference tournament game in
the Big 12 this year doesn't prepare us to be a NCAA team, then no season will
ever prepare us to be a NCAA team. This conference is unbelievable.  
These guys over here, I have been telling you guys all year, they don't care
about anything but winning. Don't care about anything but winning. Losing is
not something they take well to.  
Now, the sun will come up tomorrow and we've got to line up and prepare. If
there are 64 better teams than us in the country, I want to see them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the supporting cast that surrounded Michael tonight.
Did you get what you wanted from those guys in this game?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: Yeah. They fought their hearts out. I mean, you know, we
played a very good basketball team. Here's the thing with -- to take my point
a step further in the Big 12. Kansas and Texas can very easily both be number
1 seeds. We're the No. 3 seed in the league. Does that mean if they're both
almost No. 1 seeds that we're not deserving of any seed? You can't do that
unless you have balance. There's no way we win ten conference games and go out
and play A&M nose to nose the way we did. Some people might disagree with me,
but I think they are a pretty darn good basketball team.  
No way we do that with one guy or two guys. I thought Clent Stewart played as
well as he has played in over a month today. I thought he had a lot of energy
and a bounce to his step.  
I think Blake Young was his typical stuff, all over that basketball court
creating havoc. We took some 3s that were wide open, we just didn't put them
down. And then Dominique Kirk plays like a senior. That's what seniors do at
this time of year. They don't want their seasons to be over. They want to
continue playing, so seniors at this time of year step up and make those kind
of plays. That's what four years in the Big 12 does, it prepares them to be
able to make the plays he made tonight.  
  
Q. Your points are certainly very valid. Do you fear what could happen
Sunday based on the experience you guys had last year at K-State? Do you fear
what may happen Sunday, may not happen Sunday?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: No. I'm not in Afghanistan. I've got nothing to fear, you
know? I'm a basketball coach. I have been on the bubble two consecutive years.
Got left out my last year in Cincinnati, got left out last year. You wake up
the next day and go coach basketball and go wherever they send you. I don't
know if it is a bad word on your part. But "fear" \-- my country, my family
has overcome a lot to succeed in this country. So the NCAA selection committee
thinks that the team I coach is not good enough for their tournament, I don't
fear that.  
  
Q. Coach, you said the last two years you were on the bubble. Do you feel
that you're on the bubble this year?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: Two years ago at the University of Cincinnati we were on
the bubble because we were a No. 8 seed in our conference, 8. And we went out
and lost in the first round of the conference tournament. That's why we got
left out of the bubble. We were 8-8 in conference play.  
Last year we had bad losses, bad losses. We lost to California who wasn't a
good basketball team. We lost to New Mexico who wasn't a good basketball team.
You look at our schedule, you look at the teams that have beat us, and you
tell me who that we beat -- that beat us, excuse me, is not going to play in
the post-season? Now, does that mean that if you lose to the teams that are
good you are supposed to get in? No, that's not what it means.  
But the bottom line is we've won a lot more than we've lost. We were the
number 3 seed in the Big 12 tournament. If that's not good enough to get you
into a NCAA tournament, then you know what? Then something needs to be done to
reprogram how the system works.  
  
Q. Coach Turgeon was in here just a little bit ago, he said the last time he
played you, you were a different team, different animal. Not counting win or
loss tonight, you played your hearts out tonight, how would you evaluate how
you guys were playing going into the tournament?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: We lost a heartbreaker at Baylor. We lost a heartbreaker
at Nebraska. Went nose to nose with Texas. Went into Kansas where you can
count the number of teams that have succeeded over the last four years that
have won on probably a couple of fingers. And we fought our hearts out that
night. Went out and won our last two conference games including at Iowa State
which only one Big 12 team has a winning record in that facility against a
team that at home plays extremely well.  
Texas needed luck in overtime to win. Kansas went in there and Bill raved
about how good they played and it was a dogfight of a game. We went out there
and we won. We came out today and played A&M and we played well. We played --
I've said from the word "go" this conference deserves six bids, six bids to
the NCAA tournament. We played one of the six that I think should get a bid.
That's what this time of year is all about. Every team you play is a good
team.  
Now, Mark thinks we were a different team back then than we are now. That's
because we played in our building. Tell him we can go play in our building
tomorrow morning, I guarantee you we will play a little different in our
building. It's basketball.  
  
Q. Back to the play with 7.9 seconds left, when you talk about that's the
play you wanted, you got from Clent penetrating and shooting the three?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: No, the one I was -- the one I was answering before was
the one that Michael missed. I didn't talk about the final play.  
  
Q. About the final play, what were you looking for exactly?  
COACH FRANK MARTIN: Stew overdrove the ball there. We were supposed to run a
little action there where we ball screened and then we flare the screener to
set the ball screen. Stew overdribbled the ball. Got into a place where he
couldn't come back to the guy that set the ball screen. So he just decided to
jump up and shoot it. I think his foot was on the line so it wouldn't be have
been a 3 anyways. But then he goes in there and battles and pats that ball out
and gets us one more shot.  
I don't want to say he made a mistake but he made an ill-advised decision.
Instead of just giving up on it, he went out and figured a way to get us one
more shot.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by the Texas Longhorns and Coach Rick Barnes and his
three student athletes, Damian James, D.J. Augustin and Justin Mason.  
Coach, we'll come to you first. Congratulations on today's victory and your
thoughts?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we knew coming in it was going to be a really hard-
fought game. We had two of them with them throughout the regular season and
really a hard one just a couple days ago. It is almost like you feel like you
are in 2-3, 3-5 series. But I thought we did some good things, some of the
things that we didn't do so well last week, I thought we improved on. Had
different guys do some different things.  
I look down and Justin had 8 assists tonight which is great and Connor got off
to a tough start but came back and made really some second-effort, got us some
extra possession plays. Obviously, D.J. and Damian throughout were terrific.  
  
Q. D.J., do you feel like this was a typical game for you guys, both the
good stuff and the bad?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: You know, we just try tried to play better than we did when we
played Oklahoma State at home. We watched film and we didn't like what we did
on defense. We tried to come in this game and play hard on defense and leave
it out there, give it the full effort.  
  
Q. Damian, at one point they hit three straight 3s to make it a fairly close
game. What was the tendency? It seemed like at that time you were content to
fire up 3s right with them, and then all of a sudden, no, let's go inside.
Let's move the clock. Can you talk about that?  
DAMIAN JONES: It was just, you know, we didn't want to exchange baskets with
them. You know, we really wanted to get stops on the other end. But Coach
always told us to put pressure on the basket and either in the post or D.J. or
Mason driving the ball. We were just able to get in there and people made
plays.  
  
Q. Justin, just talk about the grittiness, I guess, of this team right now,
what's driving you guys, how hungry are you for this Big 12 tournament
title?  
JUSTIN MASON: I think we're all very hungry, you know. You know, the year of
experience we went through last year, you know, we're all aware of what we're
fighting for for this year. You know, I think it is our maturity and us
growing up over the course of the season makes us play harder. We know what's
out there every night for us.  
  
Q. Damian, everybody knows about your rebounding talents and everything. Are
you feeling a little bit more responsibility to score more now since A.J. has
been in a shooting slump?  
DAMIAN JONES: I really don't worry about scoring. Coach always tell me to do
the small things and you'll be able to score the ball.  
I just really focus on rebounding and really working hard on my defense.
That's my main focus right now. Staying in front of my men, helping my
teammates.  
  
Q. What was key in the beginning of that second half, I mean, in that run
that you guys had? Was there a concerted effort maybe something with Thomas to
maybe slow him down some, too?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: I think we had to slow the whole team down. We needed to get
stops on defense and not let them get easy baskets. They got a lot of great
players. I think we did a great job tonight helping each other and, you know,
playing pretty good defense.  
  
Q. D.J., y'all have been effective in that zone a lot this season. How
effective was it today? Was it as good as it's been in a while?  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: It was pretty good. You know, we can go back and work on some
things, you know, and I think we played pretty good zone defense tonight.
Everybody was, you know, playing their role, playing their part and we got
stops in there and it worked well for us tonight.  
  
Q. Damian, how confident are you guys when you have a lead late? I think you
guys are 26-1 or something when you have a lead with 4:00 left, especially
with D.J. controlling the ball.  
DAMIAN JONES: We really do have a lot of confidence with the ball being in
D.J.'s hands because we know him being the player he is, he going to make
plays and just make plays for everybody else and put us in position to be on
top at the end of the game.  
  
Q. I would like to ask any of the players, the officials seem to call it
real loose, allow a lot of contact. Wonder if you feel like that played into
your hands or not.  
D.J. AUGUSTIN: You know, either way you are going to have to play hard. You
can't worry about what the officials call. They are going to call some bad
calls, some good ones. You got to play through it and no matter what, play as
a team. That's what we do every night. Go out there and play as a team no
matter what happens.  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll let you return to the locker room. Congratulations on your
victory today.  
Let's go to Coach now. Questions for Coach Barnes.  
  
Q. Back to my original question, when they were bombing 3s in left and
right, did you make a suggestion that perhaps your team should not try to do
that as well?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Yes. We, actually -- second half I thought maybe we were
extended in our zone because they did a really nice job of flashing someone
into the middle of the lane and putting some pressure there. And the only
thing we really did in the second half, we said we were going to have the off
guard as opposed to really worrying about the three-point shot from them from
the top of the key. Really try to take away that interior pass first.  
But when they knocked down a couple, again when you play a zone and it's been
-- it's hard for us right now because you followed us this year, we have
become a pretty good man team. We feel like we are getting what we needed out
of it.  
They made a couple, and I do think -- I thought we -- around the 7:00 mark
there -- I thought we had gotten into a kind of walk-it-up game with us. We
don't want to do that. 7:00 is a long time. Actually that's what we looked at
last night. The first half in Austin we did a great job of playing our tempo.
Second half, they got the game kind of like it was today, but we needed to get
out and try to get some easy baskets. That's all I kept telling them. Let's
run, try to get some easy baskets. If not, play inside out.  
During that period, we got a little happy. With A.J. and D.J., we're going to
let them shoot it. Damian who shoots the ball well, he shot a quick one. But
we came back and did go back inside with it.  
  
Q. Was your philosophy on the zone today to see how much you could get out
of it to rest these guys a little bit as well and your thoughts on, you know,
D.J. with the ball in his hands with 4:00 left?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Well, we felt we -- looking back, we probably should have
-- excuse me, we probably felt like we should have played zone the last time
we played them. But we feel, too, that we want to mix some things up a little
bit and it goes back with what I said. We feel real comfortable with our man,
but we'll go zone. Normally, we'll stay in it depending on how people attack
it. You know, we'll stay it n it a little bit longer because when we are
really playing, we do some pretty good things with it.  
But D.J. obviously with the ball in his hand I mean, a lot of good things are
going to happen because so many people are concerned about him. You are going
to have to help somebody from somewhere to help on him. And his confidence
level, it goes back -- our players know if he got it, they get to where they
are supposed to be, if he can't score, he'll find them.  
  
Q. Took Oklahoma State almost 8:00 for their first field goal in the second
half. What did you like defensively? What were you doing to them in that
stretch and overall defensively at this point in the season? Where do you
think your team is?  
COACH RICK BARNES: I thought our concentration was good in the fact that we
did have to adjust a little bit in what we had planned on doing early because
we respect the fact that they took 31 3s and we thought they would shoot 3s
and we thought they would. And my recollection, I will be honest with you, I
think this is the most zone we've ever seen from Oklahoma State. But based on
how we handled it a little bit in Austin, we kind of expected it.  
When we talked about some of the adjustments that we needed to play,
especially those first five guys, they've played enough of it where they were
really coming out of their zone area, stepping into other areas to help their
teammates. That's what they were alluding to, where just -- I'm not going to
say matched up, but they were willing to leave their area of the court and
slide somewhere else and make some of those plays.  
If we would have rebounded early, that was the difference in the game in the
first half. They scored from offensive rebounding and got some extra
possessions. That's always a concern with the zone, but overall, again, our
concentration has gotten a lot better here in the last couple weeks in terms
of being able to talk them through some things.  
  
Q. Your comments on Sean Sutton as a coach. He has been under fire all
season, played three tough games with you. Your thoughts on Sean, the job he
has done at Oklahoma State in his second season as head coach.  
COACH RICK BARNES: Back -- I don't know how long it's been. I was at Clemson
and Kelvin Sampson came out and asked me to do a clinic for the high school
coaches association in Oklahoma and on the way back, I had called Coach Sutton
and asked if I could stop by and watch practice. He said, sure. So I flew in
that day as I left Norman. And coach had gotten sick and Sean ran the whole
practice.  
So in my opinion, I don't think Sean has just been an assistant coach over the
last however many years he's been there. He has been with that program. He's
like family there. You go back and look, he's had -- I'm sure Eddie Sutton
will tell you Sean had as much to do with the success over the last couple
years that went on there. I can just tell you they're a really hard team to
play against because they are an extremely well-coached team.  
They don't beat themselves. You know, things happen that -- I know they lost a
key guy that transferred, I think to Louisiana Tech. That's a huge loss for
them because if they got that experienced post-player they are a totally
different team.  
And I don't know what happened in that situation, but I was impressed today
watching the young guys play. They got these guys back. They lose obviously
Marcus. But these guys are back, and he's just done a great job. I know that
if I were an athletic director evaluating a coach, he's a guy that would have
high marks in everything because of the way he does his business and the way
he coaches his team.  
  
Q. As somebody who used to hate zone, when you see 3s going in from the
other team or offensive rebounds, do you have any moment of bout self-doubt
about using it or is it just a reality these days?  
COACH RICK BARNES: Yeah, about every time we go to it. Again, coaches would
tell you today, if I said it once, I said it ten times, should we stay zone?
Should we stay zone?  
And then at the end of the game, I'm saying when we're man, knowing they're
looking to shoot quick, I would say to the coaches, maybe we should go zone.
Yeah, I would say there is some self-doubt along the way.  
I've learned though over the time, it goes back to Jim Boeheim, when I started
talking to him I think we started using it five years ago quite a bit, he said
to me, you go back and look at the way you guys defend the three-point line
with your man and look at ours, I guarantee you we defend the three-point line
better than you guys and they did.  
And I said, how can you stand there and watch teams make 3s. He said, well,
sometimes it's fool's gold. They said you just got to be patient with it. I
said to myself that first year we're going to do it, they will have to make
two or three before we change. Again, over time, we stay in it. If we think
people are uncomfortable with it, we'll get out.  
Innately, yeah, I have a hard time probably staying with it sometimes. But
it's work and we'll do.  
  
Q. Coach, we talk a lot about the zone. What was it about Oklahoma State
that made you feel like the zone worked well, especially since they do Jack up
a lot of 3s?  
COACH RICK BARNES: You asked me why I think it would work?  
  
Q. Yeah, why did you think it would work?  
COACH RICK BARNES: What makes it difficult from -- we wanted to try to use our
bench some today. Marcus Dove, even though he would be down as a post-player,
he is a perimeter player in our opinion where he can drive the ball and we
just wanted to really try to take away the dribble penetration. They really
drove it at us in Austin. They drove it hard in Stillwater, too, but we just
felt like we had in some way had to get the dribble penetration under control.
So we -- again, we did, we started even as it went on, we would compact it a
little bit more and just said, hey, let's get in it. We can close down the
lane.  
On the kickouts, let's try to run them off the line. Early in the game, again,
the rebounds came from dribble penetration, whether they -- whether we -- if
we helped up, which we did, which we don't want to do, they had a couple dunks
that way and dribble penetration, we rotated over to help. We felt a zone
maybe could slow some of that down, just to try to stop the dribble
penetration.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, your comments about the game?  
COACH KNIGHT: First off, it is just disappointing. It is probably the most
disappointed I've been because it is a game we're in and we missed eight
layups in the second half, miss 4-5 free throws and we just make a lot of dumb
mistakes. It comes from just being casual. I mean, kids think they got 1,000
possessions and you can make a bad pass, you can walk with it and you're just
going to have a couple hundred more to get it back. It has been a problem for
us. We build leads in the first half and we just give them back and I think
that's been the problem with us all year and it happened to us again. And it
is not surprising, it is just frustrating.  
I got to figure out this spring with my staff what we can do to change that.
But, you know, I knew what type of game it was going to be. It was going to be
a hard-fought game defensively, offensively and just who made -- whoever makes
dumb mistakes would lose the game and we ended up making too many mistakes
when it counted and we lost the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Martin, how tough is this one for you to swallow being your last game,
knowing you had chances to really win it?  
MARTIN ZENO: It is pretty tough knowing it was my last game as a Red Raider.
We didn't do the things to win so I just got to live with it and learn from
it.  
  
Q. Martin, talk about the last play when it was 72-70. Charlie falls down
going to the line. What were you guys trying to do that there?  
MARTIN ZENO: We were trying to take a good shot. He tried to kick it out and
lost his balance and we lost the ball and they came up with it.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can just talk how frustrating this game was, all the
missed foul shots, all the missed layups, those kinds of things?  
MARTIN ZENO: It was disappointing from that part but on my part because I
didn't play to my potential. It hurt me because it was my last game and I
didn't do the things I could have to help our team win.  
ALAN VOSKUIL: It was just frustrating because we pretty much beat ourselves.
We made the mistakes. We didn't get rebounds. We missed free throws. We just
beat ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll come to you, first, but we'll excuse your students
first.  
Guys, thanks for coming.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can put into context this season and the roller coaster
it was for you personally.  
COACH KNIGHT: It has been a real let-down, you know? We have been involved in
games that we should have won, and it is just our mentality, it has been hard
to overcome. We played casual basketball is the problem. And I finally put a
sign up in our locker room that "casual basketball will not get the job done
in the Big 12." And that means we can get a lead, you take care of the ball.
You don't throw passes that get intercepted. You don't miss layups. You don't
walk with the ball. You guard your man. You don't get driven. You get
rebounds. You don't lose rebounds and give it back to them to get 3s or 2s.
Just a lot of mental mistakes that it doesn't come from what the other team
does. It just comes from us. I think it is just a mental approach that's not
very good, and it is something we got to really work on.  
  
Q. That last possession, is that an example of casual basketball?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah. We work every day going against a 15-second shot clock,
getting it up, full court.  
With our motion offense, motion offense is a surprise. So, you know, there is
no reason to take a time out because it allows them to either set up a zone or
a trap and now we have them on their back heels.  
And we work every day, 15-second shot clock trying to get a good shot and it
was just too much dribbling and it got casual, it got casual with the ball.
Fall down with the ball and don't get a shot off, that just can't happen.  
That's not what lost the game for us, you know? It was just everything added
up to that. We saw mistakes like that throughout the game and that's really
what killed us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the possession before that, like you thought there was
goal tending on the block?  
COACH KNIGHT: I thought it was goal tending but what can I do? You can sit
there and argue but they are not going to change the call. You let them know
what you thought.  
I thought the ball was coming down but I mean, it is such a quick play that I
mean, it is just a judgment call. It is not like they're trying to do it on
purpose. It was just a judgment call and, you know, you let it be known in
case it happens again. That's all you can do.  
You can sit there and complain and complain but it doesn't do you any good.  
  
Q. Sean yesterday talked about the friendship the two of you have. I wonder
if you might comment about that and Sean is under a lot of pressure in turning
the team around at Oklahoma State.  
COACH KNIGHT: First thing, I know Sean has been under some unfair criticism
throughout the year. The guy everyone should kind of be upset with is JamesOn
Curry. You know, he leaves and kind of leaves them hanging. They didn't have
enough time to replace him. If Oklahoma State has JamesOn Curry, I am not
playing Sean today. He is in the bye game playing tomorrow. I think people got
to understand that the job Sean has done.  
JamesOn is a guy like Jay Jackson that can win games by himself. Now Sean is
handicapped and doesn't have Curry and has done an unbelievable job with the
pressure he has had. I think it is unfair. I think too many times people want
to put the blame on the coaches. These players got to be held accountable.
Especially when they're given scholarships, free education and everything that
goes into college. There's got to be at least a sense of loyalty. So it cracks
me up. With Sean, he really got taken by surprise, by the whole deal when
JamesOn left. And now he has him, it is a totally different team. That's an
unbelievable job.  
I think it is really hard to come back from when you lose a player of that
caliber, a kid that can win you games by himself when nobody else shows up. I
think he has done an unbelievable job. It is obviously the teams we have
beaten here recently, I just hope other people see that and finally realize
it.  
  
Q. Pat, in addition to the casual basketball, you guys get a lead a couple
times by 5 or 6 points. It seemed like maybe this is associated with it, the
guys are kind of like the killer instinct to put Oklahoma State away.  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, the guys that have a killer instinct on this team is my
staff. All the energy has to come from us. We just haven't had that guy on the
court. Since Ron Ross left, it has been really tough. We have not had an
extension of our coaching staff on the floor. You have to have that to be very
good. That's why guys like the Patriots with Tom Brady are so good because the
coaches know -- because kids get tired of hearing it from the coaches. You got
to have an extension of the coaches in the locker room and on the floor.
That's been tough for us. When things have gotten tight, we haven't had
anybody out there pulling guys together like we had when we had Ron Ross.  
Ron Ross would get on guys before we would even think about it and you need
that. I am trying to see if we can get that. I think these freshmen are
talented this year and have it in them. We have to work on that this spring
plus the group of guys we'll bring in last year. The big reason I recruit them
is because of personality.  
  
Q. Pat, you have a sense of post-season possibility for your program?  
COACH KNIGHT: I hope just because how tough our conference is and the teams we
have beaten, the NIT would give us a look. But I just don't know because now
you're talking about it is a selection committee and it is a group of men
making the selection.  
And there is always human error when it comes to selection committees. So my
fate's in the hand of the selection committee. I don't know what the situation
is. I hope they give us a strong look because I think this team belongs there
with what we've done and how hard our conference has been this year.  
It is not just me. I think there are other teams that don't make it to the
NCAA tournament. There are probably three or four teams that should be
considered for NIT.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Trevor Cook and his play in the second half that
really gave big minutes.  
COACH KNIGHT: I think he showed he wants to be a player. I actually talked to
him after this game, just he and I one-on-one. He is only a sophomore. You
kind of forget about it. I kind of forget about it and get frustrated with him
and maybe get on him too hard sometimes. I think he has gotten it here in the
last couple weeks. I got on him really hard, kind of called them out in a
meeting and he used to be the type of kid that you would feel sorry for. He
got upset with me and turned that energy around in a positive thing and played
really hard in practice.  
So I think he is starting to get it. I have to remind myself, this is a kid,
this is his first year of really big-time basketball in the Big 12 and so I
really look forward to seeing what he can do in the spring, working with him
from a basketball standpoint, weight standpoint.  
You know, I have the kid for two more years so I am really excited about it. I
think he has grown up here in these two weeks. I told him that, and I am happy
for him. But he's got to get a taste of this and not like it and we make sure
this doesn't happen next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH KNIGHT: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Steve Harley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18158)

### [Aleks Maric](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13719)

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Coach Doc Sadler
and his two student athletes, Steve Harley and Aleks Maric. Coach,
congratulations on your victory tonight. Your thoughts on the game?  
COACH DOC SADLER: Thanks, Charlie. First of all, you got to give, you know,
Missouri credit. They just kept playing and playing and playing. And, you
know, we missed free throws and allowed them to keep having some hope.  
I thought both teams really played well defensively, and it was hard to score.
I mean, if you hold Missouri to 56 points, you've got to be really, really
excited as a basketball coach to know that your team put forth that type of
effort against a team such as Missouri.  
And going into the game, one of the things that we wanted to do that we did
not get done is we did -- we wanted to take away the three-point shot. When we
won at Missouri, they made three. When they beat us at Lincoln, they made 11.
So that was a conscious effort. And we gave up nine, so we didn't do a good
job in that area.  
But overall, I mean, I couldn't be more pleased with these guys. They have
given me every bit of effort, and it was a 40-minute ball game. Until the very
end, we had some guys get some defensive rebounds and then, you know, got the
victory.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Let's go to questions now for our
two students athletes.  
  
Q. Aleks, how did you feel going into halftime when Steve hit that jump shot
at the buzzer?  
ALEKS MARIC: We were feeling great. With a point left, we had a lot of good
momentum going into the locker room and coming out in the second half. Guys
were up and energy was up and I think that transferred into the first five
minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. Aleks, nine-minute stretch in the second half, you were the only one on
the team to score, kind of held Missouri off from making that run. How big was
the second half there for you guys?  
ALEKS MARIC: It was huge. I mean, obviously like Coach said, both teams played
great defense. It was very, very hard to score. I mean, we used the shot clock
as much as we could, we had to mix things up. It was tough but we were able to
do it. Stuck together, played team basketball and got through it.  
  
Q. Aleks, wanted to ask you about playing Kansas in the next round. It was a
team that beat you pretty soundly two times this year. What kind of a
challenge is that for you guys?  
ALEKS MARIC: To be honest, I haven't thought about it. I am fresh off the
court against Missouri. That was our main focus. We are going to go back to
the hotel as a team, rest up and look at them tomorrow. Then I can answer that
one tomorrow if you want to ask it.  
  
Q. Steve and Aleks both, the scheme things that Missouri does as far as
switching back and forth from different defenses. I know they did some
pressure for a while there. Talk about the challenges and then also just
beyond that, the little pesky things that Missouri's defense does. They break
up a lot of passes and disrupt what you guys are trying to do offensively.
Talk about that and how you were able to overcome that?  
ALEKS MARIC: They mix things up a lot. They play a lot of scramble defense.
They press you full court, 1-1-2, 1-2-2. They chase things up a lot. They'll
deny, they switch. You have to be sharp mentally I think on the offensive end
to pick up what they're doing.  
We got caught a few times on the baseline after they scored and we turned the
ball over because we didn't pick up what they were doing. That really cost us.
But for the most part, I think we did a good job.  
STEVE HARLEY: Like he said, we were switching defense and was making it very
hard for us as an offense. Switching defense with the press back to a zone,
that makes it very hard for us to run a play because we don't know what
defense they're going to run until they get into it. So they just keep us off
balance as an offense.  
  
Q. Steve, how evenly matched was your team with Missouri? You played a
4-point game with them and then an overtime game and then this game came
within a point.  
STEVE HARLEY: It is just a battle. I guess, we match up with them, they match
up with us, it is going to be a 40-minute ball game every time we play them. I
guess it is an equal battle.  
  
Q. Steve, it was a battle. How did you get so open on that inbound play and
cut for a lay-up?  
STEVE HARLEY: I don't know. You can ask Missouri. I really don't know
(laughter). I got lucky.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Congratulations on your victory tonight. Good luck
tomorrow.  
And now questions for Coach Sadler.  
  
Q. Doc, can you talk about the work you did on the Lyons tonight?  
COACH DOC SADLER: Again, you know, the last few ball games he has been -- he
and Carroll both have really played well for them. It is a catch 22 because,
again, you look at the reasons they're winning and especially when we played
them and it is the three-point shot.  
But at the same time, you realize that you got to stop Carroll and you got to
stop Lyons. And what we tried to do that is what we call two-slide helping and
get back. We did a great job the first half and then late in the game Lyons
got that baseline shot when we didn't get out there.  
But you're not going to stop those two guys. You know, again, I think
defensively Aleks did a great job and again Ryan and we had a lot of help with
him also.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what this win means in terms of momentum
for your program.  
COACH DOC SADLER: Wow, you know, we've got so much to do there. And each time
we do something that we haven't done, it's got to help us and this was just
another step. So I hope that it really, really helps us. I mean, you know,
it's hard to sit there and, you know, listen to you guys on T.V. and talk
about seven out of the last eight years we haven't won a game down here, all
that stuff, believe me, it starts messing with peoples' head and especially my
little head -- big head, little brain.  
So I was conscious of that. We were fortunate enough to get a win and
hopefully it will help us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about getting another shot at Kansas and what you
might expect from them tomorrow?  
COACH DOC SADLER: I am the happiest guy in the gym because if we wouldn't have
won, we wouldn't be getting a chance to play again. The happiness ends there.  
I've gotten a chance to play them four times, and I know one of your questions
to them was "do you have any suggestions"? My question to you y'all, do y'all
have any suggestions because what I've done hasn't worked.  
We're going to have to play near perfect basketball for us. It's just a very,
very tough matchup. Their forwards create problems for us. But as I said
before, I mean, I know this will be the only team that has a chance to play
against them tomorrow night and the way our team is, I mean, I don't know
what's going to happen but I know this, we're going to give an effort for 40
minutes and we have all four times we've played them. It's just the score has
been way out of whack.  
So I don't know. I'm happy but sad, I guess. Does that make sense?  
  
Q. The last two possessions, they weren't able to get a 3 off. So if you can
just talk --  
COACH DOC SADLER: We switched on everything there. You know, I was concerned
that they might drive it to the basket but they didn't. So we switched out on
everything, even Aleks on their point guard Horton. And I think the thing that
kind of goes unnoticed is that we got the defensive rebounds. They did miss
the shots, but we didn't give them two and three shots at it.  
And so our guys did a terrific job once they saw the shot being taken to go
run down the basketball. So I think more than anything, that's the thing I'm
happy about.  
  
Q. Coach Sadler, with a few exceptions you have played a lot of close games
this season. This one and the other games against Missouri both in Lincoln
obviously very close games. Tell me what your team did really great in the
last minute, last 30 seconds that made the difference for you guys coming away
with the win.  
COACH DOC SADLER: I thought our free throw shooting was tremendous (smiling).  
I don't know what we did. I mean, I think defensively, you know, that free
throw shooting was a joke. And defensive rebounding I mean, they didn't get
two, three, four opportunities when they missed the shot. And I think so many
times in those situations you see teams win the game on second shots or third
shots. You know, we're running down the rebounds, they get it and they kick it
to a wide-open player and he makes a 3. That didn't happen. So I think if you
were to ask me what I was most happy about, it would be that, that we didn't
give them two and three shots in that last minute when they did miss the shot.  
  
Q. You were up 17-4 in second-chance points tonight.  
COACH DOC SADLER: Thanks. Should have saved some of those for tomorrow
probably. Thank you all so much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Curtis Jerrells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16448)

### [Kevin Rogers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18144)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH SCOTT DREW: We want to give all the credit to Colorado, they won the
hustle points. They did a great job taking it to us. I thought the first half
we tried to speed the tempo up, tried to get in the passing lanes and got away
from our game plan which was to make them play through us. They did a great
job executing their offense, got a lot of open 3s and a lot of lay-ups.  
The second half we did a better job holding them to 29%. In the overtime, they
just -- overtimes, they just executed better than we did.  
  
Q. C.J., did you feel like y'all had your usual intensity at the start of
the game? Or was it a little off?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: At the beginning, it took for them to get a good lead on us
to actually start playing, you know. That's been something that we had trouble
with early on, but not lately. For some reason we did it again today.  
  
Q. C.J., you guys were coming into a completely different situation this
time being a 5 seed, a team that everyone expected to win. Not a 11 or 12
seed. Did that alone make a difference in y'all's mind in terms of the
preparation?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: Probably. But Coach talked about it. We tried our best not to
think about it and just want to continue to be the hunter and not the hunted.
We wanted to take care of business tonight but didn't.  
  
Q. Kevin, did you just kind of feel just team-wise, you guys had some
opportunities, another case of missed opportunities in this game?  
KEVIN ROGERS: Like Curtis said, we just -- we didn't take care of business. We
came out a little flat, you know, against a team that wants to win for their
seniors.  
It came back to bite us. You know, we were well-prepared. You know, again like
Curtis said, we just didn't come out and execute.  
  
Q. What kind of defensive adjustments did y'all make at halftime to get them
from 72% in the first half down to 29% in the second?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: We just played defense. We played no defense in the first
half. That's why they were able to get the back doors and the easy lay-ups and
all the transition.  
I mean, we knew they were going to do all of that. We weren't focused. It
really wasn't an adjustment, it was just we started playing defense.  
KEVIN ROGERS: Just like Curtis said, it really wasn't an adjustment. You know,
we just came out and we knew we had to play defense for us to get back into
the game. Credit those guys for making big shots, though. But, you know, it
was just a lack of focus in that first half.  
  
Q. C.J., you've gone up against Richard Robby before. When he's on like
that, how difficult a matchup is he?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: It's kind of difficult because he's also pretty big but, you
know, I gave up some back doors.  
Like I said, we were prepared. We knew they was going to do that. It was just
playing bad position. When you give a good player, easy, early, looks, it is
hard to stop them down the stretch.  
  
Q. Guys like Digger Phelps on ESPN say you guys still had work to do to get
into the NCAA tournament. Do you feel like you're in the tournament or is it
going to be nervous for you on Sunday?  
CURTIS JERRELLS: I think all season long we've took care of business and did
what we had to do. You know, although we lost tonight, we're still pretty
confident. It is out of our hands now. We will wait and see what happens on
Sunday.  
KEVIN ROGERS: Like Curtis said, we've handled our business the entire season.
It is not in our hands anymore. All we can do is wait and watch on Sunday.  
  
Q. Kevin, did they do anything against you different defensively? It seemed
like they limited your touches this time.  
KEVIN ROGERS: I don't think it was anything different. You know, our guards
got off to high starts, so I was just trying to get in and make a couple plays
when I was open. But I don't think they did anything different. It was just a
matter of me making plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks for coming. We will now take questions for Coach
Drew.  
  
Q. It seems like there was a very concerted effort on y'all's part to drive
more to the basket in the second half. While that's good, that seems to get
away from what y'all normally do. Do you think y'all did that too much?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: That's one thing that's great about tape, you can look at
tape and find out.  
I do know when you shoot 2-10 from 3 in the second half, that promotes you to
drive more. If we're hitting those shots, then I think we shoot. Instead of
driving, you are driving and kicking. Now that's opening things more up. But
all game long we really struggled from 3, and that's obviously our biggest
strength or one of our biggest strengths.  
  
Q. Did you feel this was a game all the way from there at the end of the
regulation into overtime, just a game of missed opportunities, you didn't have
some chances?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Disappointing from the first half standpoint because we had
a game plan that had just worked, just up there, executed it, won on the road.
We come back and then all of a sudden we get a little giddy, get out of
position, give up some lay-ups and that opened Pandora's box.  
Second half, all we did was did what we were supposed to do and what we did up
in Colorado. Again, one thing we tried to do was force tempo and maybe that's
why we were out of position a little bit more in that first half.  
And then second half we got back to playing how we should have, which is again
make them make shots over us instead of giving them those open looks and back-
door cuts.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get you to elaborate on the first half defense and what
went wrong there. Was it just a matter of being out of position?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think you go into a game with a game plan and for some
reason we didn't execute it and that's always the coach's fault.  
So, again, our first thing was to take away back-doors. We gave up back-doors.
The second thing was to take away 3s. We gave up 3s. Second half we did what
we needed to do and obviously that's 29% from the field. That should have been
like that for both halves and not one half. That's a frustrating thing. I got
plenty of time to watch tape and figure out why.  
  
Q. How comfortable are you going to be between now and Sunday about your
team's chances of being able to go on and play in the NCAA?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I felt very good coming in with the body of work we had done
and from what the experts were saying, the ones that understand it and follow
it and do the most.  
Anyway, we'll have to see what they say now. I know one thing, when you are
winning, you don't have to worry as much. Now, we're in a position where all
year long we haven't had a so-called bad loss. But in a conference tournament,
a 5 seed shouldn't lose to a 12. So, again, hopefully they look at the body of
the work and not one game.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk about -- is the worst thing you can do is let a guy
like Richard Robby get on a roll and talk about a senior coming through at a
big moment?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Richard Roby has been an all-league player for four years
for a reason. We knew he was going to play well. He did the last time and he
does against most people. But 32 points and 12 rebounds, that's a little more
than we'd like to give up.  
Again, if we took away the easy ones, then everything would have been
manageable. I thought Marcus Hall was just as important with his 25 and 10. I
think every coach that coaches against Colorado knows just how good those two
are. Those are two excellent players.  
  
Q. When you get to the NCAA tournament, it's basically a six-game season. A
lot of teams that lose a game that probably feel they shouldn't lose, kind of
use that as a some righteous anger going into that tournament. Are you kind of
excited that maybe, hey, it is a six-game season now. We got that out of the
way, we have nowhere to look but forward?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think no coach likes to lose but at the same time I do
know it focuses a team more and that's the situation where I know if we're in
the tournament, we will definitely be more attentive and more sharp to begin
the game, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Scott, how big of a challenge has it been to get this team to play the
kind of defense you want this team to play because obviously that's been a
battle for you guys?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think the big thing with our team is all year long we've
approved defensively, but when we don't make shots in first half, I think
sometimes that we let our offense dictate our defense. And, again, good teams
don't let that happen and that's something we continually work on.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Donald Sloan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17780)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready for Texas A&M. Coach Mark Turgeon and his three
student athletes, Bryan Davis, Donald Sloan and Dominique Kirk. Coach,
congratulations on tonight's victory. Your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Well, we have had a tough 24 hours. I was really worried
about our team. DeAndre -- just so I handle this now -- is at the hospital. We
think he is going to be all right. They are making sure it is not his
appendix.  
And then we had Sloan who played great tonight, lost his mom this morning and
he flew in just for the game. So sometimes when things like this happen, they
inspire you or they put a cloud over and I thought we had a little cloud over
us at the start of the game. And then we fought through it.  
So I was really worried. I didn't want to come up here after the game after a
loss and make excuses but I was really nervous about what happened in the last
24 hours for our team but our guys came through.  
I am really proud. It wasn't pretty. Junior gave us a big lift. B.J. had a
great couple minutes right before half, that was really the game. We built it
up right before half. We did a great job on our execution. We guarded all
night. They missed some open ones. Our transition defense wasn't good early
but I thought in the second half we guarded much better and just did a
tremendous job. It was just a gutted-out win.  
And definitely it wasn't pretty and we missed way too many free throws down
the stretch but they have been doing that to me all year. We'll take it. We're
looking forward for another day.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student athletes?  
  
Q. Donald, can you talk about playing under these conditions for you; how
tough was it?  
DONALD SLOAN: First time I ever experienced anything like this, you know. I
don't think I've had to deal with something like this my whole life. For it to
be somebody as close to me as it was, you know, kind of debating whether to
come up or not. Family asking me what I'm going to do. Teammates asking me
what I'm going to do. I think I made the right decision. I think she would
have wanted me to come up and play in this game for her.  
  
Q. Bryan, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit it seemed every time
Iowa State put together the run, you would jump in and really stop it. How
were you able to do that?  
BRYAN DAVIS: I think today as a team we really grew up. The guys came off the
bench and really helped us. We just kind of played great team D.  
  
Q. Donald, was it difficult to concentrate tonight with everything that's
happened? If you don't mind me asking, was your mother ill? What were the
circumstances?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: He really don't want to talk about it. She passed. She was
ill. She passed. He just asked me to handle that for him. He really don't want
to talk about it if that's okay with everybody. She passed away early this
morning.  
DONALD SLOAN: It was kind of tough. As you can see in the beginning of the
game, I felt like I was kind of out of tune, out of rhythm, out of sync a
little bit. I think it showed. The coaches pulled me to the side and told me
basically if I wanted to still do this. And I was like, yeah, you know. We are
in it together until the end.  
They patted me on the back and put me back in. The teammates embraced me
really well when I came back and I felt like if I needed anything, they were
there. They're there for me, I got to be there for them.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how important this win was? A lot of talk
about you guys needing one to get to NCAA. Was there some pressure there? Do
you feel like tomorrow there will be a little less?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Every game is important. We came up here to win. You know, we
came up here to win, try to win the whole tournament. We knew this game was
very important. I mean, it was always in the back of our mind but we never try
to let it affect us. You can see at the beginning of the game, it started to
affect us a little bit.  
We just got in a rhythm and started playing as a team and just went out there
and played hard.  
  
Q. Are you guys looking forward to playing K-State tomorrow for a shot of
redemption?  
DONALD SLOAN: I am. I'm pretty sure they are, too, and our coaches. I am
really looking forward to that game.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I mean, it is going to be a big game. K-State is a talented
team. They got a great coach over there. We just try to go out there and play
our best. It is going to be a great game. I think it is going to be a battle
to the end and they got great players on their team, and we got to go out
there and just fight.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we'll let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on the victory tonight.  
We will now take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Status on DeAndre. Was it stomach flu before and when are you expecting
to hear something?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: He is at the hospital right now. He was running a fever.
Originally we thought it was some food poisoning. It happened -- what's today?
Tuesday night, came down Tuesday night about 9:00, 10 o'clock. Didn't do
anything yesterday. Actually was able to eat for the first time at pregame
meal today and wanted to give it a shot but just couldn't give it a shot.  
And he's at the hospital right now with his mom. He has a fever. They are
going to do a CT scan to see if it's not his appendix. If it's not, then he's
just got a bad virus. So we're hoping it is just a bad virus. Status, probably
not good for tomorrow if it's a bad virus. But you never know with young kids.
We're just hoping it is not the appendix but we don't think it is.  
  
Q. I think just talk about the 12-0 run in the first half, how much momentum
that built and can you talk about the impact Bryan Davis had down low for
you.  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Well, the 12-0 run, we had a strange line-up in there, one
that we don't practice a lot.  
When I took the job at A&M I wanted to be a motion team. We're not a motion
team. We wanted motion before half, and then we just made plays. We were able
to spread them because we had some little guys out there and we made shots and
made plays right before half and it was huge.  
And then our transition defense hurt us most the first half, and they came
back and hit a 3. That was a big 3 to cut it to eight right before half for
them. But, no, I was really proud of that run and our execution because I
looked at the clock and we had Joe with 2, Bryan Davis with 2. I think Junior
had 2. You know B.J. came in and gave us great minutes.  
And then Bryan Davis was really good. We couldn't guard Brackins. He was
really hurting us. Actually, he did a great job on him and I thought Beau
Muhlbach did a great job on him. We helped Beau, we doubled a little bit on
Brackins when Beau was guarding him. I thought he did a great job of just
playing hard and playing with intensity and thought both those guys really
helped us a lot.  
I thought Junior, Chinemelu Elonu gave us some huge minutes for a guy that
hadn't played a lot lately, to go in there; he had a couple nice moves and
some nice rebounds and played smart tonight.  
So we did it by committee. It wasn't a routine game for us, by any stretch of
the imagination. But Bryan Davis was really good. I thought he had some big-
time blocks and did a good job.  
And then late in the game when we couldn't make free throws, he did a good job
defensively, switching out, guarding the guard and getting big rebounds for
us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup tomorrow with Kansas State? Sounds like
your guys are excited about this rematch.  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Well, I think we're just excited for another day. K-State
whipped us pretty good at their place. It was a good game for about 30
minutes, and then they whipped us. It seemed like they made every shot the
last 10 minutes of the game or a free throw.  
So we're looking forward to that. We realize we will probably be going into
another road crowd tomorrow night. K-State will probably have half the arena
tomorrow night. KU will probably have the other half. So we're looking forward
to it. Playing against a great player like Beasley. Walker took it to us last
game. Pullen had a heck of a year, Young had a good year. Very athletic.  
They did some things that gave us trouble. Hopefully we will be a better team
tomorrow than we were tonight.  
If DeAndre is back, we'll be deeper. But it will be a heck of a tough game for
us, one we're looking forward to. We're disappointed a little bit the way we
finished in the league because we lost a lot of home games, too many home
games this year. We're trying to make up for it here in this tournament.  
  
Q. Did you feel like there was a certain sense urgency tonight because of
the NCAA ramifications?  
COACH MARK TURGEON: Well, I didn't feel at the start. I thought our guys were
sleepwalking and really concerned me. We jumped them pretty good that first
time out and they woke out.  
But, yeah, long nerve-wracking day, you know, long nerve-wracking day.  
I don't know. I will not sit up here and politic for where we were, I thought
we were pretty into the tournament because the league did so well but tonight
helped.  
I don't know if our guys were nervous about that or not. I'm sure they were
because every time you turned around, they were talking about bubble and teams
trying to get in. So a lot of pressure on these kids. We try to get them to
play hard and not think about those things and just go out and get the victory
and I think we did that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the courage of Donald Sloan to come back and play a
game like this under those circumstances.  
COACH MARK TURGEON: What a tough kid. The first play of the game he ran the
play wrong and I was like, oh, no. And up until game time, we thought DeAndre
was going to play. I will get back to Sloan. All of a sudden we are looking
around, DeAndre was not going to play. I think that kind of blindsided us,
too, because he was warming up.  
But Sloan to do what he did, he got himself going right before halftime. He
almost had a triple-double tonight, nine assists, nine rebounds and 12 points.
You could tell he was fatigued. Two nights ago he didn't sleep at all because
the call came and his mom wanted to see him one last time and his blood-shot
eyes the next morning from crying and everything else.  
Last night he didn't get any sleep either and had he to get up here and catch
a flight here. To do what he did, you know, we know how tough he is because
we're around him every day and you see him. But I couldn't have done what that
kid did today. It was pretty special. You know -- I know his mom was really
proud of him before she passed, and obviously if she is looking down tonight,
she's really proud of him. Not only the way he plays but he is just a great
kid, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Drew Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14395)

### [Marcus King-Stockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18145)

### [Richard Roby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13912)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Colorado Buffalos and Coach Bzdelik and
he brought three student athletes, Marcus Hall, Richard Roby, and Marcus King-
Stockton. Let's go to questions for our three student athletes first.  
  
Q. The first half, was that the best you guys have felt running the offense
this year?  
RICHARD ROBY: I think we ran the offense well at times, but for 20 minutes I
think we did make the extra pass and looked for one, another and we shot a
great percentage at halftime. We did that because we got stops, too, and we
pushed the ball up and let the defense get set.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could talk about the way that Baylor was able to come
back and tie the game and then you still had the extra jets to go out and put
them away in overtime.  
MARCUS HALL: It is a game of runs, you know? We went on our run and we knew
they were going to come back and fight. They won 20 games this year, so we
knew they weren't going to go out without fighting. It was about weathering
the storm. Like the Coach said in the locker room, when the smoke cleared, we
were on top.  
RICHARD ROBY: Yeah, it is a good basketball team. They were able to make shots
and get the ball to transition and they're great one-on-one. We knew they
could score the ball. We just had to sustain the run. We did that and we kept
fighting.  
  
Q. Marcus and Richard, can you both address, that must have been the most
support you have had out of a crowd all year, even at home, wasn't it?  
RICHARD ROBY: We have a great crowd, I think. People that support us do a
great job. I guess we had some other people start supporting us at the end
probably. Didn't want to see Baylor win.  
MARCUS HALL: We appreciate those who do support us.  
MARCUS KING-STOCKTON: Yep.  
  
Q. For Marcus, can you just talk about the give and go working a lot today
and how much y'all's confidence kept growing with sticking with it and going
to the basket and following through on all those plays?  
MARCUS HALL: They were playing pretty aggressive defense. We knew when we hit
a wing or swing the ball, that you have to look for it afterwards, you know?
And we just -- we knew that we had to drive the ball and get away from the
jump shot and not fall in love with the jumper. That's what got us shooting
70-something percent in the first half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- I mean, did your eyes kind of light up when you saw
a smaller guy on you on defense?  
RICHARD ROBY: Not really. A lot of teams put smaller guys on me to try take
away my driving abilities and make me into a jump-shooter. And Jerrells is a
great defender, very strong. I knew my work was cut out for me going up
against him the last couple years.  
  
Q. Both the women's and men's has been a tournament of upsets with the 12
seeds coming through and being the 5 seeds. Did you feel like underdogs --
this is for any of the players -- when you were out there facing Baylor?  
RICHARD ROBY: We thought we matched up with them. We watched film. We saw what
we needed to do better and we never felt like a 12th seed. We had a lot of
tough losses throughout the year, a lot of close games. So we knew we were
better than our seed was.  
  
Q. What was the mind-set going into the second overtime? You had the lead in
regulation. You had it in the first overtime. What are you feeling going into
that second overtime?  
MARCUS HALL: Don't give up, you know. This could have been our last
opportunity, you know, and it is a new season for us, and that's the way we're
looking at it. We refused to give up.  
  
Q. You guys know you are the first 12th seed ever to win and how does that
feel?  
MARCUS KING-STOCKTON: Feels great. (Smiling).  
RICHARD ROBY: It does feel good. Me and Marcus and Marcus -- Marcus sophomore
and me and the other Marcus are freshmen. We are the first 11th seed to win
here, too. That's a big accomplishment.  
  
Q. Kevin Rogers scored 24 points the first time he played. Was that a big
key for you all to not allow him?  
MARCUS KING-STOCKTON: Yes, it was. The first time they played us, he hurt us
on offense and got a lot of easy dunks. We want to try to take that away from
him and make him earn some points.  
  
Q. Rich, you beat Oklahoma in boulder and afterwards their coach talked
about being embarrassed. Is that any motivation for you guys catching them
tomorrow?  
RICHARD ROBY: You know, we just want to go out there and play hard. We can't
worry about what people say in the media. We know we're capable of beating
that team on our own floor, on a neutral floor. We got to go out there and
execute and play with the same type of intensity we played with today.  
MARCUS HALL: I mean, like Rich said, we can't worry about what people say. We
believe and to us that's all that matters, the coaches and the team and those
that are supporting us believe we can win the ball game tomorrow. That's all
that matters.  
  
Q. Is that motivation to you, though, that they said that?  
MARCUS HALL: Of course.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you very much. Congratulations on your victory today.
We'll excuse you to go back to your locker room.  
We'll keep Coach here for questions.  
  
Q. Jeff, you said yesterday you have trouble getting a feel in the locker
room how the team is going to come out. Were you pleasantly surprised the
first half the way they executed?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: You know, we haven't won as many times as we would have
liked throughout the course of the year. But this team has always battled.
We've lost Big 12 games by one on the road, by two on the road and by six on
the road, at home by seven, by nine.  
You know, they've always battled and that's one thing -- I've slept good
throughout the year from that standpoint, that I know that they will give it
their very best and we've come up short but this team, they have a big heart.
They're great young men. I'm proud to be coaching them.  
And I would have said that today had we lost.  
  
Q. Jeff, can you talk about what you saw in Baylor's defense that you were
able to take advantage of today?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Well, they really got up into us. I shouldn't be giving
away any secrets, so I'm not sure I want to answer that question (smiling).  
But we really did a great job of passing the ball, making the extra pass. I
think that was the key. We practiced this morning. I mean, we watched film
last night. We're going to -- regardless of where we're seeded or what our
record is, we're going to keep working to get better. And our players showed
that today.  
We learned a lot about ourselves the last couple of days in practice and
worked on a few extra things and the thing is we made the extra pass today. We
cut a little bit harder with a purpose. We had variety to our offense.  
I think this offense takes a long time to develop, and it is getting better as
time goes on every day. And so I think we saw the fruits of our labor today,
especially in that first half.  
  
Q. Is this kind of what you expect, what kind of performance you expect out
of a senior like Roby?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Without question. I thought Richard handled himself very
well. You know, Richard is a terrific young man. I think all you have to do is
listen to him. He is very intelligent, carries himself really well.  
He does great in the classroom. He's been a joy to coach. I wish I could have
him for another couple years. You know, he rebounded the ball today, got a
couple blocks, got a couple steals, communicated well on defense, cut hard;
really proud of him, really happy for him.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about your defensive effort? It was two seconds to go in the
second overtime when they matched their season average in points.  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: You know, we held Baylor down to 68 points. The first time
we played them, which is well below their average, I think they were averaging
83 points per game at that time when we played them. We tried to trap their
ball screens.  
Today they tried to drive against it, and I think they got away from their
ball screens which is their bread and butter and they just started putting
their head down and driving the ball on us in that second half.  
Jermy Jackson and Marcus King-Stockton, their biggest strength is their
athleticism and their intelligence and in order to blitz or we call trapping
ball screens, they're excellent at doing that, they can do that well against a
team that runs a lot of ball screens, they become very effective players in
that kind of game. So that really helps us to hold them down below what they
normally average.  
  
Q. One of the most talked about games in the Big 12 was the five overtime
Baylor game. Did it concern you at all just going up against the team with
that kind of overtime experience and a team that's really proven that they can
almost play forever?  
COACH JEFF BZDELIK: Well, they're very deep. We're not. But I wasn't
concerned. I enjoy these kind of games, to be honest with you. I think that's
what you get into coaching for. Being in the moment.  
Even though we haven't been in overtime games this year, you know, we practice
special situations a lot so we're prepared. I think preparation breeds
confidence so we practice special situations a lot. You never know. And
tonight -- today was one of those moments.  
It's not like when you are in a time out and you diagram something where we've
run this hundreds of times in practice, in this kind of situation. Yes, it is
not in that particular moment in the game, but we know what to do. And I
thought we executed well at times -- most of the time.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you. Congratulations and good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Craig Brackins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18160)

### [Rahshon Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16319)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Cyclones. We have Coach McDermott
and his two student athletes, Rahshon Clark and Craig Brackins.  
Coach, we'll go to you first with your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: Well, the statistics are very telling. We turned it
over few enough times to give ourselves a chance to win. We rebounded well
enough against a very good rebounding team to give ourselves a chance to win
and we held them to 42% shooting.  
And that got a little bit better late as we were pressuring when they got some
easy baskets, which was good enough to win. But to win in this game you have
to make shots, and we missed some free throws. We missed some front-end
1-on-1s. We had some open looks in the first half from the three-point line
and, you know, missed some opportunities down deep to make shots. Our margin
for error is pretty small, and when we don't cash in on those opportunities,
it makes it really difficult for us to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our two student athletes?  
  
Q. Rahshon, talk about the defensive job you did on Carter tonight.  
RAHSHON CLARK: Basically I just tried not to let them get the ball. I knew if
he was able to get a couple shots off, good looks, that he would start getting
into his momentum and start making shots so I just tried my best not to let
him touch the ball.  
  
Q. Rahshon, I was wondering if you could kind of talk about what was going
through your mind there at the end when you were walking off the court.  
RAHSHON CLARK: Basically that I'm going to miss this. You know, this is my
final game as a Cyclone. I will always be a Cyclone but I just won't be able
to step on the floor with these guys and play with them anymore. I will just
miss in this whole experience.  
  
Q. Craig, can you just talk about finishing up the season strong like you
have here in these last two games, how much confidence do you have given the
improvement this team has shown even though it hasn't resulted in some of the
wins you would like and some of the players coming in for next season.  
CRAIG BRACKINS: I have been pretty confident. I have had a couple good games
toward the end. Our team's confidence is really high right now. We're excited
to just get ready and start for the next season, and we're expecting our young
guys to come in next year and be really good.  
  
Q. Rahshon, you and McDermott had kind of a little moment at the end of the
game. What were you guys talking about?  
RAHSHON CLARK: Basically, you know, that we were going to miss each other,
miss, you know, me being here, you know, trying to win games and things like
that; just that we're going to miss each other basically.  
  
Q. Rahshon, what are you feeling right now? Are you a little disappointed
just kind of the way this game turned out and kind of the offense futility you
guys had?  
RAHSHON CLARK: I am not disappointed. We went out there and gave it everything
we had. The guys never gave up. You know, we tried our best and that's all I
could ask for, even though we didn't come up with a win.  
You know, we played, you know, as best as we could. I can't ask for anything
more than that.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we'll let you go back to the locker room and we'll
keep Coach here for final questions. Thanks for coming.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, it was kind of a roller coaster season. Talk about Rahshon Clark's
role and his leadership and what he's taught the younger players.  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: I think the thing that sticks out to me the most -- and
I shared it with the team in the locker room -- I asked them if my staff and I
were gone tomorrow and all but a few of their teammates decided to leave as
well, does Iowa State mean enough to you that you'd stay? And the answer when
Rahshon Clark was posed that question was, yes, it does.  
This institution and our athletic program and our basketball program in
particular will always be indebted to him for that decision because that is
the -- in my mind, the ultimate sign of unselfishness because the easy thing
for him to do would have been to leave and nobody would have questioned it.
But he made the decision for reasons that he felt were the right reasons for
him, not what other people were telling him to do.  
And along the way -- not a lot of people know this -- he tried to convince his
teammates to stay but he didn't look down upon them when they made the
decision to leave. That's the ultimate in leadership. He knew there were going
to be some tough times ahead and he wasn't afraid of that challenge.  
  
Q. You guys kind of went with a smaller line-up at times using less at the
far. Do you think that forced you to take more jump shots that could have
contributed to the low shooting percentage?  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: We were up 7-2 and we went 15 possessions without
scoring a basket. And I think only three of those resulted in turnovers. And
if my count is right, nine of those were either put-backs or layups, nine of
those possessions.  
We couldn't get anything to fall. It wasn't necessarily just jump shots. We
only took 10 three-point shots the first half and one of them was late in the
half. So I don't think we were casting up a lot of bad shots. I think we
missed a lot of good shots.  
But, obviously, A&M has been successful this year in large part because
they're so sound defensively. And they tried to take away what we wanted to do
as we tried to do with them and defensively, as I mentioned, we played well
enough to win but we're at 7-2 and the next time you look up there, we're down
14-7. A stretch like that against a team that's -- wasn't long ago this team
was almost a top ten team in the country, it's hard to come back from.  
To our guys' credit, we got back in the game and made it a game in the second
half.  
  
Q. Coach, another close loss, I guess you could say. Craig had another good
game. Do you feel good about these kids? Have they started to turn a corner
toward the end of the season?  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: They didn't quit. As a coach, I think that's the thing
that we have to take as a positive from the last two weeks of this season is
that Craig Brackins went into one of the biggest funks I have ever had a
player go into. It happens to a lot of freshmen and most times they don't come
out of it. To his credit, he's ended the season with two really good games.  
Diante Garrett has made steady progress throughout the season and Wesley
Johnson has learned to play the game when he doesn't have all the athletic
skills that he is accustomed to having because he is not healthy. That will
bode well for him when he's back and he is healthy because he learned to play
the game in a different way. I appreciate he's been willing to do that.  
But I like our young group. I like the leadership that I think our seniors and
Wesley Johnson will provide next year. Obviously with the four incoming kids
and Luca Staiger coming back on board and the one or two players we may add to
this recruiting class, they will be looked upon in a big way to provide some
good leadership.  
There has been some good learning lessons from them from hanging around
Rahshon Clark the last couple years.  
  
Q. Don't mean to pick on one player, but Hubalek's line jump was 0-8 from
the field. Was there something that caused that to happen?  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: It is hard for me to explain. We got the ball to him
deep where he has been successful and he had a couple roll around the rim and
didn't go in. He probably let it affect his confidence, but, you know, my
message to Jiri after the game, don't you dare take this away as a memory from
your experience at Iowa State. You've accomplished so much. You've come so far
in the two years I've had the opportunity to coach you. This needs to become
the furthest thing from your mind. You had one bad game and don't let that
sour the great experience you had as a Cyclone.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about just kind of the emotions of having
Rahshon play in his last game. I mean, there are so many fans down here from
Iowa State, you guys had a big crowd. He's waving, everybody is cheering him.
How is the team reacting with that, too, just all that emotion, especially
with all those fans here?  
COACH GREGG McDERMOTT: Our fans are very basketball-savvy. And like me, they
understand the sacrifice he made to stay here. You know, he's flying all over
the court, seven offensive rebounds, playing on one leg. And our fans
appreciate that because they understand basketball.  
We were able to inch back in that game because our fans willed us to do it,
like they usually do. It was just unfortunate we couldn't go on and extend a
run to really allow them to impact the game because I think they were waiting
to do that. Unfortunately we couldn't make enough baskets to do that. But they
appreciate it like I appreciate what Rahshon has done for this program and the
leadership he's provided during a rebuilding stage of our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [DeMarre Carroll](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18157)

### [Matt Lawrence](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17019)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Missouri Tigers, Coach Mike
Anderson and his two student athletes, DeMarre Carroll and Matt Lawrence.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: First of all, I wanted to say I was very disappointed in
our performance today. I thought coming over I thought we would be amped up
and ready to play. We had the opportunity to play in the tournament here in
Kansas City, but for some reason, just seemed like what you saw today has kind
of been a synapse of our season. To me that's the way I look at it.  
But one thing our guys did, they went down fighting, and you got to give
credit to Nebraska. I think the game was played at their tempo and they were
able to come out with the win, but it wasn't because of lack of effort. It
just seemed like we couldn't throw it in the ocean today. When you get to
tournament play, we scored 56 points. We scored 55 points, 56 points in the
half. It just wasn't our day. Again, you got to credit Nebraska in doing a
good job. But we had opportunities. Again, I will just talk about the
inconsistencies we have had throughout the year, with players in and out.  
But, again, I thought our guys continued to fight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, if you could talk about how would you describe your team's mood at
halftime?  
MATT LAWRENCE: Well, I think they went into the half, they knocked down a shot
and it was a little bit of a momentum swing but, you know, we knew that the
game was 40 minutes and we went on the second half and we wanted to get after
them for the first five minutes. But credit to Nebraska, they came out. They
had a game plan. Slowed us down and we let them do it.  
It was just kind of -- the first half seemed a lot like the second half. We
never really could turn it, you know, get the lead in our favor. And it is
just a credit to how well they played.  
  
Q. DeMarre, those last two minutes you pulled within one, what was the
difference in the game and the last two minutes that helped Nebraska pull
away?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Well, I don't think it's nothing Nebraska did. I think we
just beat ourself. Every time we got close, we shot ourself in the foot by
getting a turnover or making an easy layover or looking for the refs to make a
certain call. I think we shot ourselves in the foot. I didn't see the energy
today. We just didn't have the energy.  
Just one of them days. Hopefully our young players, we can regroup and come
back next year and try to win this thing.  
  
Q. It reminded me a lot of the end of the game at home this year when you
guys lost to them by four. You were close at the end. Is there something about
Nebraska, with their dispensing switches or any of their game plan that has
made it hard for you guys both times to get over that hump and take the lead
back late?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Like I said before, it's nothing Nebraska did. I think it was
us, we just shot ourselves in the foot. We like to get the game up-tempo up
and down. When we get it up-tempo, we get closer and closer and then we will
make a missed turnover or easy lay-up or looking for the ref to make a certain
call.  
Give credit to Nebraska, they're a great team. I think it was more that we did
that really made us not do the things that we should have done out there
tonight.  
  
Q. DeMarre, you brought it up, you spoke of next year. Has it sunk in that
this year is, indeed, over?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Well, you know, once we get back, you know, Coach will give
us time off and we got to really think about this year.  
But, you know, this year there has been ups and downs. There has been a lot of
stuff going on. You know, I think for us to come this far, you know, with all
the stuff that's been going on, you know, I'm still -- it is not the best
season, but I'm just happy we made it this far 'cause we really didn't have to
make it this far, all the stuff that went on, given credit to our coaching
staff. They really kept us in tune and they never lost, you know, the dream,
the road, the rainbow down the road.  
So hopefully we can continue and get better next year.  
  
Q. DeMarre, how important to the outcome of the game was the fact they had
13 more second-chance points than you guys and 11 more rebounds than you
guys?  
DeMARRE CARROLL: Like I said before, it was energy. I just didn't see the
energy in our guys. Yesterday we was hyped and jumping up and down. Today I
don't know if it was nervousness or jitters. I just didn't see the energy.  
You know, it is one of them days. Hopefully we can just regroup.  
  
Q. Matt, I wanted to follow up on a question with DeMarre. How long has the
season felt for you?  
MATT LAWRENCE: Well, it's been a roller coaster ride. There are parts of the
season that I will always remember. You know, times when bad things have
happened to our team, but we came back and got a huge win, Kansas State. We
started out the season beating Texas. I mean, you know, it is a credit to guys
that have been working hard all year.  
You know, the season didn't finish out how we'd like it to, but, you know, it
has had its ups, too. I think we're going to move forward and celebrate our
seniors and then like I said, just move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you go back to the locker room. Thanks for coming.
We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Mike, what are reasonable expectations for next season?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, I think my goal every year is to be at the big
dance, is to have the opportunity to win a national championship. The only way
to do that is to be in the NCAA tournament.  
I think some of the foundation, you know, you can see, some of it is laid.
That's why we have the movement with our young guys with Keon Lawrence and
J.T. Tiller, Matt Lawrence, Justin Safford. I think you saw that movement
where those guys were playing quite a bit. Hopefully we can add on with the
recruiting class we have. We have a young man sitting here, Zaire Taylor. We
are laying the foundation about what we are going to be about.  
This game in particular, I think depth was an issue. When you don't have guys
have it going on, you got to have somebody come off the bench to spark you.  
Even with that being said, we shot 30-some-odd percent and we still had a
chance. I think the question was 2:00 to go in the game and that's the
learning part of this game. We have to learn how to win and finish off games.
We're doing it with other guys now.  
So, therefore, you got to make plays. But, again, I think my expectation every
year is to win a national championship. I don't know when it's going to take
place, but that's my expectation. That's just me.  
  
Q. Mike, have you been to a lot of NCAA tournaments at UAB. How does the
talent here compare to that? Are you close?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think it is going to take some recruiting classes, no
question about it. I inherited a team. One thing about me, I never complain,
you know, about what I don't have. I just work with what I got.  
I think what you've seen, a steady improvement of players. When you look at
Matt Lawrence, I think you've seen a guy that was sitting on the end of the
bench really when I first got here. Even with Keon, Lyons, that's the key. We
have always had the opportunity to develop players. As you develop players,
you develop teams. How do you do that? You got to get better players,
especially when you talk at this level to play consistently night in and night
out. So no question about it, I think our talent level has got to go up. But I
think we got a good class.  
I think we got a pretty decent nucleus of guys that have played a couple
years. So they know the expectation. Again, you can just look out there on
their faces going down the stretch and just see, we got some young colts out
there, J.T. Tiller in particular. He gives us energy. Leo Lyons, I mean Leo
before I got here, he didn't play a whole lot of basketball.  
So now he's starting to put it together. But as I said, the season to me has
been -- what you saw today has been kind of the up and down of the season.  
  
Q. With some of the seniors, like Darryl and Marshall, they're playing time
especially compared to last season sort of dropped off a lot. Was it just more
of a problem with them not fitting with the system? What was it in your
mind?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think we had some other guys that were playing well.
Again, I thought we went with the young guys, the guys that were leaving it
all on the floor.  
I mean, that's -- again, when we had the incidents that took place, we had
some guys, hey, we're going to go with these guys and those guys were in
different roles. At times they did -- they came in and filled those roles. But
we had some other guys that I thought were playing better than they were.  
  
Q. The talk is of next year. If the CIB calls, will you accept that
invitation?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: My expectation every year is to be at NCAA tournament, of
course, NIT and that's how I feel. Right now we just had a tough loss.  
Again, my expectation, no question about it, to be at the NCAA tournament
every year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Leo Lyons' game and some of his struggles today as
well as what you expect from his future in terms of coming back next year.  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think you saw what I talked about. We have to wait
until the next game. We talk about consistency. I think -- there were only a
few games where you saw our team click on all cylinders. Again, I thought Leo
right here at the last stretch, I thought he put some games together.  
And, hopefully -- he can see that there is a lot of work to be. When you talk
about wanting to be one of the better players in our league, not only that in
our league, in our country, so there is a lot of work to be done for Leo, not
only Leo but our basketball team in order to get better because, I think next
time we play in this tournament, we're going -- we'll put on a better
performance than we did today.  
  
Q. We talked about the offenses and things that were disappointing. Tell me
a little bit about some things that you did well today, particularly on
defense because the Cornhuskers had maybe half a dozen games all season where
they scored this few points, you had a 5-second stop late in the game and the
defense obviously did some well things for you?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: We did some decent things. When you talk about
defensively, even as we went down, we still fought our way to get back in the
game with the basketball with an opportunity to go up. Again, that's why I
say, the inexperience of maybe attacking to get to the free-throw line. I
think with a veteran player, they understand. You got to attack and make
something happen. I thought we did some decent things. I thought the second-
chance points were big. I think somebody made that comment. They got some
loose balls. We had been getting those going down the stretch here and it
makes a big difference.  
Again, to me, it is just the inconsistency. You can see us turn it on, and
then it kind of goes away. We start off the second half, which blew my mind, I
don't think we scored a field goal until 12 minutes to go in the half and yet
we're still right there. Again, there is the inconsistencies.  
Again, with experience in bringing in some better players to fit what we're
doing, I think the foundation is going to be laid and I think you are going to
see us really, really improve, I think, as a team next year because, again,
when you win -- to win in this league, you got to have players. You got to
have very good players.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you again.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Cowboys of Oklahoma State, Coach Sean
Sutton and his three student athletes: Byron Eaton, Terrel Harris and James
Anderson.  
Coach, congratulations on your victory today. Your thoughts and initial
comments on today's game.  
COACH SUTTON: I thought Texas Tech really came out and played well, which I
thought they would, knowing Pat, even though they had come off some tough
defeats. I thought their guys really played with great energy throughout the
game. They shot the ball extremely well. Our defense looked like we were down
at the Y, just playing playground ball, not to take anything away from them. I
think they do as good a job with their motion offense, Pat has continued that.
I did think that we were as nearly sharp defensively as we've been down the
stretch of this season.  
I was really proud of our freshmen, not knowing how they were going to react
for the first time in post-season play. Those guys had 37 points, 15 rebounds.
Byron really came back. I challenged him at half time he had to be the best
point guard on the court. Came back and scored 12 points in the second half,
made a lot of big plays down the stretch and then James made a great defensive
play when blocked that shot shot and hit the two big free throws. Forced us to
win and happy to get this first round behind us and hopefully play better
tomorrow against an outstanding team.  
  
Q. James, did you feel like this was the best game maybe you've played
against a Big 12 team this year?  
JAMES ANDERSON: Yes, I think it is. I came out and made big plays and picked
up our defense from where I had been playing earlier in the year and made a
big block and hit two big free throws. I think it was one of my best games
this year.  
COACH SUTTON: He rebounded better, too. He had 8 rebounds.  
  
Q. Byron, how many times has Sean challenged you this year? I hear the word
"challenge" associated with you quite a bit?   
BYRON EATON: He challenged me quite a bit this year. It all started at the
beginning of the season. He challenged myself, Terrel and Obi to run the team
and to be at our best.  
And every game is a challenge for me to guard their point guard and play the
way I should play.  
And I think the last few games he challenged me the most because I have been
going up against some good guys. He told me to come out there and run my team.
I think I have been doing a great job of responding to his challenges. I got
to keep it up as I go against another great team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Terrel, Byron got his third foul late in the first half and you were down
6 the guy made the foul shots. The rest of the half you went on a big run. Can
you talk about how you guys were able to play well without Byron on the
floor?  
TERREL HARRIS: Well, during that time we pushed the ball a little more. When
Byron is in, he pushes the ball and runs the offense. When we don't have
Byron, we really don't have too much players we run because we really don't
have a true point guard on the court, so I believe our transition points
picked up a little more and our defense picked up more.  
So we really just carried Byron while he was out and just took up his slack.  
  
Q. James, what do you think during that time out between your free throws?
Are you thinking, Coach has iced me here?  
JAMES ANDERSON: Coach just told me to take my time, stand at the line and
don't fall back and fade away from my free throws because I faded away earlier
when I shot two free throws and I missed one. He just told me to stay in there
and I hit it.  
  
Q. Byron, it seemed like for a good portion of the game that you were kind
of out there, kind of up and down but then late you emerged to take the game
over, in a sense. Can you tell us how that happened? Maybe why it took until
the end of the game for you to be what you could be.  
BYRON EATON: I can't say why it took so long. I had some great looks during
the game, I just wasn't able to knock them down.  
But the main thing came down to my team did a great job when I was on the
bench keeping us until the game. When I came back, like I said, Coach tried
and challenged me the second half. Marcus Dove told me, "It is your turn to
take over the team. You need to be the best point guard out on the floor."
Like Coach Sutton said, that's what I did. I got high enough. They tried to
switch on us a few times, I was able to get to the rack. If not, I found the
open man.  
I was doing a lot of things I had been doing in the past and it was successful
for us. I got back to doing what we were good at.  
  
Q. Voskuil finished with a lot of points. It seemed like when Terrel was in,
he did a pretty good job keeping him quiet.  
COACH SUTTON: He moves about as well as anybody without the ball. I think him
and A.J. from Texas, those guys are in constant motion. It's hard for just one
guy to guard them in a situation like that. We had to rotate different guys on
Terrel. They had done a very good job on him the first two times we played
them.  
He got off to a hot start and second half they went right back to him and Obi
got caught up on a couple of fade screens and didn't get through. I thought
when Terrel came back in, at least he had him more under control. He didn't
get as many good looks.  
TERREL HARRIS: I got to tell you, that is the hardest person to guard in the
Big 12 to me. I had to guard A.B. Abrams a lot and he moves a lot, too. But
they have Augustin that really penetrates and gets some shots. But Voskuil,
the offense is just constant movement. You have to always be on your Ps and Qs
with him. So whenever you let up -- anytime you let up, he'll dodge you, you
know?  
I mean, I try to always stay with us, try to stay in his tracks and make sure
he doesn't have any space. He hit some tough shots today, and he did good
today. Wasn't my best defensive job on him today.  
  
Q. You guys played two really close games with Texas. What's it going to
take for you guys to knock them out tomorrow?  
BYRON EATON: I think the main thing is we got to come in and get a great
start. They got a great start down there in Texas in our house. And we got to
close out the half. In our house, I think they were on a 10-0 run and went up
10 points. I think they went up 2, 3 points at their half. The main thing is
we have to do a better job of guarding them. We can't give them open shots. We
need to do a better job on closing out shooters. Make them run. They're good
at pushing people. You got to push it back at them and see how good they
really are.  
The main thing is we just got to guard them and guard them guys and see how
good they really are and knock down some shots when we get the opportunities.  
TERREL HARRIS: Well, with Texas we do play them close. We have played them
close basically every year -- I mean, every year since I've been here. And I
believe that this year everybody has to win their matchups. Byron has to win
his matchup with Augustin. I have to win my matchup with Abrams. Our starting
seven has to outplay their first seven. That's basically what it comes down
to. People have to make plays, we have to rebound the ball and just control --
control their transition.  
So I mean, they are a really good team and they execute their core offense. So
we just really have to just play good defense and really just execute them --
out-execute them.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you for coming and congratulations to your victory today.
We will let you return to the locker room.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What about this -- is your team improving every game like you were during
that streak even through the Oklahoma disappointment? Do you feel like you are
getting better?  
COACH SUTTON: I thought we did some good things today. Obviously we did not
play defense like we've been doing but I thought we got down a couple times
and we fought back and took the lead and it was kind of a see-saw game. I
thought our guys did a good job of hanging in there. They made some great
shots, shot the ball extremely well from the three-point line. I think we are
still getting better.  
In a situation like this, you never know how deep you are going to react the
first time out, even with -- I thought our young guys did really well. Some of
our older guys I didn't think reacted as well as they have been playing early,
as the game went on. Certainly Byron, Obi, both those guys got going a little
bit down the stretch and then I thought Marcus Dove was pretty solid
throughout. I mean, for him to hold Zeno to seven points I thought was a huge
key.  
And then Byron, he didn't play very good offensively until late but his
defense on Roberson was outstanding. Held him to 2 points. That was a matchup
that I really challenged him in, that he had scored 20 the last time we played
them in Lubbock and he was the difference in the game. I thought Byron did a
lot better job at defending him today.  
  
Q. You switched to the small lineup. Why?  
COACH SUTTON: Well, we were having a hard time getting back to Cook and he was
causing us problems, wasn't stepping out there -- Thomas and Adams weren't
getting out there to defend the three-point shot. So he put five guards on the
court if you count Marcus Dove, that way we could switch all ball screens and
then Pat countered and put in a small lineup of his own. Basically it was five
guards at both ends of the court.  
And defensively, it allowed us to switch a lot of things against their motion,
switch ball screens. I thought it worked out for us.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the way this team has battled and fought all the way
and then also looking ahead to Texas?  
COACH SUTTON: Chris, this team has been really fun for me to coach. We
struggled early, which I expected because when you lose as many quality
players as we lost and you throw JamesOn Curry into that mix and you start
with seven new players, I knew it would be a challenge early because of how
hard our schedule was. If I had to do it all over again, no one -- those guys,
I probably would have played a softer, nonconference schedule. But these guys
have continued to battle every day. As I said, a lot of fun to coach. I think
we've made great improvement.  
I told them I'm tired of having to come to the Big 12 tournament to win the
tournament, just to get in the NCAA. I want it to go back to the way it used
to be where we come in here and we're already in it.  
But they stayed together. They believed that we would get better and they
played hard. That's all you can ask for as a coach.  
They have to learn a valuable lesson. In conference play, you cannot lose at
home. It just kills you when you lose at home. I told them after the Texas
game, how many home games did we lose? And they counted up three. I said, if
we went -- if we went to three games at home, we are in third place and that's
a lesson that you freshmen have got to learn from here on out. That when you
play conference games at home, you are going to win those because they're hard
to get on the road. And hopefully those guys will remember that as we start
into the conference season a year from now.  
Really proud of this team and hopefully we can keep it going and play well.  
  
Q. About Texas?  
COACH SUTTON: I think they're as legitimate Final Four team. I think they got
a great point guard, Augustin is as good as anybody in the country. They can
shoot the basketball. They play very good defense, and they're explosive in
transitions. So we've played them well both times. They've just made a few
more plays than us at the end of the game. Put ourselves in position last
Sunday and Abrams hit a big 3 for them late that proved to be a big difference
in the game.  
  
Q. Sean, was that James' best game in some time and was there something you
had seen that gave you reason to believe that was coming?  
COACH SUTTON: I thought it was, John. He practiced really well this week. I
thought his shot looked better this week. He looked more relaxed. I thought he
played pretty good at Texas but in terms of his most complete game, this is
probably the best game he's played since we started the Big 12.  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, thank you and again congratulations. Good luck tomorrow.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [Jessie Sapp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17172)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. It appeared that your team really failed to match their intensity. You
look at the offensive numbers particularly, that seems to be the difference in
the game. What jumps out at you about that?  
COACH THOMPSON III: They hurt us on the boards. It was evident right from the
beginning. You know, who, what, when, where, why, I don't know. I thought our
guys fought and scrapped. But the rebounding was key.  
  
Q. At the end of the first half, they were outrebounding you. Those are
hustle plays. How did you address that at the beginning of the second half,
because I really saw your team get out-hustled particularly on the boards.  
COACH THOMPSON III: It just happens. It's one of those days. I agree, it did
happen. And you've got to give them all the credit in the world. That's a team
that's gone through a lot of adversity this year with the injuries that
they've had.  
Obviously, Jamie is a terrific coach. They've done a terrific job of sticking
together and staying focused as a unit. So you've got to give just all the
credit to them for what they accomplished today.  
  
Q. What will you take away from these three games heading into the NCAAs?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I got to digest it before I can answer that question, I
guess. This the second part of the year has just ended. The third part of the
year is getting ready to start. So as we try to do all the time, you know, you
can't have too many high highs, you can't have too many low lows. That's hard
to say that right now because it doesn't feel too good right now.  
But, you know, we're not a group that feels sorry for ourselves. So now we've
got to regroup. We have to grow, we have to be better. As I said all year, we
have to be better next week than we are this week. So you don't want to ruin
the third part of the year because you're feeling sorry for yourself about
losing tonight. We have to move on. We have to move on.  
  
Q. Last year you guys were able to ride the wave of winning Big East
Tournament into the Final Four. But how do you guys turn this loss and still
be able to keep your chins up for the tournament?  
ROY HIBBERT: No matter what, we just have to bounce back. Figure things out.
Look at stuff from this past game and just move on to the next segment of the
year.  
  
Q. Jessie, did that team play like a team that had played four games in four
days?  
JESSIE SAPP: They just played like they wanted to win. They did a lot of
hustle plays. And you wouldn't have known that they played in four days. They
just played hard, and congratulations to those guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Sam Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18114)

  
_NEW YORK, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH DIXON: Thank you. This obviously is a great win, great performance, and
great effort by our guys. First of all, I'd like to praise Georgetown and
their university and their basketball program and Coach Thompson, who is first
of all a great coach and a classy, classy person. We beat a very good team,
and we understand that and we knew we had to play well, so I can't say enough
about our effort, but I also can't say enough that we beat a quality program
run by a quality person in Coach Thompson.  
As far as our guys, every guy stepped up. Every guy made plays. And I don't
know where to start. We could probably start with the guy next to me, who did
it for all four games, and he's been doing it all year, and he's getting
better and better. So I'm proud of him and how he's gotten better and better.
And the defensive guys and offensively. But I'm just more proud of him how
he's become a leader, and I think it's a great testament to his team work and
belief, and willingness to take on extra and want to do more. So I can't say
enough about Sam and how he's played. It is well deserved.  
  
Q. Talk about the aggressiveness that you had tonight, on the line 44 times,
and just as important, outrebounding this team?  
COACH DIXON: Well, we had to do that. We had to outrebound them. We talked
about it. For whatever reason, I didn't think we were playing as aggressive as
we needed to, say, ten games ago. And I don't know what it was. Maybe it was
the numbers, maybe it was the practices that we were unable to do. But when we
got all our guys back and we were able to get back into it and do the things
we do, we have just been more physical, more aggressive, and just more like we
normally are, I mean, more like Pitt.  
It just carried over throughout this whole tournament. And the rebounding was
obviously a key factor again tonight. The fouls, obviously, it seemed like
those were the longest two and a half minutes in history. If we could have
made a few more, I think they would have stopped fouling, but we kept them in
it a little bit.  
But, again, we were attacking off the dribble, which is something we wanted to
do as well.  
  
Q. Knowing everything you've been through this year, how sweet is this
because you've managed to survive so much?  
COACH DIXON: I don't know if it makes it any more sweeter, but it doesn't take
away from what our guys have been through. When I see a Mike Cook out there
celebrating, and I see Austin Wallace out there celebrating, and Cassin Diggs,
and it makes me think how many guys have stepped forward to help our program
in a time when people were talking about us being an NIT team or whatever.
Whatever. And I don't fault people for that. I completely understand what
happened to us, losing four guys for nearly the season in about a space of a
couple of weeks is really unheard of.  
But everybody hears about the certain guys, and Sam getting better and better,
and Levance coming back. Taking a couple of weeks to get back into his groove.
But we had guys like Maurice Polen out there practicing every day, Tim Frye,
we picked up a guy, Ryan Tisi who made our practices better and joined our
team in January, so we were able to practice. We don't get to this point
without those guys. Cassin Diggs even gave us some practice, even though he
probably needs surgery. We have a number of guys that need surgery at the end
of the year, and they were able to give these guys what they needed in
practice. Sam, Levance, Ronald and the rest.  
So I guess I'm thinking more about those guys, a lot about those guys, because
I really appreciate it and we couldn't have done it without them.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your seniors. I think it's a hundred wins right
now for the senior class. The leadership your seniors provided.  
COACH DIXON: It's something that I hope it's a continuation of year to year.
Our seniors, every year we're talking about our seniors, how many wins they've
had, what they did. And every year it's -- I hope it's and I think it is
something that's being passed on, and it is taken as a source of pride to step
up as far as leaders, and to do the things right and to show our freshmen. We
had a young group, and our guys improved throughout the year, our freshmen
improved throughout the year. Ronald Ramon, Keith Benjamin and Mike Cook were
still there all through the end. Just continuing to lead and play their best
basketball for Ronald and Keith here at the end. So that's what it really
comes down to. That's really senior leadership.  
  
Q. A little while ago you talked about how the measure of an elite program
is a national title, and you haven't won one. Now that you've achieved here in
a championship game where you've sometimes faltered, is your team ready to
overachieve or achieve greater things in the next tournament?  
COACH DIXON: Well, I don't know of the sign of it. But what we've done over
the seven years, national championship teams haven't done what we've done over
seven years as far as the consistency and what we've done year after year. I'm
just saying what I mentioned was a national championship from 30 years ago, a
Villanova national championship, that's remembered forever. That's not
forgotten. So that carries a lot of weight down the road. But it doesn't take
away from what our team has done over the last seven years, and having, I
think, the second best record in the country, second highest RPI, best record
in the Big East, all of those things.  
But at the same time, that is our ultimate goal. And we don't have problems
discussing that. But it doesn't take away from what we've done.  
  
Q. What are you capable of this year?  
COACH DIXON: I've always felt that we're capable of beating anybody we play,
and I'm sure our players feel the same way. I know Sam feels that way, I would
say. So I think you should really talk to Sam. He's the guy that made all the
shots, made the plays. I just make sure that he's in the game there, that's
all I do.  
  
Q. You said yesterday when you asked about the four games in four days that
you guys would show up. Did you ever feel tonight that they even looked the
slightest bit tired?  
COACH DIXON: No, I didn't. And I think I was talking about four games in four
days, I mean, we've been through a lot more than that this year. We lost four
guys in two weeks for the year. So, you know, and other guys coming down with
injuries right after that, that would have been out for games, but played
because we were low on numbers. So I really didn't give -- I mean, if we had
only played three games, these guys would have gone. Sam would have found a
place to play a pick-up game today in the gym somewhere. They would have gone
somewhere anyways. So it's better that we're playing here in the Garden.  
  
Q. Sam, did you ever get a sense that you guys were tired at any point?  
SAM YOUNG: I think to be tired is a mental mindset. When you go to bed and
you're just about to get up and you say oh, I'm tired. But when you're out
here and you have a guy trying to take the ball from you, that's a challenge.
And you want to take on that challenge. I don't think tiredness or fatigue
come into play when you've got so much on the line, and so much emotion
involved.  
  
Q. You seem to have almost a sixth sense tonight about exactly when Hibbert
would release the ball. Can you just describe for us what you were seeing?  
SAM YOUNG: I noticed, not only in this game but in previous games, that he
likes to take the one-two jump hook. And I always said he'd get it to two, and
jump as high as I can. Hopefully I'd get it. Sometimes I did, sometimes I
didn't. I pretty much got it at the right times tonight, and that's how that
went.  
  
Q. You're the one team in the Big East that Georgetown wasn't able to beat
this year. What is it specifically about your team that presented challenges
that Georgetown couldn't figure out a way to solve?  
COACH DIXON: Well, I think today they caught us playing our best basketball,
that was part of it. You know, this team is a team that's better now than it
was earlier in the year, and we didn't play at their place. We got them at our
place, and we tend to beat people at a pretty good high rate at our place.  
If you're looking for a weakness in Georgetown's game, there isn't one.
They're very good. They're very experienced. They're very well-coached. And I
would dare to say that they're going to be a very high seed and do very well
in the NCAA Tournament. So I don't think it says anything about Georgetown.
They are one of the best programs, one of the best teams in the country.  
  
Q. You seemed surprisingly calm even relaxed as the game was ending. You
just kind of strolled up to the court after everyone else went nuts. What was
going through your mind?  
SAM YOUNG: I think in moments like that, I probably take quite a while for
things to register because it's just so much of a big goal. A big tribute.
Once you get there, you think did this really happen? I can't believe such
good things have happened in a short period of time.  
Sometimes you sit back and think, and you never would think -- I mean, things
are such, I guess, a prestigious tournament like this that we'd come out, I
mean, come out and do the thing that's we did this whole weekend.  
  
Q. How does this change your outlook and expectations for the NCAA
Tournament now that you've won this tournament?  
SAM YOUNG: It kind of do, and it kind of don't. My expectations are still the
same. It definitely gives us a confidence booster going in. It definitely
gives us a lot of motivation going in. And I felt like right now with us
playing, like Coach said, our best basketball, I feel like a lot of guys know
what role they need to take on for us to be a great team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about doing this for the seniors.  
SAM YOUNG: What can I say? I'm happy that we were able to do this today. I've
been through this, this is my third year at the Garden, and I'm finally able
to win one. Ronald, they've been here four years, and the last three years
they couldn't win it. So I was really feeling it for them for that, because I
think they lost to Georgetown, I think, twice. And they lost to Syracuse once.  
But to come out and to do such a thing for them, and to let them go out with a
bang like that, I mean, it shows a lot for the team. It shows a lot. And I'm
just glad I can send them more with memories like this.  
  
Q. Growing up in the D.C. area, were you a Georgetown fan or a Maryland
fan?  
SAM YOUNG: To be honest, I didn't even watch basketball (laughing).  
  
Q. At the end of the game at one end the guys were going crazy, and you had
to go to the other end to do a TV interview and you were drinking your water.
Can you describe what you're feeling there as you're watching your guys?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I guess you coach a long time, you've got a lot of ups and
downs and different things that happen. But to be able to sit there for me and
watch our team, and watch the players celebrate with their families, I can't
think of a more gratifying moment. I could have sat there all day and just
watched them. That, to me, was fun and rewarding. To see Sam with his mom, who
has meant so much to him and inspired him with her work ethic, you know,
seeing them together, that was fun. I remember seeing that vision when I was
sitting on the side. That was special. I remember Keith Benjamin, seeing him
with his mom there, too. I guess that was probably the best thing I've had
happen to me this year.  
  
Q. Was this moment much better for you than winning the state championship
in high school?  
SAM YOUNG: Definitely. Definitely. It just means so much more. You're on a
higher level, a greater level not to say college is a high level, but you're
playing in the Big East. That is the best conference in college basketball. To
be in the Big East, and to be a Big East champion says a lot. I just feel like
a won a million dollars. I can't say how proud I am of myself and my team.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Roy Hibbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13731)

### [Jessie Sapp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17172)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. On a scale of 1 to 10, how charged up were you to play tonight and why?  
ROY HIBBERT: I just came to the game to try to establish myself down low, not
just try to score but try to just set the tone and get deep positions. Try to
pick up on things that I did before in the year.  
  
Q. Talk about Hibbert and talk about the different looks you gave to
Alexander today.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yeah, I think that Joe Alexander is terrific, and he's
playing at such a high level right now. You know, you just look at the points
he's putting on the board the last four or five games I think it is. He's put
so much pressure on everyone that goes against them. Then they have shooters
and other guys that can make plays around him. So it's not like you can really
help too much. I just think that between Patrick (Ewing) and DaJuan (Summers),
and for stretches also Jeremiah (Rivers), you know, they play him differently.
So it's like a different look, a different feel.  
But I just thought they worked their behinds off. It was one of those games
where we wanted, like I say, we didn't want to double, we didn't want to run
guys at him. It was just, hey, guard him. And we're fortunate that he missed
some shots that he had been making the last two weeks. But I think our guys'
effort, particularly DaJuan and Patrick did a very good job of just making
things a little more difficult for him. And we were fortunate that it worked
out.  
  
Q. On back-to-back days you have convincing wins with two different styles.
Roy didn't play as well yesterday as he did today. How refreshing is that for
you at this time of the year to win convincingly on two separate days?  
COACH THOMPSON III: This time of year you want to win. You want to win,
convincingly, not convincingly. I've said all along, and you guys that have
been following us, we can play and have success different ways. Yes, we'd like
to, and the big fella is the hub, he's the focal point. We don't want and will
not have more days like yesterday, but if there is a situation that because of
foul trouble he's taken out of the game or because of how the opposition is
doing he's not as successful, we don't need to always force feed. We have
other guys that can step up and make plays. We have an unselfish group that
make the extra pass and we give the ball to each other.  
So there was no sense following yesterday, there was no feeling of oh, what in
the world is going on? We had guys that were open. We had guys that had shots,
the ball went in the basket. Today he had a little more freedom down there; he
did what he does. Just as long as we keep playing unselfishly, you know, we
have options.  
  
Q. Was the start of the second half played at a faster pace than you would
have liked?  
COACH THOMPSON III: No, start of the second half -- I don't care about the
pace. They scored too much. The start of the second half they came out, I
don't know what it was, but I feel like they made four threes in a row. The
pace, I don't care about the pace. We got to get stops, and we didn't get
stops at the start of the second half. Then once we started to get stops,
everything was fine.  
  
Q. They got it down to four points and you went out there and you posted up
the guard, which I don't know if you do that very often, was that a set
play?  
JESSIE SAPP: No, it was not a set play, but I felt I had the advantage over
them. You know, John (Wallace), or I think it was Austin (Freeman) looked down
gave me the ball. Sometimes I work out, play around with the big fellas and do
post schools and stuff with them. So today was a chance to, how do you say,
sport that talent. So I got an and-one, and it was relaxing.  
COACH THOMPSON III: I have to say jokingly that Jessie Sapp is our best post
player prior to today. The part he hadn't figured out yet is, which the big
fella has figured out, is you don't have to shoot it every time to get it down
there.  
  
Q. After yesterday do you even have to talk to Roy Hibbert or your players
about what went wrong and what didn't happen to get him the ball, they just
know?  
COACH THOMPSON III: No. I mean, as I said, Villanova, their game plan that
they executed very well was to sit three people around him, and say we're
going to make you make a shot. That was somebody's question over here. There
was no need for a big pow-wow, we just do what we do. We take what the defense
gives us.  
As I said following yesterday's game, we don't want and we're not going to
have games where Roy doesn't score. But at the same time we didn't have to go
back to the drawing board and reinvent the wheel. We did what we do, they
played it differently tonight and it was over.  
  
Q. Your dad used some language that I can't publish. So I need to come to
you with this: Some people have said this team has been more lucky than good
this year. You're on the verge of possibly back-to-back regular season and
tournament titles. Does it irk you when you hear that?  
COACH THOMPSON III: This group, we just want to win games. I learned at a very
young age when my pops was sitting in the chair that I now sit in, that people
aren't always going to say good things about you. They aren't always going to
say what is right. They aren't always going to say positive things about you.
A lot of times it's more negative than positive. So you learn at a young age
just do what you do.  
We know what we want to do. Just keep winning games. If you want to call us
lucky, we'll be lucky.  
  
Q. After Chris picked up the technical foul, you went on a 28-1 run to end
the game, can you talk about that stretch.  
COACH THOMPSON III: I don't think Chris' tech had anything to do with that. I
didn't see that play, I don't know why the tech was called, but this group has
a knack for ending games. So the run, if that's what it was, that's coming
down to the latter part of the game. We execute. We got stops. We got stops
and the fellas got rebounds. Then as the game progresses, and that's a
terrific team over there, well-coached, everyone knows they're not going to
quit. They're going to keep playing hard. They have so many different weapons.
We were fortunate that their guys missed shots that they normally make which
allowed us -- and they had to take threes. They had to take shots. We were
fortunate they didn't go in, we got the rebound, and we were slowly able to
pull away.  
  
Q. Your coach says that there was no need for a pow-wow last night, y'all
take what you get. But do you sense that Roy was pissed off yesterday? Did you
fully expect a game like today?  
JESSIE SAPP: I didn't expect this big of a game. He did very well today. I
knew he was going to come out hungry. So we wanted to feed him. We wanted to
keep feeding him and feeding him.  
It wasn't just his scoring. It was his rebounds and his energy. We fed off him
today. And we need him in a game like that for us to win and be successful
throughout the rest of the season.  
  
Q. After your last basket, you kind of shouted, I don't know if it was to
the crowd or to yourself, do you remember what was going through your head
then?  
ROY HIBBERT: No, I was just saying, "I'm a monster right now. "  
COACH THOMPSON III: I know.  
ROY HIBBERT: "I'm a monster, be afraid."  
(Smiling) I don't really show a lot of emotion, but it's just the way our team
was just working, and the way I was getting the stops. I said, you know what,
you know, just got to keep cranking those buckets out and I'm happy we got the
win.  
  
Q. Is it after the national anthem was played just before the end, Patrick
was next to you and kind of rapped you in the chest a couple of times. Did he
tell you that you're a monster?  
ROY HIBBERT: No, it's just a thing we've been doing.  
COACH THOMPSON III: I was going to say, it's two or three years now.  
ROY HIBBERT: We always have a bet to see who can get more rebounds than who,
and who can get more blocked shots. And I usually, I beat him sometimes. I'm
happy. That's something we do to challenge ourselves to go out there and just
play hard. That's gets us going.  
  
Q. The guys next to you had 20 rebounds between them, and West Virginia only
had 22, can you talk about the energy they brought to the game.  
COACH THOMPSON III: I think from the beginning our focus and our energy at the
defensive end kind of set the tone, and so just as a group. I didn't realize
these two did that, and that's good. They need to do that more often. Y'all
hear that (smiling). But just as a group, I think we set the tone with our
defense.  
Like I said, we were fortunate our guys -- I mean, this is March in New York.
This is the Big East Tournament. So the enthusiasm was there, the energy was
there, the focus was there. And we're fortunate to get some lucky bounces
along the way.  
  
Q. You heard what I asked Coach, we were talking about that yesterday in
front of the locker room. Why do you think people don't mention Georgetown in
the same paragraph this year with, let's say, North Carolina, UCLA or other
teams that seem to be destined for the Final Four?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Can I answer that?  
  
Q. Yeah, but you're going to ruin what he's going to say because he's going
to echo what you say.  
JESSIE SAPP: No, I'm not.  
COACH THOMPSON III: No, no. It's you and your peers that are or not saying it.
So you should be able to answer that, not him.  
  
Q. Nobody cares what I say, trust me.  
JESSIE SAPP: You heard what Coach said (laughing).  
No, I'm just playing. No, but I told somebody else, it's just people don't
really understand our offense and the things that we do as far as the little
things. We're not looking for everybody to be -- one person or two people to
just score 25 points a night or this and that. It takes a lot to win a lot of
close games. Much of the games we've been winning were close, but at the end
of the day, we still got the W. So it takes a lot for you to consistently do
that. We don't really pay attention to what this person said, what this person
said. We just look in our locker room within our team. As long as we all
believe, we're fine with that.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH DIXON: Obviously, great win for us against a very good team. We have
tremendous respect for the Marquette program. Their kids and how hard they
play. I thought we really jumped off to a great start offensively. Executed
very well, as we knew Marquette would keep battling. Very surprised that we
could come away with a win with them getting 21 offensive boards, 47 rebounds.
But we took care of the ball, took good shots. I thought our offense was good
for the most part. We had some guys made plays, Ronald, Sam, great drives when
we needed them as they stepped up the defense. It was a great win for us
against again a very, very good program, and proud of our guys, once again.
Thank you.  
  
Q. It's truly remarkable that you got into the Big East championship seven
of the last eight years, what is it that your team plays the best when it's
tournament time in the Big East?  
COACH DIXON: Probably have to ask the players that as well. But I think we
have a good focus. We understand what it's about. We do, it's a cliche, but we
do take it one game at a time. We don't talk about it as a tournament, we talk
about it as the next game that we've got, and that's how we really look at it.  
We love playing in New York. We have New York guys. We'll do anything we can
to play in the Garden. We'll change schedules around. We'll change events
around. We want to get our kids back here. We've told Joel Fisher, that runs
the events here, that we'll play in any of the events that they have. We do
enjoy playing here. They take very good care of us. I guess that helps, too.  
But you're beating good people. I know the record is pretty -- I guess I've
had people coming up to us, and there's a lot of talk about the record. I
don't know what it is. I know we've beaten very good people playing here, non-
conference and conference. But again, you've got to have good players and kids
that want to compete and play at the best place to play in the world, really.
I grew up hearing about it from my dad. And these guys heard about it growing
up themselves. So I guess that has something to do with it.  
  
Q. Over the past seven years in that streak you've only been to the
tournament, having played all four days, twice. Is it more difficult to get
there on the fourth day and how are the challenges going to be tomorrow
playing after that?  
COACH DIXON: I think it's probably more difficult to win more games. But we'll
be ready to play. We'll be after it. We'll be there. We'll show up. We're
going to be ready. I know our guys are anxious to play. They're looking
forward to the opportunity. Nobody was tired out there at all, so. We'll be
ready.  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Levance Fields.  
  
Q. The crowd was strongly favoring your team. Can you talk about any
psychological benefit that may have had on your play?  
SAM YOUNG: Repeat that again.  
  
Q. The crowd was strongly favoring your team. Can you talk about any
psychological benefit that may have had on your play?  
SAM YOUNG: I'm not sure of the question.  
  
Q. How did the crowd affect you guys as a team?  
SAM YOUNG: Oh, oh. A lot of guys' families out there. Of course we've got so
many New York guys, a lot of their families grew up here and a lot of their
families are able to come to the game. So of course we'll have more people.
And me being from the D.C. area, it's not too far from here. When you're
looking in the crowd and you see your family, you see your fans and your
friends, that gives you a lot of motivation and a lot of energy to take the
extra step and initiative to do whatever is needed to win the game.  
  
Q. When you first played here at Madison Square Garden when you were young
and you were a kid, what do you remember about it?  
RONALD RAMON: You know, it's one of the greatest places to play at, especially
growing up in New York City. You always want to play at the Garden. You always
watch the Knicks play, and you always want to come down when Jordan used to
play here and watch him play. You look at it, and you want to be in that
situation. You want to go out there and play. Now that it's presented to us,
you want to go out there and compete and do the best to play in front of your
family and friends.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: It's like Ron said, it's very exciting growing up here. We
look forward to this. Our friends and families. We get a lot of tickets for
people to come. It's exciting. Something about the Garden. Special things
happen. So every chance we get to play here, we're excited about it. This is
our second home, as Coach always says during the shooting rounds. We're used
to the fans cheering for us and a lot of people coming out.  
  
Q. It seems like you do kind of own the event, but is it specifically just
about this city and who comes to the games and the building, or does it have
something to do with the event also?  
RONALD RAMON: I think it has to do with the team. As a team we get focused. We
take every step of the season differently. We separate it. We call it the four
seasons. The first season is the non-conference games. Then we go to the
regular Big East games, then you get to the Big East Tournament, and then the
NCAA Tournament. So we take it one step at a time.  
This is one of the events that we try to get focused for, and come out and
play the best basketball we can play.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: It's just, like I said before, it's a special place to play.
Lot of guys that's not from here or freshmen on the team they get pumped up
even more. It's their first go-around, and me being in my third year, and
Ronald in his fourth, like I said, we just love playing here. We take
advantage of it. We play hard, we battle and we're used to being in this
situation. The biggest thing is once we get on that bus, we've got to get
ready for Georgetown. Because since I've been here, and three years with Ron
and Sam, we've been in this situation. So it's time to cash in and get this
championship.  
  
Q. You were quick to point out yesterday that you guys hadn't quite finished
the job here in the last couple of years, and during your time you're 1-5 in
the six title games. Can you talk about what it would mean to you to win
tomorrow?  
RONALD RAMON: It would mean a lot, especially being a senior. How every single
player on the team is talking about us doing it for the seniors. "Let's go out
there and play the best basketball."  
Nobody's celebrating. We're just trying to get focused and prepare for the
next game. We're glad that we're back in the championship game, but it's time,
like Levance said, to go out there and play the best basketball on the last
day of the tournament.  
  
Q. Two things about Levance: The first game against Marquette was his first
game back. Was it a night-and-day difference tonight offensively? And
secondly, how comfortable were you with him at the foul line when you were
struggling at the foul line?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, obviously, it was night and day. It was something that we
anticipated. A lot of people thought it was going to be easy to come back and
be ready to go right away. Even probably Levance thought it would be easier
than it was. We talked about it, but still I don't think you're ever prepared
for it. Usually guys are out for the season when they're out that long. It's
really gone as we anticipated. It's going to take some time, and we knew it
would take three, four games for him to get his feet under him.  
So it's really, you know, we talked all along about focusing on the last four
games. I thought it would take us two weeks for him to get into it, us getting
used to him, and then him just getting his legs and getting through it and
getting knocked down a few times. Then finding out that his foot was all
right, the conditioning, and all of the things that came with it. So there may
have been some rush to judgment by others, but not by myself.  
So I think I just kept encouraging him. I think there were some frustrations
at times with Levance, tried to prepare him for it, but I think that's to be
expected. But he got through it, and our guys had confidence in him. We're
where we wanted to be at this point right now.  
  
Q. Were you comfortable with him shooting those free throws at the end?  
COACH DIXON: I mean, he's made them all his career. I thought I looked relaxed
over there, maybe I didn't. But I feel very comfortable with all three of our
guys up here knocking down free throws at the end. We're very good at making
shots the end of games. We have very good character and toughness. We play
late-game situations in practice. But these guys, you're talking about guys
that won state championships and city championships, and prep school
championships. You know, they didn't win just because they came here; they've
won all their lives.  
  
Q. I know that you and Jessie are pretty good friends, did you call or text
each other before the tournament and did you reach out to him tonight? What
will it be like playing against him tomorrow?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Well, you know, we always talk. Actually I seen him at
halftime going into the locker rooms. He gave me five and said, "I'll see you
tomorrow." So we're real close friends.  
Obviously it's going to be fun to play against him again. Played against them
last year, but they came out to win this. Like I said, it's very exciting, but
I know not only in my mind, but the three people to my right up here, and the
rest of the team that are here, we want to finish it up. We're happy about
being here. We know this is a special spot to be in, but like I said, we're
used to being here, but we want to finish it out, that's the most important
thing right now.  
  
Q. How important was it to get Jerel McNeal in foul trouble early?  
COACH DIXON: It was a key. Obviously, he's a great player. We had some guys in
foul trouble, DeJuan was in foul trouble. It's just part of the game. But I
liked the way that we got him. We took some charges and that was something we
emphasized going into this game, and that was big. We thought he's a driver,
he's a guy that gets to the basket. We've got to get our body in front of him,
and we've got to be there. That's how we got a couple of them. So that was a
big part of it, I think. So we earned it. We had to earn it.  
It's something we talked about doing as a team. So it's something we've gotten
better at, too, down the stretch here as we've gotten better as a team
defensively.  
  
Q. We've heard the two New York guys talk about how they feel about the
Garden and everything, but from your vantage point when you see these New York
guys and they're coming up on a game at the Garden, can you describe the way
they begin to act differently or what you see in them?  
SAM YOUNG: To be honest, if I wasn't part of this team I probably wouldn't
think of the Garden and respect the Garden as much as I do. They let me know
just from their actions and the emotions that this is the most famous arena.
Every time we come here, they show that emotion. When I see that, I have no
choice but to get excited and to be a part of what they already know, the
knowledge that they have about the Garden.  
  
Q. You missed the regular season game against Georgetown. Obviously, you've
played them so many times, what's it going to take to knock them off this
time?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Actually we were able to handle them pretty well without me.
So I'm just hoping we'll be able to do the same thing tomorrow. They're a
tough team. They have a 7-footer in the middle, and a lot of perimeter
shooting. They do a great job in the offensive executing. We've just got to
come out and do more than them. We've got to do it on defense, as Coach said
tonight. The biggest thing was getting McNeal in the foul, but it's the way we
did it, taking charge and being physical. They shot 31%, and that's knowing
how Pitt plays defense. A couple games in my first game back we just weren't
getting after defense. So hopefully that continues tomorrow. We've been doing
well in this tournament, and like I said, we just want to close it out.  
  
Q. You talked about the guys winning state championships and champions
before they got to Pitt, is that something you specifically target in your
recruiting, guys that have won that help you create the culture?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, of course. I think watching Ronald's AAU program, his high
school program, I remember watching in his AAU program he didn't lose a game
all summer long. Watching him down in the Peach Jam and different places.
Levance won a state championship or city championship. Sam went undefeated in
his high school senior year and his prep school year. So I've just messed
these guys up a little bit since they got here.  
But otherwise, yeah. You want guys from winning programs that have been
coached. They've all been coached. They've all been around the game and it's
important to them. So it's important to us. I want it to be just as important
to them.  
  
Q. When you guys were able to stop Dominic James for most of that game,
everybody knows what a great player he is, what did it take? And when you had
his confidence rattled for most of the game what were your thoughts on the
court?  
RONALD RAMON: Like I said, from the beginning of the game we try to come out
and be aggressive. Try to stop the ball screen, try to make him just make
plays. Kick out some of the drives that he was having. But we were doing a
great job as a team. Guys were staying with the shooters. We were able to get
a lot of open shots and we did a great job staying with our hands up and not
getting fouls. You know, after him getting in foul trouble a little bit and
not being able to create for his team he got a little frustrated and we took a
little advantage of that.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: For the most part, like I say, he's a great player. He's very
quick. We just kept a hand in his face. Don't give him the drive and make him
shoot contested shots. We did that. Did a pretty good job of that. And he was
off, and like Ronald said, he got into a little foul trouble and got
frustrated. We kept getting after it. So it was a great job by all the guards,
because at different times all of us could be guarding him or McNeal,
Matthews. We all just helped. And the big guys did a great job of rebounding.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Wesley Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16971)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH CREAN: Well, again, I thought both teams played with tremendous heart
and character. They got off to a great start; we didn't. But we came back in
the second half, showed tremendous character and fight. And had opportunities
down the stretch, and it became one of those possession-by-possession games in
the end, which we felt it could even at halftime.  
We were not shooting the ball very well in the first half. We weren't as
physical as we needed to be in the first half. But yet we were still in
position to come back. So we never felt like we weren't going to be able to
come back. And we just have to keep understanding what it takes to play in the
first half the way we did in the second, and at the same time we know that a
very good basketball team in Pittsburgh beat us tonight, a team that's
improving. I think they're a microcosm of this entire conference. Even though
we've all had an opportunity to play each other and beat up on each other,
there are a lot of teams still in the Big East that are getting better. I feel
like we're one of them, and I certainly think that Pittsburgh is one of them,
so that's all I've got.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult it was with McNeal on the bench and
being in foul trouble.  
COACH CREAN: It's very hard. There were a lot of flow issues tonight. And when
you don't have as good a player as there is at the wing spot in this league on
the court, and he's off the court for extended periods of time, that's hard.  
  
Q. Coach, for a long time you're shooting bad. And things weren't going your
way. What does it say for your team that you were in this game in the second
half?  
COACH CREAN: We felt like we were going to be in it in the second half. We
were a little surprised that they had chose to play as fast as they did in the
first half, and we felt that was in our favor. And it ended up being in our
favor as the game went on. We never felt like we weren't going to be able to
come back in the second half. But we really didn't make enough shots to get us
over the hump. We had eight field goals, I believe, in the first half. Only
one of our starters had scored in the first half. It was not a great offensive
performance. Some of it was us, certainly some of it was them. But we felt
like we were going to come back. There was not any disappointment or
discouraging remarks or feelings in the locker room. We felt we were going to
come back, and we did.  
Again, we have great heart, great character, great toughness, but so does
Pitt. We just put ourselves in a little too much of a hole in the first half
to really make the dent we needed to make.  
  
Q. What did you see that earned that technical foul, and how much do you
think it energized your team for the last ten minutes?  
COACH CREAN: What was the first part of your question?  
  
Q. The technical foul?  
COACH CREAN: What about it?  
  
Q. What were you seeing at that point and how much did it turn around the
game?  
COACH CREAN: I didn't like the flow of the game on a lot of fronts, but I'm
just coaching my team. And I thought our team played with great heart
throughout the game, and they certainly continued to do that after that
situation.  
  
Q. Were you tempted to take Jerel out after that second foul? Did you give
it any serious thought?  
COACH CREAN: Yeah, but at that point the momentum was so far away from us,
that if you take off a player that can do what he does offensively and
defensively, there was no way we want to go into halftime down 20. And he's
playing too well, and he's smart, he's smart. He's going to play through the
risk a little bit. We have to understand that.  
I gave it little thought. Certainly if we could have even nipped it a little
closer, we would have gotten him out a little more, but there was not much we
could do about that. We need to win the game and we have to have him on the
floor.  
  
Q. How much of a toll did playing three games in three days, how much did
that effect you?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I can't really say. I mean, we're a conditioned team, we're
well-conditioned. That's what we do. We run, we get into you. And they're just
as tired as we are, and we know that. All that goes out the window once the
ball gets tossed up. The adrenaline is going, and you're with your team and
you're playing to win. You don't even feel that. We just weren't -- I don't
think condition was a factor at all. We just didn't do what we needed to do
long enough.  
  
Q. For clarification sake, what was said to Jerel when he pointed?  
COACH CREAN: That was Tim Higgins. You'd have to ask him, seriously. I'm not
going to comment on that. I'm not going there. I'm not going to be -- I'm not
playing things out that way. You'd have to ask him. I'm not trying to be
smart. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Dominic missed his first 12 or so shots, and then in the last eight
minutes started scoring more. What was the difference there?  
COACH CREAN: He attacked better. He attacked better. No question about that.
That's where he's at his strongest. He needs to keep understanding that. Once
he finally figures that out once and for all, he's going to be by far one of
the most elite guards in America. When he settles, when he just dribbles
rather than drives, he's guardable. When he attacks, it's very hard to guard
him. And it creates a lot of things for our team. He did some outstanding
things with that in the second half.  
  
Q. For the players, spending most of the year in the top 25, and you guys
had a great run throughout the year. I know it's hard to think about the NCAA
Tournament right now, but the way the character and the heart you guys showed
at the end of this game, do you think that's going to help you the first
weekend of the tournament?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think so. I mean, we try not to think of moral victories
and stuff like that. We worry about the victory, the win and all that kind of
stuff. But like after we lost at Notre Dame, we were able to rally around each
other or gather together and realize if we play the right way, we can do a lot
of things. We can be a very scary team.  
Like Coach said, we were down 13, there was no thought of us losing the game
coming in after halftime. We were able to fight back. We were able to come
back through the missed shots and all that kind of stuff. So I think once we
figure out how to play with that edge the whole time, I mean, sky's the limit.  
  
Q. What was your plan to defend Sam Young tonight?  
COACH CREAN: Well, he's so good. He just rises up. We have to put our best
defenders on their best players, and we felt like we did that. The mistakes,
we made some big mistakes early on a couple of their sets. There's no excuse
for that. We know their team, they know us. You know, there were a couple of
times we weren't as alert as we needed to be in the first half. So that put us
on an island a little bit.  
But we have a game plan for him. For the most part we followed it. But he
earned his baskets. He played outstanding. He's a great player. Obviously,
there are a lot of things when a guy gets that many points you'd like to do
over again. But we try to do our best in a one-on-one situation, but it's very
hard to guard him one-on-one.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say Coach is talking about the character you guys showed
especially in the second half coming back, but is it fair to say that
toughness is what the Marquette program is really all about?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Yeah, you could say that. That's what we hang our hat on. Our
toughness, our tenacity, defense, rebounding, all that in-your-face, just
playing hard. That's what we do. We pride ourselves on how hard we play, and
we bring the most out of each other. That's what Coach preaches and that's
what we try to do. Unfortunately, we only got to show that in the second half.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Joe Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18103)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. You played that 2-3 zone against UCONN so well. I know Roy Hibbert isn't
necessarily the same player that Hasheem Thabeet is, especially on offense,
but why didn't you guys go to that at all today?  
COACH HUGGINS: We did.  
  
Q. Why not so often? Why not the whole game?  
COACH HUGGINS: Because they made three threes in a row. They made three threes
in a row, and we had to get out of it. And at our place we guarded them man
and held them to 50-some points. So I think the whole staff, and the players
wanted to play man.  
  
Q. After Hibbert was held to nothing yesterday, were you expecting a game
like this out of him?  
COACH HUGGINS: He's a really good player. I don't know really what I was
expecting. I was expecting us to guard him a little better than what he we
did, but he had a heck of a game. He played very well. He played aggressively.  
  
Q. With the UCONN win yesterday, do you think with all the momentum behind
that win, do you think that affected your guys? Did you see any fatigue on the
part of certain players?  
COACH HUGGINS: We practice three hours a day every day. Every day. We never go
less than three hours. We shouldn't be fatigued. I don't think we were
fatigued. We didn't necessarily get bagged, but I don't think it was fatigue.
We didn't get back early in the game. If you're that fatigued early in the
game, we probably should have just called it off, and say we're just too tired
to play.  
We did a better job in transition later when we should have been tired than
what we did early.  
  
Q. Joe, Coach Thompson just said that you simply were not making shots that
you had made earlier. Is that what you felt? It was an off-night or were they
doing something to mess with you?  
JOE ALEXANDER: It was definitely both. I wasn't making shots that I've
normally been making lately. But it was due to stuff they were doing
differently. They were having guys from the weak side coming and helping me
when I was driving, sometimes doubling in the post. So they did a good job.  
  
Q. You were outrebounded 40-22, any reason you can put your finger on why?
Lack of effort, or just they're that good?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, first of all, they're pretty good. They were 15-3 in this
league, and this is the best league in this country. They're pretty good.
That's the biggest reason is because they're pretty good. You know, it's hard
for us to match up with a guy like Hibbert. What did he have, 13 of them? It's
hard for us.  
And then we kind of -- they forced us to, I think, probably help too much on
him, and then it opened things up and then they beat us in transition.  
They're good. I mean, it was a whole lot more them than it was us. I mean,
they're just good.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Joe Alexander's development this season, and the
progress that he's been making, and why he's making progress.  
COACH HUGGINS: He's made the progress because he wants to. I've never had a
great player that didn't want to be great. Joe puts the time in. Joe works at
it. You know, Joe's listened to what we've asked him to do. You know, we were
just walking down the hall. We were talking about one of the guys that I had
before and kind of how he is, and how he works. And this guy's going to be
successful because he'll put the time in, he'll work at it, and he'll listen.
He'll do what he's asked to do.  
  
Q. After when you guys got it down to four after Ruoff's technical free
throws, the drought kind of came. During that time period, how many different
things did you try, different combination, rotations? Was there a lot of
things that you tried?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think during that time I think it was either Alex or Darris
(Nichols) asked out. They were tired. And we subbed. If I remember correctly,
when it was four they threw it in the post against Mazzulla, and Joe tried to
take a charge, and it ended up being a three-point play which took it back to
7, and we had a miss and they came back to hit another three, and all of a
sudden it's 10 again. That's what good teams do.  
  
Q. After Smalligan's foul trouble you had to try to guard Hibbert. How hard
is it to give away six inches like that to guard a player that big?  
JOE ALEXANDER: It's just not something that you're used to, I think. After
playing them once or twice you could probably do a better job on him. But it's
just so different than anything I'd had to do before.  
  
Q. Bob, how much did you hate that match-up?  
COACH HUGGINS: They just got us more spread than what they got us before. You
know, when you let him catch it, and bounce it a couple of times into the
lane, he's going to throw that hook. We just couldn't get help to him. Didn't
or couldn't. We let him catch it too deep. We didn't let him catch it that
deep. And Jamie got in foul trouble early. I thought Jamie did a pretty good
job early and then got in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Despite the loss tonight, your team has obviously played pretty well
during the stretch. Does that give you a lot of hope for the tournament?  
COACH HUGGINS: We're going to be fine. We're very young. That's what I think
people don't realize. We've got two seniors and two juniors and the rest of
our guys are sophomores, red shirt freshmen or freshmen. And we have
intensity, I think, and I think young guys do. You maybe get satisfied
sometimes when you really don't deserve to be satisfied. And we just don't,
you know, we can't go very deep on the bench.  
We'll have a day between, a day between to one prepare. We'll win our first
round game, and that day between to kind of regroup and keep guys a little
fresher than probably what they were. He played 40 minutes and 39 minutes in
two games prior. Darris played about the same. It's probably easier for Joe to
play, turn around and play 40 again and it is Darris, just because of his body
type.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Jessie Sapp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17172)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Jonathan Wallace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17169)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the two guys on either side of you. At
different times they almost took over the game.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Yeah, they did. And, you know, you play that game, and to
say Roy had a tough time getting into rhythm would be an understatement. You
know, the nature of our team is when any particular guy is struggling, not
doing well, we have other people that can step up, and our team is confident
in everyone. John got us going, kept us going in the first half, and Jessie
made some plays in the second half.  
You know, we're fortunate; that's a very good team. That's a team we know. We
made a little run to start the game. I forget what the score was, 10-12, two
or three, and you know they're going to come. They made that run in the second
half, and we were fortunate to hold on. But we stuck together as we do. That's
what we do.  
So these two were terrific today.  
  
Q. What are the positives and negatives of Roy Hibbert in a big game like
this not being able to score?  
COACH THOMPSON III: The positive is that we won. That might be the only thing
positive coming out of it. We're good enough particularly when everyone else
steps up to win, but that can't happen. He has to get the ball, he has to
score. Between the foul trouble made him tentative in the way they play, the
way they root him out made him tentative. But that's something that can't
happen, won't happen again.  
  
Q. How surprised were you with the fluidity of the plays running so smoothly
in the second half and the open shots? Were you really surprised how that
worked?  
COACH THOMPSON III: You said with the fluidity?  
  
Q. The fluidity of the plays?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Walking down the hall someone told me, how many assists on
how many baskets? 25 on 28. You know, the guys did a very good job of making
the extra pass. In many ways they do such a good job. They do such a focal
point. They place such an emphasis on taking away post play that everything
else opens up. So we were fortunate the shots went in tonight.  
  
Q. It's a question for Jessie: You're from the city. You seem to have big
games when you come and play here. Can you describe whether that's just a
coincidence or whether there is a feeling that you get about playing here
because you're from here?  
JESSIE SAPP: It's just a coincidence. I come out every night, whether it's
here or any other place we play. I give it my all. It just so happened that
tonight and the other nights that I played here has been one of my biggest
games.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your first half play, and did the basket look
huge for you?  
JONATHAN WALLACE: Just my emphasis coming out Coach told me make sure I was
aggressive. That didn't necessarily always mean by scoring. We just try to be
aggressive and get good looks at the basket. And my teammates, we were keeping
the offense moving really well. I was just getting open looks and stepping up
and making them.  
  
Q. Coach, when you pretty much give them your best punch and you have an
11-point lead at the half, and they come out and start the second half on an
18-3 run, do you say anything to the guys to help them keep things together
and get refocused?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I don't think it was our best punch, because our best
punch involved the big fella. But that being said, we've been there before,
and that's a good team. That's an NCAA Tournament team. That's a team that's
played a lot of ball, played a lot of teams and won a lot together. Teams in
this league are going to make runs. Teams in this league are too well-coached,
too talented, too poised to think that you're just going to run away from
somebody.  
So they made a run. We started the second half. Roy missed the lay-up right
there. DaJuan stepped out of bounds. We took a couple of quick shots. Then
they come down and score. We missed the shot, and then all of a sudden they
get a transition basket. So it happens. It happens. They're too good not to
expect that to happen.  
As always, we just said let's stay focused. Let's stay together, and we were
able to slowly, methodically pull away as we do.  
  
Q. Is Jessie kind of like a really good insurance agent, he always seems to
know what you need and he'll bring it?  
COACH THOMPSON III: (Smiling) No (laughing). Is Jessie like a good insurance
agent?  
To answer your question, Jessie plays well normally when he gets a chance to
give his mom a hug. So that's why he's played well when he comes here to the
city.  
But I said it before, Jessie makes plays. And so we have other guys in the
locker room. We could come out tomorrow and it would be a totally different
group of guys that are able to step up, and everyone in that locker room knows
that. We're fortunate to have him.  
  
Q. But what I mean by that is it can be points, it can be rebounds, it can
be steals, it can be defense.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Well, he knows that if he doesn't do all of that
consistently, he'll spend time sitting with Ms. Michaels on the bench. So he
has the ability to do all of that, and he's got a God-given ability. So we
expect him to do it, right?  
JESSIE SAPP: Right.  
  
Q. If I had told you that Stokes and Reynolds would have more turnovers than
field goals, made field goals today, would you be surprised?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Did they? Honestly, looking at this stat sheet from their
standpoint and from our standpoint, there is a whole lot that you say, if you
told me this would happen, if you told me that would happen, we wouldn't be
sitting here. So that's why you've got to play the game.  
Our guys were attentive to them. Our guys were attentive to them. They had a
tough run yesterday morning. But I think that our focus was very, very good at
the defensive end. We had some lapses, as Jessie indicated, at the start of
the second half. Then good teams get going, good players get going, and we
were able to make a few adjustments and pull away in the end.  
  
Q. Nova goes without a field goal for five minutes and change. Talk about
your defense with Hibbert on the bench.  
COACH THOMPSON III: We were fortunate. The previous question, I guess, in many
ways is the answer to that. Our guys were attentive. We were very attentive.
We helped each other. And so in many ways certain times they're small, they're
fast. So a lot of times at the defensive end when Roy's out we're not at a
disadvantage because we can get small and fast, also. I think that played out
a little bit today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contribution from Chris Wright in the first Big
East Tournament game.  
COACH THOMPSON III: Chris and Austin. It's good to see Chris running around
out there a little bit. Knock on wood, hopefully he can stay healthy. But it
gives us a little more depth. He's been a big injury to us this year. We've
missed him. We've had to adjust and tweak and change a lot of things based on
how I had anticipated playing during the course of the year.  
You know, they're freshmen. They're freshmen, and it's the end of the year. I
don't know, this is Chris's 11th, 12th, 13th game, I forget. He's missed most
of the year. And Austin, for the most part, has been steady. So they're going
to be pretty good one day.  
  
Q. Jessie, the time that you've been here, you've played like last year or
this year. Have you been overlooked on this squad?  
JESSIE SAPP: Not at all. I know those guys are great players. I just played my
position. It's a team thing with me. Whatever the team needs, I always
emphasize on that. It's not the fact of being overlooked. I just play my
position and just do whatever Coach tells me to do, and I know I'll get credit
for it in the long run.  
  
Q. You guys made so many threes today, how much of that was a by-product of
Roy's struggles or might you just have had an exceptionally hot shooting day
with or without him?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I think it's both, to tell you the truth. Like I said
earlier, they place such a premium and they're very physical in terms of the
person that's guarding Roy than they bring the weak side help all the way over
and sit right behind him. Most times he has three people around him when we're
playing them. With skip passes and good ball reversal, which our guys did, you
end up with open shots. Now, you still have to make them. I think they're
playing, let's give them shots. If they make them, they make them; if they
don't, that's what they try to create.  
But they put so many people around our post players that you have to make
shots. We told our guys be ready to shoot. "You're going to be open, put the
ball in the basket. Make shots. "  
  
Q. We've seen two noon blowouts so far. Your next opponent you've had two
close games with West Virginia and against UCONN. What do you expect tomorrow
night?  
COACH THOMPSON III: I want to wait and see who we play first, and then we can
talk. This is the Big East Tournament. So you're going to see whoever you
play, one of those two, they're going to be playing well. They're going to
have won two games, and we'll see. We'll see who we play. We'll get there and
start to prepare later.  
  
Q. You indicated you thought Villanova was a tournament team. Obviously,
there are probably other teams other leagues around the country that would
argue with you. That is the nature of this time of year. But what is it about
that team or your league that you see that indicates they should be warranted
that number of slots?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Well, as you go through, and I'm not on the committee.
They have a tough job, all right. You can sit and everyone has an opinion, and
I guess that's people's jobs, but if you're going to pick the best teams to be
in the tournament, they're one of them. If you're going to pick the best team
to get an at-large bid, they're one of them. And I know that just based on
going through this league. This league is brutal. All right, this league has
so many -- I've said it over and over again in the past two weeks or so, so
many talented players. So many good coaches. So many different styles of play.
We added extra games this year, so we beat each other up for a couple more
games this year. So you walk away from this league ready.  
Not having looked at the landscape, but knowing that if you're going to pick
the best teams to get an at-large bid, they're one of them.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [David Padgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17012)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH PITINO: As most Big East basketball games, it was hard fought. We just
went cold at the wrong time even with tip-ins and lay-ups toward the end. Our
guys did a good job of fighting back to get into overtime. Sometimes it's just
about making shots, it's a simple explanation. We just couldn't make shots.
But you've got to give Pitt credit, their defense had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Last couple of games your guards have been a little off shooting-wise, do
you see anything mechanically?  
COACH PITINO: I don't. I think they're open shots just not going in. I think
T-Will's shots were just bad shots. Runners in the lane and off balance. I
think the ones, two, and threes just collectively had a bad night. The fours
and fives played well. But sometimes you have a deep bench if can you get some
guys to come in, it's a little bit better. But just collectively everybody had
a bad night. That's, again, a tribute to Pittsburgh's defense.  
  
Q. Which things need to be addressed before the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I'll take a look at the film first. We've had a good year,
and we'll take a look at the film and make our improvements.  
  
Q. Last time you played Pitt they had only four turnovers against the press.
They had their point guard tonight with 17, can you explain what you did
differently?  
COACH PITINO: We relied on offense last game. We didn't play good defense at
Pitt. We just shot 57% for the game. We dominated the glass. Tonight they
dominated the glass early with a lot of offensive rebounds. We were playing
excellent defense, but we would have shot 25% if we would have blocked out
better in the first half. The second half was just a matter of us executing
better. They did a good job of stopping our interior, giving our perimeter
players a shot, and we just didn't knock it down.  
  
Q. David, it's nothing new, I guess. They came at you real hard with double
teams. But did they do anything differently defensively than maybe they did
last time?  
DAVID PADGETT: No, they were aggressive in their defensive game plan. You
know, they came after me pretty hard when I caught the ball. They were ready
to check the post and did a good job of being aggressive with their defense.  
  
Q. When you said they were aggressive with their defense, was that a
surprise to you, were you expecting that?  
DAVID PADGETT: No, we knew. We knew they were going to probably come after us
in the post. We've got to give them credit. They played very well on defense,
they were very aggressive in what they did.  
  
Q. Rick, you sat behind Pitt's bench last night, is that something that you
normally do?  
COACH PITINO: It's just where I had the seats. I would have been across the
court. They were my seats that I had for the tournament. I didn't know it was
Pitt's bench at all. Didn't gain anything by it. We know them very well.
Looking at Antigua's warm-up, his outfits, that's about it. That's the only
thing I gained by it. Orlando looked pretty sharp.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Derrick played tonight for you.  
COACH PITINO: They played well. Our front court played well. Then they started
taking away our front court, and we threw it out. And we had difficulty
scoring from that point on. Generally we don't, but collectively our wing
players and our point guards went cold. Hasn't happened to us this year, but
it can happen.  
  
Q. How much does it concern you entering the tournament with two straight
losses?  
COACH PITINO: Well, obviously you don't follow basketball very well. Because
if you think it's bad to lose to Georgetown at Georgetown, a hard-fought game
in Pittsburgh in overtime, you don't follow basketball very much. Because I
think they're two terrific basketball teams that played better than us down
the stretch. So if that's a concern for you, it's not a concern for me. You
worry about it, I won't. Go home and lose a lot of sleep over it. Promise?
Okay. (Smiling).  
  
Q. Which Big East team do you think over the last few weeks are playing the
best?  
COACH PITINO: I thought we were until tonight. I think Georgetown had a
brilliant shooting. There's an old cliche, "shooting cures a multitude of
sins." Teams always look much better when they shoot the ball well and you
make the outside shot. When you don't shoot well, you don't look as good,
obviously, no matter how well you played defensively.  
Georgetown looked great tonight. They shot the ball well. We didn't, we didn't
look as good. It's just part of the game. It's always been that way. So we've
got to regroup and make sure. We took good shots tonight, we just didn't make
them.  
So I think everybody's playing well in the Big East. I think it's a very
evenly balanced conference. I know we've had close games with the exception of
maybe a few this year. We've had very close games with just about everybody.
And it's a very tough conference, very closely -- I couldn't tell you who is
better. Villanova was playing terrific, they lose. Syracuse was coming back,
playing well. Notre Dame on a given night. I think it's just on a given night.  
But you've got to give Georgetown credit, because they won the championship
beating us, and now they're probably the best team right now. But you never
know. West Virginia's coming on. They were very aggressive today. We'll go
home and lick our wounds.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Dante Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18132)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH WRIGHT: I just wanted to start by congratulating Georgetown. They were
great today. It's a team you love to compete against. If you beat them, you
know you beat a great team. They win with class, and when they -- I should say
they win with humility. When they lose, they lose with class. They're a great
program. I love what John does with them, how they play. They just were great
today, they're great. We did not play a good basketball game, but you've got
to give them a lot of the credit for that. And we've got to go back and keep
getting better at the things we do.  
  
Q. You know with the gun-slinging mentality, you live by the three, you die
by the three. You knew you had a chance to come back. Talk about that second
half when you came out and the momentum seemed to be going your way
somewhat.  
COACH WRIGHT: We didn't feel bad at halftime, believe it or not. We're down
11. But we were getting the ball inside. We thought we kind of established,
and were taking the ball aggressively and getting to the foul line. We felt
good about it. I think they made ten threes at halftime, we thought all right,
they can't keep making all of these. But in the second half we didn't get to
the foul line, and we weren't as aggressive, I guess.  
And they just kept making them. And we had our chances. We had our chances.
When you play a team like that, if you don't take advantage of it -- they're
such a great passing team, when you get behind on them, you're not going to
press them and turn them over.  
  
Q. Coach, when Scottie Reynolds got cut, did he bleed enough for the
Selection Committee?  
COACH WRIGHT: I don't know. We're definitely, we're an NCAA Tournament team,
but that's not our decision. We'll let the Committee make their decision, and
we'll accept whatever they do. That's the way we want our young men to conduct
themselves, to live, you know. You control what you can control.  
We had our chance here today. We still think we're as good as any team in the
country, but not Georgetown today. And whatever the Committee decides, we'll
accept it. We'll be happy to play another day wherever we are.  
  
Q. You've always done a very good job limiting Roy Hibbert, what is it today
that stopped him?  
COACH WRIGHT: We let everybody else make threes so he couldn't score. That
wasn't the plan though. That wasn't the plan. I thought a lot of it was in the
first half, getting him in foul trouble. We did a great job getting the ball
inside. We were attacking them. We really felt pretty good at halftime. We
felt like, you know what, we're getting the ball inside. We're getting to the
foul line. It just didn't -- second half, we didn't get there. We didn't get
to the foul line and we didn't make our threes. You can't live and die with
the threes. If they weren't making those threes, I think they would have gone
to him a lot more. But it was as much of them making threes, they didn't need
to go to them.  
  
Q. How difficult will the next game be just waiting to find out, you're
going to play another game, but just waiting to find out your fate?  
COACH WRIGHT: You know, this has been such a long season. We went to Canada at
the end of August with these young guys. I think these three days are going to
be good for this team, believe it or not, I really do. I think we're going to
rest up. We're excited about playing together more. That's how we're going to
look at it. I'm going to try to get them to look at it. It's probably going to
be tougher on them.  
We have a lot of young guys that came to Villanova with the dream to go to the
NCAA Tournament and the expectation. That's part of our job as coaches. We've
got to teach them about life here. That's the great thing about being in
college. If we were NBA coaches, we'd probably be fired after a game like
that. But we're in college, and people at Villanova like us to teach lessons.  
  
Q. Coach, playing Georgetown today and the last time you played them, what
was the difference?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think they really attacked our pressure to get threes. They
started the game that way. That's a very confident mentality. They kicked it
up. Didn't go to the basket. Reversed it, and just shot threes.  
Their first three they missed we didn't rebound it. We got lazy, gave up an
offensive rebound, and on that play they kicked it for another three. Little
things like that. You don't get that many chances against great teams like
Georgetown. And then once they got that confidence, they just attacked. They
didn't try to go to the basket for lay-ups, they tried to get threes and did a
great job.  
  
Q. Jay, yesterday Scottie said he felt like Mike Nardi out there. Today
there was a whole lot more of what you referred to yesterday of yelling at
him. How much of it did you think it was Georgetown being a little bit more
experienced and how much of it was Scottie?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think there was a perfect combination. I thought there was a
period in the first half where they made some threes, and Scottie got a little
-- he lost his poise a little bit, and tried to take it to the basket and got
his head cut doing it rather than running the team. But then I thought he came
back from that play and having his eye bleeding and continued to try running
the team.  
So, two stories in that game: Little bit of youth, great experience by
Georgetown, but then I thought a great response by Scottie, you know,
finishing the game strong.  
  
Q. Scottie kept coming back, coming back, but 11 minutes to go you had to
take him out because he was bleeding again and Georgetown went on that final
run. How tough was it not to have Scottie in there?  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, correct me if I was wrong, I have to watch the film for
everything so I hate to be like a football coach and say that to you, but I
think it was 51-50 we were up or down?  
  
Q. 51-50 down?  
COACH WRIGHT: 51-50, we had the ball. We had to take him out. And we turned
the ball over next play, and they got an and-one. But if you're a good team,
you don't do that. You've got another player to come in there and make the
play. So you've got to give Georgetown credit. They had guys that were out.
They played without Chris Wright, and he was huge today.  
It's not an excuse, we're just not -- we just didn't respond as well as
Georgetown did today. But you can't make excuses. There is probably something
going on in Georgetown, but you don't know it because they respond. That's
part of the game.  
But I'm proud of our guys. I'm proud of Scottie the way he handled it. We want
to keep playing basketball together.  
  
Q. Dante, can you just talk in general about this season, you as an
upperclassman being sort of a leader, helping these young guys along.  
DANTE CUNNINGHAM: I mean, being an upperclassman, being that we don't have any
seniors this year, it was kind of hectic at first just because we haven't
actually had to go through such a young squad. We're juniors, me and Dwayne
and Frank and Shane, we just had to take them on. We had to just keep
rebounding with them, keep fighting with them. It was back and forth for a
little bit, you know. But definitely you could see it in a lot of their plays.
Corey stepped up a lot. Corey Stokes and Corey Fisher. They're definitely
coming along. They have great attitude out there, so.  
  
Q. Do you feel having to play last night when Georgetown had the day off had
any effect in this game? After the last 12 minutes it seemed like you were a
little slow and just couldn't make a run after them after while.  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, I was hoping that was going to be to our advantage, to be
honest with you. I wanted to try to use our depth a little bit more. I was
hoping they'd be a little rusty, miss some shots early. But it just went the
other way. It can work both ways. Sometimes you could be on a run and be
feeling good. What happened is when we got behind, certain guys we have to
play when we're playing catch-up. We didn't get to use our depth as much as I
would like to.  
Just didn't go our way this time. Because they came out, and the rest
obviously did them well. When they started drilling shots like that early, you
know, that made the biggest factor.  
  
Q. You said before they had another guy come in and another guy and they
stepped up. I hate to keep leaning on the age thing, but they're older than
you overall. Do you expect to see this team being one of those where you can
put in another guy, another guy?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, I do. I really like the depth of this team. As I said, we
were willing to use it tonight, today if we could have kept the game closer.
But once we got down after that spurt, I think after it was 51-50, I think
they hit six straight threes, they were on a run. Now we're down. So there are
only certain guys you can play. We would have liked to use Casiem Drummond
more. But you're not going to go out and press with a 6' 10", 280 pound guy.
So we didn't get to use him. But I do think we're going to be that kind of
team. We have great respect for Georgetown, and we think we're going to be
back at that point very quickly.  
  
Q. It is out of your hands what happens now, but if you were going to make
your case to the Committee, which they're not going to give you the
opportunity to, but if you were, what were a couple of points that you'd bring
up? The back end of the season last 15, 16 games you have been streaky both
ways.  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah. I would just say if you look at the top 65 teams, if
you're going to pick the best 65 teams, you're not going to worry about how
many come from a conference, how many mid-majors. And you just look at teams
that we've beaten and how we've played everybody, everybody that we've played.
That I think we're one of the best 65 teams. I really believe that.  
It doesn't matter what happens with the other games. I was a mid-major coach,
I know who is who. I know we're one of the best 65 teams. However, with that
said, I also know that it really doesn't come down to that. There is a lot
more to it, and we knew that at the beginning of the season. So you've got to
accept that. We're going to accept whatever the Committee decides. No
arguments.  
If you get to this point, and you put it in their hands, then you've got to
accept whatever they decide. Life's not fair, but we had our chance. Now we'll
take what medicine we get here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the team's growth since the tough loss to St. Joe's
and now, and how far you guys have come?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, I'm really proud of this group. Especially these two right
here. Dwayne and Dante have become big-time players, and big-time leaders.
They were both kind of role players. Now I think they've become outstanding
players in this league. Then they took that and took on leadership roles. I
think Scottie's really become a big-time point guard in learning how to be a
leader. We like each other, we want to keep playing. We know we can get a lot
better.  
As I said, we're going to rest up from this. Lick our wounds. This was a tough
loss to take, but as I said, it is the best thing about being in college. You
get to learn from this. These guys are going to learn a lot, and we're going
to get better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH CALHOUN: Some games are very complex. You mull over them, why you won or
why you lost, and it's difficult. This one's very easy. They came out, and
they kicked our butt and they outworked us and won the game. We had physical
mismatches, which we never took advantage of inside. 42-26 on the glass,
especially when we were coming back, we couldn't get any defensive rebounds to
get ourselves going. And we were unwilling for 40 minutes to put the kind of
effort you need into a tournament game.  
Simple. Case closed. We go home.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
COACH CALHOUN: By the way, I should say that Alexander, he is a terrific
player. He'd be a lot better player if he didn't touch the ball as many times.
Because our kids feel after he gets it, they were going to stop him. And when
he got somewhere around 27 or 28, I thought it would be a good idea if he
realized -- by the way, he had 32 the first time. Before they realized he was
a good basketball player.  
He played terrific today. But my team was not very good today. And we didn't
compete the way we need to compete to get 24 wins. It's more than
disappointing this time of the year that you won't compete in Madison Square
Garden the way we didn't compete.  
  
Q. What can you take out of this?  
COACH CALHOUN: I take nothing out of it.  
  
Q. Going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CALHOUN: I take nothing out of it. A lot of worry.  
  
Q. What things can you improve on in specific?  
COACH CALHOUN: Competing. I'm not trying to be a jerk to you. I know you're
trying to ask a question. But to take something out of a game like this where
we had mismatches. Ruoff gets the second foul. We don't use him, so we go
zone. Then we run at Mazzulla, who doesn't take threes, and leaves Nichols
alone. We know they're going to run that play. In the beginning of the second
half we tell them at halftime, you're going to get picked at the top. I'll
give you a list. I'll take away all the things that we didn't do that we told
the kids to do. It's not the kids' fault, it's the coach's fault because the
kids didn't listen to us.  
Bottom line I take nothing out of this game except for the fact that we didn't
compete the way we should have competed to win a game like that.  
  
Q. Are you concerned about your post play going forward?  
COACH CALHOUN: Before this game, we had one of the best shot blockers in the
country. We played a team that put five out. Thabeet's a good player. He'll be
making more money than probably most everybody in this room. That's a hard
game to play in because they play five out.  
But am I concerned about Hasheem? I'm concerned that he played awful today and
he looked tired for the first time all year, and the fact that Jeff had a bad
game offensively and defensively. Rebounding, particularly, the two of them,
where we had our butts handed to us, where I thought we had advantages in
there.  
But if you put everything in one game, I'll put it in the 45, 48-point win
against Cincinnati. Put everything in that game, then we're wonderful. If I
put everything in this game, we're quite frankly not very good. Not very good
at all. So I can't do that, no.  
But bottom line, that's not my concern now. My concern is our focus on how
important was it to win here in the neighborhood, in the Big East, in Madison
Square Garden, and just apparently it was a lot more important for West
Virginia to work harder. That's what I'm concerned about. And the NCAA's,
there's a lot hanging out there for a lot of us. If you don't want to compete
there, that I'd be much more concerned about than any individual aspect of our
game.  
  
Q. Is Alexander a particularly tough match-up for your team specifically or
is he tough for anybody to beat?  
COACH CALHOUN: He's averaging 28.8 coming into this game. So that makes it 29
against the last five opponents he's played. So one would have to presuppose
that he's a tough match-up for everybody. He's probably one of the best
players in the league, clearly.  
The way to play him is not to allow him to get the ball. One guy did, that was
No. 11. But he after awhile got oversized. We were supposed to get a rotation
down from our post, but like a lot of the other things we did, we expected
Hasheem to do that, but he didn't do it. Then we started making subs, we
didn't do that. And we wanted to double him when he got the ball in the low
post. Once again, there wasn't many things that we planned to do that we did
do.  
  
Q. You had a really good run late in this season, then you lost a game and
you were disappointed in the way they played then. Now you're very
disappointed in how they play today. Going into a NCAA Tournament, would you
say this is the most confused or less handle you have on a team going in?  
COACH CALHOUN: I really don't know about that one. Rollie Massimino in 1984
when he lost by 30-something points, and the next game was, I believe, the
NCAA Tournament. He went on to win six games and win a national championship.
I think he probably was a little confused that night about going into a
tournament.  
I know the night that Steve Lappas and Villanova beat us, and I happened to
see Steve who is a very good friend, talking how high he was going into the
tournament; they lost that Tuesday to Virginia Commonwealth, and we went to
the final eight that year. My point being simply that to take any single game
as a barometer, and for me to take our team when we do practice again and try
to take this one game, I think we won 13 of our last 16, something like that.
That's a pretty good closing for a season.  
But I am incredibly disappointed here because with the aspects of the game,
they were always bottoming. The number one aspect that always bothered me,
when we don't give it everything we have and leave it on the floor, and Ruoff
makes faraway threes, which I've seen him do before. Yes, Alexander put a good
performance on, certainly, but that game was very winnable inside for us. It
wasn't just the guards' fault. Our big guys who never presented themselves to
throw the ball into the post.  
So, yeah, I have concerns, which we'll address. But how do you figure how
poorly we played at Providence, come back and we were ahead of a team, not a
bad team, by the way, 36-5. So I don't know if it's a handle. When you win ten
in a row, you say you don't have a handle on your team, it would be hard to
say that, it really would be.  
But there have been a couple of times this year that we've done some
unexplainable things in a 32-game schedule. And this one, the Providence game
in particularly. The first Providence game they just shot lights out from
three. Made 14 out of 22 threes. That happens to teams. It happened today in
the Villanova-Georgetown game. They start making threes and continue to make
threes, even without their big guys. Those things happen. What I didn't like,
that game, when we weren't scoring, they weren't either. But we weren't
getting rebounds to give ourselves opportunities. Now the shot, the clock,
we're down for about 10 most of that period of time, 9, we were not scoring.
Then we gave them two and three possessions at a time because they just kicked
our butt on the boards. That concerns me greatly, and hopefully we'll be able
to do something about it by the time we play again.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Luke Harangody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16984)

### [Kyle McAlarney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18163)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH BREY: They got on a roll making some jumpshots in the second half. And I
think with them you try to give up something, and you know their speed,
they're getting into the lane. Could you try to take that away, play a little
zone. But when they made jumpshots like that, a bunch in a row, it kind of
broke our back a little bit. McNeal was fabulous. He's been fabulous these two
nights in New York. So it's disappointing for us.  
I thought offensively we played well enough to win the game, but we could
never get them under control on the defensive end of the floor. Lot of speed
coming at you.  
  
Q. Luke, how disappointing was it to pick up those two quick fouls in the
first half? Do you feel that limited you the rest of the night?  
LUKE HARANGODY: Yeah, kind of got me out of my rhythm. I have to watch myself
better than that. Kind of keep myself in the game. In a situation like that
where I did have to sit out the rest of the first half and not be on the floor
with my teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the key points you're picking up for next week?  
COACH BREY: Well, you know what I told them, we're excited we get to play next
week, to be one of 65 teams. This team hasn't lost two in a row all season.
That's how good a year they've had. So I reminded them of that. There are some
things we can work on before we go into the NCAA Tournament. I'll be honest
with you, I really like the fact that we're not playing any Big East games
next week. I've had enough. It's been great. I love the league. We need some
fresh faces, and I'll bet you the other coaches in this tournament are going
to say the same thing on Sunday.  
We need to get some rest. But Sunday night will be an exciting night, and it's
great that we get to play. They've earned that.  
  
Q. Kyle, how much was the second half there just about their toughness
getting into you?  
KYLE McALARNEY: Well, you know, they're a great team. Hats off to them. In the
second half they went on a few runs and we didn't answer. We, offensively, we
missed a few shots and I think that got to us and hurt us on the defensive
end. Loose balls, defensive rebounds, they really got after us. For a stretch
there, they were a little tougher than us.  
  
Q. Mike, I think they shot 63% in the second half, I believe they had 57
points. How much of that is them, and how much of a concern is that for you
defensively?  
COACH BREY: Probably a little bit of both, but I think you've got to give them
a lot of credit. This is a team that certainly was picked, I think, in the Top
10 in the preseason. They're very talented. With them you've got to try to
give up something. We're not quick enough to take away both, the perimeter and
the inside. We kind of packed it in a little bit in some different zones and
they made jumpshots. That's probably as good as it gets. You've got to hope a
couple of those come off and they got confident in it. They got to some loose
balls with their speed; that really hurt us.  
The game we won in South Bend, we were amazingly efficient offensively. That
kind of held them off. Tonight we weren't bad, but it wasn't good enough.  
  
Q. Was there a point where it just got frustrating out there when they're
making shot after shot and you guys cut it to four, then back to ten, cut it
to three, and it's back to eight.  
KYLE McALARNEY: Yeah, it is frustrating. You know, at that point it kind of
feels like they're throwing in everything. It's almost like, what are we going
to do? Our scouting report is we need to give up that jumpshot and take away
the paint, protect our paint and they start throwing those in.  
Like I said it before, hats off to them. Give them a lot of credit. They're a
great team. Eventually they were going to hit those shots.  
  
Q. How have you seen Jerel McNeal grown offensively over the year?  
COACH BREY: He's really the key for them. I'm so impressed with him. We talked
about really being aware of him. Trying to have Tory (Jackson) on him to play
man-to-man to take him away. It's easier said than done because he gets so
much in transition when you're broken a little bit. Different guys are matched
up. He gets to the backboard. No one in the league's playing better than him
here. He's a very confident guy. And we have felt he's the key to the team. We
did a little bit better job on him in South Bend, that's why we got one win.
But the other two times we couldn't really control him and we lost the games.  
  
Q. You get to play next week, obviously the NCAA Tournament is on the
horizon, so what is the level of disappointment with coming in here, with
expectations to play on the weekend?  
LUKE HARANGODY: You know, well, we definitely had expectations to come in
here, as you said, and have a successful tournament. I think now we just have
to look forward, like Coach said to Sunday. And we get to play next week. A
lot of teams don't get to do that. I think we kind of have to put this in the
past. But still we'll look at some things we did wrong tonight and just see
what we've got next on Sunday.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the 111th game between these two teams in history. How big
is this rivalry especially now that both teams are premier teams in this
conference?  
COACH BREY: And the first time ever in the Big East Tournament, so it kind of
takes the rivalry to a new level. I got educated to the Marquetate rivalry
real quick. When I got the job eight years ago they asked me, when are we
putting Marquette back on the schedule? Of course they weren't in the Big East
then, and we put them back on the schedule. Now that it's a league game, it
just ratchets up the intensity.  
I can't believe the atmosphere was any better than when we were in Milwaukee
that afternoon. They were ready for us. Also it was the day the Packers were
playing, so we got a lot of bad karma that day. And our fans were very ready
for them to come to South Bend.  
So it's a healthy rivalry. It's a good rivalry, I think it's two very good
programs in this league.  
  
Q. Luke, you said before that you didn't feel like you found a rhythm. Was
there any point that you felt like one stretch where you could score eight in
a row? Was that the only time you felt comfortable tonight?  
LUKE HARANGODY: After this game I felt like I really couldn't get into the
rhythm tonight. It had a lot to do with them scouting and playing a great
defense against me and knowing what I do best. You know, got to give them --
hats off to them for that. But tonight just wasn't one of my nights and I just
couldn't get in a great rhythm. And I've just got to move on.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH DIXON: I know you want to talk to these guys, they made all the plays.
It's a great win for us. Played hard. Thought we battled through some things.
We had the foul trouble early. Got performances by everybody. Bradley
Wanamaker gave us great minutes, Tyrell Biggs, Gilbert Brown, and our bench
was terrific for us, and that was big. Proud of them.  
Battle through against a very good team, and made plays all the way through.
And we defended well. And like I said, our defense has been getting better and
better since we've been back to somewhat good health besides the three guys
that are out for the year. But we're getting better and better for practice.
We've really looked at these last four games in this tournament for us to be
ourselves, be the team that we can be, and that's what we're becoming. So
proud of these guys, every one of them. They just, they battled. That's really
the best way to sum it up.  
  
Q. From the first game you played them, it looked like you double-teamed
Padgett a lot more. What kind of adjustments did you make defensively from the
first time?  
COACH DIXON: We made a lot of adjustments, actually. To be honest, these guys
won this game. I felt like I didn't do a good job coaching the last game. So I
lost the last game, these guys won this game.  
We made some adjustments, we had to shut down Padgett. But we held them to
37%, they know the numbers. I asked them what the game was, I asked them the
numbers and they knew exactly what they were. We held them at 37%. What did
they shoot last time, guys?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: 57%.  
COACH DIXON: 57%. So we knew exactly. As soon as they got off the floor they
wanted to know.  
So they battled. They contested shots and they're just getting better. It's a
young group that keeps getting better.  
  
Q. Last night you predicted that DeJuan would bounce back with a big game.
Can you talk about what he did and the way he came back.  
COACH DIXON: You're playing against one of the best players in the country
right there in Padgett. I have tremendous confidence in him, I've always had.
And he got in some foul trouble, got double-teamed. There's some things he's
going to get used to, and it's happening more and more the better and better
he gets. He just got some foul trouble. But again, 16 points, 8 rebounds
against two of the best big guys in the country says a lot about him.  
I thought his defense was very good. I thought Sam helped him out in a lot of
ways, too, defensively. And I can't say enough about Sam, too. Sam is just
getting smarter and smarter on the floor. He's kind of become really our
general out there as far as what we're doing defensively. Recognizing things,
and it's just talk about being most improved. They talk about a shot, I'm
talking about how much smarter and aware, and how the guys are just feeding
off of his knowledge.  
  
Q. If you go by seeds, this technically goes down as an upset. But is that
an unfair characterization considering what this league is like?  
COACH DIXON: I think with our team it's probably -- I don't think anybody
really knew what to make of our team with all the injuries. This is a team
that had to change in midstream three, four times in what they were doing.
We're finding ourselves. I think we're on our way. We have, and we're just
getting better and better.  
But these guys are the guys that made the plays, so you need to talk to them
about what they did. But we're getting better. And it's because we've got
seniors like Keith (Benjamin) and Ronald, and these guys are just getting
better and better here, too. Inside DeJuan and Sam on the defensive men.  
  
Q. You talked about it yesterday, and you saw the team coming together, when
did that happen?  
COACH DIXON: No, this is just about being able to practice. We weren't able to
practice for a number of days with our injuries. Levance (Fields) wasn't
practicing. This past week before our DePaul game he was able to practice for
the first time. We had three good practices. We got after it. We did the
things we do. More drills, blockout drills. The aggression and physicality
that we usually have. And that's been coming. We just haven't been able to do
it. And when we did, I felt this thing would be going our way and you'd see
this team coming into their own and just getting better. Teams get better.
Certain teams get better at different times of the year.  
This one because of the injuries that really no one can really compare it to
someone else. You lose four guys for nearly a year, we're finding ourselves
and our freshmen are getting better. But again, these are the guys that made
the plays, so ask them the questions.  
  
Q. Levance is coming back, battling that pressure up and down the floor all
night long, you've got any concern about how much legs he'll have left for
tomorrow?  
COACH DIXON: For a normal guy, but with his heart and his competitiveness,
he's going to battle through it. We've got Ronald, too, as well. So all of our
guys handle the ball. We're a low-turnover team. We had a few more than we'd
normally like to. But we'll be ready. We'll be ready. We won't come out tired.
We'll be ready.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about your instincts during the game, when you decided that you
had to defend better and rebound more and stuff like that. Talk about that.  
SAM YOUNG: In the first five or ten minutes of the game I realized that my
shot wasn't falling as much as I would like it to. I figured if I'm out there
on the court, I have to do something else. I have to still contribute
defensively, just making sure I'm in the right spot as far as making sure my
team is in the right spot. Get rebounds, block shots.  
  
Q. Ronald, in overtime it was a two-point game, and you drove into the lane,
clock was running down and you had a bunch of 6'11 " guys in front, can you
talk about that lay-up you made.   
RONALD RAMON: I was just trying to make a play. We came down to it, DeJuan had
the ball on top of the key, and it was the nine, we ran the play a few times
and they adjusted. So I tried to back cut. DeJuan made a great pass. Guys were
in the paint, trying to dig the ball. So the ball got loose, and they were all
trying to go for the ball once I got it. So wide open lay-up, and I just went
for it.  
  
Q. DeJuan, they had a lot of lay-ups and dunks in the first half. What did
you do better in the second half to cut that off?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: We adjusted to it. Coach did an excellent job seeing what they
were doing. They were slipping the screen. So Sam and Terrell did an excellent
job just handling the slip-ins. Our help side was better. And the guards did
an excellent job being in the gaps, helping out on the slips, so we did an
excellent job on that. That was coaching.  
  
Q. DeJuan, what did your coach say to you after your performance last
night?  
DEJUAN BLAIR: He just said to keep my head up. That was a tough game yesterday
for me. He just said, "It's over. That was yesterday. Worry about tomorrow."
So I just went in my room and just thought about it, thought about what I did
wrong, what could I do better tomorrow. And I adjusted to everything I did. So
my shots were better. Took my time being patient in the post.  
My coach had a lot of confidence in me, bringing me the ball, so I just
handled it very well. Kept my head up. Everybody, all my teammates, my mother
and my father called me. Got a lot of calls from back home. I'm going to have
games like that. Everybody has (bad) games. But luckily we're in the
tournament, and we get to have another day to redeem yourself. So I think I
did an excellent job at that and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ronald, the first time you guys played Louisville, Edgar Sosa had a big
game. What changed in the past couple of weeks that limited him today?  
RONALD RAMON: I think it was just about team defense. We talked about being in
the gaps, making sure we saw the ball screen pretty well coming down screens.
So we tried to readjust to some of the things they did to us in the first
game. Being able to practice and going through their plays a few times. We
were able to come out and adjust to it.  
  
Q. Ronald, you've been to the semifinals a couple times in the past few
years, what have you learned in the past that you'll expect for tomorrow
night?  
RONALD RAMON: Play hard. We've just got to come out and play as a team. This
game's going to be behind us in another five minutes. We've just got to get
ready for tomorrow. Watch, see who we're going to play, and mentally just get
focused. Come out with the same intensity and same mentality about playing
defense.  
  
Q. Ronald, Coach talked about how the team is coming into its own now that
it's getting healthy. For you and players on the court, how different does it
feel now than maybe in January or February?  
RONALD RAMON: It was different just because guys weren't able to get after it.
Practice is where it starts. We weren't able to compete, we weren't able to go
after each other, do the aggressive drills as we call them. But now that guys
are healthy, we're able to go five-on-five, get after it, making each other
better in practice, and I think that's where it starts. Now we'll be going on
the court and playing games, the chemistry's there and we know what we have to
do to win games.  
  
Q. You guys played Duke back here in December, how much of that benefited
you guys playing them prior to this tournament?  
SAM YOUNG: It helped us a lot. Most teams probably play here once, we played
here twice. We always play, we always have good games. We always play pretty
decent here. As I said, this is our home away from home. So I just feed off
the energy that the New York guys bring.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Joe Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18103)

### [Da'Sean Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17188)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. Last year in the NIT final you don't score a point in the same arena, how
have you made this? It's like you grew up shooting, pretty much?  
JOE ALEXANDER: The adjustment has come for me, better shape physically.
Lifting more throughout the entire season. I feel like I have my legs
underneath me as opposed to last year when I lost a lot of weight at this
point.  
  
Q. Was that as difficult to coach as it was to watch?  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah. Two years ago I'd have been sitting in front of the TV
with a cold beverage and some popcorn, watching everybody else sweat.  
These guys, they did a great job. We rebounded the ball. We struggled a bit
against our pressure and we kind of got that straightened out. They did a
great job.  
  
Q. The West Virginia guys outrebounded UCONN 42-26 so, pretty much that was
the deciding factor for the victory today?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Yeah, you know, Coach talked to us a lot about for us to win
this game we have to get back on defense and then transition, and stop them in
transition. And us outrebounding them or keep them in close with the rebounds.
And we, obviously, we had a little bit of trouble in the beginning of the game
as far as transition, but we kind of buckled down on that.  
But for us, our rebounding that much, it just shows how much work everybody
else is doing as a team. We did great, and everybody else helped in the
rebounds.  
Q. Over the last five games Joe's averaged about 30 points a game. What's
going on in particular over the last week, week and a half. And how important
is his play going to continue to be as you go on through March?  
COACH HUGGINS: I wanted him to do it the whole year, I couldn't get him to
cooperate. No, he's slowed down. He's slowed down. He's doing a much better
job of reading the defense. He's such a hard match-up, because if you put a
bigger guy on him, he can take him out on the floor and beat him off the
dribble and get him to the basket, hit pull-up jumpshots. If you put a smaller
guy on him, he can go down in the post and put people on his back. That's kind
of what we talked about early on was let's make you the most difficult match-
up in the league because he hadn't spent a lot of time playing in the post.  
He's really done a great job of listening and learning and being a heck of a
post player. But we can also get him out on the floor whenever he's got a big
on him. And he shoots it well enough out there that you can't play off of him,
which makes him a pretty hard guard.  
  
Q. You said last night that this hasn't been a challenge for you, that it's
been a pleasure to work with these guys. That said, are you ahead of the curve
where you thought you would be at this point one year in with this thing?  
COACH HUGGINS: I didn't know. I don't come in and watch tape because I don't
want to have preconceived ideas. People try to tell me this about Da'Sean, and
this about Joe, and I didn't want to hear it. I wanted to come in fresh. I
wanted them to come in fresh, and not come in saying this guy can do this or
this guy can do this. Because we play so much different than what they played
a year ago. You know, it's been good really good for some guys because of the
freedom, and because we've spread it so much.  
I had no idea where we'd be.  
Q. Has this been an enjoyable year coaching?  
COACH HUGGINS: I thought it was pretty fun being number one in the country a
couple of times. I kind of enjoyed that. They've been good. All you ask is
that guys come in every day and they listen and they work, and for the most
part these guys have done that.  
  
Q. Where would you say Joe ranks among the other best players in the
country?  
COACH HUGGINS: We're a work in progress. But he's a hard guard. You know, he's
just such a hard guard. He's not a post guy, he's not a perimeter guy. I told
him early on that probably in our best interest to win more games, we ought to
stick him in the post and teach him how to win in the post. But that's not
where his future is. And that's not where I thought he could really blossom,
so we have him out on the wing. He's out on the wing every day guarding. He's
out on the wing playing offense every day on the wing. He's playing off the
dribble.  
The great thing about Joe and Da'Sean as well, they want to be good. They
really want to be good. I probably had a couple more talks with Joe than
Da'Sean about - probably a month ago, right, Joe? - that it's going to get
worse before it got better, and it did. I think what people don't realize is
he was slowed by a groin for a long time. I mean, and probably played in some
games that he probably shouldn't have played in just because he wants to play
so bad. So that kind of retarded his progress as well.  
But it's fun coaching guys that want to learn. It's fun coaching guys that
want to be good. And these two guys really want to be good players.  
Q. Can you talk about the quick turnaround after this emotional win going
into tomorrow?  
COACH HUGGINS: We packed for the week. This is for us a four-game tournament,
we knew that coming in.  
  
Q. Can I get you to comment on how well you've been playing lately? You've
had a solid season, but it's like you've taken it to another level in the last
few weeks or so. Are you just feeling it right now? What's going on?  
JOE ALEXANDER: The number one difference is I just slowed down, whereas in the
past I would grab the ball and try to move really fast and do everything in my
repertoire all at once. But now the coach has got me to recognize that it's
actually better to move slower on the court, so that's the difference.  
  
Q. Is it more difficult to win four games in four days mentally or
physically?  
COACH HUGGINS: I feel pretty fresh (smiling). I don't know. We spend a lot of
energy because we try to guard so hard. I think our mental approach is pretty
good. We're running out of people today. We were about as deep on the bench as
I wanted to go.  
I think as I tell them, we're going back to the hotel. They're going to get
off their feet. They're going to rest, they're going to relax. And these guys
are pretty good athletes, so they'll bounce back. I tell them all the time,
everybody that wants to play in the NBA, those guys play a hundred games. They
don't get to rest very much. They can play a hundred, we ought to be able to
play whatever it is, what are we on, 33 now? They're a third of the way
through an NBA season.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, obviously, the last time you guys played Georgetown, it ended up
a little messy with you and Patrick at the buzzer. The rematch now, what do
you think?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I'm just looking forward to playing them again. They're a very
good team. We did very well against them last time, just came up short. It
should be a good game.  
  
Q. Did you do anything specific to diminish A.J. Price's effectiveness?  
COACH HUGGINS: We put a 2-3 zone in last night in the ballroom. We haven't
played 2-3 zone all year. We just wanted to try to keep him in front of us. He
just got on such a role when we played them at Hartford. He's a great player.
There's not a lot of guys that shoot it off the catch, and shoot it off the
dribble, and have the ability to get to the basket like he does. So we just
want to try to keep him in front of us as much as we possibly could.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Maurice Acker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18162)

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Jerel McNeal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18123)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH CREAN: First off our guys have had an opportunity with playing the late
game two nights in a row, to be in the hotel room watching all these great
games. The story of the tournament every year, and certainly this year, has
been toughness prevails. And it's everybody it's coming down to the wire,
because every team is full of players that can make plays, that can create
extra possessions that have toughness. And our team right now is really
learning a lot about that again at the highest level.  
And ever since Jerel has been a freshman and guys that are now juniors and
seniors, when they were freshmen and sophomores, we have always wanted to take
that next step in this tournament and get to Friday night. Because we've
always felt if you can play on Friday night at the Big East Tournament, you
can play with anybody. So we're very, very proud to be one of the four teams
that's going to get an opportunity to do that.  
We knew we had to beat an outstanding team offensively and defensively today
with Notre Dame. And our guys really turned it up in a lot of different ways
in the second half.  
The first half had its good moments, it had its tough moments for us. But the
second half was full of what these guys have turned into Marquette basketball.
Proud of what they did, proud of these two and their teammates. And we were
very excited to have an opportunity to play in the semis tomorrow night
against Pittsburgh.  
  
Q. Maurice, could you speak a little about what it meant to be able to
provide for your team coming down the stretch.  
MAURICE ACKER: It meant a lot. We just came out as a team in the second half,
we talked to each other in the locker room before we came out. We said we
weren't going to lose tonight. So everybody had that mentality that we were
going to come out and play our hardest, and we were going to get the win.  
  
Q. How much better of a chance do you feel like you guys have in the
postseason just having Jerel out there? Kind of compare it to last year?  
COACH CREAN: There's no question it's a major difference. Last night I was so
happy for him to be able to play in this tournament again. It was tough for
us, obviously, last year without him. But as tough as it was for us, it was
harder for us to watch him. I think I can speak for his teammates on this, I
know I'm speaking for myself, it was very hard for us to watch him not have an
opportunity to play here last year because of his injury. And I think he's, in
the last two nights, has made up for lost time, there's no doubt about it.  
So we're definitely, definitely happy with the way we're continuing to get
better. I think the experience of playing in games like this, the toughness
that's in it, the possession-by-possession mentality that you have to have is
certainly going to help us as we go forward.  
  
Q. Could you just comment on Maurice's play coming off the bench and how it
impacts the game.  
COACH CREAN: Absolutely. He's got tremendous speed and quickness, that's
obvious. Size, the size of his heart is always outweighed and outshined
anything that he may not have in size. And that's what I saw. I'm just
fortunate that he's with us, because I made a big mistake not signing him out
of high school. A big mistake. But fortunately, you don't get an opportunity
many times to rectify those decisions. And Dan Fitzgerald being part of our
program is one, and certainly Maurice is another.  
I think from the Villanova came game a few weeks ago is when his season has
really started to flourish. Our players have loved playing with him all year.
They have great confidence in him. Certainly as a coaching staff we have that
confidence in him. And we get it from watching him attack and just play with
that abandon that he has, and that's why he's playing so well, I think.  
  
Q. Jerel and Maurice, you two played together in high school, how does it
feel to be playing together now in the Big East Tournament?  
MAURICE ACKER: It really is a good feeling. Since high school we've been
playing. Since really fifth great grade or whatever. But since we're on the
court we have that bond. I know where he's at every time and he knows where
I'm at, so it's a good feeling.  
  
Q. Jerel, your thoughts?  
JEREL McNEAL: I mean, just same thing. Just going off what Coach says. I'm
just happy to be playing with him again. Just getting the opportunity. He had
to sit out last year after he transferred. And I think there's no doubt just
in our locker room, in everybody's mind how much he's helping us. He's the guy
here. Other he was going through ups and downs in the big first season and
things like that. And I was just telling him stick with it. Tonight was his
time. He had to step up. He made big shots at crunch time. So he's a big-time
player. I'm happy for him more than anything.  
  
Q. You said the second half was full of Marquette basketball. Besides making
a bunch of shots, what's that mean?  
COACH CREAN: I think our defensive intensity turned up. I think the biggest
thing for us at halftime was our talk needed to change. We needed to become
much more aggressive verbally with each other in our transition defense and
our match-ups. There were a couple times in the first half we let them have
wide open shots when we were there. We didn't communicate on pick-and-roll as
much. And we got a little stagnant offensively. It allowed them to really
create the momentum for themselves in the first half. And I thought in the
second half we created momentum because of our defense, because of our
communication, because of our ability to stay in the backboards. And because
we never stopped running and pushing. And I think that's, in a sense, what
these guys have made is Marquette basketball. That's what it really means to
us.  
  
Q. Did seeing some of the other teams that had played the first day, West
Virginia and Pitt win the game today, did that motivate you guys thinking it
could be your day again?  
JEREL McNEAL: I wouldn't necessarily say motivated us. Because I mean you're
playing on the biggest stage in the country right now. Playing the Big East
Tournament. Coming out and playing in the most famous arena in the world. If
you can't get motivated for that, you're not a competitor.  
But we definitely, I mean, it just speaks for the conference and how deep this
conference is when you see all the teams that played on that first night come
back and beat the team that's got the bye.  
From day one, we all understand competing night in and night out about this
conference just how good it is. And I think it's just a compliment to how
great this conference is.  
COACH CREAN: I don't think we could underestimate how well our big people
played tonight against a great player, Luke Harangody, and don't underestimate
the job Dominic James did. And we ask a lot of him. That's one of the things
that helps when you have Maurice in the game, Dominic doesn't have to shoulder
the load as much bringing the ball up, which allows him to be one of the best
defenders in the country, which he is. Even though they made some shots late,
I thought for the most part our guys did a great job making them earn their
baskets.  
  
Q. Maurice, I think you hit that second three to put you guys up ten with
3:30 to go. Then your teammates come and mob you in the middle of the Garden
floor. What does that feel like? What's going through your head right there?  
MAURICE ACKER: I mean, that just shows how we are as a team or whatever. If
somebody's doing good, we're going to acknowledge that. It's just a good
feeling, you know, knowing that we've got different teammates that are behind
our back or whatever.  
  
Q. You go from one very storied and long rivalry with Notre Dame to now
somewhat of a new rivalry with Pittsburgh. What do you expect from the
Panthers coming in tomorrow?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we know they've been in this position many, many times.
What is it, six out of the last seven years, seven out of eight. So I was one
off in the locker room.  
I mean, they have done a phenomenal job. When you think of the Big East,
obviously, they're one of the first names that are going to pop up. We played
very well against them a few weeks back, and it was Levance Fields' first game
back. We understand it's a different team. I hope we're a different team. But
we know that they pose tremendous challenges because of their toughness,
because of their ability to rebound the ball, to play physical on defense, and
really they're an outstanding offensive team. So, again, it's going to take a
great effort from us to win because they don't have any holes or weaknesses.  
  
Q. How was it for you last year not being able to play?  
JEREL McNEAL: You know, just like I said earlier, it was one of the hardest
times of my life. You know, just working all the way up to that point in the
season and not being able to play in the most exciting part of the season,
which is March Madness. And it's one of those things that you go through
throughout your life that makes you not take things for granted. I thought
about it all year. Had a whole year to think about it, and just anxious to get
back to this point.  
So now, I'm right back here. The year went real fast for me, and I'm just
excited to be here and be playing and helping my team out and just winning
games more importantly.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Scottie Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16946)

### [Corey Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18094)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jay Wright, Scottie Reynolds, Corey Stokes.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That was a big-time win for this team. Because I think
Syracuse is a tournament team, and I think we beat a tournament team, and
that's what this group has to do. This group is kind of making their own name.
I'm really, really proud of them, really happy for them.  
We just got great leadership from Scottie. I told him walking over here, I had
no idea he had 22 points, but I knew he had 6 assists and no turnovers. When
he came out, I said that was a big-time point guard game. I thought he had 6
assists, no turnovers and 12 points, but he had a big-time game.  
And of course, Corey just keeps getting better and better and better. And he's
just making us a much better team. When you have great players, you're a good
team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive adjustments you made in the second half,
especially the first five minutes?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Well, I thought we did a pretty good job in the first half
defensively. I did. We couldn't score and we were turning the ball over. So I
wasn't that concerned defensively starting the second half. I thought we
rebounded better in the second half. But it was more getting us going
offensively and making some shots and not turning the ball over. So that was
probably, I think, what made a difference in the beginning of the second half.  
I thought the end of the first half, our defense kept us in it because we
couldn't score, and we got some turnovers and some steals and we got some fast
breaks, even that last three. And that's where our defense really helped us at
the end of the first half.  
  
Q. Jay, you started Stokes in the second half, just your thought process
going into that?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Normally Corey Fisher starts for us, and we like to play the
two smaller guards. But they were so big, and we just, and Corey played really
well defensively in the first half, Corey Stokes. So we wanted to stay big.
That's really what it was. We wanted to keep as many big bodies on the floor
as we could.  
  
Q. Corey, you had 13 points in this building against St. John's. You shot
well, you obviously shot well again today. Have you played here before? And b,
your thoughts and feelings of playing in this building?  
COREY STOKES: It's great playing at Madison Square Garden. It was always my
dream as a young kid to play in the Big East tournament. Coach Wright just
told me to go out and play aggressive, and just play even more aggressive on
the defensive end, and just help my teammates out.  
  
Q. You had Scottie off guard/point guard back and forth a lot this season,
how has he handled that? And I'll ask Scottie the same thing, what's it been
like going through that all year?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I think that's been a real struggle for Scottie, though he
never mentioned it. It was something we were trying to do because defenses
were focusing in on him so much, we were trying to play him at the point
because that's where he belongs. And then we were trying to take him off the
ball so that we could run them off screens. I really think it affected him. As
I said, he never said a word. Just did whatever we asked him to do.  
And I think it's important for our team that the ball is in his hands and he's
running the show. He's our leader. I think that showed in our last few games.  
  
Q. Could Scottie just talk about it.  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: It's just been a learning process all year. Just learning
how defenses are going to play me at the two spot, and how defenses are going
to play me at the one spot. And I think the last two weeks and the last now
three games, I've just been getting better each day at the point guard
position. Knowing that I don't have to score 30 every night. I can just go in
there, just relax, play my game, get my teammates involved, and, you know,
that's going to open up things for me.  
So the last few games that's what I've been doing and our team's been winning.
That's really what it comes down to.  
  
Q. Your team obviously shot the ball really well from three point range. How
were you hoping to attack Syracuse's zone today?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We knew we had to make threes to play with these guys.
That's what was kind of encouraging about the first half was that we were not
making shots in the first half. That three at the end of the first half by
Dwayne Anderson was huge, because I don't know if that was our first one or
second one of the half, but I think it just made us feel like the lid was off
the basket. We were playing good defense. We came out in the second half,
started banging them. And we have good shooters. When we make threes, we're a
tough team, like everybody.  
  
Q. Last year this time you were playing at St. Benedict's wishing you could
be over here. When did you feel you got comfortable with playing in Coach
Wright's system?  
COREY STOKES: Like the start of the Big East Tournament, I think. Like in the
beginning of the season I was losing like a little bit of my confidence
because I wasn't playing that much. But my coaches, especially Coach Wright
and the captains were just telling me to keep my head up and keep a positive
attitude. That's what I have been doing, and it's working out for me now.  
  
Q. What do you guys need to do tomorrow to get through Georgetown?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Making shots always helps, you know. I mean, if you make
shots against them, you've got a chance. Now that's easier said than done.
They're even longer than Syracuse, which is crazy to say, but they really are.
They might be the only team that's longer than Syracuse. Maybe a little bit
Connecticut. But I don't think so. I think they're the longest team. We've got
to move their defense and make shots.  
We did a good job of that in the second half. Again, you've got to guard. That
kept us in it in the first half when we did make shots.  
  
Q. What does this do for your NCAA Tournament implications? Is this enough
or do you want to seal it up with Georgetown?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Oh, I hope it's enough. But I know I have no say in that, so
I'm not going to worry about it. I just want to be honest about it. You hope
it's enough. But you get to play another day, so that's really what's most
important to you. You just sit back after it's all done, and you look to see
if it was enough or not.  
We're just really happy to be playing another day. This team is just getting
better and better. We're really enjoying the work we're putting into it. So
that's what we're most interested in is just playing another day in this
tournament, which we all love.  
  
Q. There was a point it seemed to me somewhere around the defense and
offense switching back and forth where you did a lot of talking to guys and
moving them around. I've been told that's somewhat of an adjustment for you.
Can you talk about the vocal part of being a leader at this point of your
career?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: I definitely felt like Mike Nardi today out there. I said
that a few occasions. But today I felt that I was him. I felt like I was
shooting like him. I think he was in my presence a little bit.  
But no, it's just something that I've been working on since the end of last
year, and going through the whole summer and the fall. I might not have done
the best job, but I just keep working on it. The only way you're going to win
is to keep that intensity up on the defensive end, the defensive side of the
ball. You can see that in today's game. You know, we weren't making shots but
we were getting stops on the other end. And that's what we pride ourselves on
is getting stops, and if we're not making shots still find a way to win.  
  
Q. As you look at tomorrow, Georgetown is a little bit longer, maybe outside
shooting more of a premium, are you going to have to have Scottie off the ball
a little more tomorrow?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We might. We might. That's one of the things we struggle
with is we need his scoring. But what's helping is Corey Stokes really, Corey
handled the ball a lot today against pressure and did a good job. We put a lot
of pressure on Scottie because we want him to run the show. But what we've
been working on, that's what he's talking about is running the team and still
finding ways to get your shots. It's a delicate balance, but it's probably
what is going to be a big factor in the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Given the way, the flukey way the first game ended, do you feel like
there is some unfinished business with Georgetown?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: You can answer that first.  
COREY STOKES: Well, we're just going to go out and play the next game. Me, my
teammates and the coaches are really looking forward to this game. And we're
just going to go out and play hard with Villanova pride.  
  
Q. Donte' Greene had that quick flurry of nine points midway through the
first half and he was quiet the rest of the way. Did you guys change up your
defensive strategy at all? Or make it a point to try to stop Donte'?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: No, actually that was a time where we lost it. We lost our
intensity. We didn't execute there. And they did a great job of recognizing
it. We made similar mistakes of leaving him to help. And every time we did,
they found him. They do a great job of that. They reverse the ball well and
find your mistakes. And that was a period that we did that.  
  
Q. What does it say about the depth and the strength of the Big East that
you have national champions playing in an 8 and 9 game in the first round?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: That's a great -- I've said it a lot of ways; that's another
way. You have two teams that won national championships playing 8-9 games. I
remember when I was an assistant you dreaded playing an 8-9 game in that first
night when no one else was playing. It was hell. And now we are all excited to
be in the 8-9 game. We were so excited to be an 8 seed, we finished strong and
we had a chance.  
Lot of times you play in the 8-9 game, and that game used to be when I was an
assistant, okay, you just got to get into the tournament. That game doesn't
mean anything. If you win, that's not helping your NCAA chances because you're
playing a 9 team. Here you're playing a 9 team, you're playing a NCAA
Tournament team.  
You look at the amount of teams in our league that have the number of wins
they do. I just think it's going to take time for the country to understand
what a great conference it is, because there hasn't been anything like it.
Anybody that is in it will tell you that. It is by far the best conference in
the country. Most competitive top to bottom. And it's just new so people don't
know how to adjust to it.  
  
Q. Corey, how many times have you been asked about, talked about, seen that
foul on Jonathan Wallace?  
COREY STOKES: A lot of people talk to me about it. After the game a lot of
people were asking me if it was a foul. The referee made a call, and he just
made the call, and that's what it was. You have to just play through it.
Tomorrow you have another chance to play them, and hopefully we come out with
the victory.  
  
Q. What were you able to do to keep the ball from getting into Onuaku and if
you did, keep it from scoring?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: We were able to play three different people on him. We
started with Antonio. Casiem Drummond gave us a few good minutes there for a
while. Picked up a couple of fouls which was good and bad. He was physical in
there. And then Donte' played him some, and Antonio played him again. So we
were actually able to put three people on him.  
He's a big body. Early in the first half, that was hurting us. They were going
inside to him. He was passing out there, and I thought that was a big part of
our defense that helped.  
  
Q. You said Corey's development is one of the reasons why this team's gotten
better through the season. He's had 18 points today, has tied a career high.
Had 18 against UCONN in that win. Is that something you noticed on him early
on when you were recruiting him, this knack for showing up in big games?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, from being an assistant at UNLV, and being a Hofstra
assistant, he's the best shooter that I've ever been involved with recruiting.
I'm not surprised at this. I was a little surprised early that he struggled a
little bit early. But I was more impressed with how he handled it. When I say
early, I mean in the fall, preseason. But I was so impressed, our whole staff
was, how he handled struggling. When a McDonald's All American is not playing
a lot and struggling, usually everybody's complaining. He didn't say a word.
He just kept asking. And I said this to our team, he just kept asking, what do
I need to do better? How do I do this better? And it's showing now. He's a
great talent. He's just going to get better and better.  
  
Q. Considering everything that was on the line here, how close it's been
between 'Nova and Syracuse this year, if I would have told you with 4 minutes
left you were up by a lot, would you have been shocked, stunned amazed?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Shocked. Never thought it would be a game like this. We
prepared for a battle down to the bitter end. We would have been happy to come
out of here with a one-point win at the buzzer. We were ready for that. But
when you make shots like that in the second half, anybody's going to -- it's
going to be tough to beat anybody when you make shots like that. We've had a
lot of nights where we didn't.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Dwayne Anderson and what he's done for the team.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: He's the guy now that we don't take off the floor. He's such
a leader out there. He had, how many rebounds, 7 defensive rebounds. Guarded
Greene. He's just a Villanova basketball player, man. That's the greatest
compliment I can give anybody. And so proud of him.  
  
Q. How much did that run at the end of the first half help you guys get your
footing?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I thought it was huge. I thought it was huge, because we
couldn't score. We were missing free throws, turning the ball over. You know,
we looked nervous. We just looked like we wanted it too bad. Sometimes that
happens. I was resigned at the first half I said to myself, all right. We've
got young kids, they just wanted it too bad. Donte' looked shaky. But we kept
playing good defense. And our defense created turnovers and created some fast
breaks. Even that last three, Scottie got a loose ball, kicked it to Dwayne. I
thought that was huge for us, that run at the end of the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Tim Welsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14050)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH WELSH: Well, I told our guys that it's a tough way to lose, because we
fought, we challenged. We stuck to our game plan as good as any night we've
played this year. The shots didn't go down at times, but we battled, scrapped,
clawed, loose balls, rebounded. We knew their zone offense. I thought we got
to their shooters when we needed to. Obviously, Alexander's a tremendous
player and he shot over us a few times, which he's going to do.  
But end of the game it comes down to a bounce or a made shot or a turnover. At
the end of the game we got them to miss, and they offensive rebounded and put
the ball in. And we drove the ball to the basket a couple of times. We laid it
in, they called a walk.  
You know, first half we tip it in, they call offensive goaltending. Second
half, they tip it in and it's a bucket. So those things went against us today.
In games like, this sometimes it's the breaks. We missed a dunk. We missed
some foul shots when it was crucial. Then down the stretch we looked a little
slow on our cuts. They pushed their defense up on us. We tried to drive to the
hole and make some things happen, and just didn't complete the play. That is
part of the game.  
At the end of the game in a hard-fought game, it is who makes the plays at the
end. We turned it over three, four times in the last four minutes and that was
the key part of the game. I told our guys I was proud of the way they fought.
It is unfortunate that the result is what it was because they were really
focused down the stretch to get to this point.  
We came here to win. We didn't come here just to be happy to be here. That is
a disappointing part that the end of the game went the way it was. But we lost
to a very, very good team who is going to be in the NCAA Tournament. I think
we looked at what we did today and I told our guys we can build on that moving
forward. It hurts right now, obviously, for all of our players in the locker
room.  
  
Q. Your defense kind of upset the rhythm for the most part for the first
half.  
COACH WELSH: Yeah, they averaged 70 points a game in the league, and they got
58. So from that perspective, we did a good job. But obviously, scoring points
is a difficult thing for us at times against certain defenses with some
players playing out of position. But we got the game into the 50s on both
ends, and then it becomes a scratch-and-claw-type game.  
But defensively, I couldn't ask for anything else. They got up on the
offensive glass at a couple of key points of the game. The put-back got them
the lead, and then the tip-in that was on the rim. But other than that I
thought our defense was solid all night long. We let Butler loose in the
corner a couple of times, but other than that, I thought we did a really good
job.  
  
Q. Offensively different from the first half anyways, you just had so many
chances that didn't go, plays at the rim.  
COACH WELSH: Yeah, you talk about the offensive goaltending. You talk about
the lay-ups that we missed. We missed three or four lay-ups. I think Randall
missed a couple, our guards missed a couple. So we're getting good looks. We
got a lot better looks than we did in the last game we played, because we
opened up our offense a little bit. Emphasized going back door. We cut harder,
we played more solid. We still turned it over, though, and that was at some
opportune times. We had a chance to increase the lead, but just couldn't
finish at times where we had some lay-ups. We had one of the best three-on-
twos you've ever seen. We executed. Made some passes, got to the rim, and they
deflected the ball and it goes off our leg. Those type of plays get you at
these type of games because they add up. A bucket here, a bucket there,
basically it was a two-point game tonight.  
  
Q. How disappointing is it to come down here and play how you wanted to
play, as a player anyway, and not come away with the win?  
GEOFF MCDERMOTT: It was very disappointing. We also wanted to win. We played
well, we played our hearts out. Everybody fought, and just like Coach said,
couple things don't go our way, we don't come up with the win.  
So it was real tough coming down here. Making it, and then playing as well as
we can, as hard as we can and just not coming up with it.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Bobby Gonzalez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18121)

### [Brian Laing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18119)

### [Jamar Nutter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18120)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH GONZALEZ: You know, it's tough. We don't believe in moral victories.
Obviously, we came here to win a game. But at the same time you have to be
realistic. We played a hell of a team. Marquette is just a terrific team. I'm
proud of our kids. We gave everything we had. We played them even all the way
to maybe the 6:00 minute mark. If Eugene Harvey's lay-up goes in, we take the
lead. I thought that was a huge momentum and it just rolled out.  
Our game plan was terrific. We went in transition, played the zone. We got
beat on the backboard by 19. Three of our big guys fouled out. We just
couldn't get to the ball quick enough. We did not shoot the ball well. We were
4 for 20 from three. And they held our second-leading scorer in the Big East
Conference, he was at 19. He was 15 below his average, and lot of credit has
to go to Marquette.  
We just couldn't get over the hump. We played them even and even outplayed
them within parts of the game. When it got down to five minutes you could see
the difference in the depth. They had Maurice Acker come off the bench and
stick a huge trey.  
We just didn't have enough bodies. In some ways it was good the game ended
because I wanted to give Brian a standing ovation with a minute to go, and we
had nobody else to put in.  
I'm proud of our kids. I thought we did two things tonight: We bounced back
from the way we ended the season, and hopefully we showed the NIT Committee
we're a quality team and we maybe deserve a good look.  
  
Q. How tough was it for you to get any kind of good looks out there?  
BRIAN LAING: They played very aggressive on defense and did a lot of switching
and just made it hard for me to get any open looks.  
  
Q. After the last game, you sounded very discouraged about your chance of
getting into the NIT. Do you feel like this performance will get you in
there?  
COACH GONZALEZ: Here's what I think: I think our league is so special, and 7
or 8 teams can get into the NCAA Tournament. Let's say they take 8 teams and
Syracuse goes to the NIT, the only team left with a winning record over .500
in the Big East Conference left is us at 17-15, and we beat Providence and
Cincinnati who are behind us. We beat Virginia, we beat Louisville. You know,
we battled Marquette. We got here to the Garden. We were picked 13th. We
weren't supposed to be here. We represent the metropolitan area, which I think
is important.  
And Eugene Harvey put on a pretty special performance. I know everybody's been
sort of down on him, kind of killing the kid. And he came back and was a big-
time point guard tonight. So I thought we rose from the ashes. I thought that
made a statement about this team. I'm no expert, but we did go to two NCAA's
and two NIT's in Manhattan. I believe if we can get to the NIT our second
year, it would be a huge compliment. I think these two seniors deserve to play
again. So whoever is out there making the decision, I hope they give us a
chance.  
  
Q. It looked like at the end the line kind of exchanged words, maybe
something was exchanged. Was anything going there?  
JAMAR NUTTER: No, I mean, I guess like the other two games that Marquette --
that wasn't a foul to hurt him (Dominic James). And the game at home, I might
have took a shot at them. But I didn't mean it in that way; I was just trying
to get myself open.  
But, no, at the end of the game, he didn't want to shake my hand. So I just
kept walking, and I just said it's fine with me.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the fact that your big guys fouled out, they've shown many
times throughout the season some signs that in a couple of years they're going
to be really good.  
COACH GONZALEZ: They showed great promise tonight. They used 15 fouls they
were physical. I thought Augustin Okosun had his best game of the year. I
thought Mike Davis got shot out of a cannon. John Garcia was struggling, he
gave us what he had. We threw Brandon Walters in there. The freshman hadn't
played for four or five games. I thought everybody gave from the bottom of
their heart. The Garden rose a couple of times. They were fighting for the
underdog, and we were right there. We were down one. We just needed something
big to happen. We went 4 for 20 from three. For us to beat a great team like
Marquette, we needed some threes. We just needed some magic. But our big
people really stepped up tonight and showed us some stuff. So I was proud of
them.  
  
Q. You mentioned that if you make the NIT, it would be a nice step for your
program. Talk about where your program is two years in.  
COACH GONZALEZ: Last year we got picked 15th and we ended up 13th. This year
we got pick 13th and ended up 11th. So we feel you've got to crawl before you
can walk. It's progress. 14 wins last year, 17 this year. Last year we didn't
win a road game, this year we won three of them. We got to 17 wins, it's not
easy. We're one of ten teams to have 17 wins or more. We put Brian Laing in
the First Team All League for the second year in a row. So I feel like we're
heading in the right direction.  
We had three sellouts at the end of the year. We need a few more players, to
be honest, to compete with the upper echelon of the league. A couple guys out
there are potential pros. We need a few more, one or two great players and
we're not far away.  
  
Q. Have you spoken to the commissioner? Is there anything going on between
you and he? Do you expect anything?  
COACH GONZALEZ: About what?  
  
Q. About his comments on Tuesday night, last night?  
COACH GONZALEZ: I don't know anything about it.  
  
Q. So you haven't spoken to him about the end of the game on Sunday?  
COACH GONZALEZ: No. We played Marquette tonight. Regular season is over. We
came here to be in the Big East Tournament, so I'm not sure what you're
referring to.  
  
Q. You're not aware that he at the news conference to announce the awards
admonished you on Friday?  
COACH GONZALEZ: No, no, not aware of it. I have no comment. I'm proud of our
kids and how we played against Marquette tonight. I'm not concerned about
anything else. I thought we carried ourselves with class this year and battled
hard. Had a good year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Deonta Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18115)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH CRONIN: Well, we've played Pitt three times. Three extremely physical
battles, hard-fought games. We were on the short end of the stick tonight. Our
guys fought, they competed, they never gave up, so I'm extremely proud of
their effort. Didn't catch a lot of breaks in the game. So that was
unfortunate. And Marvin Gentry's injury, it really left us shorthanded on the
perimeter. I thought our guys got a little bit tired and that affected our
defense.  
But you've got to give Pitt credit. They're a great team. They've been to six
of the last seven Big East finals, conference tournament finals. That speaks
to what kind of program Jamie's helped build and continued over a long period
of time. He's a great coach, and they have a great program. You have to give
them a tremendous amount of credit. We don't have a guy that's ever been in
Madison Square Garden, let alone play in a Big East Tournament game. So I'm
proud we're back here. Proud of the effort we put forth tonight. Time to go
back and get ready to fight hard to get back here next year.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Rashad Bishop's performance tonight, this
season, and what you expect from him next year.  
COACH CRONIN: I thought he played harder tonight than he's played in a long
time. The biggest challenge for Rashad is to play as hard as you need to play
at this level. That is a challenge for most freshmen, to be consistent with
your effort. I thought he was more physical tonight than he had been. He's
capable of being a 6, 7, 8-rebound-a-game guy at the small forward, which is
what I'm looking for. I was really proud of the way he competed physically
tonight. If he plays like that, he's going to be a great player for us. It's
all about consistent effort for him.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Deonta's effort tonight and the scoring burden
you have to put on him.  
COACH CRONIN: I've been asking him to do too much since I signed him. But I
guess if you're going to ask a guy do too much, he'd rather ask me to have him
score than play too much defense.  
It's been a tough road for him and for all our guys. And the rebuilding of our
program, there is a lot of excitement around our program with knowing that
we're going to add Mike Williams this year. I think it was a shell shock to us
early, his injury. And it shifted the majority of the scoring burden right
back on to Deonta's shoulders. But he stepped to the plate. Guy's got 30
points, six assists, played 39 minutes. I don't know what else I can ask him
to do except drive the bus, and I've seen him drive, so I'm not going to ask
him to do that.  
  
Q. Jamie Dixon said that his team's playing the best basketball right now
that they've played all season. How would you compare how they played today
versus the other two times?  
COACH CRONIN: I think Levance looks better. He looks healthier. Tyrell Biggs
is making shots from the perimeter. So when they sub him in there, they don't
lose a lot. I think that's probably the best he's been playing. Levance looks
better. It's all about personnel. They've got guys playing a little bit better
than they have played. Obviously, Sam Young is a tremendous player. I don't
know how he wasn't a unanimous All Big East player. I'd like to know who
didn't vote for him. The guy's done an unbelievable job improving his game.
You've got to give Jamie a lot of credit for that.  
But they've shown tremendous perseverance as a group after all they've been
through. It's a credit to their coach and to their kids.  
  
Q. How did you think you got your spot after what happened Sunday night?  
COACH CRONIN: Regular season was over. We fought hard to get to the Big East
Tournament. That's the bottom line. We went 8-10 in this league with
absolutely nobody that had been recruited for more than two or three months.
These guys banded together and they got us here. That's all we were focused
on. So now that we're here, we wanted to make sure we showed what Cincinnati
basketball was all about, fight hard, compete, never give up. Anybody who is
in the arena tonight saw that. And I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Deonta, maybe you had no choice now that coach put this burden on you,
but you are you the kind of guy that really wants that responsibility?  
DEONTA VAUGHN: You know, it's been a lot on my shoulders my whole life growing
up playing. Being the go-to guy for every school I went to and played with.
And I was the go-to guy last year. There was a lot on my shoulders. Like he
said, with the injury of Mike Williams it put a lot back on my shoulders. And
with John Williamson getting in early foul trouble, he couldn't be too
effective like he was last game. I had to take advantage of my opportunity and
try to make things happen. I try to do a lot for the team this year, previous
to this game to help my seniors out so they can continue their college career.
We just came up short. I just gave a lot of effort and hope my team loved my
effort tonight and everybody else.  
  
Q. You guys held DeJuan Blair to one field goal attempt, all numbers way
below his average. What are you doing to throw him off?  
COACH CRONIN: He only played 24 minutes and we pretty much trapped him,
double-teamed him every time he got the ball. So we didn't feel we could play
him one-on-one. The first time we played him, the traps worked. We did a bad
job trapping him in the second game. Also, he had six offensive rebounds in
the second game at Pitt. Really, it won the game. If we could have blocked him
out at Pitt, we would have won. We couldn't keep him off the glass.  
So he's a freshman, having seen him and having seen the smile on his face, I
don't expect he'll get too down. I think everybody in our league would love to
have him on their team. I think you'll see a different effort from him. But we
trapped him.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Lazar Hayward](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18122)

### [Jerel McNeal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18123)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening comments.  
COACH CREAN: I haven't had a chance to look at the stat sheet in depth yet,
but we knew in this game we were going to get their best shot, which we felt
we did. We were going to get a very hungry and spirited team, which we did.  
I think he (Bobby Gonzalez) did an outstanding job of recovering from a tough
game the other day with Rutgers to have his team absolutely ready to play.
They had a great game plan. It took us a little bit to settle into it. But I'd
say the last ten to eight minutes of the first half we started to figure out
exactly what it was going to take to win the game. We got in the bonus early
which helped us, and we knew we had to attack and get to the rim.  
It was an incredible experience for our players to see just how challenging
this month is. We're proud of the way that we played in the second half. I
thought our guys showed incredible maturity. They continued to understand how
aggressive the game was and we continued to be in attack mode. The number one
key for us defensively was our ability to get back in transition, we settled
in and got better at that. And the number one key overall for the entire game
was our ability to rebound the ball, and we definitely did a fantastic job of
that. We don't have a lot of size, so we have to have a lot of heart and fight
to rebound the ball, and we did do that. And these two to my left did an
outstanding job.  
Everybody that came in brought us something, and we'll build on it and get
ready to play Notre Dame team tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Jerel McNeal and Lazar Hayward.  
  
Q. Jerel continues to fill the stat sheet, how important is he for this
team?  
COACH CREAN: I think it goes without saying how important he is. It feels
great to be sitting in here with him in his uniform and being able to play the
game. Because last year with his injury he didn't get a chance to be in this
tournament. But Jerel has done great things for this team from the first day
he played the game at Marquette, and he will continue to. He's not only one of
the best players in the conference, but I think he's one of the best players
in the country, and I think it's because he plays both ends of the floor with
an absolute vengeance, and I think that's what separates him.  
And Lazar Hayward came tonight and in the second half they both played very
similar in the way they were aggressive, attacking the rim, rebounding the
ball, challenging, you know, Seton Hall defensively, and I'm proud of the way
they played. Certainly not only them, their teammates did a great job with
them as well.  
  
Q. Jerel, can you talk about what it's like being here this year and maybe
how motivated you are from being injured last year?  
JEREL McNEAL: Yeah, it's a good feeling just being out here, being able to get
out there on the court with my teammates and actually be playing this year. It
was a tough time last year just going through the whole injury thing. You
know, having to sit there and try to coach from the sidelines and motivate my
team more, trying to help them win games. But it was a good feeling to be able
to be out on the court with these guys and be able to make things happen and
get after it and try to win a Big East Championship.  
  
Q. You're so known for your defense, but it seems like more and more you've
been able to supply offense. Can you talk about working on that and what
you're trying to bring on that side.  
JEREL McNEAL: I mean, with the type of team that we have, it's just offense
where everybody shares the ball. You know, there are going to be the nights
where you're going to be the guy that gets open shots and open looks, and
you're going to be the guy that can make plays. Tonight was one of those
nights. I was getting open looks. But all the credit goes to my teammates,
because without these guys and the way Coach coaches us and teaches us to move
the basketball and play unselfish and play together, none of us would be able
to just come out and play one-on-one and have great nights.  
  
Q. You had two very different games against Notre Dame. Can you talk about
what you take from those two games?  
COACH CREAN: I think both teams have a familiarity with each other. They'll
have an understanding of us, and we'll have an understanding of them. They've
just continued to improve as the year's gone on; we think we have as well. We
understand that the first game we played was their first true road game that
they had played, and they certainly recovered from that and played outstanding
during the season.  
In the game down there it was a great turning point for us. It was one of
those defining periods for us to leave the game with. Even though we didn't
win the game, we never had a situation inside the game where we didn't feel we
could win. Even down double figures, we felt like we could come back and play.
We just fell a little bit short. It was a one-possession game at the end.  
So we feel like we have an understanding, like I said. We're excited about the
match-up, but at the same time we understand how good they are.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to go into a game like this, and kind of grind it
out, to Notre Dame, even though it's a fight or you're out of it?  
COACH CREAN: I think again, you can't win this time of year -- if we allow
them to come out and score 80, 85 points, we're not going to win. It can't be
that type of game. At the same time, we're not going to back off from playing
either. We want to get up and down the court. But they're a much better
defensive team than they get credit for sometimes. They score a lot of points
and they've got some guys that score those points and do it in a very exciting
way. But at the same time they've really improved defensively as the year has
gone on.  
We don't know what the game will be like. We just know whatever it is, we have
to be able to get inside of it, adjust to it, and try to do our best with it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first time you played Seton Hall, you struggled
offensively as well. What do they do that make it's so hard for you? And can
you talk about you held them scoreless the last five minutes of the last ten
possessions, did you do anything different at the end of the game?  
COACH CREAN: In answer to your second question, we went a little smaller in
the end with the foul situations, which allowed us to switch a little bit
more. But I thought our guys locked into understanding what they wanted to do.
A couple times Eugene Harvey split us in the pick-and-roll or refused the
pick-and-roll. Those are two of his great strengths as a guard. We missed some
shots that we make, you know. But we have not won because we've shot the ball
at an incredible rate all year long. We had the maturity to keep really
playing at a high level defensively and on the backboards, even though we
weren't scoring at a high rate and shooting the ball great. But I would say
they have a lot to do with that. They have very good athletes.  
Again, not only are they athletic, they're very good basketball players.
They're long, certainly Brian Laing has always created a match-up problem for
people in this league. You put him at the 4, he does great things. He can come
down and guard. They've had a very good year. I know they've lost a couple
games as of late, but they've had a very good year with good players, and I
hope their season continues from this. I'd be shocked if it didn't.  
  
Q. You mentioned just before that you don't have great size, so you have to
have great heart. Having said that, you've had more offensive rebounds than
they had defensive rebounds. Surprise you, shock you, impress you?  
COACH CREAN: Well, it's something to build on. That's a unique statistic. I
thought our guys again had an incredible hunger to get to the backboards. In
this time of year, you've got to bring everything that you have, and you've
got to take it up another notch. So whoever we have on the floor has got to be
a participant in creating extra possessions for us. Whether it's offensive
rebounding, loose balls, whether it's deflections, whatever it is, we've got
to be in position to do that. I thought our guys did that. To outrebound them
that way is a statement to the way they played. The way they played on the
backboards and the tenacity they played with throughout the game.  
  
Q. Lazar, kind of another double-double for you. How does this speak to the
team, to your own play going down the stretch?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I think it's just with some of the same things that Jerel said,
you know. It's just a reflection of how we play. And this whole team we have a
bunch of guys that always wants to win. And you know, we have a bunch of
hungry players. When things like that happen it's just because we're so hungry
and we're so eager to win.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought defensively we did a good job until the end of the
first half, and we gave them a couple of baskets that changed the momentum a
little bit. But the second half we just didn't do a good job reacting to where
Stokes and to where Reynolds were. And they got wide open looks and they're
going to make those.  
We got some good looks on offense. We missed some shots around the basket
area. And you really just can't do that. We have to score points to where
we're not going to stop anybody the whole game. I just thought offensively we
made some bad turnovers, and some of that is certainly Villanova's a very good
defensive team. But the open looks from the three-point line really were I
thought the difference in the game today.  
  
Q. How disappointing is this knowing that you probably needed to win to get
to the Big Dance?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We needed to win a lot of games. After last year we probably
needed to win two or three games probably compared to even get close to where
we were last year. But that wasn't the thought.  
We knew we needed to win. After the Pittsburgh game, we knew we had to win at
Seton Hall, we knew we had to beat Marquette. We certainly knew that we needed
to keep winning. I don't think one win would have been enough by any stretch
of the imagination. So we just couldn't quite get the job done.  
I'm proud of these guys, and I said this after the last game, we played with
seven guys. They battled hard. I think that there's a certain level of energy
that when you play as many games as we have, as many minutes as our guys have
played, particularly Jonny and Paul at the guards spot they've given a lot,
and I don't know if they have enough energy to play as hard as you have to
play back-to-back and in these circumstances.  
I've been extremely impressed with what Jonny, in particularly, has been out
there a lot of minutes in the last ten games. And this is, obviously, a very
difficult conference to play those kind of minutes. I think it wears on you,
you know, I think that that's certainly been a factor in some of the mistakes
that we do make late in games. I think guys get tired. When you can't rest
somebody, that's very difficult to ask. Particularly guys that are coming from
high school, playing high school last year, now we're asking them to play 40
minutes and be the guys that carry the team. I think that's an awful lot to
ask of young guys.  
I look at what Connecticut struggled with last year. They had a couple of
upper-classmen as well. And it's just a struggle in this league with young
players. We had no upper-classmen. We had two sophomores, Paul and Arinze, who
did not play last year, and Paul played 15 minutes or 17 or 18 minutes a game.  
And I think what these guys have accomplished, I'm pretty proud of what
they've done in this league this year. I think the league is tougher this
year. I think it's a lot tougher. We've had to play pretty shorthanded. And I
think they've come through it better than I might have thought at one point in
time.  
  
Q. Just to continue your thought about how tough this conference is, did you
see this coming when the conference started to get bigger? How much harder it
would be for you to compete?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, it was always hard. I don't see any difference. It's just
there's more teams, but it's no different in terms of heart. I mean, when we
had nine teams, we had six go to the tournament. And you played those six
teams, you played five of those teams if you were one of the six twice. So I
don't think it's any harder. It's just hard. But I don't think it's gotten any
harder at all. It's always been hard since the very beginning. Some teams had
to catch up. Connecticut or Seton Hall, took them a couple of years to catch
up, so there might have been a couple two, three, four years there it was a
little bit less balanced. But once those teams caught up, you know, you had
six teams. Five or six out of nine going to the tournament. The other two
teams going to the NIT. It's always been hard. I don't see it any harder now,
it is hard.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, you were competing against five teams back then. Now
you're competing against a cast of thousands?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, I think the difference is when there's nine teams, if you
have a couple of teams that struggle a little bit, six teams can win
20-something games. With 16 teams we've got seven teams that won 20 games this
year. I think that's a lot. That shows how strong the league is. But that's
still less than half. Whereas before, two-thirds of the teams were winning, or
more than half, anyway, were winning over 20 games and getting to the
tournament.  
So I think in the 18 games you're going to get a couple more losses. But it's
really no tougher, it's just there's more teams.  
  
Q. You just mentioned about how young this team is, and how proud you are of
what they've come through. With the NCAA Tournament being the publicity
monster that it is, how do you get these guys to appreciate what the NIT is?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Everything is the NCAA. In my mind and their mind it's if
they're not in the NCAA Tournament, it's not a good year, period. That's just
the way it is. I think the bottom line is that's what kids should want to do,
and that's what their goal should be, and that's all they should think about.
I've talked to them a little bit in the locker room today about the
opportunity that we'll have to play in a tournament, play in the NIT, whatever
it is, that that can be good for us.  
We've learned a lot. I think this team has gotten better. We played extremely
well against Marquette, and we played extremely well against Pittsburgh, two
of the good teams in our league in the last two weeks. And we have to use
whatever is ahead of us as an opportunity to get better.  
I expect them to be disappointed. I'm disappointed. But I think you've got to
step back and be realistic in terms of what has happened this year and what
we've done. Last year we won 21 games. We had the 55th best schedule in the
country, which isn't terrible. But this year our schedule is 7 or 8. We've
come close to winning. Came close to winning 20 games with this schedule. So
our schedule has been much tougher, and these guys have hung in there.  
  
Q. Talk about how the experiences of this year having to play so many
minutes, how has it helped your development as basketball players and what
have you taken out of it?  
PAUL HARRIS: Well, you know, last year I came in playing like 17 minutes a
game. I was at the 4 spot. Now this year Coach asked me to play the guard spot
because of the injuries to Andy Rautins and Eric Devendorf. It kind of was a
tough adjustment playing 39 minutes, sometimes 40. But I mean, you just do
whatever you can for the team.  
ARINZE ONUAKU: Coming off last year I didn't play at all, so this is really
like my first go around. I mean, you just use every game to try to learn. I
mean, playing every minute, you've got to know when you can conserve your
energy and you've got to go hard. And each game you go out there and you just
try to win every one.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, what will you do on Selection Sunday? Will you
bother watching or just stay away?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Well, even if we had won, I still wasn't going to watch it
because of what happened last year. I watched it, and I thought we were going
to be in. So I told myself no matter what, I'm not going to watch it
regardless.  
ARINZE ONUAKU: I'm on the same schedule as him. Same as him.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COACH DIXON: Well, that's a team that we've battled three times now and came
away with this one; the second one for us. So we knew what we were getting
into. It was going to be a physical game. Two tough competitive teams, and
senior-dominated team.  
I'm just glad that we're not going to have to play against Vaughn here this
week anyway. So he had a big game against us last game. He had 30 again
tonight. I tell you, I thought we did a pretty good job for the most part.  
He did go away for 25, so we did make him take some shots. But again, he hit
some of those at the end that I was hoping he would be a little more
comfortable going into the last minute or two. But that's what he does and
he's a great player.  
We got great performances from a number of guys. I think Tyrell Biggs was big
for us in the end. We had to do some things with Vaughn, we were concerned
about what he was doing. He allowed us to play a little smaller, little more
versatile. And it helped us defensively.  
But Levance ran the show. Did a great job by getting guys shots. And Keith,
there were two seniors, Keith and Ronald, two seniors from New York, played
big tonight and knocked down shots and made plays.  
So again, we talked about win the battle of the boards; we got outrebounded by
one. That's a challenge with that team, they're a very good rebounding team,
Cincinnati. And we've got today a better job rebounding. We held them to 38%
from the field, and our defense is getting better.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Keith Benjamin and Ronald Ramon.  
  
Q. Speaking of defense, can you talk about how Sam asserted himself in those
last three minutes with those blocks.  
COACH DIXON: That was key. We did some things differently. Adjusted to what
they were doing. We wanted Vaughn to dribble rather than shoot, make him put
it on the floor. Sam became the help guy, and it did change some shots as
Vaughn was not able to shoot the three. Really had to lower his shoulder, get
in the lane and in some traffic which enabled Sam to help out and get some
blocks there or change some shots, anyways. That was key, but I thought we
defended pretty well.  
If we could have knocked down -- we missed some free throws we normally don't
miss, and that would have made the margin a little bit more. But that's a very
good team who, again, started out a little slow this year. Got their guys
back, got healthy, had their point guard out. Once they got in the league,
they were as tough a team to play as anybody in the conference. And that is a
very good team who we beat. Proud of our guys how we played.  
Again, as I told our guys, we're playing our best basketball right now. We've
won four of our last five. We've got our guys healthy. We've got Levance
practicing. We're able to practice and do things we haven't done since
December in this last week. So we've put ourselves in a position where we're
playing our best basketball here now in March. And that's a good feeling right
now. We're coming along.  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Sam Young.  
  
Q. Ronald, you were chasing Vaughn, going around the whole first half, doing
really well on him. Then you look up and he's got 30 points. What can you say
about him?  
RONALD RAMON: First, he's a great player. We tried to stop him in the first
half, he did a great job coming off the screens. Making sure the team defense
was there. And in the second half he was just coming down trying to drive to
the basket and using the ball screen pretty well. He was using the ball
screen, coming to the same side and he was getting wide open shots.  
We adjusted, we switched every ball screen. Then Sam and Tyrell and everybody
did a good job guarding him. He still shot, you know, a low percentage, so
that's what we wanted him to do. At the same time, he did have 30 points. He's
a great player. So he found ways to score.  
  
Q. Sam, did you think this game would come down to your defense?  
SAM YOUNG: I think every game's going to come down to my defense and the
team's defense. I knew as of late one of the guards said something about we
don't block as many shots as we did in the past. I figured not just this game,
but past games I tried to block as many shots as I can. And the opportunity
presented itself today. And Ron is kind of a short guard coming into the
paint, and I was able to get a lot of shot blocks off of him.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys get asked this a lot, but there is a common theme of how
well you guys do in this tournament. And tonight's more of the same. Could you
put that into your own words what is it about the Big East Tournament that
seems to bring out the best in Pitt?  
SAM YOUNG: This is like our home away from home. We've got a lot of New York
guys on the team. Their family comes out and supports. And they feel like
they're home every time we step in the Garden.  
For me, I mean, pretty much I feed off their energy. They get hyped when they
play here, and they start -- I just feed off their energy, basically.  
  
Q. Have you noticed any fatigue in DeJuan Blair?  
COACH DIXON: No. I've been asked that question. They've double-teamed him. He
hasn't done great against Cincinnati because of that foul trouble; he got in
some foul trouble, too. Then they read him, they double-teamed the post. They
didn't handle it great. But we got some other things out of it.  
So he's playing very well. And he will have a big game, I'm sure, tomorrow.
It's all about adjustments, foul trouble is a big key for him. But I thought
he did some very good things. He got six rebounds and less minutes than he
normally plays.  
We figured his scoring would be down a little bit because of how they play.
They double-team in the post consistently, and that's the guy we're throwing
to in the post.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the emergence of Keith has meant to the team.  
COACH DIXON: It says a lot about him as far as his work ethic. His coming into
this season. He really wanted to have a great senior year. He worked very hard
on the drills in the off-season, and worked in our preseason practices. Even
before the injuries to Mike and Levance I was saying that he deserved to have
more minutes because he was playing so well.  
But right now he's taking very good shots. He's knocking down shots and he's
making good decisions. And that's what we need out of him. We just need him to
play bigger defensively for us because we've got the three guards out there,
but that's the challenge that we face.  
You know, he stuck with it. But he's been a big contributor for us for years.
A lot of guys' minutes are up this year because of our numbers. But he's been
a big part of our program and the success we've had for the four years even
prior to this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about any extra motivation in your last tournament here?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: It's definitely extra motivation. We sit up and we talk every
day that we just don't want to go out like everybody else. We've been to the
championship game a lot, me and Ron have seen it twice. Sam's seen it twice. A
lot of people on this team have been in this game the last two years. We
listened to Brandin, who is our director of operations now. He talks about how
it took him three times and all that stuff. So the expectations are there. The
emotion is very high. We just want to go out with a bang. We come in here to
play basketball and play great basketball in front of family and friends, like
we always do and just play hard. As long as we keep playing hard and stay
together, we'll keep repeating what we do.  
  
Q. Any of the players can talk about what you expect from Louisville
tomorrow and maybe what you can do better. Your last game was a close game,
but any keys to that game?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: For us, it's just the same thing. We're going to come out and
play hard. Last game was a fight inside of our building. Now we're at a
neutral court. We can rebound the ball better than what we did last game. We
can play tougher defense than what we did last game. We gave them a couple of
easy looks last game.  
So we're going to look to do the same things we did tonight; hold the numbers
down, field goal shooting percentage, get better on the boards, look to
outrebound the team. Usually when we do those things we get wins. That's what
we're going to come out to do tomorrow. Play tough defense. Control the ball,
because we know they press, and keep the turnovers down and rebound the
basketball, and hope everything swings our way.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Joe Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18103)

### [Da'Sean Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17188)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Q. Talk a little about your first time coaching in this tournament, and your
general impression.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, looking from the outside in before, you knew that it was
such a class tournament, and class operation. And after last night's
festivities and then coming in today, a lot of conference tournaments when
you're playing at noon and 2:00 o'clock on the first day, there isn't anybody
there. This is the way things are supposed to be done. Mike (Tranghese) and
his staff do an incredible job.  
  
Q. Their zone and their switches really confused your offense.  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah, they did a really good job. But, you know, we made some
shots early. We had all kinds of opportunities early and couldn't make a shot.
That zone gets a whole lot better when you don't make perimeter shots.  
The team did a great job. Did a great job with the defense, and, you know,
they followed some guys through, didn't follow some other guys through. But
you look back at the beginning, we had all kinds of opportunities. Alex had
shots that he normally makes. I think he was 0 for 6 to start the game.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, could you talk about what kind of things were running through
your mind in the final minutes of the game. You had a lot of tough rebounds
down the stretch.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Basically I was just trying to get inside, get rebounds, help
my team the best way I could. It was a very close game, and they were playing
very hard. I just tried to do what my team needed me to do. Whatever we were
lacking at the time I just tried to do. If it was defense or if it was
rebounding or just making the extra pass. Just anything to help. That's all I
was pretty much thinking about.  
  
Q. You really enjoyed the last few seconds of the game, it seemed like.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Exactly, time ran off the clock, and knowing we were up and we
had everything under control was a good feeling. Especially we won our first
game here in the tournament.  
I was just very excited.  
  
Q. What adjustments do you have to make for tomorrow's game against UCONN?  
COACH HUGGINS: They're good, and they're playing at a high level right now.
We're going to go back and look at tapes since we've played them, and see if
they've changed anything or made any adjustments. We played pretty well,
actually, the first half there. We'd go in the locker room down 16 or 17 and
came out second half and played a whole lot better. Actually kind of got back
in the game. But we have to go look at tape and see.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defense the whole night, but especially in the
last five minutes, they had one field goal down the stretch.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we work so hard at it. You know, we were just trying to
tell our guys we've worked this hard, let's just go get it stopped. Let's go
do what we're supposed to do. I thought we made them take hard shots. They did
a great job controlling tempo.  
But at the end, we were just going to switch ball screens and not switch
anything else, and kind of try to stay with our man and guard.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of trouble does McDermott playing the point give you?
And it looked like you were trying to keep the ball out of his hands.  
COACH HUGGINS: No, we were just trying to make him run more clock after we got
ahead. You know, it's hard when your power forward plays point. But we're
fortunate because of this guy. You know, he can go out on the floor and guard.
And Wellington can go out on the floor and guard. And Da had him some, and he
can go on the floor and guard. I don't know if it affects us as much as it
would affect other people, because we have guys very similar to what Geoff is.  
  
Q. Seems like lately with your scoring output you're garnering a lot more
attention from the opposition. You were able to hit a lot of high-lows. Do you
think that will continue the rest of the season, the high-lows?  
JOE ALEXANDER: Yeah, I think the high-lows will continue. It's a pretty easy
shot for me. Even with more focus from the opposition. You know, on them
guarding me on that shot, it's still easy for me to hit.  
  
Q. You're able to dump it down, too, right?  
JOE ALEXANDER: Yeah, that's one of the things. When my teammates know their
man is coming over to help out on that, they make the adjustments and get
open.  
  
Q. Last time you played UCONN they couldn't handle you and everything, was
that because you guys were running such a good offense, got the shots you
wanted or did you just have a great night?  
JOE ALEXANDER: I think it's a little bit of both. Obviously, our offense gave
them trouble, and, obviously, I was shooting well that night.  
  
Q. Looked like they didn't have a defensive answer for you.  
JOE ALEXANDER: Yeah, I don't know (smiling).  
  
Q. You felt all along you were an NCAA Tournament team. You follow the
losses with some of these other conferences, does this eliminate any doubt
that you're not in your mind?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know how any team that wins 11 games in this league is
not an NCAA Tournament team. If you're taking the best teams -- and I told Raf
and Jay when they were in Morgantown for the Pitt game -- I was a mid-major
coach. I was at Akron for five years and I know how hard it is. I know how
hard those people work at it. But the reality is if it's the 34 best teams,
put them in our league and see how many they win.  
This has got to be as hard a league as there is in the country. What makes it
even harder is having 16 teams. So you prepare for 15 different styles of play
throughout the season. There aren't any days off in this league. I think
that's the difference. The difference is in a lot of those other leagues, you
cannot come to play some days and because you're a little bit better, you can
win. It's very, very difficult to do that in this league.  
  
Q. For tomorrow, are you going to look to increase the rebounding effort
tomorrow?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Definitely. They're a very good rebounding team. We went
there, and the end of the first half they were leading us in rebounds by about
ten. We know how good a rebounding team they are. We're a very good rebounding
team as well. Honestly, it's a matter of who wants it more. We've got to try
to outwork them as we go to play.  
  
Q. Considering the challenges you faced when you took over this team at the
beginning of the year, how pleased are you to be in a position, like you said,
11 Big East wins? A pretty sure shot at the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH HUGGINS: I'm not sure I had any challenges to be honest with you.
They've been terrific. They're great to coach. They were, I think, very eager
to play more man-to-man. I think they were excited about having a little bit
more. We run an open post deal that there is a lot of freedom in, and I think
they enjoyed that.  
I guess I'm one of those guys where it's half empty instead of half full. I
look back at the Pitt loss, I look back at the Oklahoma loss, I look back at
the Georgetown loss, I look back at the Tennessee loss and say what if? I
mean, all of a sudden now we're 26 wins and we're probably ranked in the Top
10, well, we are ranked in the Top 10 in the country even if we win half of
those, two of those four.  
But we're learning. People don't realize how young this team is. I think
everybody sees Darris has been around forever, and takes care of the ball and
doesn't throw it away. But the rest of these guys are young. Da'Sean is a
veteran for us; he's a sophomore. Joe didn't play at all as a freshman, and,
you know, played limited minutes at the end of last year. So I think we're
getting better and better and better because these guys are getting playing
time and they're getting experience. Our roster is full of freshman and
sophomores. We have two seniors and two juniors.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, Coach, we'll just ask for a couple of quick comments and
take questions for the three players then we'll finish up with questions for
yourself.  
COACH WEBER: First, I just feel good about our kids and obviously we wish it
would have been a more successful season. But they continued to battle and
didn't quit. And even throughout today, it's a tough thing to go through four
games. But they gave it their all and we finally figured it out at the end. As
I said yesterday, better late than never.  
Gotta give Wisconsin a lot of credit. Just reminds me a little bit of our
'04-'05 team, just such a good team. They just are balanced. They have so many
different weapons. They understand each other. They play off of each other.
And I just wish them the best to win the Big Ten and come back and win the
tournament. To me it's pretty impressive.  
Bo's done a great job. I think our kids have given a great effort the entire
weekend. I don't know if -- they could probably tell you if fatigue set in.
I'm sure it's a little bit of a factor. I think more than anything, we went
and faced a very tough team.  
Our seniors, two of them are here. I thought Shaun made All-Tournament. He had
very consistent effort. And Brian played with a lot of courage to come back
after having the injury when a lot of people didn't think he would come back.  
So appreciate -- and Chris Hicks, all those guys. So we're very proud of our
guys. The way we perform at the end is the way we expect to perform.  
And we've been fortunate to get to this tournament championship three times.
And hopefully we can continue that. And I just -- and also our fans stuck with
us all year, through a lot of tough times. And there was a lot of orange here,
and they didn't have to be, especially after the year we had and so many
heart-breaking losses. So I truly appreciate them for hanging in there.  
Hopefully we can get this thing, take this momentum from now into the next
season to have a successful year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. We'll take questions for Shaun, Brian or
Chester.  
  
Q. For all the guys, I know that you were saying that fatigue wasn't an
issue. But it looked like -- were you feeling it in that second half? It
looked like you were.  
BRIAN RANDLE: I mean, I really don't think it did, to be honest. Like Coach
said, we came up against a great team today. And they hit a bunch of tough
shots. Really hit almost every shot they could. And, I mean, we fought to come
back, and it just didn't go our way. So I don't know that it was fatigue. They
just had a great day.  
  
Q. Brian, it looked like you guys on offense really never got much going,
except Calvin gave you a spark and a little bit of stuff in open court, but
didn't look like you were getting into your sets and running a lot of your
stuff early on? Was that your take on it? And can you talk about their defense
and how the matchup went?  
BRIAN RANDLE: They play solid and methodical. They don't do anything flashy
necessarily to wow you. They wear you down and stay consistent. I think we got
a little too hurried at times. And personally I did trying to do too much. And
just that guy's really wanting to help not out of selfishness, just going a
little too fast.  
It's almost like too little too late. We tried to make a punch, and they hit
back.  
  
Q. Brian, I know this is a tough moment for you. Just talk about it a little
bit. Kind of the finality, you guys got close to the NCAA, now it's not there
and this being your last game barring maybe the NIT?  
BRIAN RANDLE: I mean, it's tough. It's not the way I wanted to go out,
obviously. We came in here feeling great. We're on the verge of winning a
championship and making the NCAA and you know obviously that didn't happen.
The season didn't go as expected.  
But at the same time, you know, I'm proud of everybody on the team. I'm
extremely proud of Shaun and Chris for their resilience they showed. Because
as seniors and things not going well, it could have been easy to fall and do
our own thing. But especially Chris kept everybody together. And these young
guys started to buy in late.  
So it's a tough day, but, at the same time, I know the future's bright for
these guys and I'm still proud of everybody, including the coaching staff and
the training staff and everybody.  
  
Q. For the two seniors, could you talk about your overall career here at
Illinois?  
BRIAN RANDLE: Not much to say about mine. It's just been up and down. It's
been tough. It's been rewarding. I've been afforded great opportunities, to
play with some great teams, including this year. Just have a lot of support.  
Now I have a lot of opportunities for the future and I know I'm a part of this
family for life. So in terms of my basketball career, it's been hard-fought,
but I wouldn't change any bit of it.  
SHAUN PRUITT: I would probably say the same thing. This is a great
opportunity. Great opportunity to get an education and play the sports you
love and have fun doing it. So you get some wonderful experiences, get to go
places you've never been before. And just do a lot of, I don't know, a lot of
things that a lot of people don't get the opportunity to do.  
  
Q. Chester, you're back next year. Could you talk a little bit about how you
saw the younger guys come along this year and will this kind of finish carry
over to next year?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: You know, our young guys have been big for us, especially
Demetri. Mike Davis has come in for spurts. Mike Tisdale. The thing -- their
confidence mainly is the biggest thing coming into next year, and now they
understand how hard they have to play each night. And we add a few pieces next
year, and I think we'll be better.  
  
Q. Shaun, when you look back on this game, what will you think about that
maybe you guys could have done differently to make it work?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I think we could have kept our poise a little bit more early.
Like Brian said, I think as a team we tried to do a little too much too soon.
And you can't do that versus Wisconsin. They're so disciplined and systematic
that margin for error is very small; if you make mistakes, they're going to
capitalize on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas. Finish up with Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Coach, going into this game, you know, losing twice to Wisconsin, what
did you feel you guys really needed to do to beat Wisconsin?  
COACH WEBER: I think some of it, you just hope they don't play well, which it
doesn't happen very often. We thought if we could pressure a little bit, and
we did that middle of the first half, we got after them a little bit. They
turned it over a few times. And then we didn't take advantage of those
opportunities.  
Couple -- a missed dunk, blocked dunk, couple of layups, just against them you
have to match their efficiency and their mental toughness and their
discipline. And we thought of Purdue as the one team that's beaten them, they
got after them. We probably don't have that capability because they have a
little more quickness.  
You know, if they're going to shoot like that, it's tough. I'm shocked, to be
honest, it was only 50 percent. I thought it was -- to me it was like they
never missed. So when they shot it, you were surprised. And then to go 9 for
18 from 3, they spread you around, you take some things away and they make 3s.
I think that was kind of our thought.  
You know, limit the stuff in the lane and see if they can beat us from the
perimeter, you think on the third day maybe not have the legs. They stepped up
and made shots.  
  
Q. You talked about their good shooting. You guys did struggle shooting-
wise. But held them to 61 points. In the tournament Purdue scored more points
in the overtime, your guys' overtime win, is that roughly around where you
wanted to see their point totals, was in the low 60s?  
COACH WEBER: Actually, if you're going to beat them, aren't they number one in
the nation I believe defensive and it's like 57, 56, so you gotta hold -- if
you're going to have a chance, you have to hold them around 50, 52 because
you're not going to get many more than that.  
But in the first half we had those opportunities and we just didn't. You know,
it should have been a two-point game. We missed the front end of a bonus. I
know we haven't shot free throws, but if we were going to win, we had to be
very efficient and we weren't.  
  
Q. For a little perspective, the Big Ten regular season and conference
champion's probably not going to be a No. 1 seed. I know that's a little
presumptuous here until 6:00. But that does say something about college
basketball at this point. Does that surprise you?  
COACH WEBER: I think there's a lot of balance throughout the nation. I think
Wisconsin belongs up in the top, whatever, seven, eight teams in the country.  
I think all of our representatives, we're kind of hoping for five. I'm not
sure. Looked like Georgia was going to win. So when we left the locker room.
But I know for sure the four, I know they're all capable of Sweet 16. You get
to the Sweet 16, you get an upset here or there, make a run. Even Ohio State,
we talked about it this morning, with their zone is not easy to go against.
Butler is a very efficient point guard. They have some other talented kids.  
I think we'll surprise some people around the nation. And you know again the
Badgers, if they just keep their poise, they're very solid. They guard you.
And I think unless something changes or they have a real bad shooting night,
which doesn't come very often, they're going to have a nice deep run into the
tournament.  
  
Q. Bruce, Illinois has been to the tournament I think nine years in a row.
Hit the wall today. And now that string is over. Just talk about that. And how
tough it is to do that and sort of the feelings about not getting it to that
next one?  
COACH WEBER: Well, you know, I'm not sure what the longest string in the
country. But it's probably -- it's gotta be up there. And it's disappointing.
You know, we finally figured it out at the end. I think we got some guys to
buy in. Maybe the young kids got better. You know, Demetri made some major
strides.  
But the consistency, I think you saw today, he just didn't -- especially going
against Wisconsin, you can't just be casual, because as soon as you're casual
they get you.  
So if, again, if, coulda, woulda, shoulda, all those things, we should be
sitting there waiting to see where we're going, to be honest. I think our team
was capable of that. It's a shame. But it's what it is. And we have to learn
from that. And hopefully correct it and then make sure we're battling for a
Big Ten title next year and getting back in the post-season.  
  
Q. Obviously one of the tougher seasons you've had for Illinois, what have
you learned this season as a coach from this experience?  
COACH WEBER: You know, I've gotten lots and lots of calls from former players,
Purdue, SIU, just, Coach, you're a good coach, we know, we've been through it,
we've watched you, you've been part of our lives. And a lot of coaching
friends. And the one thing somebody told me, you know, this will make you a
better coach.  
I think it makes you a better coach, a better person. You gotta learn from it.
You know, I think the biggest thing you've got -- when I talk at a clinic, the
first thing I say is you gotta get your kids -- it sounds simple, but they've
got to buy into winning.  
I don't think we did that. I gave them a T-shirt the first day in June when
they came back, a workout T-shirt, and it said "team" on the front and it said
"just buy in" on the back. And it probably took us till about three weeks ago
until I think all of them got on the same page.  
The other thing you gotta get your seniors have to have the best year of their
career. Obviously when Brian came back and played well, he didn't have a great
game today and then Shaun bought in, we were a much better team. Then your
best players, they gotta be, your best players have to be your leaders and
your hardest workers.  
It's probably why we had the struggles we did. So we got -- those are things I
talk about at clinics. I'm going to have to -- we're going to have to adhere
to them and make sure that in the future those are the things that happen.  
  
Q. When you talk about buying in, when Hughes hit that big shot before half
to put them up, quick 10-4 start in the second half, what do you tell your
team in the timeout, we're down to double-digits to a very fine ball club, is
that part of the buying in program?  
COACH WEBER: I think one of the things we've struggled all year is the
leadership. When we hit tough times, and it seems like the last few weeks
we've been able to overcome that. But this game we just couldn't find the
spark. We couldn't get the shot, couldn't get the stop. Hughes' basket was
huge at the end of the half, and them to come out and we don't score and they
score, you know, now the doubt starts setting in.  
I think we can continue to battle. They just made a lot of big shots and a lot
of tough shots. And they're so methodical and they break you mentally. I mean
we talked about that at halftime don't let them break you mentally. You've got
to get them starting to doubt. That's why they're so good. And very, very
efficient team.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate all your time this weekend, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2008

  

### [Brian Butch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18195)

### [Marcus Landry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17068)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Wisconsin head coach Bo Ryan and student
athletes Marcus Landry and Brian Butch.  
Go ahead and take an opening statement from Coach Ryan and then we will do
questions for Marcus and Brian and then we'll finish with questions for Coach
Ryan.  
COACH RYAN: We're very proud to be representing the Big Ten as the Big Ten
tournament champions and regular season champions. Our players have really
done the university proud. And I can't thank them enough for their
accomplishments and hopefully now we can go get some more.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Marcus or Brian.  
  
Q. Marcus and Brian, can you each also address the fact that you maybe
eliminated any possible confusion as far as winning the regular season title
as well as coming here and capturing that tournament crown?  
BRIAN BUTCH: Yeah, I mean, at the beginning of the season you have two goals.
You've got a couple other goals, but as far as Big Ten goes, those are your
first goals: To win the regular season championship and then win the
tournament.  
We did that, and it's a pretty proud thing. We're all very proud of it.  
MARCUS LANDRY: Well, I'm just proud of my teammates and everybody. Like he was
saying, we come into the year with goals and this year we have met most of our
goals, the ones that we have set for this time so far.  
So it's just a great accomplishment.  
  
Q. Marcus, I wanted to ask you about the block that you had of Randle. Can
you take us through that play, the one where it looked like he was trying to
dunk it?  
MARCUS LANDRY: Actually, he ended up getting the ball from me on the pass. And
it was just -- I kind of watched the ball go instead of getting back and
sticking to our rules like we normally do.  
But when I seen that the ball wasn't going back, I tried my hardest to get
back. I'm glad that he kind of hesitated before he went up for a layup,
because he kind of had a wide open layup if he hadn't hesitated.  
So just playing really hard and sticking to some of the things that we have in
front of us. You just get good plays and you make up for your mistakes.  
  
Q. Marcus, was it nice as a team to get back to shooting the ball well?
There was a couple of rough games shooting down here. You guys shot the ball
pretty well today. Is that nice, especially heading into the NCAA
tournament?  
MARCUS LANDRY: It's always nice to have a high shooting percentage. And we go
over a lot of things in practice and things, what percentage are high-
percentage shots and things like that.  
You're going to have droughts sometime where you're not shooting well, but
it's all about what do you do to get back into the rhythm of shooting well.
Pounding the ball in the post and then maybe getting the post, kicking out,
getting better shots and higher percentage shots.  
So it worked out in our favor to get some high-percentage shots after we
started moving the ball some more.  
THE MODERATOR: You're free to head back to the locker room. Thank you.  
We'll finish up with questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Bo, when did you know that Trevon was going to play today and can you
just talk a little bit about his play?  
COACH RYAN: Before the game, because he had to pass the tests, and just
something that's been nicked for a little while, and just good treatment and
him following orders on keeping it up and keeping the stem and the ice and
whatever is done. Henry put him through the tests, and he cleared him to play.  
I never have any say in it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defense throughout the tournament. I think you
held everybody under 42 percent or something like that. Can you just talk
about that and how important it was for you guys to get this championship?  
COACH RYAN: I'm still mad about the 3 they hit at the end of the game. I got
on the guys in the locker room, who left him open?  
Because these guys do take pride in what they do. And it starts not just in
the post, not just on the perimeter, not just -- it's not any one thing, it's
just -- the rules that we have, this team has adhered to this point to the
rules better in the past two and a half months, I think, of probably any team
that I've coached.  
And if we keep doing those things, then we can keep playing. I hope we don't
change.  
  
Q. Historically, when a team wins an outright Big Ten title and the
conference tournament title, they're a No. 1 seed. You're not a No. 1 seed. Do
you feel snubbed in any way? Is that a reflection of the conference, do you
think?  
COACH RYAN: I don't know, I think it starts early and then perception becomes
reality. And I know there was a lot of people that wouldn't want to play a lot
of teams in our league later in the year, but, you know, still I think it's
more about the matchups. I've always felt that. And I know other people feel
that's been the way people have felt about a lot of teams, when they're moved
to this line or that line.  
If you look at the 97,000 different things that the committee's supposed to
keep in mind -- I just found out recently that they don't reach into a hat and
pull the names out when I just did an interview before this. And I don't mean
-- they've got a tough job. How do you put people on different lines,
different places, keeping in mind who you've played in nonconference, who is
in your league, who have you played before, and you look at all those things.
I don't know how they do it. But alls I know is I'm glad we're playing.  
And I think any one of the top two, anywhere between 1 and 4, if you take a
look at those seeds -- I don't even know who the rest of them are -- those are
all pretty good teams. As well as the other group. So it's kind of hard to
differentiate.  
I don't know the rest of the bracketing. How did the other teams -- I saw
Indiana was an 8. What about Michigan State or Purdue?  
  
Q. 5.  
COACH RYAN: Michigan State is 5. Purdue?  
  
Q. 6. Ohio State did not make it.  
COACH RYAN: Ohio State did not make it? Who were the so-called last ones in?
Villanova?  
  
Q. Kentucky.  
COACH RYAN: Kentucky.  
  
Q. I don't know if they were last but -- K State?  
COACH RYAN: K State, Baylor. Arizona State?  
  
Q. Arizona got in.  
COACH RYAN: Arizona got in?  
  
Q. Do you think this is just a cyclical thing with the Big Ten? I mean,
everybody -- we just went through the list and everybody seemed to have a
lower seed than maybe you would expect, given maybe their RPIs and things like
that.  
COACH RYAN: Well, we won the conference in '02, and what were we? I felt we
were a 6. We were tied. Actually, we moved up, I think, in respect, getting
the 2 last year and a 3 this year, because we did have an injury and a lot of
people thought we weren't going to be at 2 last year.  
So, again, they have to look at the 1s, then the 2s and where and the other
factors. I think now, trying to say that there are snubs or anything else is
not valid, simply because there's 20 more rules in how they're placing teams
with the pods.  
It is totally different than before. I look at Tony's team and they're
fighting for a championship until a couple weeks to go in the league and they
ended up with a 4 from a league that has a very high RPI. What did Stanford
end up? A 3? A 2?  
  
Q. A 3.  
COACH RYAN: A 3. So Stanford ends up the same as us. And UCLA. So I just think
that when they made the change to the pods that the seeding became a whole
different ball game.  
  
Q. Coach, two-part question. First, how big is this for game momentum,
winning the tournament, and what do you know on CS Fullerton going in?  
COACH RYAN: I'll see film by the time I go to sleep tonight, because we'll
have it waiting for me when I get back. My son's the video coordinator. He
told me he already has four games of Cal Fullerton, because you project out
and you get as many games on TV and you spend 15-, 16-hour days in the Kohl
Center. That's what our video coordinators have done over the years. So we'll
have film.  
But as far as momentum and anything else, what we wanted, a Friday, Sunday,
it's fun to want. But we do not have school this week, so our legs sometimes
walking on our campus to a class is hiking to some people.  
At least they'll be off their feet and they'll be on their feet when they're
with us and doing the practices. And so I think that washes out the fact that
we're playing Thursday, Saturday. So let's play. Just hope we keep bringing
the same energy and the same focus for the next one.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the game? What do you think turned this
game? Maybe the surge at the end of the half, your consistent shooting,
what?  
COACH RYAN: If you're Illinois, you're going to give your best. As I said
before, when we played Illinois at Illinois, Bruce hasn't forgotten anything
about the game and his players, with Randle being healthy and McCamey scoring
and Meacham and Frazier, how tough he is, that's a tough team.  
And obviously by beating Purdue and Minnesota and who else did they beat?
Can't even remember. And Penn State.  
So they were playing well. And when you know what happens when teams like when
Iowa made that run, when teams are doing things the right way and positive
things are happening, they have players like Pruitt, who has been through it.
I didn't mean to rhyme there. But Pruitt did a pretty good job. He was a
handful for us.  
And you talk about an improved guy in the league. I really like what he's
done. I told him if he ever wants to use me for a reference for any job or
anything down the road, just let me know.  
And Randle, he's had some nicks, but Illinois came to play, and they were
making passes difficult. They were taking away some lanes. I mean, Tom, you've
seen them play before. That was as aggressive as I've seen Illinois all year.
Until the tournament, and they did the same thing to Purdue. So I think we
beat a team that was firing on all cylinders. So I thought for our guys that's
a heck of a W.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Marcus Landry, Outstanding Player of the
tournament, just how he played in the tournament, how he's grown over the
course of the season?  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, I don't know how you pick the Most Outstanding Player, but
he certainly was one of the candidates and was able to get the award. But he'd
be the first one to tell you that what a balanced effort from this team. And
he's hungry. He wants more. And he understands there's some things that we can
get better on both ends of the floor, that we can improve at both ends. And
that's the way he does things.  
So it was really nice to see when guys like Landry and Stiemsma, who struggled
a little bit a couple of years ago, come back and do what they did and be a
part of something really special. Brian Butch goes down last year, gets a
chance to finish the end of the regular season, Big Ten tournament, which he
didn't get a chance to play in last year.  
So as a senior he finishes the regular season. Greg finishes. Big Ten
tournament. The seniors Michael Flowers, Tanner Bronson and just now they get
to play some more. So whatever they add to what they've accomplished, they've
earned it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: As we've done previously, we'll take a couple of opening
comments from Coach Weber, then we'll take questions for the Illinois players
and then finish with questions for Coach Weber.  
COACH WEBER: I mean, it would be an understatement to say we're not excited to
be here in this situation. You know, there's other years we've been fighting
for No. 1 seeds or top four seeds, and we didn't take care of business the way
we should have all season.  
But we kept together. We had some very frustrating losses and could have given
up, to be honest, and we didn't. And now I wish it would have come earlier,
but it didn't. But maybe it's coming at the right time. And you keep battling
and now seems like we're able to win close games.  
We had a game tonight where they tied it up. They seemed to have the momentum,
and we make some big plays, boom, boom, boom. I think Demetri three, run out
by Shaun, run out by Brian, and some big defensive stops.  
So we've learned to win. This is what our program expects, to be at this
position. And I know there's a lot of people that would not anticipate us
being here, but we took care of business this weekend. We deserve to be here.
I think we feel that we can beat anybody. But we're going to have to show it
tomorrow against a very, very good Wisconsin team.  
I thought our bench did a very good job again. We had some inside presence
with Shaun early, threes weren't going. We shoot a little too quick, we had to
calm some guys down a little bit. Good defense throughout the game and then
some big transition baskets when it really counted.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Brian, Demetri or Shaun.  
  
Q. Brian, just talk about being in this game and comparison with your
thoughts three days ago to be here in this Sunday championship game?  
BRIAN RANDLE: I mean, the thoughts haven't changed, to be honest. This is
where we want to be, this is where we expect to be. The regular Big Ten season
didn't go as we had hoped. A lot of down days. But as we have gone along,
we've gained some resilience, gained some toughness and a lot of maturity, I
think, that's shown throughout these past three games.  
And, like I said, this is the position we felt we should have been in during
the Big Ten season. Didn't happen that way, but we've had to turn it around
and done well so far.  
  
Q. Talk about, the three of you, how tired are you? How much different is it
to play three games in three days?  
BRIAN RANDLE: I'm not tired at all. I mean, if you can't get up to play a
championship game, you shouldn't play basketball. Again, it's a game, supposed
to be fun and enjoy yourself. Everybody on our team's been through AU, playing
five, six games and one day in 100-degree gym. I know for me I'm amped as
anybody.  
SHAUN PRUITT: Pretty much what he said, it's a great predicament we've got
ourselves in. We're so excited that the fatigue and injuries, we're just not
thinking about them. We're just thinking that we have a chance to go to the
NCAA tournament, even though we haven't had a great season at all. So it's
just a great opportunity.  
  
Q. Shaun, the last couple of weeks, even less than that your game seemed to
have stepped up a lot. Are you getting the ball more or are you doing anything
different or how do you explain it?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I think I've been eating a little bit better. That's part of my
independent study is nutrition. I've been eating a lot better. I actually
think it's helped me a little bit. So great timing.  
  
Q. Tell us about that?  
SHAUN PRUITT: About eating better? Staying away from ranch and mayonnaise and
being more focused, besides the dieting, and just focusing in and just being
more about my team and things like that has helped me out a lot, and
listening, listening to coaching staff and stuff like that has helped me out a
lot.  
  
Q. Demetri, your role was a little different today. Could you talk about the
assists, seemed like you had a good thing going with Brian and a couple of
other guys. Was that just from your playing with them or what's going on?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: Knowing your teammates. When I came out, first couple of
shots, they didn't go in. Coach talked to me, calm down, get your teammates
involved. Get yourself in the game another way, you don't always have to
score. As a point guard, it's my job to get other people involved. And I found
my big mans running the transition, Shaun made some big plays and we played
good as a team.  
  
Q. Brian, could you talk about a third match with Wisconsin? And you guys
showed the other day that you had it both ways, where you beat somebody that
had beaten you twice and here's another team that you were able to sweep. Talk
about the Badgers this matchup?  
BRIAN RANDLE: I thought we matched up well, obviously Butch inside and him and
Shaun matching up. And Flowers and Chester, and Demetri and Trevon Hughes,
depending on how that works on myself and Landry. I think it's a good even-
keel matchup. And then Trenton and Bohannon.  
So really the big thing, like I've been saying, it's for us to be focused
tonight and then tomorrow in preparation with the scouting report and walk-
through, just making sure we understand what we're doing offensively,
defensively. Our defensive principles and just concentrating, that's going to
be the biggest thing. Because we've got enough heart to go around. We just
have to make sure we're smart about it.  
  
Q. Brian, would you explain what happened at the end of the game? I didn't
understand why the clock went down to 4.8 and what did they rule as far as the
play when Brock got the rebound?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll come to that.  
  
Q. Shaun, could you also address playing Wisconsin a third time? Neither of
those games went down to a wire. You've had so many close, but those didn't.
What's the hope this time from your point of view?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I thought we did a good job in Wisconsin up there. They blew it
open at the end, but for the whole game we were in the game with them. It was
pretty much about our defense. And then we got a defense let-up at the end,
that score really wasn't how it really looked.  
I think at home I think we just didn't lock in on defense as much as we did
the first game. But, I mean, we're excited about it. Our energy level tomorrow
is something that should definitely keep us in the game. I mean, they're a
tough team. It's not that much room for error versus a team like Wisconsin.
They don't mess up that much. They always stay to their focus and game plan.
We'll have to be disciplined tomorrow to have a chance.  
  
Q. Brian, would this one game tomorrow make up for the entire previous 35?  
BRIAN RANDLE: Yeah, it would. You strive every year to win a Big Ten
championship and to get to the Final Four national championship, I think given
the heart attack we had early on to win four games in a row, you know, beat
two top 25 teams would be huge.  
And really it would give us a lot of momentum going into the NCAA. We're not
looking back at this point. Everything's going forward. We're much more
mature, I think we have a better sense of how to play and where we want to be
where we need to be. So most definitely, this would make up for it.  
  
Q. Shaun, if you could address that, too, what would it mean to win
tomorrow?  
SHAUN PRUITT: It would mean a lot I mean to us and the coaches. I mean it
would mean that we came together and put the season back to where it should be
in perspective. And I think it would mean a lot to the fans who stuck with us
and in a sense may have thought we let them down.  
But it would mean we just kept fighting to the end. We're just going to try
our hardest tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with questions for Coach Weber. If
you want to address the question.  
COACH WEBER: What happened at the end, I believe he called an injury timeout.
Calvin got poked in the eye. I guess you could have called a foul or
traveling, instead he called injury and stopped it. What happened with the
clock, when they inbounded the ball, the clock did not start for three
seconds. One of our assistants noticed it. We asked them, we requested the
officials to watch the TV monitor and we were right. So that cut off, what,
three-point something, which put it at 4.8, which made it a little bit easier
for us to kind of get the game done.  
So that was I guess the story of that situation.  
  
Q. Coach, you're able to match the Illinois women now. Comment on that a
little bit? Did you talk to your team about that?  
COACH WEBER: We have. I'll be honest. It's kind of ironic they were the 9th
seed, we were the 10th seed. They've had some heart-breaking losses. Last
weekend we watched a couple of their games after practice, you know, just
everybody together cheering for them. And we were all heartbroken to see them
lose on a blockout and especially the effort they gave, the fatigue factor you
guys asked about. They only had nine people and only played six or seven and
they got through four and really had a chance to win the last one.  
And so I don't think it will be a factor. We have to make sure we use our
bench. I thought Calvin was very good today. And he had struggled a couple of
games. Came through for us. And Mike Davis has given us solid minutes, Jeffrey
just defending.  
But those guys will be very important. And as you saw in the first game, you
know, I think Michigan State had, what, five people foul out or four people
foul out. So it's going to be even more important because Wisconsin is
patient, they do get the ball inside. And we'll have to make sure our bench
does a great job, if we do have any of those foul problems.  
  
Q. Your starters have played a lot of minutes the last three days, what's
your sense of how they are physically and then what are they going to have
left tomorrow, do you think?  
COACH WEBER: I think they're fine. I think the only one you worry about is
Chester. We tried to get him out a lot quicker than normal. But he has so much
tolerance of pain that -- and he just has such a will and a desire to be
successful that I think he'll be fine. I don't think that's going to be a
factor tomorrow, at all, to be honest. It's going to be more what Shaun talked
about: Having the discipline to match their system.  
It looked like Michigan State had them today. We were watching in the locker
room. All of a sudden you turn the TV off and we're getting ready for the game
and we turn it back on and it's tie score.  
So they just -- and we've used them as an example, to be honest. Wisconsin,
they don't show emotion. They just come and play. They don't talk trash. They
do it old school-wise, and we've talked about it with our guys: Be smart. Be
consistent, and do it on the court.  
And if you find a way to win it, then we'll do some celebrating tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, there was some talk of moving the championship game up to 1:00
into the SEC's time slot. Were you aware of that and how would that have
affected you in terms of preparation?  
COACH WEBER: Well, it would make it tougher. I'll be honest I hope it doesn't
happen. And I hadn't heard that.  
I knew there was some -- I saw the news last night with the dome and all the
damage and I knew about the delay of the game and I knew Kentucky -- I heard
they lost this morning and Georgia has to play twice today.  
But if it happened, you gotta deal with it. You gotta suck it up. We what
Wisconsin does. They're not complicated. It's kind of -- I grew up in
Wisconsin it's the old Green Bay Packers sweep, you know it's coming, can you
stop it?  
And on the other end, Brian mentioned it or Shaun, they played a pack defense
and they're going to be in there. It's almost like a two-three zone, you're
going to have to get good ball movement up there. We had some success at home.
It wasn't one of our better games.  
And I think they kind of caught us when we had our hearts kind of taken out so
many times and maybe lost our spirit a little bit.  
  
Q. Talk about your players, every time Minnesota made a run, you guys kept
pushing and kept pushing?  
COACH WEBER: And this is something we've struggled with all year. We hit these
walls and we're not -- we don't find a way around them or through them. And
now for some reason I don't know if they realize it's the end of the season,
this is it, this is do or die, whatever, they have finally come together, and
they understand they're doing it as a team.  
We're keeping our poise. We don't argue as much on the court, helping each
other. And it's all the things we've kind of been emphasizing all year, and
finally I guess we got to them. So I guess it's better later than not at all.  
And Pruitt's effort today, we have a play hard chart, and it's loose balls and
deflexions and charges and all those types of things that never get in the
stats. And he was our leader. I don't know if he's been a leader all year. So
I think he's hooked up and he fought in the post, didn't really Williams get
going.  
That's what we're going to need tomorrow. We're going to have to fight every
possession, get loose balls, have some things go our way, maybe some balls
bounce off our head and go in the hoop. Just some things are going to have to
happen magically for us to have some success.  
If you have a will and desire maybe that will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Hughes was a tough matchup for you guys, looked like he was hurt late in
the game. If he doesn't play how will that affect what goes on tomorrow?  
COACH WEBER: Tollackson didn't play last night, so you can't depend on that.
Obviously Trevon has hurt us. He's had big numbers in both games. But at the
same time once, it's Krabbenhoft, then it's Flowers, then Hughes and Butch.
They consistently come up with big efforts. So Brian said we do have good
matchups, we have to stay out of foul trouble. We've really had trouble with
their ball screens. I think we're better at that now. We understand it. Now
can we do it in the game.  
And then we've got to keep any time we get Chester, different people out,
we've got to keep them rested. I saw Tom Izzo, he was in so much foul trouble,
used guys that haven't been in games in months. And those kids fought it out
and gave him a chance to win. Like our guys did yesterday against Purdue in
the first half.  
And that's probably what is going to have to happen if we're going to have
success.  
  
Q. Bruce, have you ever coached a team in four consecutive games like this
and do you make any adjustments strategically to account for fatigue?  
COACH WEBER: Well, just get back. I just told them I'll walk back, they can
get back. We need to get food, get them rested and hydrated. We talked about
that. We've talked about being here all week, and we've talked about rest.
Making a commitment. Shaun talked about his eating habits and actually has an
independent study class, his last one. And the whole class we set it up to
help him. And he's studying nutrition and his eating habits. He's writing a
paper on it and really he's monitoring himself.  
So it's a good thing for the future and I wish he would have thought about
that a while ago, but, as he said, maybe it's a good thing at the right time.
So we'll go back, eat, we'll watch some tape. We'll meet like we always do
about 9:30, have some ice cream sundaes and get up in the morning and walk
through the hotel and make a go of it.  
That's all you can do. This is in my five years our third matchup with
Wisconsin in the finals. They beat us the first year here, we beat them the
second year in Chicago, and we have a lot more to play for than them.  
I think I gotta believe they're a 2 seed somewhere in there. I don't think
it's going to change for us with our record. There's not much unless we find a
way to win it. So I hope that's the motivating factor.  
  
Q. Following up on Pruitt, besides his diet what else has come together for
him. Because he's playing like you probably expected all year?  
COACH WEBER: I think he gets it now. And I'm not sure he got it, to be honest.
And when I say get it, it's a general term, but he understands what it's
about. And I always talk about who makes All-Conference, who makes All-
American. It's the guys from the teams that win. And if you have success,
you'll get those honors, you'll get those accolades.  
And it's really bassackwards, if you win, we had three guys make All-American
that didn't average over 15 points a game. But we won. And people appreciated
that. And now I think he gets it. I think a lot of them get it. It's the team
that's more important and hopefully we can bring that out of them tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Drew Neitzel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16991)

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tom, we'll ask you for a couple of opening comments, then we'll
do questions for Travis and Drew and finish for questions with Coach Izzo.  
COACH IZZO: I'm really proud of these two guys. I guess all the crap that
Neitzel has been through is all worth it because I think in two games he
showed what a warrior he is. And the guy next to me didn't score any points,
but he did as good a job as anybody I had as guarding, playing the one, the
two, the three, the four and probably even center the way the game went.  
I'm very disappointed in the outcome and I guess a better team won. That's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for Travis or Drew.  
  
Q. Drew, the last shot, could you describe what happened, whether you
thought it was going in?  
DREW NEITZEL: We just got the rebound and tried to push it up. And I seen an
opening so I pulled up. I seen Butch coming out on me and just missed it. He
had a good contest. I had to get it over him. I didn't want to get it blocked.
I wanted to have at least a chance of it going in. So he made a good play on
the ball.  
  
Q. Drew, if there's a silver lining, is it what you take from this
tournament into the NCAA tournament as far as how you're feeling shooting the
ball?  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, I just gotta keep being aggressive, staying confident and
my teammates did a great job getting me the ball. So I just gotta stay
confident and try to put this game behind us and get ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Travis, how hard is it going to be for you guys to try and shake off such
an emotionally wrenching game like this?  
TRAVIS WALTON: You know, it's going to be tough, because I felt almost every
player put their heart into it. It was a tough game. But it's going to be a
quick turnaround for us. We gotta find some way to bring energy. Me and Drew
are going to bring it in, try to motivate all the other players to bring it
and get ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Travis, when a game is called the way that one was called, what runs
through a player's mind and does it change the way you approach the game, go
about your business?  
TRAVIS WALTON: I ain't got no comment for that.  
THE MODERATOR: You're free to head back to the locker room. Appreciate your
time. Thank you. Finish with questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Tom, would you answer that question?  
COACH IZZO: I'm sorry, Skip, I answer a lot of questions, but just a tough --
I thought we did just about everything we needed to do to win a game. We
didn't rebound as well. Maybe we're just a real physical team with all those
six-four guys playing center today, and I don't know. I didn't play, so I
don't know how it is to play under those circumstances.  
  
Q. Tom, since Drew was in high school, you've had a terrific relationship
with him, and you talked about this tournament and him, would you just talk
about Drew and what he means to you as a player?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it's a hard time. I mean, you kind of hope every player --
we really felt we could win this tournament. And, you know, I think what the
truth of it is, it's been a tough year for him. Not an awful year, just a
tough year.  
For him to play like he did the last two days and the number of minutes, I've
always said good things happen to people who work hard and stick to it. And he
still comes in and shoots, still comes in and watch is film.  
I think he deserved what he got as far as his play. I don't think he deserved
what he got as far as how the game went.  
  
Q. Can you please comment on the fact that you just lost a two-point game
given the circumstances. Guys kept going down like flies with the balls. Tell
me a little bit about your team --  
COACH IZZO: I don't think I did a very good job either. We played a couple of
guys that have played in three or six games in the last 18. And I give a lot
of credit to Isaiah Dahlman and Tommy Herzog sat there for most of the year,
and Isaiah, and we just -- we had to see Raymar on the bench for so long, and
it's just a hard loss.  
I feel for the players. I feel for our fans. I've been through it before.  
  
Q. Is this kind of a day that can be a growing experience with Kalin, can
you talk about those late plays with Kalin?  
COACH IZZO: Kalin Lucas did a hell of a job today. I would be careful where
you go with Kalin, because he took a couple too deep and we talked about it.
But I told him to try to get fouled, but I'm not sure that would have worked
today.  
He made some big-time plays and some big-time shots. And the last one didn't
quite go his way. And I think the greatest thing about today is I saw how much
it meant to him in the locker room.  
So he'll grow. He'll be -- he's a tough kid. I'm really proud of him and him
trying to keep this team on his back a little bit. And Drew did a hell of a
job. But with Raymar out and Naymick out and Goran out, a lot of people out,
that put a lot of pressure on that kid.  
I thought all in all he did a hell of a job. And he'll grow from it. He'll get
better at the things he didn't do well and the things he did do well, he's
going to be a special player.  
  
Q. Tom, you seem very despondent about this game, what then do you say to
your kids in the locker room after this one?  
COACH IZZO: I told them I was proud of them and that there were a couple of
guys that didn't play as well as they need to play to win a big game. But I
told them the same thing I always tell them: Make sure you control the things
you can control; the things you can't control, you have to do the best you
can.  
And I thought today, for the most part, 11 turnovers, shoot a higher
percentage, we hold them to the 30s, there's certain things you don't control
and that's what I told them.  
I don't plan on getting over this today. I don't plan on getting over it
tomorrow. On Monday I'll get over it.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Travis Walton's leadership, is that
something you've put on him, or is that something that he's kind of assumed?  
COACH IZZO: No, I've put it on him. I think when Drew was -- Drew's good
leader but he's not the vocal leader that Travis is. And we've got some young
guys, and we've got some of those big guys that haven't maybe played as many
minutes.  
I always say that in tournament games usually they're the ones in the film
room, in the hotel room, the locker room, and Travis Walton did a phenomenal
job. Last night in our meetings and meeting after meeting and film session
after film session, and walk-throughs, and this morning. He just did an
unbelievable job. Yeah, he really did.  
  
Q. It's clear how much you had invested in this game. Is there any sliver of
a silver lining when you look ahead toward next week to going home on
Saturday?  
COACH IZZO: No, none. Zero. I'm sorry, but not at all. The only silver lining
is I had some guys that left it all on the floor and there's no silver lining.
There will never be a silver lining in losing. And the way that game, there
will never ever be a silver lining.  
So, no. And for those of you that wonder if we're going to drag this on to the
tournament, no, we're not going to drag it onto the tournament.  
But I don't feel like -- I just think it was a tough game for our kids, for
our fans. And Wisconsin is a good team and hopefully they play well.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Tom. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Dan Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18148)

### [Lawrence McKenzie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18187)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'd like to have you make some opening comments if you
could, then we'll go the question route.  
COACH SMITH: Okay. First, certainly want to commend, congratulate Illinois and
Coach Weber and his team. They did what they had to do to get the win today.
They're one of the best defensive teams, one of the best rebounding teams. And
I also want to commend and congratulate and wish both teams, Wisconsin the
best in the tournament.  
I thought we played with a lot of heart and a lot of hustle and a lot of
toughness today. And it was indicative by the way we rebounded the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Dan or Lawrence.  
  
Q. Obviously there might be an outside chance that this team get an at-large
bid in the tournament. Can you talk about that and the possibility of going to
the NIT?  
DAN COLEMAN: I mean, I don't know what to say to that. Hopefully. That's up to
the selection committees for either tournament. But I'd like to keep playing.  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: The same thing with what Dan said. I'm just wishing for the
best, hoping for the best and that's up to the committee. But I do want to
continue to play.  
  
Q. Dan, I know everybody's got a lot of intensity in all of these tournament
games. But the way you guys won last night, did that -- what was the impact of
that? Was it just kind of sort of such an emotional high that it made it
tougher today? What kind of feeling did you have from that?  
DAN COLEMAN: I didn't think it affected us. I mean I think everybody played
hard, left it on the floor. Couple rolls here there might be a different
story. But I think last night didn't -- if anything, it added to the adrenalin
to this game and had people playing harder.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the last three games overall? Obviously coming
back from Northwestern, down 16 and then the tough Indiana game, sort of what
you've all been through the last three days here?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: Started off with a tough game with Northwestern. They
played their butts off. And we were down 16 and going into the halftime. Guys
came out and played with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm, ended upcoming
back, with that.  
Then yesterday Indiana, started off well. Started off well, started off with a
great lead but we knew that those guys got two great players and D.J. White
and Eric Gordon, they've got some other guys that are definitely great role
players.  
And you saw what happened there. Like Hoffarber hitting an amazing shot, we
were very excited about that. Then coming today, Illinois played some great
defense. That's pretty much how it is each time we played them.  
They play some great defense. We got a couple of looks. Some shots were in and
out. Took a tough L.  
THE MODERATOR: You're free to go back to the locker room. Thank you. Finish
with questions for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Coach, if you had a chance to go before the committee and explain to them
why you think your team should go to the NCAA tournament, what would you tell
them?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we've certainly -- our schedule is not really indicative of
I think how hard and how -- because this is a pretty tough league, the Big Ten
is a league that probably deserving of multiple -- and certainly I think Ohio
State, and probably already have four teams in, in Michigan State, Purdue,
Wisconsin.  
So now it's a matter of trying to figure out what this conference, power
rating is and that type of thing.  
We've played better over the last few weeks. That's about the only thing we
can talk about. And I think that there is -- to overcome some of the
adversities that I think we've had to make the turnaround like we have this
year would be a great story. But otherwise -- but that's not up to me and I
don't get that opportunity. But I hope that people would consider us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about last night's win, sort of what carry-over there might
have been from that to today's game?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I was interested in what Dan and McKenzie thought about it,
because it was a very emotional win and you're trying to get them to settle
down. And all you can do is just say at the end of the game, we talk about it
not being to that point, could have iced it at certain times, so as a coach
you try to pinpoint that we were very fortunate and there were things that we
could have controlled a little bit better, to get to ice the win after having
such a large lead and controlling a lot of the tempo early on.  
So that's how you bring them back. That's how I brought them back to earth.
But again physically and mentally and psychologically, you are spent. So it
takes some time to recover from that. But a lot of it has to do with just
playing against a very good team in Illinois who has a lot of confidence,
obviously, when they play against us.  
  
Q. You might have answered this question already, but to this point, with
the 20 wins, with the signature win against Indiana, a lot of people witnessed
the shot that Blake hit. Do you think you guys are on the bubble? I mean, do
you have a --  
COACH SMITH: There's always hope. There's always that hope. So you can never
-- you never say never and you just -- that's about all we can do at this
juncture. So it doesn't really do much good. We don't really talk about it.
Haven't really talked about it until someone from the media or someone asked
me about it. Because you're too focused on trying to prepare for the next
game. And we'll probably leave here in the morning, get back. Certainly we'll
be waiting like everybody to hear what our good fortunes are or bad fortunes
are.  
  
Q. You haven't been in a situation like that in a while, but if say you find
out you're not in the NCAA tournament you find out immediately after that
you're going to the NIT and who you're playing, what is it kind of like that
to kind of feel maybe emotions go up and down knowing that you're not going to
be in then all of a sudden having to prepare for that?  
COACH SMITH: To be honest with you, I always feel like it's a real, it's icing
on the cake, any time you can get to post-season play, it's no real let down.
You play a long season. The kids work extremely hard. And you hope they've
been rewarded in the way you make those sacrifices throughout the season.  
So you're not really -- you know you're giving it all. Yes, you don't have
that feeling of not making it. I'm sure there are teams that in situations, in
conferences that have had great ratings or RPIs and didn't make it that felt
like they deserved it.  
But no, I don't think we've ever -- I've never felt like we need to sit here
on pins and needles and worry about it. We need to move on from there because
there's a lot of things in your program that you have to deal with, that you
have to get ready for the following year or for the post-season or for
recruiting. So your attention is on a lot of different things.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the last three days. It seemed like it's been
such a roller coaster with Northwestern being down by 16 yesterday and then
here today what it's been like for you?  
COACH SMITH: It's been fun. In coaching that's what you live for those moments
where you -- players do too. You don't want to be in those situations, but you
prepare yourself that decision-making time, and we were great -- we haven't
had many of those opportunities this year so it was fun to be in those two
situations back to back where we had some chances to make plays and coach and
make some decisions in tight, pressured situations. So that's the beauty and
the joy that you get from coaching.  
  
Q. If you do find out you're playing in the NIT, how much of a benefit would
it be to play at home, as well as you guys played lately there?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we've had our problems but we have been playing better. And
certainly no doubt about it our fans would be excited about it. But we'll have
to wait and see. It would be a good experience to have someone, to play
another game in the barn or two. We were just getting used to it.  
Thank you all. It's been a good tournament. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Brian Butch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18195)

### [Michael Flowers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17046)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Once again we'll take an opening comment from Coach Ryan then
we'll take questions for Michael and Brian and finish with questions for Coach
Ryan. Go ahead, Coach.  
COACH RYAN: I don't think words will adequately describe what these guys did
in the comeback. I think probably the best thing to do is to put it -- from a
DVD on and watch it again and just make your own observations.  
But I really liked what these guys did on every possession. Michigan State
gave us everything they had. Extremely physical and tough game, but in the end
our guys just managed to get one more possession. And that says a lot for
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for Brian or Michael.  
  
Q. Michael, can you take us through that play where you stole the ball and
drilled in, were you anticipating Lucas passing? He had been driving and
firing it up there the last few minutes?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: I knew that towards the end of the game with a player like
Drew Neitzel that they were looking for him, and I just wanted to cover him
and make sure he doesn't get any -- if he doesn't have the ball, he can't
score. So I was overpressuring him and the pass came. I tipped it, effected
it. And just ran. As fast as I could for the layup.  
  
Q. Michael, I don't know if vindicated is the right word, but the fact that
Drew had a great game all the way through and you were able to get the winning
shot with Neitzel right there with you, can you describe your feelings?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: It was a little bit frustrating. He came out firing and my
hand was right there. That's what got me in foul trouble. Hit him on the
release a couple times. And you can't contribute to the team if you're on the
bench.  
But luckily this is a team and nine people played and they all contributed in
their own way. And we just came out on top.  
  
Q. Michael, if you could, just comment on your in-game defense on Neitzel,
keeping the ball out of his hands, what were you doing specifically there?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: Just following our rules, making them -- forcing them one
way, getting over the screens. And just making sure if he caught the ball, he
caught it 35 feet away from the basket.  
I think in the second half, towards the end, I did a really good job, way
better than I did in the first half of keeping the ball out of his hands, and
that kind of disrupted the flow of their offense, and we were able to come
back because they weren't scoring, we were scoring with the clock stopped. So
that was to our benefit.  
  
Q. Brian, when a game is called like that, what runs through a player's mind
and does it force you to change the way you want to go about your business?  
BRIAN BUTCH: Well, with us it doesn't really change what we do. We have rules
that Coach puts in place. Just to play tough defense and not foul and not put
us into positions to foul.  
When we foul, it's pretty obvious, because what we usually do and how we
usually play defense. That's what we kept on telling each other. We were down
10, and we just said, you know, what it's going to come on the defensive end.
That's how we got back into it, was we really just concentrated on the
defense.  
  
Q. Brian, what does a comeback like this tell you, this team is playing just
so well and to be able to come back like that, what does it to the psyche of
this team? Are you feeling almost like you're impossible to beat or really
hard to beat or what?  
BRIAN BUTCH: Well, when we do what we normally do, we're pretty tough to beat.
When we get away from it, that's when we struggle. We got away from some of
the things we normally did in the first half. And that's when they kind of --
in the start of the second half, we got away from what we normally do. And
that's when they got their lead on us.  
When we finally got back to what we normally did, we were able to cut away at
it little by little. It came down to the last couple minutes. We made some
more plays than they did.  
Just kind of the way it goes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Coach, in your career at Wisconsin, you've won -- out of 11 games you've
won eight. What is it about your style of system and how it matches up with
Coach Izzo's?  
COACH RYAN: I didn't know how many. I never keep track. All's this game was 40
minutes of basketball and we were one possession better. I've never
personalized, agonized, become obsessive about another team, anybody else, any
other players, any other -- that's why I act 20 when I'm 60. Didn't you notice
that? I'm okay. I'm not going to get an ulcer.  
I don't know about the matchups that you people refer to and how many this and
how many Tuesdays did the team wearing a certain color lose a game. I don't
know. So I didn't even know the number.  
Today we just happened to match up one possession better is all I know. That's
the best I can give you.  
  
Q. Bo, you got four of their bigs to foul out, all of them played 22 minutes
or less, is that something that just happened? Was that an emphasis on what
you wanted to do with the ball offensively, get their bigs in offensive
trouble?  
COACH RYAN: Junior high, high school, every level I've coached, if you don't
touch the post, you are not going to get to the free throw line. Although,
there were some fouls on three-point shooters today, probably the most I've
seen in a single game. I don't know how many there were, but that was a lot.  
So we're going to touch the post. We're going to try to get something going to
the rim. And that's how you get fouled. Other teams can do the same things,
and they've done that at times.  
I mean, we picked up fouls on some of our guys. We had to play with a little
different rotation in the first half. We're all trying to do pretty much the
same things, only some years, depending on the players, what you're looking
for more than others.  
Right now we're just trying to be the most opportunistic team in the country.
We don't care who gets it, where, when. But we do know if you get it 15 feet
and in, you tend to get to the free throw line more.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Brian's determination coming back from 0-for-7
shooting and making the impact he made today?  
COACH RYAN: You saw the guy from Georgetown. He figured if he could do it,
Brian could do it, AWOL, and then Medal of Honor. That's what Brian went from.  
But he was okay with it, probably because we loosened him up afterwards. I
told him he set the record for the only guy going 0-for-19. One guy went
0-for-18, and you're 0-for-19, Brian -- no, he was one under. I said, you
missed the record by 1. I didn't realize he was only 0-for-7.  
But that's what we said to him yesterday. And we don't want him to get real
happy with himself right now either. We've got a lot to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kalin Lucas getting loose at the end and you all were
able to stop him, what were you thoughts on him and how were you able to stop
him?  
COACH RYAN: Boy, he's tough. On that pull-up jumper, we were right in him. And
he shot right over the top of guys and then he missed a couple. But those are
tough shots. But he felt -- you could tell he wanted the ball. You could tell
he was thinking: I can score here. And players like that are tough to stop.
He's pretty good.  
  
Q. How do these come-backs in these game situations help your team as it
prepares for the NCAA tournament?  
COACH RYAN: I don't know. But I know they're tired. That's a lot of energy out
there. And just gotta make sure we get hydrated and feed up and get ready for
tomorrow.  
But comebacks are one possession at a time. And I just think our guys stayed
focused and just a couple of breaks, a couple of shots bounce off the rim
there for them. And a couple of balls go in for us. We get fouled shooting the
3.  
We make a 3 and get fouled in that run we made and we scored double digits
with the clock stopped. That's the only way we make that comeback.  
  
Q. Wanted to know how serious Trevon Hughes's injury was and is he going to
be available for tomorrow?  
COACH RYAN: I mentioned, get hurt more often, Trevon, because seems the
players really rally around you. Don't misquote me here now. I said that
tongue in cheek and said, your teammates really, really respond to you. He
smiled. We high-five one another. And he's fine. I mean fine emotionally.
Physically our trainer will make that decision. So we shall see.  
  
Q. Bo, regarding Michael Flowers, at halftime, was there some point of
inspiration, instruction that brought him back into the mainstream?  
COACH RYAN: Couldn't have been at halftime. Because he was trying to make
something happen offensively. Took two bad shots and a reach-in foul. For
people that know me, that's like taking the game of basketball and cursing it.  
Okay, by that I mean he was trying to make plays that got away from him a
little bit. That third foul on the whack down, that's not Michael. And once he
got -- it was after that that he got himself, okay, I can do this. I'm ready.
Okay. He was fine. But I probably should have said something else at halftime.
But it wasn't something that was said at halftime, in answer to your question.  
  
Q. Bo, given your quote after the game yesterday about rhythms into the NCAA
tournament, as dandy an event we're at, is a win like this almost cumbersome
in terms of what you're going to try to get done?  
COACH RYAN: We won't talk about it. We'll rest. We'll do what we have to do
between now and tomorrow. But maybe you're asking that because you're thinking
about me. Did you ever try squatting for 40 minutes three straight days? These
tournaments when we get to the finals are tougher on me than they are on the
players. I gotta get a little help from Henry tonight, the trainer, on my
legs.  
Are they cumbersome? You know, if I say it is and if we talk about it, then we
become (moaning) type people, throw pity parties. Then it will happen that we
look tired. We can't let that happen. They certainly didn't play that way the
last six minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll ask you to please make a brief opening comment or
two and then we'll take questions for the players and finish up with questions
for you.  
COACH PAINTER: I felt that this game was going to be one of those grinders and
become a possession game. I thought we did a pretty good job of putting
ourselves into a position to win the game. To go into overtime, they made a
couple more plays than we did.  
It's one of those things where you have to close it out when you have a two-
possession lead, you have the balls in a couple situations. They made a couple
of plays and you have to give Illinois credit.  
And we've talked about it all year with some of our guys. We've got some guys,
couple of them up here that have been pretty special for us and made huge
plays. We had guys make plays tonight, but I think Demetri McCamey was the guy
special tonight. He was 6-for-6 from 3, just made big shot after big shot,
especially when they were down in that position.  
That's the difference. When it got into overtime, we had some nice looks at
the baskets, we had some layups and free throws and different things, and the
ball just didn't go in for us.  
Sometimes that happens in this game. And it's unfortunate for us, but you have
to give Illinois credit. I thought they played very hard and they were very
efficient especially in the overtime and in regulation, with some of their
back cuts for layups.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the two Purdue players.  
  
Q. Chris, how are you feeling? And what would you think of kind of your
performance in the overtime when you had to switch to McCamey there?  
CHRIS KRAMER: My body is sore, but so is everybody else's. We played 30 some
games this season. Everybody's sore. You just gotta play through it.  
I'm going to put that on myself. I should have played better defense in the
regulation and overtime. I was defensive player of the year for a reason. I
can't let that stuff happen.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what happened on that travel call right at the end of
regulation? I mean, was there -- did you fumble the ball or what happened?  
CHRIS KRAMER: To be honest, I have no idea. I just caught it and I don't know
if I really traveled or not. I just dribbled and then they called a travel. I
really have no idea what happened.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, you guys shot the ball really well until the overtime.
Emotionally, what did McCamey's shot do to you? Anything, do you think?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Definitely. Every time he made a big shot, you just got that
bad feeling inside you like, dang, he hit another one. He definitely came and
knocked down big shots at the end. We just needed to stop it. But we didn't.
They made plays.  
  
Q. Chris, can you just kind of talk about the, I don't know, frustration in
overtime when it seemed like you guys couldn't get the ball to go in? As Coach
said, you had some layups and point-blank looks from 3 after some offensive
rebounds and whatnot. Did that get discouraging?  
CHRIS KRAMER: We got some good looks. We just have to step up and make those.
If we get the opportunity again I think we'll do that. We made the hustle
plays to get the ball. Gotta put the ball in the basket. And then who knows
what could have happened.  
Our guys hustled and made those plays, but Illinois made a lot of plays down
the stretch in the end of regulation and overtime. And that's a lot of their
credit.  
  
Q. Chris, I'm sorry if I was out of the room at the moment. But your shot at
the end of regulation, could you take us through that? It left your hand,
looked pretty good?  
CHRIS KRAMER: Yeah, I went off a flex screen. And then down screen, dribble
handoff and Shaun Pruitt really didn't hedge that well. So I had to take it.
And I pulled up at the free throw line and I let it go. I thought it was good.
And it rimmed out. So we had to go to overtime.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, do you have any sense at all because you beat Illinois twice in
the regular season that you might have assumed too much this game, or perhaps
been looking forward to the possibility of playing Indiana?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: I mean, no. I mean, we know it was tournament time, it's a new
season in the tournament. That taught us a lesson tonight that every time is
going to come ready to play in the tournament and take it up another level. We
see Illinois took it up another level. Now we have to look forward to going to
the NCAA tournament and taking it up another notch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time. Finish up with questions for Coach
Painter.  
  
Q. Matt, as recently as I think the Minnesota game when Keaton hit that shot
at the end of the half, you've always talked about how you believe that
momentum can be a carry-over and stoppage applied. Just looking at your guys'
faces when they came out in overtime, it wasn't a look of fear but it was a
look of "damn." Did you sense that and would you agree that momentum carried
over?   
COACH PAINTER: I would agree with that. I did sense that and that was
something I tried to -- it's very hard as a coach when you do sense it and you
see it of trying to get them going again. And the one thing that gets you
going is when you make shots. And obviously we didn't make any shots in the
overtime.  
But it was just a breakdown on our part. Obviously when a guy makes all the
shots he has, we talked about staying with him. It's just a breakdown. And
they broke us down off the dribble. And he kind of came in behind the play.
And we were supposed to stay with him and we didn't. And we were in position
to win the basketball game. We turn it over and we don't get a stop.  
Then we get a good look at the basket. We really wanted to get Chris to turn
the corner and get to the basket if he could and kick it to E'Twaun and he got
cut off a little bit and the clock was going down. He shot that pole up.  
I really sensed that and I felt they had momentum. I thought we had to do
something the start of the overtime. Make a play, make a basket, cessation,
couple plays in succession to do that. And we weren't able to do that.  
  
Q. A young team that hasn't been in this situation before, is there a lesson
that they can take from this that maybe they can apply to the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: I hope so. But you ask E'Twaun the question earlier about
looking past him. Our guys weren't looking past Illinois. They respect
Illinois and they understand that they've struggled from the free throw line.
We had some bad breaks with injuries and that they're a good basketball team.  
But hopefully we can learn that the game comes down to a possession or two and
we've got to do a better job of taking care of the ball in that one instance
and getting a stop. But I expect our guys to regroup and play hard in the NCAA
tournament.  
  
Q. Freshmen are sophomores now, but they've never been in, like he said, a
tournament where it could be one and done if you don't win. Did you talk to
your guys about it, were you concerned about it? With this outcome, even
though you lost, is this a positive learning experience having experienced
this before the NCAA tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: I think any experience you can make positive if you look at it
the right way. And that's what we'll discuss with our guys. And learn from it
just like we learned from Ohio State loss at the end of the year because
everybody wanted to win the Big Ten title, now come out and make you even
hungrier to play in the NCAA tournament.  
Time will tell. Our guys are competitors. I thought they laid it on the line.
I thought we had some breakdowns obviously. Defensively we had some
breakdowns, but I think our guys will regroup and be ready to go.  
  
Q. Your freshmen are pretty well known because of their accomplishments this
year. But Illinois may be a little bit under the radar, did you know about
these other guys, Davis and Jordan, that kind of thing?  
COACH PAINTER: I think, first of all, when you talk about their freshmen you
have to talk about McCamey, he was player of the game. And we lost this game
because Demetri McCamey is special. Six of six from three and you have to tip
your hat to him. He did a great job. He was the difference.  
I thought in the first half Davis, especially and Jordan made the one basket,
those guys kept him in there. We were getting some momentum and hanging in
there. And I felt Mike Davis did a very good job with him. We know about
Mike's athleticism and we have seen on tape he's made a couple of 15-footers
through the Big Ten season. I mean that he's made a couple. We knew he could
catch and shoot 15, 17 feet. But what are you going to do when you have
Meacham and Pruitt and McCamey, some of those other guys you slough off to?
But after you hit a couple, we tried to talk to those guys about being there
with him.  
But there's no doubt that their bench outplayed our bench. They did a very
good job. And I talked about McCamey being the difference, but if you're going
to grab one element that I thought we have an advantage over Illinois, I
thought our bench is an advantage over their bench, but tonight obviously it
was not.  
  
Q. What did you tell the team in the locker room after the game? And how
much does this loss, do you think, hurt your seed in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: There's no question, to answer that in reverse. It hurts -- any
time you lose doesn't help your seeding. No doubt about that. Unless you're
losing to someone that's maybe ahead of you. Sometimes you can stay pat with
that.  
But I just told them they've done a great job the whole year. They've battled
the whole year. We've had some breakdowns, and you have breakdowns when you
win. And the only thing you can do is just go back and get those things
corrected and try to improve and get better. And just like a lot of your
questions you guys have asked today, it's what you do as a coach. You just try
to take this as a positive experience, learn from it and get better.  
But I'm proud of our guys. They've done a good job this year. Illinois, you
know, Illinois was pretty good tonight.  
  
Q. Matt, is there any silver lining, Kramer's limping around, Grant's
limping around, the extra rest you get from an early exit, is there any
benefit to that whatsoever?  
COACH PAINTER: There's been a lot of discussion. I don't think that I've
coached enough to go through so many different situations to find out what's
right for your particular team. But, yeah, it will be good to have a couple
days' rest. If it does help us, if there's some silver lining there, then
great. Obviously we'd like to keep playing and be playing Indiana or Minnesota
tomorrow. But we're not.  
The thing I would say about that and I've always talked about that through
injuries, you know they've got guys like Chester Frazier who doesn't even
practice. He's out there limping around. He's got some guys out there had to
play 39 minutes last night, they turn around tonight and McCamey plays 42 and
Frazier plays 45, they played the whole game. They've got guys with injuries
too. But the guys we have that had injuries and battled, I'm proud of those
guys. Grant and Kramer has battled. But you have to keep plugging this time of
the year and try to win games.  
  
Q. There's obviously an awful lot of time on the clock and different
scenarios that could have unfolded with 31 seconds in regulation, any thought
in fouling them?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, I thought about it with Pruitt. I thought about doing it.
But the thing, to be honest, that threw me for a loop with that, I've never
done that before. But I did think about it. I did think about fouling Pruitt
if he got the basketball, but I'm worried to get the rebound. If we can get a
rebound off a free throw and we don't turn the basketball over, we win this
game in regulation. But we couldn't get a rebound on two different occasions
on back-to-back plays in regulation. Then we turn the basketball over there
when we're up three with 20 seconds to go.  
Those are very important possessions for us. We have to get that rebound. That
led into my thinking now even if he misses and he's missed them so far, can we
get this rebound? Can we -- and I've never done that before. I've never
experienced that and just to hand somebody points even though their percentage
isn't good, I'd rather get a stop, especially with that kind of time.  
I think you had a lot of possessions at that time. If you're at six seconds,
five seconds, four seconds, they've got it on the side, now you can control
that and get a foul. But with 30 seconds right there, I think that's too much
time.  
  
Q. I think the last nine minutes of regulation you didn't sub. Really
sparingly in overtime when you had to. You just didn't like the way your guys
were playing off the bench? You thought the guys you had in were playing
better? Or what was the thought process there?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought Calasan was obviously doing a pretty good job on
Pruitt. We wanted to keep Kramer in there defensively to defend Meacham. We
had to switch up and put him on McCamey a little bit. Keaton Grant was
cramping with some different things. Keaton made a couple of shots in that
stretch. E'Twaun Moore I was not going to sub out of the game. And Robbie
Hummel gets a double-double for us, has been solid.  
Like I said, I thought their bench was pretty good and did some very good
things for them and allowed them to sub. And maybe some of those other guys
were a little bit more fresh because of it. But we stayed with the guys who we
thought were our best five.  
  
Q. Mark asked you the question about finding a silver lining maybe, if you
play great next Thursday or Friday night, maybe if the rest is good. But the
other side of that is if you think about it you will have only played two
games in about 16 or 17 days. Is that at all a concern, or will you be able to
answer that next Thursday?  
COACH PAINTER: I think the answer lies in how you play in the NCAA tournament.
We do need some rest. And when we have those long stretches, we do get some
rest. We still practice to try to stay sharp. But it lies in how you play.  
We'll see when we play on Thursday or Friday if that will help us. But I
expect our guys to bounce back and play very hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Drew Neitzel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16991)

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Izzo and then we'll
take questions for the student athletes.  
Coach, if you could make a couple of opening comments and get things going.  
COACH IZZO: I thought, first of all, they're playing for their lives, and I
still think that's a team worthy of playing another day in an NAC game and I
hope they do.  
I thought early on we had some great looks and we missed some shots. And then
they made a couple of great plays right before halftime. And the second half
we just kind of ground it out. And it's great to have Drew hitting some big
shots and Travis did an unbelievable job not only defending but running the
team.  
And I just thought all in all we were in some foul trouble. Believe it or not,
two of my freshmen that didn't play much were big keys. And that was Durrell
Summers and Chris Allen, both spared some time. But these guys logged a lot of
minutes.  
And I'm just proud of this team for winning a game when a team was playing for
their lives and we knew it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Drew or Travis.  
  
Q. Drew or Travis, doesn't matter, how do you all feel you dealt with the
press? And that was a big turning point in Sunday's game, how do you feel you
handled the press today?  
DREW NEITZEL: The coaching staff did a great job of making some adjustments
and preparing us this week in practice. They really did a great job of
breaking down the film.  
And we had two or three different press breakers that we put in depending on
what they did. And we just made a conscious effort trying not to turn the ball
over and made good decisions.  
And I think we did that for the most part.  
  
Q. Drew, throughout your career, Wisconsin has been a rival, could you talk
about how special is that for you to face them again tomorrow?  
DREW NEITZEL: It's going to be a big game, just because of where we're at,
semifinals, trying to get to Sunday.  
And they're playing great right now. So we get another chance at them. It's
not too often in your career or in a season you get another chance to play
somebody that's beat you.  
And it's a big game. We gotta do a lot of preparation tonight and tomorrow
before the game. And bring it again.  
  
Q. Drew, I was wondering if that's as good as you felt offensively this
year. Travis, wondered, how much of a lift is that for the team when Drew is
hitting shots like that?  
TRAVIS WALTON: It's big for a team when Drew's knocking down shots. It gives
us a different look, on the team, impress more upon you get shots in the
middle, but it feels good for Drew to be knocking down shots for us.  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, for my part, yeah, I mean that is the best I felt. I just
wanted to come out and be aggressive. I think in a lot of games this year I'm
aggressive at certain points and other parts of the game I just sit back and
let my teammates do the work and I just wanted to be aggressive for the whole
game and take my shots when they're there and I tried to penetrate some more
and be on the attack rather than just sitting back and waiting for open shots.  
  
Q. Drew, could you just talk about the last game you had six points, and
this was kind of a bit of revenge for you just to come out and shoot so
much.  
And Travis just being put in the position again, to shoot so many free throws
at the end of the game. I know you liked that. Could you talk about just being
in that position again, too?  
DREW NEITZEL: It was a tough game last weekend. And like I said, it worked out
funny how we played in the last game and the first game of the tournament. And
as a player you gotta forget about that.  
And I watched the film. Looked at myself in the mirror and said what do I
gotta do differently. I just wanted to be more aggressive. And I got a chance
to redeem myself, and not only myself but this team got a chance to redeem
ourselves and we took advantage of the opportunity.  
  
Q. Drew, the rivalry with Wisconsin was mentioned earlier, but you faced
Flowers a bunch of time in your career. Last time it wasn't the best meeting
you've had against him. What do you do differently going into that game
tomorrow against such a great defender?  
DREW NEITZEL: I think continue to be aggressive. That's about it. Just be
aggressive. Not let him take me out of the game. And we're going to watch a
lot of film tonight and figure out some things what we can and can't run
against him that will work.  
And I think the main thing is just be aggressive.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. We'll finish up with questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about how Drew's been able to persevere and come
out and deliver a game like this for you?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it's been hard on him. I mean, I think he's answered it
pretty well. I thought he was a lot more aggressive from the get-go. And you
never know why. All you can hope for guys that work as hard as he has, good
things will happen to him.  
And persevered, as we talked a lot this week, is he's had to prove to people
all his life, and I think he's a guy that most people can root for, not if
you're not an Ohio State fan, unfortunately, but he works at it. I don't know
why he's been a little more gun shy this year, but he picked a good time to
open it up.  
And as I said, you can finish your career on a great note and I think that's
the way he'll be remembered. I think that's what he'd like to do.  
  
Q. Tom, talk about the ability to handle the press. Only nine turnovers they
stayed in it the entire game?  
COACH IZZO: I think that was a big key. I'm not sure we turned it over once,
maybe once against the press. We had a couple of turnovers. There was a couple
of sloppy things early.  
I thought in general we handled the press very well. We did put in a few
wrinkles and they made some adjustments and we came with another wrinkle. And
I just thought, you know, all in all, when we got Raymar in the middle of the
zone, it was another big key at the end of the press, we felt we could kick
out to our guards. That's how Drew hit some of those shots.  
Where last time we played them our guards were hanging in the back court. And
so the biggest thing we worked on was getting our guards in the fight and not
letting them just linger in the background. And Ray then did a good job along
with Kalin and Travis of delivering the ball to the right people.  
  
Q. Could you expand a little more on Chris and Durrell getting their
contributions, I know you've wanted to get the freshmen more involved in this
run?  
COACH IZZO: Durrell made that big 3 and the driving layup. He's got some
energy. He's got some legs. I keep saying he's going to be a great player. And
I say that still could be this year. But I really do feel that there's just
times it's hard to get him in there as much.  
But I think he showed some real promise there in a couple of things he did.
And in Chris, you know, we played him a few more extended minutes the first
half than the second, because we were in a little bit of foul trouble with our
bigs, we had to move Ray to the 4. I thought he checked and handled himself
well. He missed some shots that I think he'll hit, but I'm not worried about
him making shots. He'll make shots.  
  
Q. Tom, with Drew playing 37 minutes playing as hard as he is, is there any
concern in your part with his legs going against Flowers tomorrow and just how
excited are you to play Wisconsin?  
COACH IZZO: I am excited. I mean, they've had our number, as we all know.
They've had a good team and have played very well. And, you know, I think
Flowers is one of the best defensive players in this league.  
And he did a great job today in parts of the game that I saw. We'll have to
get Drew some rest tonight. But it's a time of year, as he said, what have you
got left to hold it for? There's nothing left. We just have to be a little
smarter with using TV timeouts and things like that tomorrow and get him in
and out.  
But you gotta go with your best players and our best player's feeling good
now. So we know it's going to be even more difficult tomorrow. They guard very
well. They guarded very well today. And yet we think we guard pretty well and
we rebounded pretty well today. And we have to find a way to win a game. I'm
excited about the opportunity to get a chance to play them again.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you about the play with about a minute and 20 to go.
It's a three-point game and Ohio State had chipped away at you a little bit.
Morgan looked like he got in the lane got the ball to Walton in the corner.
Lucas up top great ball reversal over to Neitzel and the shot he makes all
your guys getting involved on that play?  
COACH IZZO: I think if great part they all got involved. I can't tell you how
many times this year we got some of those looks. To be honest, Drew struggled
some to make some of those shots. And to me it was like poetic justice that it
should go in.  
For a kid who works that hard, it was a fitting way, maybe, to put the final
stamp on and then when you get everybody involved, as you say from Ray to
Trav, to K, to Drew, it just made it even all the sweeter. That's something
we'll be able to talk tonight on how ball reversal would help us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about not getting to the line at all in the first half and
then 22 free throws in the second half?  
COACH IZZO: Well, a little bit was we probably got six at the end there. But
you're right, we were a lot more aggressive early in the second half. I
thought we took the ball to the basket a little bit more. Drew said he was
more aggressive. Kalin Lucas, trying to find his niche for when to go in for a
seven-footer and when not to. He wasn't getting the fouls called but he was at
least taking it in there.  
I thought we were more aggressive in general. We have to be. I mean that's
been one of the negatives. But it also helped to get Ray in the middle of that
zone. He did some real good things in the middle of that zone. And I think
having three small guards and him in there helped us a little bit, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Blake Hoffarber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18188)

### [Lawrence McKenzie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18187)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just like yesterday, we'll ask you to make a few opening
comments. We'll take questions for your players, then finish up with questions
for you.  
COACH SMITH: Certainly was a hard-fought game. There was a lot of ebb and flow
to it, and I thought we established a presence early in the game and I thought
that we were able to survive the onslaught and survive without Spencer
Tollackson and with our guys in foul trouble.  
I have to give it to Indiana. They did a super job of keeping the ball alive
and getting the second and third shots there at the end.  
Again, I have a lot of faith in these young men and the way they played and
we're just grateful to get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Blake or Lawrence.  
  
Q. What were you all thinking after D.J. White hits that free throw and goes
up with 1.5 seconds remaining?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: I just told the guys to calm down, and I really felt that
we had a chance to make a shot. It's just amazing. I'm still in shock right
now.  
But I really felt -- it's funny to say, but I felt like we had a chance to
make a shot. Blake got the ball. They threw the pass, perfect pass, Blake got
it. It went in. It was like I might have slapped myself two times; I thought I
was dreaming (laughter).  
  
Q. Obviously, Blake, what's better that shot or your Espy win?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: I think they're both equal. We got the win in both of those
games. I mean, that's all I want to do is win. I think all of us on the team
thought we could pull off that victory. It was kind of weird when they had a
couple of shots to win it with the free throws or go ahead -- they went ahead
and we called a timeout and Coach made up a good play and the guys executed it
and Travis threw a good pass. And I think we just got -- there's always a
little luck to a win.  
  
Q. Blake, if you could, just tell us exactly what the play was and what your
thoughts were when the ball left your hand?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: I was actually supposed to be a decoy. I was running off two
screens and just kind of being a decoy. But I saw the ball just kind of going
to the middle so I went up and grabbed it and just turned and tried to get it
off on time. And I guess it went off in time.  
  
Q. Did you feel like it was good?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: Yeah, I felt like it was good. I was kind of fading to the
corner so I couldn't really see it was -- it felt good but I couldn't see if
it was on target and I saw it go through. I was in shock.  
  
Q. After taking a 16-point lead, did you feel like you all really had to
walk away with the win because of what kind of loss that would have been?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: It would have been a disappointing loss but we know Indiana
is a great team and great players and they're going to fight back, even after
that first punch that we gave them.  
They did a great job of fighting back. And I'm not thinking about what if we
would have lost now. Because we got that win. Blake made a great shot. And
everybody's excited. But still have two more games to go.  
  
Q. I guess, Lawrence, this would have been the end of your NCAA tournament
hopes. What does it feel like to be surviving the events again and does it
seem likeliest of a miracle that you guys would be able to get an NCAA
tournament bid?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: Actually, this feels great. This feels great. But we really
don't want to stop at this game and hope, and hope. You know, we want to go --
we want to go and try and win it all. That's the goal. That's the goal for
each team that came in. We don't want to stop right now. I think -- I mean,
that shot -- I just feel like -- I don't know. I don't want to say it feels
like destiny, but something like that. Something of that nature.  
But we want to continue to keep on playing and get rest and come back and be
ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Obviously this game was an opportunity to avenge earlier losses against
Indiana. Illinois, know you face them tomorrow, can you talk about that
game?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: It's definitely a chance. Illinois has had us for a long
time. It's definitely a chance to come out there and prove something else.  
But we're focusing on the big goal. We're still focusing on the big goal. And
that's our goal, to get to the NCAA tournament. Coach has us think up -- in
the hotel, we have to think like champions. That's how we're thinking. That's
really helped us. I think it's about believing. Everybody believed. And I
think that's what really helped that shot.  
  
Q. Lawrence, can you talk about the team playing shorthanded, the character
that you guys displayed and Travis Busch doesn't play much all year then makes
the pass all year, can you talk about guys like him stepping up?  
LAWRENCE MCKENZIE: Busch, I can say so much about Busch. He came in, got on
the floor, got the loose ball and scrapped and at the end he made a great
pass. He did a great job. In a team -- in a game like this, you really come
together and get close, man. Sometimes a little too close. A couple of guys
kissed Blake (smiling).  
I think a game like this you get close and you bind together. And after you
win these type of games and after these type of things happen, you feel like
the next game has to be yours. And you work so hard and you got this one.  
So I think it definitely helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Blake, for those of us who don't know, can you tell us the shot that got
you on the Espy's and something about hitting shot while you're sitting down
or whatever for those who don't know?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: It was my sophomore year in high school and we were in the
state championship game and I don't remember how many seconds were left, but
it was kind of the same thing. And we were down by two and they threw it long
and I went up and the ball got bobbed around and I fell down and I shot it
from the corner on the corner by the baseline on the three-point line and made
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time. We'll finish up with questions for
Coach Smith.  
  
Q. A second ago you were shaking your head thinking about this game, is
there an element of disbelief about what just happened there?  
COACH SMITH: No, just time. It's late, it was a long day. Got a game to get
ready for tomorrow. This is over and done with. We'd like to stay with you all
night, I guess, but we can't. So we'd just like to hurry and get this over
with, that's why.  
  
Q. Tubby, in the immediate aftermath of the shot, you were by the scorer's
table and you looked a little bit agitated. What was going on?  
COACH SMITH: I'd rather not say.  
  
Q. Blake said that he was actually supposed to be a decoy. What was the play
you had drawn up?  
COACH SMITH: Well, he was actually supposed to get the ball, but at second
thought I said, no, Blake they're going to be looking for you, you're going to
be a decoy. So take it off and look for Dan and we'll throw it in the middle
of the lane the lane area to try to get a foul, get them going off our back
and maybe we can get that call. Maybe we'll get that call. Maybe we'll get
that call. (Laughter.)  
But he grabbed the call and he was able to get the shot off, but he did catch
it and it was in that area and, right, Travis Busch has never really thrown
that pass. We've run that play in practice, but he's got one of the better
arms.  
And you can't say enough about a kid who is a walk-on, on a scholarship this
year. He does all the things the right way. Plays his heart out. Set the tone
defensively for us. And that's what we're looking for guys that play with that
type of heart and that type of hustle.  
I really thought he set a pace for us. And it's a great reward for him to get
that opportunity to make that pass and be a part of that play to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Michael Flowers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17046)

### [Joe Krabbenhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18168)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have Coach Ryan make a couple of quick opening comments
then we'll take questions for Michael or Joe. And then we'll finish up with
questions for Coach Ryan. Go ahead, Coach.  
COACH RYAN: I'm impressed with the way our guys just hung in there trying to
get acclimated to playing here and the noon game and the whole thing.  
We had the energy. We just weren't executing as well as I thought we could
have. And then they caught themselves. They got the free throw line. They did
some very good things defensively picking up for one another. And hit some
shots when we needed them.  
So I think it was a great effort by the entire team and all the guys picked up
Brian Butch in the locker room, and told him he'll be okay tomorrow, right
guys?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Michael Flowers or Joe Krabbenhoft.  
  
Q. Guys, talk about your defense. You held Michigan to 20 percent shooting
for the entire game. Just talk about the defense?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: The scout team did a great job of preparing us for this game.
Last game we played them at home they outrebounded us, they were physically
more dominant than we were. So we wanted to come out here and put our foot
down and play Wisconsin basketball. And that's hard, in-your-face defense.  
  
Q. You talk about Marcus Landry, the way he played in the second half and
what he's meant to this team?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: Marcus Landry is an underrated ABA player. He can score with
his back to the basket. He can take you off the dribble. He showed his
athleticism or some drives to the lane. I mean, he's an all-around player. He
causes some matchups. So to our benefit. And we give him the ball down low so
he can do his things. He also has good court awareness and sees the open man
and passes the ball really well.  
COACH RYAN: Mike saw a lot of the ABA stuff on the way down. If he saw the
corridor here -- there's some people here (laughter).  
  
Q. Specifically you said Harris caused you a lot of trouble in Madison,
specifically defensive player of the year. Did that give you motivation today
or can you talk about that?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: Pretty much winning is my motivation. I go out there, work
hard just like everybody else. I do things. I get on the floor. I take charges
for my teammates. You know, nobody ever wants to get scored on, and that's
what I pride myself on is really stopping my opponent and causing him havoc
and just disrupting the flow of his game. Doing that ultimately benefits my
team.  
  
Q. Joe, you led the team in points, but you had five scores -- you had five
players score seven points or more. Could you talk about the total team effort
today just to get the ball in the hoop?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: I think that's the way it's been all year. If you've been
watching us, that this team is so versatile, everybody can put it in the hoop.
We're not worried about who goes out and is the leading scorer. We're just
worried about the team being up at the end of the game.  
So it's been like that all year. Great contributions from everybody. The
starting five, everybody who played today did a great job. The guys coming in
at the end.  
So another team victory for Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Joe, since Michigan played yesterday you guys obviously didn't. That
said, can you talk about the importance of the start you guys had to the game
today?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Yeah, I mean, it's very important to come out in every game
and try to get, build some momentum, get an early lead, whatnot. I thought we
did a good job of that today. Michigan stayed in it, but our defense, what
we've been hanging our hat on, you know, since the beginning of the year, took
us all the way to this one.  
So credit to our defense and everybody stepping up and playing really hard.  
  
Q. Mike, just talk about your defense on Manny Harris. What did you do
differently this time? Were you a little bit more physical with him this time
than you were at the Kohl Center?  
MICHAEL FLOWERS: I started focusing on the little things, making sure I got
over to the screens, and if he did -- caught the ball, it was more towards
half court. Away from the basket. We took care of the ball, which eliminated
any transition points that they could possibly have. I know at the Kohl Center
they had a good amount of transition points. So we took care of the ball, had
good shots and rebounded it throughout the game really well.  
  
Q. Joe, you've played with Mike for three years now. Have you seen him more
focused maybe defensively than he was today?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: Mike's been focused since the day I stepped on campus. He's
the most intense player, whether it be in the weight room, up in the practice
facility, just shooting around, playing pickup ball when we're in practice and
especially out on the floor. He gives it 110 percent every time. I admire him.
I respect him.  
And obviously he's a lot quicker and more athletic than I am, but hopefully
some day I can keep on trying to play defense like Mike. We all look up to
him. And he does a great job of leading this team and teaching the younger
guys how to play with your heart and play hard, and it's just a joy for me to
play with Mike.  
  
Q. Joe, you mentioned it didn't matter how many points you scored, just that
the team won. Can you remember, though, the last time you led the team in
scoring in a game and does this mean you can lobby for more shots now?  
JOE KRABBENHOFT: In high school, maybe. It really doesn't -- you can ask
anybody on this team the same question. We really don't care. You're not going
to get anything out of us because this is a total team effort. Every time we
go out. And we're just focused on winning. Whatever. I'm not trying to get
more shots. I miss too many. (Laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, fellas. We'll finish up with questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked these guys the same question, but if you can talk about
Marcus Landry, the way he played the second half of the day and what he's
meant to the team overall?  
COACH RYAN: Well, his presence, again, Michael said it better than I could, is
that he is an inside and an outside player who has gotten better in his all-
around game. That does cause some problems for the other team. Not that the
other teams don't have guys that are similar.  
But I like what Marcus is getting out of his opportunities. So I love coaching
guys that are opportunistic. And he's one of them.  
  
Q. Bo, yesterday Michigan really packed it in the lane keeping Iowa on the
perimeter. Were you guys more conscientious of trying to get inside early and
just open that up for your outside shooters?  
COACH RYAN: Well, in 1972 the junior high school team I put out on the court,
I told them we had to touch the post. What is this? 2008. Before this game, we
have to touch the post. That never changes.  
  
Q. From your experience, the Big Ten tournament, what impact does it
generally have on the NCAA tournaments, tend to help you, hurt you, or what do
you think?  
COACH RYAN: Now that I've been around a little bit, when you guys used to ask
me that question the first couple of years, it was, well, we got beat the
first game both times. So we were home getting rest and getting ready for the
NCAA tournament. So we went 1-2 and then 2-1, those two years. And then in the
next year, we play in the championship game, a very physical, tough game
against Illinois in '05 -- no, '04, we end up playing in the championship.  
And we lose to Pitt, very good, probably the best 3 seed that ever played in
the NCAA tournament by a lot of the experts.  
The following year we go in and we get to the finals again. We get beat by
Illinois, and so we go 2-1 and then we go in the NCAA tournament and lose to
Carolina in the last minute.  
Want me to take you through the other two? So I did this. I went all right in
'06 we were just, you know, we played well enough to make the NCAA tournament
because of our strength of schedule, the RPI, winning record in the Big Ten
that year.  
And then we lose in the first round to an Arizona team that gets their best
player back after being suspended for some incident. So Arizona was the better
team. Last year, I felt -- I can't really give you an estimate because Brian
Butch goes down and it's very hard to say.  
But what I like is every time you get a chance to play a game, I think it's
good. But if you get the opportunity to play on Sunday, you just hope you're
not playing Thursday. A lot of coaches in the league before, they're not in
the Big Ten anymore, guys say they hope that if they get into the Sunday game,
the first game's Friday. For obvious reasons. These are tough, physical games.  
  
Q. What explanation did you get on the technical foul? Looked like you were
yelling just at the fact that the layup was missed. Is that what happened and
what was --  
COACH RYAN: That was frustration at a player. But maybe it's an age
discrimination thing, because I don't think officials think I can move as
quickly as I do. I think I fool 'em (flinching), because they catch me out of
the corner of their eye. I don't know. I really don't know.  
But I wasn't real happy that we didn't finish on the play, but it had to do
with my player that I was frustrated with. It didn't have anything to do with
anything else.  
  
Q. How do you continually get kids to buy into the defensive mind-set that
you have, because it doesn't always lead to pretty games or gaudy offensive
stats?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I think Michigan spent more time running the shot clock down
than we did. So that's an unfair statement. Michigan wanted that type of game.
They felt they could win that game. So if we play good defense and the other
team's taking a lot of time off the shot clock, what's that have to do with
our offense?  
I kind of like Jason Bohannon behind the back pass and Marcus Landry filling
in the middle. We can do that when we get opportunities.  
In the Big Ten how many easy shots do you get at the other end? It is so hard.
It's hard. Try it sometime. It's hard.  
  
Q. Michael didn't get Big Ten player of the year. Harris scored 26 on you
guys up at --  
COACH RYAN: Didn't get Big Ten player of the year.  
  
Q. On defense. Harris got 26 up in Madison on your team. Do you think
Michael took the challenge today, maybe had a little bit extra motivation?  
COACH RYAN: You know, Mike played hard at our place. I looked at the film a
couple times. And Manny just made some really tough shots and in transition
sometimes when Mike was helping out protecting the rim, Harris was able to get
the ball and make some things happen offensively. So it wasn't always a one-
on-one matchup.  
The other thing is a couple of rebounds that came off, Manny got --
surprisingly so, not because he can't go get 'em, but just the luck of the
bounce, Manny Harris got two or three baskets off of offensive rebounds that
are very rare for Michael to ever give up. You could just tell on tape he was
just caught off guard.  
But did he handle this any differently? No. His teammates helped him recover.
And I think in all fairness Michigan was trying to use some of their other
weapons, which they've had some success with, obviously. And to Manny's
credit, I can't say that he forced -- what, he's 1 for 12. I don't think he
forced a lot. Maybe one or two. Excuse me. But I don't catch the other team so
you'll have to ask them. But he had some looks. He just didn't knock them
down.  
But Michael plays hard all the time. I've never worried about that. Joe was
correct in his assessment of Michael Flowers.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I think you know the drill. Couple opening comments, we'll
start with questions with the players and then finish with questions for Coach
Weber.  
COACH WEBER: It would be an understatement to say it wasn't a big win for us,
especially with the struggles we've had through the year. We've been through
this drill over and over and give great efforts, emotional efforts and then
don't seem to find a way to win.  
And it looked like we had it a couple times. Looked like they had it a couple
of times. But we made the plays. We needed somebody to be special. And Demetri
was very special. I think somebody said 6-for-6 from 3. If that's right, it's
pretty good, even though Purdue's three-point shooting was unbelievable.
Chester was on more many times than he made shots. So it was special for us
but we came here to win the thing. We can't get too high.  
The next half hour enjoy, talk about it, then we have to go back to the hotel
and see if we can get enough energy to find a way to win tomorrow.  
So it's got to be our mind-set. We shot the ball pretty well. I thought for
most of it Shaun did a great job inside. You know, there's no doubt the
freshmen might have been the key to the game. We had four freshmen in. Their
freshmen have been great all year. But our four freshmen, Jeffrey Jordan, Mike
Davis and Mike Tisdale and Demetri, got us back into the game which helped us
tie it which was a really big boost.  
Shaun's tip in to tie it at the end of the half, if you get that last bucket
and then you come out and get the first bucket of the second half, or have
someone land them, it definitely helps. So Purdue has had a tremendous season.
They're going to have a high seed in the tournament. I think they can win some
games.  
I'm just happy we were able to find a way to win a game and get to play
another day and continue to enjoy the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for any of the three Illinois players,
please.  
  
Q. Demetri, when did you feel it tonight? Looked like everything you were
throwing up was going in. And related to that, their freshman have gotten so
much national publicity but tonight you guys stole the show. Did you talk
about that before the game?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: No, we had a game plan and going out playing hard and playing
with intensity and let everything carry over for itself. Just made big plays.
Coach said we needed a trigger someone to step up and be special tonight.
Fortunately I was that player. But my teammates helped me out a lot too
screening, the four freshmen, myself, Jeffrey, Mike Tisdale -- and Mike
Tisdale played real good -- and Brian Randle helped us down the stretch, too.  
  
Q. Demetri three-point shooting, hitting six of six, can you talk about
that, particularly the last one you hit that forced the overtime from so far
out?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: Felt really good. Usually I hit my first shot, and then shoot
it again and keep shooting, and in this game I was feeling good and felt
comfortable out there.  
  
Q. Shaun, can you talk about the difference in winning a close game after
the dozens of close games it seems you guys lost this year?  
SHAUN PRUITT: Unbelievable feeling. It's sad we couldn't do this earlier. This
is the time to do it. The biggest thing is to close out wins like this it was
such a good team effort and I'm just so proud of the freshmen and the team
effort just is what helped us close out the game.  
  
Q. Question for Mike Davis, please. With Purdue having a 15-0 run, you guys
finished the first half out with a 15-3 run. Mike, you had three big buckets
there. Your thoughts out there running about the Illini?  
MIKE DAVIS: Our captain, Brian Randle, got in foul trouble, he told me to go
in and play with confidence, hit the open shot if I'm open. And Demetri found
me a couple of times, Jeff found me, and Chester found me once, so I hit the
open shot.  
  
Q. Shaun, they had no answer for you, nobody who could match up with you
physically. Could you talk about the advantage you had inside and what that,
what difference that made in the game?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I think it made a big difference. I think any time a team would
double-team you or something like that, it's a good way to go inside out. And
fortunately Demetri got hot and then Brian cut to the basket.  
I remember one time I faced up and saw double team coming and Brian was wide
open. So it just -- it makes it a little bit easier on myself and especially
when my teammates keep moving and got open and things like that. So I was
happy about that.  
  
Q. Mike, late in the game you guys were up 3. I think Demetri drove to the
hoop, somehow the ball didn't go in, you followed. Can you talk about that
play?  
MIKE DAVIS: Yeah, it was a two-on-one with Demetri and Chester. Looked like
Demetri got fouled, but I was driving on the play, so I instinctively followed
the shot and he missed and I just put it back in.  
  
Q. Mike, you and the other freshmen, as Coach Weber mentioned, have really
-- were in the spotlight tonight. Talk about how you guys were able to do that
mentally, knowing that Purdue was a team that had accomplished so much and
really is a poised team despite its youth?  
MIKE DAVIS: Right. Their team is all freshmen, start what three or four
freshmen. So we just wanted to go out and match how they played and just try
to come out strong in the half, end the first half on the run. They made a run
and we made a run in the first half. At the end of the game we came out big
and made plays and shots fell our way.  
  
Q. Shaun, in preparing for this ball game, you guys have already lost twice
to Purdue this year and the coaches as good friends as they are, anything
going through your mind thinking it's going to be tough to beat these guys?  
SHAUN PRUITT: I think personally when you beat a team twice, I think it makes
them dangerous because it's hard to beat a team three times. So we were
definitely up and ready for Purdue today. But you gotta give them a lot of
credit. They're a tough team.  
We knew it was going to be a dogfight. Going into the scouting report last
night, the biggest thing was we need to play them hard and match their
intensity. I think we did a good job of doing that today.  
  
Q. Demetri, I know you don't know who you'll play next, but what will be
your thoughts about the possibility of playing Indiana again?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: Doesn't matter. We're playing the winner tomorrow, get ready
for them tonight once we find out. Doesn't really matter. We're here to play
basketball.  
  
Q. Any of the players, I know a little has been talked about the play of
Jeff Jordan tonight. Talk about how he did tonight, he stepped up and came
into his own tonight?  
SHAUN PRUITT: Jeff was huge. His defense is something very good for our team.
Any time you play defense you can always play Illinois. So I think that's his
niche, to step in and play and help us out. And he definitely did a good job
of that today. He's been doing it all year for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. We'll finish up for questions with Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Bruce, you guys opened the overtime. You got three layups. Was there
anything you were doing differently that led to those three plays?  
COACH WEBER: You know, one thing we talked about was just keeping our spacing
and trying to get Shaun off the block. And somebody mentioned to us, we played
last night and they didn't. And it seemed like in overtime, you know, they
were a little bit maybe gassed.  
And we had some energy. I know -- I thought Grant was cramping. Somebody
mentioned that to me. And we just got high and wide and made some great
passes, got some easy layups and broke their spirit a little bit. And
uncharacteristically they've been so good about keeping their poise,
especially on the road. And they came down and rushed some things where they
really haven't done that all year.  
So I'm not -- I would like to say I drew something up or whatever, but it was
just good ball movement, good spacing, and getting it to the right people at
the right time.  
  
Q. Coach, where was this all year?  
COACH WEBER: I've told you before, the guys that have covered us, it's just
disappointing, because really it should have been here. And if it means if we
can figure it out here at the end and find a way to do something and actually
get through tomorrow and make -- do something special on Sunday, I guess it's
worth it.  
But I wish the journey wouldn't have been so long. Free throws, obviously, are
still a bugaboo. You're eight for 20 and you still win the game in overtime,
have a bunch of chances down the stretch to kind of put it away.  
But I'm just happy if we finally got to them and got to them believing in
winning and the team. And Mike Davis told me today, if he plays more than 15
minutes, we're 8-2. So we got him to 17 minutes today, and we're now at 9-2.
So maybe I should listen to the players more (laughter).  
  
Q. You mentioned free throws, but you also turned the ball over, over 20
times. And so how do you win when you turn the ball over 20 times and make
less than half of your free throws against a good team?  
COACH WEBER: You shoot the ball 60 percent. When you did take care of it, we
got good shots and held them to 30 percent. The only time they seemed to score
was more making spectacular shots or a little dribble handoff play, which we
talked about in the huddle several times, we just didn't defend it very well.  
We also kind of controlled the boards. I think that was important, and
sometimes you can't explain it. There's lots of games we've lost this year
where we've dominated the stats and we haven't won it.  
Sometimes if you keep the right attitude -- that's really what we've talked
about, the whole week's thoughts have been keeping the right attitude and
hanging together and keeping our poise, not letting anything set us back. And
I did this thing about brick walls that I heard, we showed a lecture to the
guys, we kept talking about brick walls in the timeouts. Brick walls aren't
there to stop you, they're there to see you how much you really want it. And I
think tonight they showed they really want it.  
And so if I got 'em believing in some things now, that's great. Hopefully they
keep doing it through tomorrow into Sunday.  
  
Q. One guy who didn't score a point played more minutes than anybody else
was Chester Frazier. How much do you think he's got left because his knee?  
COACH WEBER: I don't know. I looked at it saw 45 minutes and he's chasing
Moore and he's chasing Grant and he didn't cramp. So that's positive. If he
has two legs and they're moving, you know he's going to play. The question we
have is can he do it for 40 more minutes tomorrow and then Sunday.  
So a good thing is Jeffrey Jordan got some minutes, and now maybe a little
more confident we can get Chester in and out. We're probably going to have to
watch that tomorrow. And really all the guys, you gotta watch them. It's
Demetri's 42 minutes and that's a whole bunch for anybody.  
So it's fatigue, you know, but again how much do they want it? Are you going
to let it -- you can't think about it. You can't let it be a factor.  
Our women had -- last weekend they were here they had nine people, six played
in -- I think in the night they beat Ohio State, the No. 1 seed. And they came
back and won the next game and got to the finals. And with such a short bench.
So we've talked about them all week, too, that if they can do it why can't we.  
  
Q. Tournament now in the 11th year, you now with a 19-8 record. You've been
here with some very good teams, one with a losing record. Is it something in
you or something that really -- do you come out in this tournament?  
COACH WEBER: I hope it's in me. I don't know. I think some of it is a
situation, obviously our first couple of years we had very, very good teams.
And you know got to the finals a couple times. We did lose to Michigan State
one year in the four or five game after we beat them, which kind of same
scenario Ohio State had.  
But just, A, it's important. Last year we were fighting for getting in the
NCAA. We were a in a major bubble, probably didn't get in unless we beat
Indiana in the Friday night in overtime and get into the tournament. This year
we're just fighting for our basketball lives see if we can do something like
Iowa did winning four games and getting in the tournament. I think we're good
enough. We show we can compete with everybody.  
We've played one of the most top 50 teams in the country -- I don't know, this
is our 13th or 14th top 50 team. Up to this point, we haven't won one. I told
them if we are going to get anywhere, we have to win one.  
We did tonight. I hope it's a boost in confidence that we can get over the
hump and do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Dan Dakic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18186)

### [Eric Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18185)

### [D.J. White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17062)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd ask if you would make a couple of quick opening comments,
then we'll take questions for D.J. and Eric and finish up with questions for
yourself.  
COACH DAKICH: Well, that was a disappointing the way we started the basketball
game. But I was proud of our team the way we competed. Hoffarber hit a tough
shot, probably the toughest shot in his career, other than the one I saw on TV
from his back.  
We didn't start the game. We didn't come to play, start the game -- had a
pretty good couple days of practice, looked ready to play in shoot-around. But
every -- never mind.  
But over the course of the last 30 minutes of the game I thought, you know, we
competed, didn't make any shots, but we were competing again on the defensive
end. As I said, it's probably the best we played defense all year, the last
three games. They made a tough shot. But when you put yourself in the hole
like that it's the uphill battle. I'm proud of the guys, I thought we had a
team that battled and fought, just made a shot to beat us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Eric or D.J., please.  
  
Q. D.J., how quickly do you try to put this loss behind you because you know
there's bigger fish to fry next week?  
D.J. WHITE: Quick as possible. Losses like this always hurt, also -- you never
forget it, especially when we want to advance and try to win this whole
tourney, but there's nothing we can do now. So we just have to try to put it
behind us, wait for Sunday and see what happens.  
  
Q. D.J., you missed your first three free throws. You just didn't seem like
you were comfortable there all night. Can you just explain what your feeling
at the line?  
D.J. WHITE: I just missed my first three. Hit a couple straight. Missed my
last two and hit my last one. So it wasn't nothing I was feeling tonight. I
feel the same way when I shoot them. They just didn't go in. But I adjusted to
it.  
  
Q. Can you describe what you saw on that last play and the long basketball
pass from where you were, D.J., and all?  
D.J. WHITE: To tell you the truth, I just remember it sailing over my head. I
was guarding Coleman and he was kind of above the three-point line and it went
over my head. I turned around and the shot was going in. That's all I remember
about the play.  
ERIC GORDON: Well, I don't -- it was just a crazy catch. I saw the other three
players, D.J., three players going right after the ball and it got tipped in a
way and Hoffarber, he just -- he just caught it and he threw it in.  
  
Q. D.J., down seven points at halftime. Your play starting in the second
half, was it something you felt like, hey, I'm the leader of this team, I need
to take over and you did it in field goals and mainly at the free throw
line?  
D.J. WHITE: We needed a boost. Once again, when we came out, we came out slow.
That's something we've got to correct going into this last tournament.  
But, yeah, I just tried to pick my team up. We started playing. We started
defending well and put the ball in the basket. At the end of the game, it just
didn't go our way.  
  
Q. How much does it hurt that it especially came down to missed free
throws?  
COACH DAKICH: It came down to a made free throw, when he made the free throw
to put us up. He wasn't going to get three free throws.  
  
Q. But they were free throws that he missed?  
COACH DAKICH: Came down to a kid made a shot with 1.5 seconds to go.  
  
Q. But if you would have made the free throws --  
COACH DAKICH: Never mind, you're right. He made the free throw when it was
needed the most, with 1.5 seconds to go. Which was pretty good for him, given
the fact that he missed a few before.  
So I understand you can go the other way with that, but you can also be kind
of positive. Like, man, that's a pretty gutsy move, stepping up and knocking
in a free throw when you've missed so many. And he would not have had the
other ones had he made it.  
  
Q. Eric, just before D.J.'s interim heroics, on your second free throw, were
you trying to miss at an angle?  
ERIC GORDON: Yeah, people on the team, they told me to miss and I understood
that. And I know the only player that would really get it was D.J. I tried to
hit it softly around the rim, and, I mean, I knew he caught it and then got an
"and" one.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the lift that DeAndre gave you guys tonight?  
D.J. WHITE: He gave us a big lift. Coach said in the locker room he practiced
well, he deserved to play good this week. So he helped us a lot in a lot of
different areas. He did help us a lot.  
  
Q. Talk about what this game meant playing in Indianapolis, you played in
Chicago, a Big Ten tournament, what it meant to have a lot of your fans in
your house?  
D.J. WHITE: Means a lot to have fan support. We have one of the best fans in
college basketball. They travel well, travel to see us and they're 45 minutes
away from our university. So it was good to have the support tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Eric and D.J., thank you for your time. We'll finish with
questions for Coach Dakich, please.  
  
Q. Dan, you've had to bring -- pull this thing out, bring this team together
so many times. How you do you pull it together after something like this?  
COACH DAKICH: I don't know. It's part of life. I thought we had a team that
kind of bonded together throughout the course of the game. Truly, at the end
of the day, if guys don't understand it, they've got to get ready to play for
the NCAA tournament. After all, nobody should have to bring anybody together
to play in that.  
Now, this is disappointing. It's awful. Awful for me. Awful for IU fans. Awful
for the players.  
But you got another opportunity and kids are -- and you know this, you've
dealt with it -- kids are resilient. Kids bounce back. A lot better than
adults do. So we'll just meet tomorrow night, practice Sunday and get ready
for whoever we play.  
But it's been an interesting couple of weeks, obviously. And have had a chance
-- that was a real chance, I thought, tonight, to maybe do something special
with this group here in this tournament, given the fact that probably, you
know, it would have stole a win, I guess, for a better way to put it, based on
being down five as late as we were.  
  
Q. Do you try to put this loss behind you and forget about it or do you look
forward and say we can use it for motivation going into next week?  
COACH DAKICH: Maybe both. I mean, you can't dwell on it once you get to play
your next game, obviously. But you also have to learn why you got off to a bad
start, who is responsible. And then why were you able to come back. DeAndre's
play, somebody mentioned that to the players. DeAndre's play was phenomenal,
but it was practice.  
That's a hard loss. I'm not going to lie to you. That's a hard loss personally
for me, given the environment, Indianapolis, the deal here. And for our
players.  
And I again say personally for me, I'm including my feeling for the players in
there, which is why I'm so defensive of our players. Somebody says, well, you
lost because of free throws, meaning they blew the game. That's not what
happened.  
So it's a hard loss, but it's part of life. And with anything you get, that
happens to you that's difficult, you learn from it. Hopefully you grow from it
and you get better from it.  
But that's what we'll try to do. But this is a tough loss. Obviously. You tell
Noah about the flood, I guess, but it's a tough loss.  
  
Q. You had a couple of the same themes that you had at Penn State, struggled
from the free throw line and Minnesota had 16 offensive rebounds. Can you talk
about --  
COACH DAKICH: We just haven't made shots. I mean, we make them pretty well in
practice. I mean -- we do practice them. I mean, I'm not sure anybody shoots
more, maybe Butler. But we practice and practice and practice. I think we have
good shooters, I think we take good shots.  
The offensive rebounding, I don't know how else they scored, truthfully. I
know Westbrook hit a 3 off the top of my head. I'm looking here. They've got
10 baskets. I'm thinking to myself, what did they get in transition, which
wasn't much.  
Westbrook hit a 3. Johnson hit a couple of jump shots. I think everything else
was off a loose ball or tip to lay it in. That's unfortunate, because I
thought our defense was pretty good. I think it's been pretty good. But I know
one time we got the ball ripped out of our hands.  
I don't know. Like a perfect storm of you got the lead and you don't and you
have a chance to win it and you're sitting there thinking if you make one of
the threes and you've got a chance.  
They made a great play, did a great job, Hoffarber. I'll have to watch the
film. We called time out. We saw the set up. We put Ellis where we wanted him,
on top of him. Drew a line, said you're here, they come off switch.  
My sense of it was guys got -- he got pinned in, somebody switched late. He
got the ball, somebody said it was tipped. They made a great play. The kid out
of bounds made a great pass. So hell of a play by them.  
  
Q. When you have a team that's shooting, as struggling from three-point
range as bad as they have in the past couple of games, do you talk about it,
talk to them about it in practice or do you try not to bring it up let them
work that out on their own?  
COACH DAKICH: It's like a guy that sends you a highlight tape. And in the
highlight tape he's shooting 3s, he makes 20 3s in a row, different
highlights. Send you a highlight tape. You go to his stats and you say, man,
he's a 40 percent shooter. So where is the highlight tape with 30 misses in a
row, you know what I mean, after 20 made?  
That's what I've talked to them about. You're shooting 0-for-6, Eric you're
0-for-6, you're a 50 percent, good look three-point shooter. Go have a 6-for-6
night.  
That's how I approach it and we work hard on it. We show them film of the
shots going in. We work on things -- but in truth we just haven't made shots.
We thought might have been a little tired, so we cut back on practice. Went
twice, didn't practice Monday. Went twice Tuesday. Once Wednesday, once
Thursday. It was energetic, but just didn't make it. I'll sit here all day
because I know as soon as I'm by myself it's miserable. So I'd rather talk
about it.  
  
Q. Has your team gotten past what happened to Kelvin, and do they need to
get past it in order to move on?  
COACH DAKICH: Yeah. It's one of the things I said at halftime. I said at
halftime, this is -- come on, let's go here. They've been great in practice.
They're fine. Much has been made about how a guy looks at me on the bench or
somebody says something. All that kind of stuff. They've got to. There's no
ifs, ands or buts. Because he ain't coming back. And you got -- you want to
play your college season, you want to play NCAA tournament, you better be
ready to play because as it looks like right now -- because my guess is we're
going to play somebody really good in the first round. Sure they need to.  
  
Q. You said coming into this tournament you felt something special could
happen if you could you go into the NCAA and have that same feeling, make
something possibly special happen there.  
COACH DAKICH: What would happen if I said no, can't do it. Hell no. There
ain't no -- yes, we can. I think we can go in the NCAA tournament and make
something special happen. You know, that's what -- kids, like I said, to your
question, Bob, kids are resilient. I'm going to go all Kiss back in the '70s,
tear up the hotel room on tour probably tonight, something like that
(laughing).  
But kids are resilient. I do two things when depression hits: One is I eat,
and the other I try to make jokes, as you can't tell, so something like this,
I'm going to have a freakin' half a side of beef while I'm telling Henny
Youngman stories or something. Some people don't eat when they get crazy, but
I eat and try to make jokes of things, if I'm not breaking stuff.  
  
Q. Coach, you've really struggled from the field shooting. You had 25 free
throws of your 58 points. Do you think you can correct that within the next
week and maybe get a little more field goals?  
COACH DAKICH: You know, I think -- I do think two things happen to win, in my
opinion. You've got to play defense. When you get in the conference
tournaments or NCAA tournaments, you've got to make shots. Just watch the NCAA
tournament. Guys make shots.  
Tonight, say whatever you want about the game, we played bad to start. We
played well during the middle. We competed like crazy for the first 30
minutes, blah, blah, blah, missed, made, whatever we did with free throws. You
say whatever you want, that kid made the shot to win the game. He misses a
shot, we win the game. I swear to you, if you watch the NCAA tournament, the
two things: guarding and making shots.  
So for us to be a good or a viable NCAA team, we have to make shots. Usually
when you're not making shots -- and this was a little bit the other day, you
are taking bad ones. I didn't think we took bad ones. I thought we took pretty
good shots. I thought Eric's 3s were good. I thought Armon's 3s were pretty
good. Other than those two guys, we didn't really shoot any. But you gotta be
able to make them. You do. You have to guard and be able to make shots.  
  
Q. Dan, how soon after the game did you know that that was the same kid who
made that shot from the seat of his pants? Did you know that before?  
COACH DAKICH: Yeah, I knew that before the game. Bob, here's what I do. This
is sad. It's tragic, really, but I get to the office at 8:00 in the morning
and I watch film until practice. And then I go to practice and then I watch
more and then I go home. So there isn't -- I think I know Hoffarber's life
story. As Johnson's and Williams'. As everyone. I'm trying to do everything I
can here to make sure these kids are in a great position, so I don't want to
-- it's probably -- you're probably going to read a couple things about me
this spring, a divorce, kids will leave, the whole thing. You know what I'm
saying. But that's not true, by the way. My wife is standing right there. So
I'm just kidding about that part of it. But you get my point.  
And the irony of the whole thing today truly is this: For whatever the reason,
for whatever the reason, all week long, I think it was ESPN -- no, it was the
Big Ten Network has been playing the 1989 Indiana versus Illinois game, like
I've seen it at least twice. Well, the game Jay Edwards hits a shot over the
back board from the left-hand side and Nick Anderson throws it in from half
court with one second to go. I've seen that shot.  
Between that and watching Hoffarber the other night on TV throw one from his
back, it is what it is right here today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Jamar Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17147)

### [Kosta Koufos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17783)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'd like you to make a couple quick opening comments,
then we'll take questions for the players and then finish up with you.  
COACH MATTA: I think obviously hard-fought game. Michigan State made some huge
plays down the stretch. I thought our defense was off the charts there to
start the second half.  
And, you know, they got us from the foul line and Neitzel came out firing and
made some huge shots, the 3 there late when we cut it to two, we were in
scramble mode and he shot it from about 25 feet. I mean, that was probably the
back-breaker for us.  
But they were a very good basketball team, and I felt like going in at
halftime we were in the position that we wanted to be and came out and got a
quick layup to start the second half then we hit a little bit of a slide there
offensively. We were struggling to get a bucket, which is a credit to their
defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for either of the Ohio State players now.  
  
Q. Kosta, can you talk about the sequence where you got the offensive foul
then a couple more quick fouls, things just started going against you guys a
little bit there. Was it hard to bounce back from that at all?  
KOSTA KOUFOS: I just wanted to play hard through that. You know the referees
know better than I do with the calls. And I just wanted to play through it.
Had great teammates to pick me up. And not much to be said about it.  
  
Q. Jamar, do you think this is an NAC tournament team?  
JAMAR BUTLER: I think so. I think we've shown this past week with the two
teams we beat with Michigan State being one of them and Purdue the other one,
the kind of ball we're playing right now I have to say we are.  
  
Q. What will it be like the next couple of days, Jamar, as you're waiting
until Sunday knowing that it's out of your hands now waiting for Selection
Sunday?  
JAMAR BUTLER: Try to make it like any other day. Pretty sure we're going to
look at film of this game and go about everything like we normally always do.
Next time we practice, go back on the court and go back to work.  
  
Q. Jamar, looks like you guys are obviously playing a lot better. Does it
bother you a little bit that you're in this position now where if you had
played a little better a little sooner you might not be waiting like this? You
look like right now you're a tournament team, but maybe that's -- what
happened before that might cost you.  
JAMAR BUTLER: I really don't look back on things and say if and, I mean, we're
here now. It is what it is. And I don't know how to even do the selection
committee. I don't know how they put teams in. But I think we're one of the
top 65 teams in the country.  
  
Q. Jamar, can you talk about the intensity of the game? It felt like almost
every possession for both teams, there were very few easy shots, just seemed
like everybody was in each other's face the whole game?  
JAMAR BUTLER: It was very physical out there. It was a battle. This is a
typical Big Ten game. And we knew what it was going to be like coming in. It
was tough out there. I'm sure we'll be sore tomorrow, some bumps and bruises.  
  
Q. Kosta, this is the second game in a row where you didn't start the game
but when you got in the game immediately made an impact, 13 points in the
first half. Just talk about maybe that changing role, not if it's permanent or
anything, but that difference for you coming off the bench and the way you
responded to it?  
KOSTA KOUFOS: Of course, Matta knows best. He runs the team well. I want to
come in and provide a presence off the bench. God blessed me with wonderful
teammates and wonderful talent, and I just want to play wonderful for 40
minutes.  
  
Q. Jamar, can you talk about your 3 at the end of the first half, the play
you guys set up and what it was like to hit that and go into halftime tied?  
JAMAR BUTLER: I think it was a great play that Coach drew up on the board. And
I think that gave us a little bit of momentum going in, to start the second
half. And we started off good, easy layup, and seemed like every loose ball
just fell into their hands and Neitzel hit a big 3.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll finish up with questions for Coach Matta now.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Michigan State's ability to deal with the press
Sunday, made a big difference, and today it seemed like they were able to deal
with it?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think one of the big -- the two times we played Michigan
State and the press was very effective in the second half. And we talked about
taking it off in the second half from the standpoint of we felt like we were
getting fouled. I think the big difference they looked at today, what they
did, is they looked to attack more once they got it down. Sunday at our place
they were resetting and the shot clock a lot of times was at like 15 seconds.
Give them credit.  
But we like the fact that they were speeding up because we wanted to try to
get it up and down a little bit more. And so they did obviously a better job
of taking care of the ball.  
  
Q. Kind of what I asked Jamar before, looks like you're playing a lot better
right now. Is it tough for you? Looks like right now if you base this on the
last week or so you guys are definitely a tournament team. But do you feel
kind of, I don't know, a little concerned because you didn't start a little
sooner?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think -- you know you hope they take this into
consideration. You know, we went 35 and 4 last year, played for the national
championship. And had one guy who was a player -- Othello, David and Matt had
a role on that team last year. Some games it was more, but no guy played over
20 minutes a game.  
As you look at this team and I think the one thing we did is we went out and
we played one hell of a schedule. I think in the RPI we've played one, two,
whatever, I don't know.  
And I don't think when you have as many new guys as we have this year, people,
like you lose, people complain about it the next morning. Then they're on to
the next thing. Well, a team, when you're as young as we are, you hang onto
that. You ride emotional confidence. You ride a roller coaster. And this team
has been that way and I think it's been obvious.  
Now, with that said, they talk about playing a tough schedule early. We did
that. They talk about getting better. And I don't think, without a doubt, this
team has shown it has gotten a lot better. What, five of our last six games
have been against top 15 or, I don't know the rankings, top 20 teams.  
I hope that they look at that and say we talk about tough schedule. We talk
about -- there's not too many teams that have played a schedule like we've
played with the lack of experience.  
So as you watch this team grow, as you watch this team get better, I think
we're an NAC tournament team without question.  
  
Q. Thad, when Neitzel was in here he said that was the best he's felt
offensively this year. Izzo said he hit some shots that he's been missing this
year. To be on the other end of maybe the old Drew Neitzel, do you feel a
little snake bit at all?  
COACH MATTA: Yes, I'd like a get well card. Like I think with Drew, from last
year, the two games he had against us, we knew he was very capable. And I
thought what I had seen on tape he was probably more aggressive hunting shots
today than what I had seen a lot of this year. And the other day he hits his
first two 3s and backed off a little bit. I think he had nine shots in that
game. He had 10 at halftime today.  
And he had that look that like, hey, I want to take the big shot today. And
fortunately for them, unfortunately for us, they were going in.  
  
Q. The sequence, Coach, early in I think the 13 minutes left. You got five
fouls called on you in 42 seconds and it went from a tie game to a five-point
game. Can you comment on how seemingly that was, because seemed like it was a
up hill battle after that?  
COACH MATTA: We never fully recovered, to be honest. Because like I said I
felt like we were playing hard. I felt like we were playing great defense. And
Kosta just lowered his shoulder and bulldozed Naymick over on that drive. And
that kind of got it going there a little bit.  
And then the rebounding started and we never got it back completely.  
  
Q. With what you just said about whether you're an NAC tournament team, will
you try to spend the next two days trying to make your case? I mean, if
anybody in that room would have a chance to be listening, will you try and do
what you can? Because you seem to be very passionate with what you guys did.
You haven't wanted to talk about it all year, for good reason. Now that you're
here, do you want people to know that you think you should be in the
tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, but I don't think I can probably get to the right people.
My wife doesn't even listen to me half the time. Yeah, I would love to walk
over across the boardwalk there and knock on the door and say, hey, I've got a
couple of things I'd like to say.  
I don't know -- I feel strongly about it for, in my opinion, and obviously I'm
going to be a tad bit biased in my beliefs, but I do think that with the
strides that this basketball team has made from where we started to where we
finished, in my opinion I think we're a team worthy of being in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Asked Jamar this earlier but the intensity of the game, courtside it felt
like a very intense game. Could you sense it? What was it like?  
COACH MATTA: I felt the same way. I think that you had two very good
basketball teams banging and you play 20 hard minutes and you go in and it's
tied. It's amazing how that -- I was happy and proud of our guys for the
intensity of staying with it and battling, and it was rough. It was physical.
There was no open cuts. I mean, guys were banging, and it's the way -- that's
the way this game should be a 4-5 game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Ron Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18136)

### [Deshawn Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18137)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
COACH BEILEIN: Wisconsin certainly did a great job defensively against us
today. And they've done that. We're not the lone rangers in this. And I was
really proud of the way we defended. Actually, our percentages continued to
come down as the year went along. We held a very veteran team to a very good
low score. But we could not throw the ball in the ocean today. And you gotta
do a little of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for DeShawn Sims or Ron Coleman.  
  
Q. DeShawn, talk about, you shot 20 percent for the game. Just talk about
their defense, was it as much their defense? Maybe you had an off night. Just
talk about that, please?  
DESHAWN SIMS: I think it was both their defense and because we got some good
shots and we didn't convert on our open shots. We give credit to defense also.
So it was both.  
  
Q. Obviously this was a rebuilding season and you got a new program going
with Coach Beilein. Talk about going forward, about the program itself looking
forward?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Since Ronnie is not going to be here, we just going to keep on
fighting and we did a good job of not quitting and letting those losses become
contagious. And every game we went out trying to fight and try to get better
every day. So that's our mind-set throughout the rest of the year, that Coach
Beilein is going to be here and the rest of the players keep fighting and keep
working.  
  
Q. When Anthony made that 3 at the beginning of the second half, got you
guys within three, which was the closest since the beginning of the game, what
was going through your mind at that point, and what happened that you were
just never able to get any kind of a run going together?  
RON COLEMAN: I just think that, you know, that really gave us a spark. Guys
still got good shots after that. But we just couldn't convert any. That kind
of hurts when a guy knocks down a big shot like that you can't knock down
anymore.  
And you know I give credit to them. They played a great defensive job. Flowers
in particular. Just all over the place. And guarding well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time. We'll finish up with
questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a rebuilding year, but there's a lot to look forward to.
What did you say to your players who won't be going to a tournament but to
look forward to next season?  
COACH BEILEIN: First thing is we'll have our last team meeting surrounding
Selection Sunday. We will have dinner and watch the game and watch the Sunday
night selection, because that's where our dreams are. And that's our only
intention.  
So I made analogies of how -- I grew up on an apple farm and I gave analogies
to how you prune apple trees. And we got pruned many times this year so the
apples will grow bigger and better every year.  
So we've gone through that process and we embraced it as much as we could, as
hard as it was, and now we just move forward with a similar plan, with a few
additions and a great group of young men.  
  
Q. With all the hype about the tournament, there's so much talk about what
teams do offensively and individual scorers. A team like Wisconsin isn't going
to rate highlights, but just talk about what they do and how that relates to
where they can be successful in the tournament?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think in particular, with us, where they have had particular
great individual defenders, they're a great team defense. But when they have
great individual defenders at certain positions, it's been very hard for us as
we continue -- we've got to continue to try and get more and more guys to
score the ball.  
But I think today in particular, Flowers was incredible on defense. And then
they -- wherever you go there's a crowd of Wisconsin, a crowd of white jerseys
there today. And then, of course, defensively, because they limit the number
of possessions -- both teams took 50 shots. We had some turnovers. They did.
So probably a 60-possession game. Kids aren't used to playing 50-,
60-possession games sometimes. And as a result offensively you get a little
antsy.  
And you are -- they get you just being a little less patient because you
haven't had a lot of touches because you just had to guard them now for 32
seconds. And a couple times today we guard them for 32 and guard them for
another 32 because they kicked the offensive rebound back. I think one time we
got them for another 32.  
So their offense is such a great part of their defense. They wear you out on
offense so that their defense is even better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Todd Lickliter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16034)

### [Cyrus Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18138)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll ask you to make a couple of quick opening
comments. We'll take questions for the players then finish up with Coach.  
COACH LICKLITER: First of all, I thank the seniors for the way they accepted
me. I appreciate that. It was a difficult transition for them, I'm sure. But
they were a pleasure to work with this year. Everyone's disappointed. It
wasn't the year that we had hoped for. But I don't think that we really
allowed that to affect our effort and so I appreciate the effort the seniors
gave, and I enjoyed getting to know them.  
I thought today it doesn't take a very astute basketball individual to figure
out if you go two for seven from three and struggle from the line, that what
you would be amazed at is it's an eight-point game. I'm surprised it's an
eight-point game. They got on a run early. We couldn't stop them. We missed
early and then from there it was fairly even. So guys defended fairly well.  
I thought Cyrus and Seth played well. Cyrus was very active. He's been very
active toward the latter half of the season when I think he felt comfortable
with what we were asking him to do. And really committed to playing high
percentage basketball.  
So that's probably -- and John Beilein runs great stuff, as we all know.
They've become more comfortable with it. They get good looks and they shared
the ball and shot it well enough that Harris was really good. It's a tough way
to lose. But like I told my son, who won the state championship the other day,
I've not been around very many people that have finished their year on a win.
What a great experience that would be. Most of us have to go out sometimes a
lot earlier than we wanted to. But I guess it's part of the basketball life.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the two players, please.  
  
Q. Cyrus, what about your development this year? Do you feel that you've
made a lot of improvement?  
CYRUS TATE: Yes. I feel like I tried my best, contribute the best I could for
our team. In the beginning it was kind of rough. And I just really like Coach
said, I bought into what was going on what Coach wanted me to do. And I just
took it from there.  
As things progressed, my confidence built up and I was able to contribute
every time for our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Finish up with questions for Coach Lickliter.  
  
Q. Todd, do you feel this team got better from the end of January to the end
of the season? If so, how? If not, why?  
COACH LICKLITER: Are you just writing a column or a book? You want me to go
through (laughter)? When you say why didn't they get better, I think that they
probably played at times as well as they could. Were they consistently doing
that, I don't think any of us do. We're not every day as good as we could be.  
With our group, we had a very small margin for error. So when we weren't on
the top of our game, we struggled to compete. So did they get better? I
believe I got the they better. Did they get good enough to compete in the Big
Ten, no we did not.  
And I also think that if you look back and, I mean, I hope that -- as stating
what I see, you asked my opinion -- I hope it's not perceived as an excuse.  
I thought the initial part of the Big Ten season was very demanding. I thought
we played at a very high level. We weren't always rewarded. We played Purdue
and Indiana well. We actually beat Michigan State. And I thought not
physically but maybe emotionally, mentally, there was some, I don't know if
fatigue is the right word, but a little bit of strain. And I think that's
typical when you're asking people to play at the level we were asking them to
play at to compete in this league.  
And so I do think they improved. I do not think we obviously improved enough.  
  
Q. You've had your scoring this year obviously but 16 minutes today without
a field goal in the second half. What do you think was going on? What do you
think was the problem?  
COACH LICKLITER: You tell me. I mean, this sincerely, did we have good looks?
I believe we did have some good looks. And we're not a team -- Cyrus works
incredibly hard, but he's really our only offensive rebounder, so we don't get
a lot of second shots.  
We've got to make the shots we get. I thought we really got some good looks.
And I've said this all along. If we come down and take bad shots, which we do
occasionally, that really puts us in a tough spot. But I thought today we
probably got enough good looks that if we were shooting the way we're capable,
not the way we do all the time, then we would have been much more competitive.
But two for 17 from the 3, you're probably going to have some droughts.  
  
Q. What do you want Jake Kelly to look like next year at this time? I mean
body-wise, physicality?  
COACH LICKLITER: Great question. I would like for him to be about -- well,
here's the thing, Randy. That's not my area. I'd love for him to be strong
enough to compete in the Big Ten. And right now he'll tell you he's not. We
have a strength and conditioning coach. You should ask him what you want him
to look like. And then let's find out and let's make sure it happens. We're
not -- fortunately for me, at this level, I don't have to oversee that. So
Jake understands. Now we just have to give him the opportunity -- he has to
put the work in.  
I'm a fortunate guy in that I've been able to coach some really good teams and
some really good players. And the really good ones made gains in the off
season in their strength.  
It is impossible to be too strong.  
  
Q. He said he wants to look like Jarryd Cole?  
COACH LICKLITER: I say set your goals high, Jake, and go for it. I'm with you.  
  
Q. You talked earlier this week, nine days off leading into the game. After
it's all said and done how do you think that affected the team either overall
positively, negatively, maybe not at all?  
COACH LICKLITER: That would be something that you would really have to -- I
guess as you look at it I don't think we played very well so your initial
response would be obviously it affects us adversely. And I think we'd be
making an excuse there. I thought it was -- I didn't think it was a bad thing.
And I still don't. I don't think we'd do anything different, either. The one
thing that is difficult is you'd love to be able to shoot as I look, I'd love
to have been able to shoot in this facility one time, either the night before
or the day before. And I say that thinking we're a better shooting team. And
it couldn't hurt.  
But other than that, I don't have any complaints with the time off.  
  
Q. Todd, you said a couple of weeks ago you would have a list of things to
work on during the off season. You've had about 30 minutes now to move into
the off season. Anything you can share with us at this point?  
COACH LICKLITER: Jim, I'm really not prepared at this time. What I meant to
say, and I think as we went through the season, I was trying to assess what
was available to us, what other programs had and what we may need to grow. I
want to be competitive. And a part of that -- there's so many parts to being
competitive at this level. I need to do my job. I need to be good at what I
do. And I need to put a team on the floor that has a great understanding,
competes hard every night, prepares well. And that's my responsibility.  
And then I know there's people at Iowa that want to do their part, too. We
just need to get together and talk about some things that we think can advance
Iowa basketball. And I apologize to you. I'm just not prepared now. Sometime
maybe we can -- maybe we won't even have to announce it, you'll just see it.
You'll say, well, that's a nice addition or whatever.  
  
Q. Was there anything about the last few months about this season that
surprised you that you didn't know before you took this job, as you look back
you didn't see coming?  
COACH LICKLITER: I initially was going to say that I was prepared to get on a
bus and ride four or five hours after games and I got on an airplane and flew
home. So I like that aspect, to be quite honest with you. I hadn't had that
advantage before.  
But I don't think there was anything that -- we competed at a high level. And
this is a competitive level. It's a great conference. But it's basketball.
It's Division I basketball. And I was fully expecting what went on. There's
always obstacles. And sometimes there's obstacles that -- I used to tell the
guys all the time, you've got to move on. If the bus breaks down, we're going
to play that night. So let's make sure when somebody throws us a curve ball we
hit it.  
So you're going to live that way. That's the way life is and you've just got
to be well grounded and prepared and everybody can perform well when
everything is going smoothly. When things are tough, you have to continue to
be poised and perform well.  
So there wasn't anything that I would say just knocked me off guard at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Appreciate your time, Coach. Thank you.

### [Chester Frazier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16997)

### [Trent Meacham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17059)

### [Brian Randle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16998)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Coach Bruce Weber and the Illinois players.
Coach, if we could have you make a couple opening comments and then we'll do
questions for the players and questions for Coach Weber.  
COACH WEBER: First of all, I want to commend Penn State and Coach DeChellis.
We had some things that happened to us over the last year, but when you lose
your two best players and you're able to keep a semblance of order and win
some big games, and even today you get down 10 and they didn't quit playing.  
And I know Bo Ryan and Matt Painter did an unbelievable job this year, but I
think Eddie on some years, he might have been coach of the year for what he
did. So I just wanted to recognize them. I was pleased for our seniors.  
You know, they haven't had maybe the year that we would have hoped for. You
know, today Shaun has a double-double, I think the first one since maybe
conference season, since nonconference season. And Brian Randle, you know, has
17 and goes 17 -- or 7 for 7 from the free throw line.  
So those guys were the leaders. We worried a lot about attacking the zone and
we worked on it this week. And we did a great job of attacking I thought in
the first half and had some opportunities to stretch the game out, some fast
break opportunities.  
We got a travel and a missed layup and a turnover and could have had a bigger
lead. But the biggest thing, we didn't defend them in the first half. They
shoot 58 percent. We did a much better job in the second half. I don't know if
they tired or we were just more aware and held them to 25 percent.  
And then, like all year we've had these, we hit these walls and have drought
scoring and it was something we talked about last night. We can't -- it
happens and you gotta find a way out of it and somebody has got to make a
play. And Trent makes a great pass to Chester and I'm happy he made the dang
thing, one of the toughest shots when you have a wide open layup. I don't know
what happened. I think they had a timeout. Seemed like they wanted to call it
and they didn't. And we did -- at least we found a way to win a close game.
It's been a long time since we've won a close one.  
I'm just happy for the kids we get to play another day.  
THE MODERATOR: We can go ahead with questions for the athletes.  
  
Q. Chester, could you go through the last play and how you wound up on the
other side of the basket like that? Did you make a mid-air decision or
beginning with the inbounds? And since there wasn't a timeout or anything, was
that called the previous time out or is that a basic play you always run?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: Play wasn't designed for me to get the ball, but I thought
Trent was going to shoot it with two people on him. But he made a good read
passed it back to me. Thought it was going to get blocked on the other shot so
that's why I reversed.  
  
Q. Brian, I know you haven't had a chance to let this soak in yet, but he
lived to play another day and you get a third chance to play Purdue. You had
lost twice to Penn State, lost twice to Purdue. Different challenge tomorrow.
Talk about that game.  
BRIAN RANDLE: It's a different style of game. Obviously Purdue wants to get
the ball up and down, but just like Penn State, but in terms of the defense,
it's a no zone at all. It's lock down, man to man. A lot of pressure, a lot of
patience on our part. So I think in terms of that, we need to be very focused
and need to be crisp and sharp with our passes and our movements.  
So, I mean, it's just a different style of game. I think it's going to be more
intense. I don't know if you want to call it a semi-rivalry now from the way
we play and the way they play, kind of parallels each other. So it's going to
be a big game.  
  
Q. Trent, could you also just go through that last play, what you saw in
terms of when you turned the corner there?  
TRENT MEACHAM: I was coming off the screen from inbounds and Chester passed to
me. First thought was to shoot it and let it go. And then I was about to drive
to the basket, but his man, Battle, stepped up to me, and it was almost
surprising how wide open Chester was. So I dumped it down to him and I knew he
was going to make that.  
  
Q. Chester, was that similar to the play that you guys ran earlier in the
game, I guess, where you got called for being out of bounds, is that the
similar type of thing?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: Almost the same play, but it was Briand Randle who stepped
in, and my guy helped up and I dragged my left foot.  
  
Q. Chester, could you talk about how it feels to advance for another day,
after all the things you've been through this year?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: Similar situation to last year. The same teams, the same type
of game. Got up early on them. They came back. But it feels good to play
another game especially for Brian, Shaun and Chris, still fighting to see if
we can win three more and continue playing.  
  
Q. What does this mean to you guys to win a close game like this? I know
you've had a lot of things fall not in your favor, but now to have one go in
your favor, does this propel you guys to give you the motivation to go on for
tomorrow?  
TRENT MEACHAM: I think it will. Like Coach said. We haven't been able to win
games like that. The last four minutes or so they took it to us. And we
couldn't get the stop or we couldn't get the rebound or the bucket that we
needed. So to finish a game with a play like that and win it, hopefully that
can propel us and just keep that momentum and see if we can go on a run here.  
  
Q. Chester, could you talk a little bit about chasing Battle around and how
were your knees and was that a factor at the end at all, how do you feel?  
CHESTER FRAZIER: I'm old. He's a young guy. He's quick. Probably only weighs
125 pounds. He's real quick. He's going to be a tough player in this league.
He has a knack for scoring. And with the two leading scorers, I think he took
it upon himself to put the team on his back and he did a good job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, fellows. We'll finish up with questions with Coach
Weber.  
  
Q. Bruce, same thing I asked Brian. You've had two great games with Purdue,
I know it's always tough to play a friend like that. But how will you approach
tomorrow and what will be your significant challenges?  
COACH WEBER: Well, if Matt's a good friend, he'll just start his walk-ons and
let us win in advance and he's going to go into the NCAA tournament anyway.  
So I don't think that's going to happen. He's done a tremendous job. Their
freshmen have shown unbelievable poise, and just to win the big road games
that they've won has been amazing to me.  
The problem we have is they have so many weapons. And they have so many
versatile players. I think they have not only guys that can shoot the ball but
probably more importantly have so many guys that can pass the ball. And they
make the extra pass and get it to the open guy.  
And then they're very aggressive and physical on defense. So it's going to be
a different game. I do not see Matt playing zone. I don't think that's going
to happen. They're going to come out and be aggressive and pick us up and bump
up us. And we'll have to deal with it.  
Ironic thing is we were worried so much about zone, we get a nice lead and
Penn State goes man, and we fall flat on our face and don't make good cuts and
don't finish some plays. I don't think we scored the last four or five, six
minutes, somewhere in there, until that last bucket.  
We're going to have to get a different mind-set and just hope that we play
good basketball and for some reason maybe they don't play as well as they
have. I thought at our place -- you know, I know they played well at
Wisconsin. But at our place in Wisconsin, they played as good of basketball
I've seen any team in our league this year.  
  
Q. Talk more about the man to man. Seemed like the game changed immediately.
You played against man to man all year, was it preparation for this game was
just zone or what have you?  
COACH WEBER: You have a change in mind-set a little bit. For three days,
basically we went against the zone and watched the film from the first two
games and how to attack it and get their zone a little disjointed. And I think
we did that.  
And yesterday I told the coaches we better get a little bit of motion or man
stuff in. And we did. They picked up the intensity a little bit. And here it's
only three, four possessions and we have a travel, I think. We have a missed
layup, Shaun inside. We get maybe take a questionable shot.  
Now they hit 2-3-3s in that stretch and the game's totally changed. So that's
disappointing for us. Hopefully, tomorrow we'll have to have a totally
different mind-set to deal with their pressure and be strong with their ball
and we're going to have to make our free throws like we did tonight. That will
be a difference-maker, especially if we're able to get it inside and take
advantage of maybe some of our size difference.  
  
Q. Bruce, do you even let yourself ponder how far this might go?  
COACH WEBER: No. Just worry about tomorrow. I'm just happy we get to play. I
felt pretty good about ourselves, about the 15-minute mark in the second half.
And then all of a sudden it changed so quickly. And I just -- you're trying to
figure out, man, how can you solve this thing. And you kept talking to them
about believing.  
And we talked about brick walls and trying to find ways around it and we made
a play at the end. So go back, have a nice dinner. Get with the watching film
and you don't have a whole bunch of time. Purdue -- they didn't know if they
were playing us or Penn State. So the preparation time in a way will be the
same.  
We know each other, and we're just going to have to do a good job. We have a
good matchup. I think Brian Randle and Hummel, if Chester -- his knee is okay
by tomorrow, he's got to guard more, and then make sure some of the other guys
don't become factors. I think that's the biggest difference. I thought Krump
at their place was a difference-maker and Green at our place was a big
difference-maker. Their other players played well, but when those guys do
that, now you're in trouble.  
  
Q. Bruce, can you talk about the final inbounds plays did you change the
play call during the timeout?  
COACH WEBER: The first timeout we drew one play up and then we had to call
timeout. We didn't get it in. Drew up another play and they did a good job of
fighting through the screen. We didn't have a shot. And we had to get another
-- we just called a regular out of bounds play we ran all year. We've actually
ran it against Indiana. Two of those plays down the stretch. And had some
luck. But they defended it well. Chester, you know, it's just a great read by
Trent and you can call timeout and draw up a lot of things but a lot of times
it's the players that make the plays and they haven't been able to do that all
season and today we did.  
  
Q. In terms of some of the recent injuries, one on Brian, looks like he's
put that behind him and not having much of a problem with it. And, two, I'm
wondering was Rodney available today?  
COACH WEBER: Rodney practiced a little bit. And I guess how the game was
going, we made a decision not to go with him. Brian seems okay. I think he
plays with some pain. He's back to fouling. So maybe he's feeling much better.
And then Chester, you know, he's probably the worst of all of the guys. We
gotta get him rested and he's always so hyper, we have to get him sitting in
bed and icing him to get enough energy out of him tomorrow night.  
  
Q. The fact that you had played so many close games this year, did that help
down the stretch tonight?  
COACH WEBER: I hope so. We've had unbelievable run of close games and not
finding ways to win it and it seemed like it was going to be the story of our
season again. And I guess the movie ended differently this time. But I think
more than anything in the huddles we just, instead of panicking, we kept
talking positive. And who is going to step up, who is going to make a play,
who is going to make the difference-maker in the game, be the difference-
maker.  
And I don't know if that did or not. But something happened and it went right
for us. And both the last two games, you know, we took the lead at their place
and they make two free throws down the stretch and Demetri had a chance to tie
it up at our place against Penn State. I guess if you're patient enough it
comes around and goes your way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Dan Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18148)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Lawrence Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18149)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll just ask you to make a couple quick opening
comments and then we will take questions for Dan and Lawrence and then we'll
go ahead and finish up with questions for you.  
COACH SMITH: Well, first, it's good to be participating in the tournament
here, certainly the Big Ten, first opportunity I've had to coach in Conseco
and be part of this tournament. This has been a great tournament. Looking
forward to playing tomorrow.  
I've got to give certainly Northwestern, Coach Carmody did a great job with
his team. They've been playing well. And a lot of close games and we tried to
share it with our players to help them understand. It's always tough that
first game is a challenge in any tournament. I thought our kids showed courage
and a lot of heart to overcome some things in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead with questions for Lawrence or Dan.  
  
Q. Lawrence, obviously high school, 40 points a game. The scoring instincts
are there. Seemed like they came out towards the end of the game against
Northwestern?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Yeah, I just wanted to give a boost to my team. We were
kind of flat, picked it up defensively. Coach gave us confidence, gives me
confidence if you're open to shoot the ball. I didn't think about it. I just
shot it and they were falling for me tonight.  
  
Q. Dan, can you talk about that sequence at the end of the game there and
obviously Northwestern needed a shot, and they didn't get a shot off, you got
the steal. Can you talk about that defensive play?  
DAN COLEMAN: I just saw them come over in the paint. That's what our coach
teaches, to go double in the paint if at all possible. And turned it back, so
I thought it was a good opportunity to peg it off.  
  
Q. Dan, could you sort of feel that the team's energy level picking up, I
mean, after Westbrook, a few good shots in the second half?  
DAN COLEMAN: Definitely. We started to defend a little better. And I think
that showed up and then they stopped hitting their 3s, so I think that worked
out for us. Worked out well.  
  
Q. Question for both of you. What does it do to this team when you guys do
play the kind of defense that Tubby wants you to play? That seems like it is
your identity; it was during earlier in the year and it seemed like you got
back to that in the second half of this game?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Helped us out a lot. They say defense wins championships.
When we lock down defensively, that's our number one offense. Our defense
leads to our offense. When we do that, everybody picks up their energy level
and we start making shots and penetrating and rebounding better. That's what
we did today.  
  
Q. When you guys were down by 16 in that first half, what's going through
your mind, and how do you take that into halftime and not let it carry over
into the second half?  
DAN COLEMAN: We weren't shooting the ball particularly well. I think I have
confidence in my guys and I think they have confidence in themselves.  
We try to look for shooters and stay aggressive. Coach said go to the basket
as much as possible, try to get fouled. I think we did a good job of that,
trying to get fouled and create something, just making things happen.  
  
Q. There's about eight-minute stretch towards the end of the second half
where you all didn't score. Could you talk about what was going on there; were
you sort of struggling to create your own shots?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: I think that we expended a lot of energy on the defensive
end. Maybe we hit -- I know I was a little tired myself -- at one point but we
caught a second wind. We spent so much energy coming back from a deficit it
kind of took a lot out of us. When we hit a second wind, we picked up our
intensity even more. D.C. hit two big free throws and we just came out with a
win.  
  
Q. Dan, can you talk about when Spencer went down and just how much you were
forced to play center and play inside a little bit and just what went through
your mind and kind of what are you looking forward to against Indiana?  
DAN COLEMAN: You know, it's another challenge. It's another thing to step up
to. We just played them recently so they're fresh in our minds. I think
everybody is excited and everybody wants this game.  
  
Q. What happens tomorrow if you play the first half that you played tonight
against Northwestern?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: I mean -- well, I don't think that will happen because
we're -- we were fired up for this game, but we didn't play it bad, but, then
again, they're college players, like us, and they're humans like us. They
might come out flat. If we do come out like that, we'll do the same thing we
did: pick up the defense intensity.  
We're not scared at all. We just want to come out and get an upset.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your thoughts toward the end of the game, team comes
back, it's tied up 42-42 then there's that drought at the end of the game?  
COACH SMITH: He touched on it. I think Lawrence Westbrook mentioned they were
a little winded because we were expending a lot of energy to get back in the
game. And that happens. Adrenalin is slowing, when you start making shots.
Then they made some plays with the shot clock running down there. I think they
hit a 3, it can take the wind out of your sails at the end of a shot clock.  
And I remember a stretch there where that happened. But, again, we were able
to weather the storm there. But I knew we were back in it, even though we were
down. I guess it seemed like we hadn't scored for a long period, it was 47-42
forever there. And I knew that we -- again, I think we had some poor shot
selections during that time and a lot of that leads to fatigue. If you're not
careful, it will lead to taking some ill-advised shots.  
  
Q. Obviously the first two games you played Northwestern, they were blowout
victories, gave you confidence. You guys obviously survived this one. Is it a
different kind of confidence you have going into the Indiana game, if it was a
blowout?  
COACH SMITH: I don't know that it makes any difference. Indiana, knowing that
they're one of the top teams in this league and in the country, it means we're
going to have to bring our best game and certainly we'll have to play a lot
better than we did tonight. We didn't play poorly. It's just that we didn't
shoot the ball well and Northwestern really shot the ball well.  
And that's something we -- and their system and Northwestern's style really
creates problems for a lot of people. So just like it created a lot of
problems for Indiana at this point. There was a three-point win there for
Indiana.  
So Indiana brings another different set of circumstances, challenges. They're
an excellent rebounding team. They've got the great 1-2 punch, but they have
excellent players around them around Eric and D.J.  
So they've got a very balanced ball club.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been looking for someone to step up down the stretch in
tight situations like you had tonight. Can you talk about Lawrence Westbrook
and the way he played?  
COACH SMITH: Lawrence has been as consistent as anyone all year long. He plays
with a lot of toughness. He overcompensates for his lack of size and really
he's playing with a hand that's just -- I don't know if he'll have to work
done on it this summer to correct it, I don't know how he does it, to be
honest with you. That tells me about his heart and his courage.  
He's a guy that we depend on to be the guy to match up with the opposing
team's usually best perimeter player. And tonight, again, I thought the second
half was typical of what he brings to a team, the aggressive play, attacking
the basket, pushing the ball up the court and playing at a pace we need him to
play at.  
So that's the leadership part that especially with Lawrence, when McKenzie is
not playing well or not shooting the ball well we needed somebody else to step
up because the guys look to Lawrence, McKenzie did. He's been the guy that can
make those shots, but today he was struggling and Blake struggled. But they
still -- I think Westbrook is a team player. He's willing to play that role
and when he has to he can step up and do it.  
  
Q. Do you know about Spencer's availability and was this, especially the
second half, the kind of defensive effort you were looking for after the
practices you had this week?  
COACH SMITH: Yes, the second half was the type of defensive effort that we
expect on a nightly basis. And you can't win games, especially any time, if
you don't compete defensively. And I'm not sure what Spencer's status is.
We've got one of the best medical staffs in the country. And I know Roger
Schipper will have him, Spencer is a tough-minded kid, if he can go he'll go.
Because we'll need him tomorrow with the inside presence that Indiana has.  
  
Q. How did you light that fire in terms of getting their attention to detail
but yet not wanting them to go out there and panic?  
COACH SMITH: Well, in the second half -- I think the big key was changing
defenses. We went to a different defense in the second half, gave them a
different look. Made some shots the second half. So the speech was pretty much
that; how we're going to make the adjustments and we needed somebody to step
up and be a leader and I think that's where Westbrook said, hey, now is the
time. And it is contagious. Dan, we try to go inside to him. He got to the
free throw line. So pretty much that was the adjustment we made.  
Not much speaking. It wasn't much you could say. They were shooting the lights
out. I didn't think we were really defending like we should. Giving them some
back doors. Once we made the adjustment went to a zone instead of trying to
guard them in the half court man to man, we were much more effective.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'd ask you for a couple of quick comments to open then
we'll take questions for the players then finish up with questions for you.  
COACH CARMODY: Well, this game was sort of typical of a lot of our games this
year. Probably in the last eight, nine, 10 games, we had leads and couldn't
end up with a win for different reasons. And tonight just seemed like it sort
of typified the whole season for us.  
It's been hard on the team and they came ready to play tonight, playing real
well and then just started second half and Minnesota came out and hit the
first three shots. And I thought we weathered the storm, actually, after a
bit. We were up by five 47-42. And just really couldn't quite get it done.  
They made their plays. So tough game in a tough season for all of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kevin or Michael, please.  
  
Q. Kevin, obviously you and the team had a great first half. You had 13
points. In the second half you didn't get a lot of looks and the team suffered
a lot. What was different both for you personally and as a team from the first
half to the second?  
KEVIN COBLE: In the first half they were running man to man and we were
executing our stuff very well. At halftime they made some adjustments and went
to a couple of different zones. We didn't adjust as well and sort of went away
from what we were trying to do, just didn't run through our stuff.  
We wanted them, if they want to go to a zone, we should be able to really
capitalize on that. It's been something we struggled throughout the year. It
happened at Indiana, got them to switch up defenses and it was a matter of us
not making the most of it.  
It's frustrating continuing to be the same problem night in, night out. Just
to see those glimpses. But it's just going to be -- it's just what can we do
to be consistent and play those first halves and make that a whole game.  
  
Q. Kevin, it looked like you're passing up a couple of the shots that you
would have taken in the first half after you missed the first couple. Was
there a little -- was your confidence shaken after missing the first couple?  
KEVIN COBLE: I don't think so. I try to have amnesia almost when you're
shooting, think about the next one so much. A lot of times we needed to get
through our stuff and make sure that the shots were quality ones like we were
getting in the first half. A lot of the shots in the second, they might have
seemed good but it was pretty early in the clock. And we needed to keep the
game -- like we said before we left to come down here, that we needed to keep
the game in the 50s. And in order to do that, we have to be careful with our
shot selection.  
  
Q. Michael, there were a couple of consecutive plays in the second half
where you had trouble with the Minnesota press. Was there something they
changed that made it more difficult for you guys to attack the press?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: They were running and jumping and they were trapping us when
we tried to get the ball across half court. Me personally, I felt as I let my
team down. I could have did a better job handling the ball. But they were
really aggressive on the defense end. They changed up their defense from time
to time so we couldn't get adjusted to one defense.  
  
Q. Michael, on that last play, a lot of times this offense will run through
you, both of you guys were on the court, but what were you guys trying to
accomplish when you were down one and yet you had the ball there and what went
wrong?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: We were just trying to get the best shot possible that we
could get. We were trying to run our play to get an easy layup. And then we
ran it, but our guard, Sterling Williams, tried to attack the basket. And he's
good at doing it, unfortunately he just turned the ball over and it got away
from us.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys were close to the upset today. How disappointing to
either of you how disappointing is this loss the way to end the season?  
KEVIN COBLE: You know, I think it just caps -- it's like the icing on the
cake, almost, for us. It's just been the same thing over night in and night
out. This game at halftime we thought maybe we had broken through it a little
bit.  
But it's disappointing. It's not how we wanted to end. Certainly not having to
dwell on that almost. It's just been every night we can't quite figure out
what it is and tonight was the same deal. It's just sickening to think that we
gave them the game.  
  
Q. Coach talked a little bit about the 7-0 run right at the beginning of the
half. How deflating was that after you go into halftime with the lead?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I mean, Minnesota, they're up 10-14. We were trying to slow
them down. It was our game plan before we came down here. It got away from us
at the beginning of the half. They got up tempo and were pushing the ball down
the court and got easy shots. That pretty much made us slow things down things
a lot more, but at the same time, they went on their run, and then it brought
them closer to their lead.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with questions with Coach Carmody.  
  
Q. When you look at the box score and you see two offensive rebounds and no
second-chance points, what does that tell you in terms of the effort that went
forth and how this game was played in terms of the boards?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't worry about offensive rebounds that much. We never get
them. Doesn't concern me. It was defense rebounds. We did okay. There was a
stretch where Coleman was trying to -- his presence was obvious there. But I
think the thing that hurt us was they went small, and it was basically
Coleman, next biggest guy was Hoffarber. It was like four guards, and Coleman.
It bothered us we weren't running offense as well as I thought we could.  
  
Q. What were you looking for on the last play, the one where Sterling was
stripped?  
COACH CARMODY: We ran a play that we ran a lot. I think Mike was wide open
cutting off the back pick and, I don't know, I looked at the tape but I know
what I saw. He's wide open for a layup down one. I don't know, Sterling
decided to try to drive baseline but that's what happens.  
  
Q. A lot of times you guys have mentioned throughout the year that you go
through spells where you don't go score and you go through droughts. Tonight
it seemed like it was the last ten minutes or so. What caused this drought
tonight?  
COACH CARMODY: A lot of guys put the ball in the basket. Mike Thompson kept us
in the second half there. I think he had the first eight points that we had
and Craig, no one else scored, the whole half. Two guys scoring. So we're
getting nothing up front, getting nothing up front and that puts a lot of
pressure on your perimeter guys.  
  
Q. Today was only the second time this season that you guys have gone into
the second half in the Big Ten with a double-digit lead, the second time was
Michigan and you almost lost that game. Do you think you guys have a problem
playing with leads?  
COACH CARMODY: Two out of 18. I mean, we have problems playing without leads,
I guess. So I don't know. I don't think that's -- I think it's a 40-minute
game. And I don't want to say everything was, that we didn't do anything.
Minnesota has a lot to do with this. They came out more aggressively. The
first three baskets in the second half we transitioned we weren't getting down
the court. Mike alluded to that. They were pushing the ball there.  
So they came out flat and we got a lead and then we came out flat in the
second half and then it comes down to the last play, really.  
  
Q. Bill, can any good come out of a loss like this?  
COACH CARMODY: The next game isn't for six months or something. So I don't
really think you play some guys so they get experience or anything. I don't
think so. We've seen this a few times. I think we just have to get, like I
said, I think it's been unfair to some of my perimeter guys. There's a lot of
pressure on them. We have to have some new blood that's going to be coming in.
It gives us some help up front.  
  
Q. Both Mike and Ted were talking about it and Coach Smith talked about it,
the difference between the first and second half being that Minnesota
switching to a zone defense they were playing a lot of man in the first half
that disrupted your offense. That's something we've seen in other games this
year. Why wasn't the offense working against the zone tonight and against the
zone in other games this season?  
COACH CARMODY: I wouldn't say it's all the time, because Minnesota plays the
two-three zone in Evanston the first half, first 12 minutes. And we did a
really good job against it. And tonight a couple times we had Craig Moore
missed a layup on it and Jeremy Nash missed a little reverse in the baseline
and those kinds of things, when the team is in a run, whatever it was there,
if you get two baskets on layups, it sort of takes them out of that.  
And so I don't know if we -- I think we struggled against some zones but we
also struggled against man to man. Again when you only win one game you're
struggling against a lot of things. But I think it's more we don't have the
depth to go for 40 minutes and whatever that might be, whatever the defense
might be. Even offensively.  
  
Q. Now that this is the end of the season can you kind of reflect on the
season as a whole and what you guys need to do differently next year to build
on it and try and improve upon it?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, you can only go up, just about. And I do think we have a
few guys coming in the front court that are going to help us and help us right
away, as freshmen do these days. So that's what we have to look forward to.
And I think Mike Thompson tonight was pretty good but then the press bothered
him a little bit.  
And so in answer to the gentleman's question back there, that's one thing,
help Mike a little bit in how you handle those run and jump situations. But I
think it's mostly the front court that we really have to improve upon.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 13, 2008

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Ron Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18136)

### [Deshawn Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18137)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for your time. We'd like to have you make a
couple opening comments then we'll go to questions for the two student
athletes, finish up with questions for you.  
COACH BEILEIN: Aside from the fact that it looked like we would never score a
basket, again, for the rest of my life in the last 10 minutes, it was a great
first step for us to come into post season, come into a first-round game and
try to gather momentum for tomorrow and in the future.  
So as a result I'm really pleased for our kids. That's what I'm preaching with
them, enjoy this and try and get better through it. And hopefully we'll be
able to come out with a similar victory tomorrow against Wisconsin.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for DeShawn or Ron.  
  
Q. You kept Iowa without a field goal for, I don't know, 17 minutes or so in
the second half, 16, 17 minutes. What were you doing defensively against
them?  
THE MODERATOR: DeShawn?  
DESHAWN SIMS. We did a good job of -- the coaches did a good job of preparing
us as far as what they were going to run in. Some different reads, how to use
ball screens. And we did a good job of playing them.  
Another thing, we went out and played tenacious defense. We weren't looking
for the switches. We just held ourselves accountable for our man, and that led
us to not let them score for that amount of time.  
RON COLEMAN: I think we did a good job. Same thing as Pete said. I think we
came in with a mind-set that we had to defend in order to get a victory.
That's what everybody locked down on. I think we did a good job of defending
the 3 as well as their drivers. I think they've got great drivers on their
team, as in Freeman and they've got Kelly.  
I think we did a good job of help side and talking. It was a lot of
communication on the floor. That's a big step for our team.  
  
Q. DeShawn, I know you've gone through your scoring droughts this year. Have
you ever gone through something like that where both sides neither one could
get a basket?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Was it like this game? (Laughter). Well, as long as either team
isn't scoring, nobody will win. So as long as -- if we can't score, we just
gotta do an even better job defensively. Did that happen this game?  
COACH BEILEIN: We went 10. How long did they go? We went 10 without a basket.
Believe it or not, this is true. Those are stats you all bring up to us. We
don't realize that. We're out there playing and not thinking about when was
the last basket scored. We're looking at the differential on the scoreboard.
That's how we determine how we're doing, not how long it's been since we
scored.  
  
Q. When we talked to you Tuesday, you seemed fairly upbeat. Did you sense
that this kind of performance was about to come out from your team?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Yes, because any time you can erase everything that happened in
the regular season, you get a chance to clear your record. And everybody, even
the top team in our league, starts zero and zero. It kind of gives you
something to play for.  
And just watching all the major teams around the country, just how they played
this week and it just looked so fun. And my whole team was watching it. And we
came out like we want to play like that. That's how we want to play.  
And that effort got a although of those teams into some NCAA bids. That's how
we came out and played.  
  
Q. Ron, you guys have kind of been burned the past as far as defensively,
tried to improve that, looked pretty improved today. How hard was it to
continue to play in the defense you were playing knowing that other end for a
lot of that game you weren't getting rewarded? That must have been a challenge
especially mentally?  
RON COLEMAN: It has been a challenge for us. It has all season, just having
lapses in the games. And some we've been focused on more that we have to play
hard for the whole 40 minutes. Just because your shot didn't fall in you have
to keep going and defend on the other end. I think that's what we did tonight.
We did that well.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about looking into the Wisconsin game and from
the last time you guys played them, what do you hope to do better this time
around?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Control how hard we play. In the Wisconsin game, we had some
previous losses, some close games, and we just went out the there and just
battled. It wasn't a lot of structure to that game, but we played as hard as
we played all season. And we got to try to keep that same mentality that we
had the day before the game and come out with that same energy as soon as the
game starts.  
  
Q. DeShawn, you guys have been talking about this tournament for a little
while now, does this win prove something, should it prove something to the
people outside the team?  
DESHAWN SIMS: Not really, because we played Iowa in the regular season and --
well, the win means something. But we split with them, and we kind of had a
feel for how they were going to play. We just wanted to win. Whoever was in
our way, we're trying to advance and just go to the promised land, basically.
So whoever is in our way we just got to play with that chip on our shoulders,
because no one has an advantage.  
We're playing in a different arena. No one is home or away and anything can
happen. So we was looking forward to this tournament, though.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Finish up with questions for Coach Beilein.  
  
Q. Guarding the 3 has been a problem, but today you were outstanding, was
there a difference?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think you don't want to say it, but they're starting to
understand at this time, because you're trying to speed that up. I think
continuing to realize, recognize who the shooters are, when you do a lot of
the things we do defensively, we switched some screens, sometimes we don't.
All of a sudden you're on a man who you have to know the scouting report and
you also know the scheme and there's a lot of thought involved.  
So I think that while it slowed down and we've gotten better at it, I think
there's some times where we're either tired or don't understand that people at
this level -- because we have so many who can shoot from so far away, and
today I don't think we gave many good looks to either Freeman Freeman or
Johnson. They certainly got the them when they were in Ann Arbor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the Wisconsin game tomorrow and in particular what did
you take from the last meeting?  
COACH BEILEIN: Seems like it was so long ago. I think the only thing we can
take, the best thing we can take into this game belief that if we play at our
best that we can be in the hunt at the end of the game.  
I thought that was the end -- as good as they are, the end of the game we were
certainly in the game. And that's something that I think the confidence,
hopefully, against another great containing defense team, a team that you
really have to struggle to score against, and that team that is obviously has
great experience and great size and girth to them.  
So I'll have to watch more film. I haven't paid attention to -- we didn't pay
attention to Wisconsin but in the next 24 hours I'll be over, doing my best
with Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Given the way this season has gone with this young team, 9 minute 52
seconds drought would have killed you in the regular season. Why didn't that
happen F is that part of forgetting the past and looking ahead?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think the personality of this team is sensitive to at times
just looking at the negative side of they scored a couple of baskets. I just
missed a jump shot. I'm in foul trouble. I just had a turnover. And you take
it to the other end of the court.  
So it's our personality and it's something as a coaching staff and players
we're trying to build this I can type of personality. So we continue to work
at that. And that was just -- like I said, the one thing I was preaching to
them, we have to be happier as we're winning that game. Work at these first,
second round games -- any tournament game is difficult to win.  
So I think earlier in the year, right, that may have come right down to the
buzzer, as opposed to being able to at least be comfortable in the last
minute.  
  
Q. Do you look at this as a positive for the future?  
COACH BEILEIN: Absolutely. This is a huge momentum thing for us to be able to
come in here. We've lost our -- we've won three, lost three in a row. All had
a similar dynamic to us where we got ahead in the game and we couldn't hold
the lead and we couldn't make a shot. And it's just part of the growing up
experience.  
Now, we still did it but we found out that our defense is a constant. We
couldn't score, but we stopped. So we won the game.  
  
Q. Could you just talk a little more about your defensive intensity and how
you guys were really locked in on trying to make sure that Freeman and Johnson
didn't get off and maybe how frustrated Iowa got offensively but just the
defense you played today?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that they -- like I said, particularly Freeman at our
place, and I think Kelly has made great improvements as well. But Johnson, you
just look at Johnson's stats, how many 3s he's made in his lifetime at Iowa.
And we just said if they're going to beat us today they'll be bouncing the
basket, or we'll be all over them.  
By stretching a little bit, I think we gave up some offensive rebounds because
they're so much bigger than us with the two big kids. But they went to a lot
of dribble drive, I thought we contained it fairly well. That was Johnson and
Freeman. We could just not -- the other guys might beat us a little bit. Two-
point rebound is better than a three-point shot because they're both terrific
players.  
  
Q. You took three charges in the first half. Physical game, mental kind of
grind out there. How far do you think this team's toughness is compared to the
beginning of the season?  
COACH BEILEIN: Great question. We've noticed just lately that the different
things we'll go into a game with a different defensive plan we won't go in
there with the same defensive plan every time. And we were having trouble
adapting from the last game to the next game. To try to use our strengths to
negate their strengths.  
And we've seen this plan evolve where now they can adapt on the fly a little
bit. I was proud of what they did. That was a big emphasis the last couple of
days which was the baseline drive, take the charge. We still have some guys
that have taken two or three charges all year. We've got guys taken 20. But
gradually they're understanding that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

COACH DECHELLIS: Well, I thought our kids really battled and played hard. We
got ourselves in the hole the second half. But I think we've got a bunch of
kids who really believe they can win and did a great job fighting back and
putting us in a position to win the game.  
And I think that's all you can ask for. We've had three great games with
Illinois. They've all been a possession game. It's always come down to a last
possession. Today they made the play when we didn't. But I'm really proud of
our kids and the way they played and the way they battled here this afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll take any questions for Talor or Stanley,
please.  
  
Q. Talor, what happened on the last play on the inbounds play?  
TALOR BATTLE: Well, I was guarding the inbounder, were told to kind of help. I
seen Meacham come off and he kind of tried to turn the corner dribbling the
basketball. And it's my job to help. So I kind of came out to help. And we had
a trap on him. And I actually kind of had the ball and he jumped out and made
a pass and Frazier was heady enough to step in and he was right there and he
laid the ball.  
  
Q. Talor, after they went up by 10 in the second half, seemed like you kind
of wanted to have the ball in your hands on a lot of occasions going after it.
Is that kind of your mind-set you had to take over the game there?  
TALOR BATTLE: I kind of -- I just, when you're down like that, especially in a
tournament where it's kind of one game you're out, I just been taught my whole
life to never stop fighting. And that's kind of what I'm made of. And Coach,
he kept calling plays for me trying to get me the basketball. And when Coach
called them I tried to make great opportunity of them and convert and help my
team come back.  
  
Q. Do you feel you've gained some experience from this and is it something
you can build on for next year?  
TALOR BATTLE: I think losing here in the first round hurts. But, like you
said, this is a great step forward for us. The past three games we've been
playing with four freshman and Stanley, a transfer, and we never played
collegiate basketball until this year. So for us to come out and play so
competitively against Indiana and here against Illinois, and we had the game
right down to the last seven seconds. I think it's a great step forward. And
Coach did a great job, especially losing Geary Claxton and Jamelle Cornley,
kind of rebuilding our team and having the other guys step up and other guys
in position to score baskets.  
STANLEY PRINGLE: I feel like we gained some experience from this. It was a
disappointing loss, but, like I said, overall I feel like due to the
circumstances it was a good season. We lost Geary Claxton and Jamelle Cornley,
but everybody kept fighting, upset two top-ranked teams and won our last five
games at home. I feel like the season was good due to circumstances, but
disappointing loss, that last possession.  
  
Q. You guys went to man there at the end, seemed like you were getting to
Illinois, flustering them a bit. Do you prefer to play man to man because you
have a chance to get at it on defense try to get some steals?  
TALOR BATTLE: Well, the past two games, we play zone, and that worked great
for us. But tonight Meacham, McCamey and even Frazier and Brian, they were
hitting shots. So credit them. And then the last four minutes we kind of just
going man to man is like a gut check and you have to dig deep and you have to
contain the basketball and fight through screens and that takes so much
toughness.  
For us to play if last four or five minutes like that, with that much energy,
is great. It brought us back into the game. It threw them off as they haven't
seen zone the past three times they've played us. So Coach kind of changed
things up and it worked. And I can't explain the feeling how it feels to lose
on that last play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time. Finish up with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see on the last play that happened?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I don't really believe games sometimes come down to the last
play. I think there's several plays we didn't make leading up to the last
play. I thought we had a pretty good shot or two. We were up one a couple
times with the ball, didn't score. The last play we didn't get a rebound on
the previous play. We knew we'd get the rebound and feeling a little better
about ourselves.  
So to say we didn't do this on the last play, Talor tried to help on Meacham.
Thought he was coming clean. Danny thought he had him. And we left the
inbounder and they made a play out of the little trap there and he laid it in
the basket.  
So that's the play. But there's several plays leading up to that that I didn't
think we made that we had an opportunity to. And we had an opportunity to get
a rebound we didn't get. As I always thought before, it didn't come down to
the last one. I mean, there's plays throughout the game that you gotta make,
or the last five minutes there were plays we didn't make, I thought.  
  
Q. At the same time, when you go into the locker room afterwards knowing
that play meant whether you could play on or not probably, that changes the
tenor of your speech to the kids?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I didn't say it didn't hurt. I'm never going to say we didn't
-- that in this last one we didn't do this, we didn't do that. But we didn't.
We didn't kind of guard the way we needed to. I'll be up all night wondering,
okay, we should have switched this, go back to zone on the baseline play. I
was worried about playing to the rim. You can second-guess yourself until
you're blue in the face.  
We need to get a rebound. We need to get a rebound and we're all pretty happy
and going down and going back and watching Purdue tape. But it didn't happen
that way. We have had three close games with these guys. It's all come down to
the last possession almost every game. And I was hoping it would tonight and
hopefully we can make a play. Just didn't happen.  
  
Q. Why the decision not to take the time out after their basket, did you
consider it?  
COACH DECHELLIS: We only had seven on the clock. To go baseline to baseline,
when you get the defense set up, it's really hard. So we thought we would have
a better chance, the ball went in with 3.8. And I told them in the tank we're
going to push it. If the ball went into the basket push it as hard as we could
the other way and catch them celebrating. And I think we probably had another
dribble or two and maybe a better shot.  
But, you know, with three seconds to go or 3.5, I think it went in, we just
made that decision in the timeout earlier if the ball went in the basket we
were getting it out and going and we were pushing it hard and not give them an
opportunity to set up and make a play.  
  
Q. What did you say to the guys on the team when you got back to the locker
room?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I think it's been a learning experience, a year for us. Some
kids grew up, had to grow up very, very quickly. I told them I was very proud
of them. We played hard here the last month or so. I think we've really
improved as a basketball team. I'm proud of them for that. I feel bad for the
seniors.  
But, you know, we've got a long way to go, too. We've got a long way to go.
We've got to improve over spring and summer. But I think our kids have worked
hard and they've tried to execute what we've asked them to do.  
And so for that I'm proud of them. And they've been a very resilient group.
I've said that all year. And down 10 or whatever, 11, they came storming back.
So there's some really, really good things.  
To kind of focus on the last negative thing, I don't think that does anybody
any good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what these last two games have meant for Jeff
Brooks?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I think Jeffrey's grown up. And we saw this for most of the
year out of Jeff. And maybe I didn't coach him right. I just told him he's
going to go out there and play you're not coming out. You make a mistake you
make a mistake, go play and have some fun. And I think he's done a real good
job the last few games. He's grown up a little bit and figured out how hard
you have to play at this level and how competitive it is night in and night
out and day in and day out in practice. He's going to be fine. He's a great
kid. Wants to learn. It's a big spring for him strength training-wise, get
stronger. They beat us up in the first half, second half I think we did a much
better job rebounding the ball.  
  
Q. You said maybe you didn't coach Jeff right. Could you elaborate on that,
could you have done something different?  
COACH DECHELLIS: We threw him out there to play. We didn't have that luxury.
We threw him out there. You make a couple mistakes, you gotta get a guy out.
But we didn't have the -- he didn't have to look over his shoulder. He could
just go play. And I think that's maybe what he needed, just a confidence that
I'm playing and play free and play loose and Jeff, he wants to do things
really, really well.  
And he wants to do things right. And sometimes, you know, things just don't
work out that way and you have to be able to adapt. That's what I've tried to
get across to him, in the sense that you can't play perfect. When you make a
mistake don't worry about it. And just move on to the next play and so that's
what I mean by coaching him well. I don't know if I got that point across to
him throughout the year that you just gotta, you gotta let it roll off your
back and keep making basketball plays and working.  
  
Q. Pruitt was really banging around inside. How do you think your guys
handled him and his presence?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Pruitt. He's a big kid and fifth-year senior, knows how to
play and get position. I think the kids did a good job and fought. I don't
think we did a good job the first half especially rebounding the basketball.
The second half, I thought we did a much better job and we're more physical
and aggressive. That's what we've tried to get the kids to be, they're not
strong. They're not bulky, but I think they can be very aggressive. We wanted
our post guys to be aggressive inside.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Lee Cummard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17053)

### [Jimmer Fredette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18200)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The all-tournament team is Lee Cummard, BYU; Curtis Terry,
UNLV; Wink Adams, UNLV; Rene Rougeau, UNLV; and Luke Nevill from Utah.
Tournament MVP Wink Adams.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some opening thoughts on the game.  
COACH ROSE: I thought it was a hard-fought game. Both teams played really
well. They play with a lot of energy in the second half, made a lot of big
plays. I think that energy level in the second half was a big difference. They
out-rebounded us, got some offensive rebounds. They were really good. They
played great. Deserved to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lee, UNLV on the offensive glass in the second half, what happened with
their performance there?  
LEE CUMMARD: They would throw it up and go get it. We had no answer for it.
Didn't play with enough energy. Congrats to them.  
  
Q. Lee, last year you kind of had the same experience here. Do you think
that carried over at all to the NCAA tournament? What effect might it have
next week?  
LEE CUMMARD: We know we're a good team. We're actually a really good team. I
don't think this will have an effect on what happens next week.  
We know we're still going to be playing and we're locking forward to
competing.  
  
Q. The first half you seemed pretty aggressive, kind of established that
lead. Was it just more them in the second half or do you feel like you lost
some of your aggression?  
JIMMER FREDETTE: I don't think we necessarily lost some of our aggression.
Just, you know, like we were saying, they stepped up and hit some big shots.
It's not like we weren't playing hard, playing good D. We were trying to get
out to their shots. They were just able to stick 'em tonight.  
  
Q. Jimmer, what enabled you to have so much success offensively tonight?  
JIMMER FREDETTE: You know, I guess they're -- just pushing the ball up the
floor as fast as we can, being able to play our game, get it into the post,
throw it back out. Play our game, dribble penetrate, looks for myself or my
teammates.  
  
Q. Jimmer, this is your first experience in this tournament. What do you
take away from it? What do you think you learned that you can apply to next
year?  
JIMMER FREDETTE: You know, just that it's a live-and-die situation. All the
teams are coming out here to play, to try to get into the NCAA tournament.
They're going to do anything it takes to be able to win that game.  
You know, the intensity is much higher. The crowds are great. So just be ready
for that next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thank you.  
Questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Wink Adams scored 14 straight points in that stretch late in the second
half. What enabled him to get on that hot streak? Did you have trouble
defending him?  
COACH ROSE: Probably a lot of hard work in the summertime. You know, working
out. He's a terrific player. He's one of the best players in our league.  
There were a couple maybe defensive mistakes during that string. But for the
most part he was just making big plays. We were contesting his shot. He can
get space, you know, with the dribble. He back-dribbles well. He's a good
penetrator. He was making big plays at a big time in the game.  
  
Q. Really aggressive first half. Was it more them in the second half or a
combination -- do you think you got on your heels a little bit?  
COACH ROSE: We shot the ball very well in the first half, which gave us, I
think, a little edge as far as energy was concerned. Our effort was really
terrific in the first half. We had some opportunities where we turned the ball
over at times, untimely times.  
I thought the second half, the game was a lot more physical. It was a lot
tougher for us to get the ball in situations that were comfortable
offensively. But we competed. We competed hard. They competed hard. They
started making a lot of shots. I thought a couple of shots Joe Darger made, we
had a hand right in their face. That's why they won 27 games. Good team. Good
players.  
  
Q. This seemed kind of similar to last year. Did it feel that way in the
second half? Your offense kind of abandoned you for a while. Is it similar in
a way?  
COACH ROSE: I think the feeling I have right now is similar, yeah.  
  
Q. After the season that you had, the best in school history, regular
season, is there a sour taste in your mouth as you go into the tournament? Do
you have any psychological work to do on your team going into the tournament
after this?  
COACH ROSE: I think you heard it from our players. They know it's a good team.
It's tough to lose. This is a very competitive group. What we need to do is
get home, get back out on the practice court and get after it.  
So that's what I expect us to do.  
  
Q. What did UNLV do to kind of stay in the game when Wink got in foul
trouble through the first half as you built a lead?  
COACH ROSE: They do what they do. They're extremely aggressive defensively.
Very active, athletic defensive team. One of the things I think that is a
telling stat is that I think we had 20-some-odd field goals and only eight
assists. They don't allow you to just get open catches and open shots. So you
have to create things.  
I thought we did a good job of that for the most part. But I think over time
it kind of wore us out. They've done that to a lot of teams.  
  
Q. How frustrating is it to come in here two years in a row, have games that
kind of were the same, end up losing on UNLV's home floor?  
COACH ROSE: It's frustrating. But I'm very proud of our players because we
battled, we competed. We came up a little short. But in this situation, came
up a little bit short because I think UNLV played really, really well. It's a
credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck next week.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to tournament champion UNLV. Coach, if you want
to just open up with some thoughts on the game.  
COACH KRUGER: Awfully proud for our guys. I thought they just did a great job.
I thought BYU had control in the first half. And I thought that flipped and we
got control early in the second half.  
But for 40 minutes, you had players on both teams, I thought, competing
really, really hard. And, again, just very happy for our guys. These three
guys at the core of everything, of course. Couldn't be more proud than we are
for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Wink, can you describe the confidence you were shooting with when you
scored 14 straight points there in that stretch in the second half.  
WINK ADAMS: I think after I hit the first one, you know, kind of was -- Curt
drove, created me the shot. I hit another one. I kind of got a lot of
confidence. My teammates believed in me, told me to keep shooting. I was just
able to knock them down for my team.  
  
Q. How exactly did you grab so many offensive rebounds?  
RENE ROUGEAU: I think just us, you know, really wanting it. Coach always talks
about whoever wins this game, you know, is the person who wants it the most.  
So I think, you know, us being smaller, quicker guys, we definitely have to
work our defenders. So any opportunity, extra opportunity, is a good look for
us. Definitely going hard to the boards always helps us.  
  
Q. Ren e, they held you in check in the first half. What was the difference
in the second half?   
RENE ROUGEAU: I just tried to get the jitters out. And at the same time, you
know, coach drew up a real good play where he basically got a lot of
confidence in me to attack Plaisted. I just have to take my time. I got a lot
of confidence in myself. I was able to, you know, try to drive and kick more,
try to check Plaisted. He did a good job on me; the whole BYU did in the first
half. I was struggling. I was glad coach drew up a few plays for me and let me
go ahead and attack them.  
  
Q. Could you perhaps talk about playing in front of your home crowd in the
tournament?  
CURTIS TERRY: Well, it definitely helps to be able to have the tournament in
Vegas. But it was pretty loud out there both ways. Early on when BYU went on
their run, it seemed like, if not half the crowd, almost all of it was for
BYU. Again, when we made our run late in the first half and the second half,
it seemed the other way.  
I thought it was a great atmosphere. Both teams played really hard. The fans
did what they're supposed, cheered their team on to victory, at least tried
to.  
We just go out there and play the game and let the pieces fall where they may.
The atmosphere out there was unbelievable for a championship game.  
  
Q. During this entire tournament, Curtis, you spent 16 seconds on the bench.
What kind of toll did that have on your body? What does that mean about you
and the NCAA tournament?  
CURTIS TERRY: I'm young, still. I'm only 22. So, I mean, I'm just gonna play
as long as I can, as hard as I can till I can't do it any more. I'm getting
enough rest at night, eating good. Coach asked me if I needed a blow. I told
him I'm okay.  
As long as we're still winning, just hope we can keep winning and keep being
on the court. As long as we're getting the job done.  
Next week we're just looking to get rested and get ready to play.  
  
Q. Was there any thoughts of last year's game when you trailed by 16 and 11
today? What was going through your minds at that point?  
RENE ROUGEAU: Basically it was just like last year all over again. When we
went in at halftime, we were down, we just said to ourselves, This happened
last year, how we were down big. But to only be down by four, that was kind of
a relief, you know, because BYU, they're real dangerous when they have a big
lead. They play with a lot of confidence.  
We definitely didn't get our heads down. If anything, we came out with a lot
of motivation and hunger and fire those first few minutes.  
  
Q. Curtis, four-year guy, a senior. Talk about your thoughts this being your
last game on this court.  
CURTIS TERRY: It means everything to me. To come here four years ago, when
Coach Kruger and the staff first got here, the whole motivation behind the
whole UNLV basketball program was to turn it around and take it back to where
it was many years ago. Slowly but surely we've done that. Last year we made a
huge leap. Then this year again we did the same thing.  
For me, I felt like I had four senior nights out here, last week, then these
three games this weekend. It felt the world to me. To play with these guys a
couple more times in Las Vegas. Now we have to take our show on the road and
get ready and just keep playing. For me, play as long as I can with these guys
and just have fun.  
  
Q. Consistently you have been a very strong team in the second half. What
are your thoughts on always having to come back going into the tournament?  
RENE ROUGEAU: I think, you know, just us wanting to get more I think
definitely helps that. We want to win this whole thing, especially it being
kind of your home turf. You kind of want to protect home court. At the same
time, you know, winning the tournament championship, that's an automatic bid.
Nothing's assumed.  
So we definitely wanted to win it just to get an automatic bid into the NCAA
tournament. Last year was such a great experience. We definitely wanted to do
that all over again.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, good job. Congratulations.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. A lot of the players for BYU got into foul trouble. Trent Plaisted, Sam
Burgess, Lee Cummard. How did that affect your strategy when you were
designing plays during the timeouts?  
COACH KRUGER: I think that kind of put BYU in a little trouble. Any time you
have to deal with that, I think it hurts what you had planned on doing in the
course of a ballgame.  
Again, any time you're in foul trouble, it disrupts what you're trying to do.  
It didn't change too much what we're trying to do. I think we came out wanting
to be about more aggressive in the second half, wanting to attack a lot more,
really regardless of who was out there we wanted to do that.  
  
Q. You set up a play for Ren e to start the second half. Did you feel it was
important to get him involved in the offense?   
COACH KRUGER: I thought it was. Rene has been such a big part of what we've
been doing from an activity standpoint. I thought the first two or three
possessions in the second half, Curt and Rene made a lot of good things
happen, created some open shots. We knocked those down. I thought that was a
big lift for the rest of the guys as well.  
  
Q. Talk about that stretch Wink went on in the second half scoring 14
straight points.  
COACH KRUGER: Like you said, he knocked down that first one. The next two or
three he had in rhythm, I think everyone fully expected them to go in. Just a
straight stretch run at a crunch time of a championship game.  
Wink is not shy about stepping up there. He likes that role, that
responsibility. Couldn't be happier for him.  
  
Q. With this big win today, how well do you think this will help your
seeding come NCAA tournament time?  
COACH KRUGER: I have no idea, of course. I think it would probably jump it
maybe one from whatever they were thinking, maybe two. I don't know. I don't
know where it started and I don't know where it will end up (smiling).  
We'll get a call like everyone else. We'll go wherever they tell us to.  
  
Q. Where does this year rank in your career? To do what you've done this
year, where do you rank this as far as your career, how satisfying this is?  
COACH KRUGER: It's very satisfying. Every team's a little different. I think
this team, it will be really satisfying to look back on what they've
accomplished for some obvious reasons. Maybe no one really expected them to do
that.  
I think the key to it all is the players expected to. I think people forget a
little bit about the five guys that start all being a lot of experience last
year. Even though they didn't play the same type of role, I think they were
part of it, a very big part of it. I think they benefited from that.  
We'll look back on this group with great satisfaction because they
accomplished something maybe people didn't expect them to do, played hard all
along the way, and very unselfishly, too.  
  
Q. What was the difference between this and your last meeting with BYU when
you lost?  
COACH KRUGER: In the second half I thought it was a little bit more like the
first meeting here when we kind of dictated defensively. I thought in the last
meeting at Provo we didn't dictate much on either end.  
I thought BYU dictated to us. They're an outstanding team, so you're not going
to win all those battles. In the first half, I thought BYU had a little
control of it. I thought the second half, we jumped up there and dictated a
little bit more.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Good luck next week and beyond.  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Lee Cummard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17053)

### [Trent Plaisted](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16408)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some general comments on
the game.  
COACH ROSE: It was a very competitive game, very physical. I thought that we
did a really good job late in the second half of executing in the halfcourt
offensively. Defensively it was a challenge all night. Their post players are
big and physical. They rebound the ball very well.  
I just thought that, you know, we made enough plays defensively to give us an
opportunity, and then we executed well down the stretch offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the responsibility that comes at this time of year
of being in the position you are to lead this team and how you deal with that
pressure.  
LEE CUMMARD: The stakes are high and we want to play and continue to play. We
know our team counts on us a lot for certain things, and leadership being one
of them.  
But, another thing is scoring, just getting down and being tough and showing
our team that we're tough. I think they feed off that a lot.  
TRENT PLAISTED: All the same things Lee said. I think our team, that's our
role on the team as captains, to kind of lead. That's the main thing.  
But one other thing I'd like to add is the fact that on our team, we're so
talented all the way around. It's not like it's -- you know, it's not me and
Lee that has the responsibility every game. Last game, I didn't have my best
offensive night and we still won by 20 points. We're a team that's very
balanced and we got guys that can step up in any situation.  
  
Q. Trent, could you talk about the stretch Chris Miles gave those three
baskets when you weren't hitting anything. Unlikely source of offense.  
TRENT PLAISTED: Chris Miles had a great game. He came in and gave us a lot of
energy. He gave us a huge lift. Offensively he made some great post moves.
That's stuff he works on every day in practice. He's a relentless worker.
You've got to give him a lot of credit because that stuff is paying off in
games.  
  
Q. Lee, you took the early charge on Lorrenzo. Could YOU describe the game
plan coming into the game.  
LEE CUMMARD: Lorrenzo is a great player, tough guard. We had a lot of
different things we were going to try to throw at them. They do such a good
job of countering whatever you do.  
But I just tried to slide in front of him on that play. Luckily, ref took care
of me (smiling).  
  
Q. Lee, is there something about their style of team that has made it
difficult for you guys to play against this year?  
LEE CUMMARD: Well, they're so well-coached. And I think of all the teams that
we play, they're one of the best teams of executing in the halfcourt. They got
that transition game. They get turnovers and steals, they play well off of
that. They slow it up, they walk it up, they're really tough to guard. But
their counters and how they're coached in the halfcourt is really pretty good.  
  
Q. Back in the championship game for the second year. Are you looking
forward to playing in the kind of atmosphere that you faced last year when you
played UNLV in that game?  
TRENT PLAISTED: Well, we don't know who we're going to play yet, so we don't
know quite what the atmosphere will be. Obviously UNLV probably has a bigger
following here.  
But we're excited to be back in the championship game. That's where our goal
has been, to get there. And we want to win tomorrow. We're going to take this
one game at a time. Our next step is Utah or UNLV.  
LEE CUMMARD: Yeah, really looking forward to it. Really, I had a bad taste in
my mouth after the last tournament championship. Excited to play in front of
the fans. Hopefully it's a good turnout regardless of who we play.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the second half, what you hear from the coach coming
out of the halftime.  
TRENT PLAISTED: I don't know. Coach is right here. Maybe you should ask coach
(laughter).  
He just told us to play with better intensity on defense, lockdown, be more
tuned in, just rebound the basketball. He said our shots were going to fall
eventually. We didn't shoot the ball very well in the first half. We were
getting good looks. Just wanted us to play with a little more confidence. To
start at the beginning, we maybe weren't as assertive as we should have been.  
LEE CUMMARD: One other thing. He just told us that we weren't playing the way
we should be playing, and we should play the right way (smiling).  
THE MODERATOR: Men, you two can go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. When you heard me ask them about the importance of taking ownership at
this time of the year, from your perspective, how important is it to be able
to lean on these guys in these critical games where so much is at stake?  
COACH ROSE: Well, both of these players have so much experience as far as
college basketball. They're both juniors, but they both started since they
were freshmen, played in a lot of games.  
I think that sometimes, you know, when the game may seem to be a little bit
bigger game, maybe a little bit more at stake, those players feel a lot more
comfortable in that surrounding because they've been there before.  
You know, hopefully that will help us tomorrow night no matter who our
opponent is.  
But what I really like about these two players and then our two seniors, Sam
Burgess and Ben Murdock, is they really take ownership in how we compete.
There are times when we're in the huddle in timeouts and I don't really need
to say a lot because they're encouraging each other and they're challenging
each other. That's a great feeling to have as a coach.  
  
Q. The stretch Chris Miles gave you there. You weren't hitting any field
goals. Came up with these three baskets to put you ahead for good.  
COACH ROSE: I think if you look back at all of our games, you'll find that
this team gets a lot of help from someone off the bench. I thought that Chris
Collinsworth gave us a really good lift in the first half. I thought in the
second half Chris Miles, his energy and his physical presence. It was such a
physical game. And he came in with a lot of energy. Hadn't played a lot of
minutes. And I thought that advantage that he had, our players really got him
the ball in a couple positions where he could really take advantage of that.  
And then, you know, he goes three for three, makes all three baskets. Trent
gets a little bit of a rest, gets to come back. That's, you know, kind of the
makeup of our team. Yesterday Jimmer came in and hit some really big shots for
us. Today Chris Miles comes in, hits some really big shots for us, good
defensive play. It's a pretty balanced group.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about defending Lorrenzo Wade in the second
half. There was a stretch that he was taking every shot. He was 5 for 14 in
the second half.  
COACH ROSE: Lorrenzo is such a versatile player. And the challenge we felt as
a coaching staff after playing him twice is that he loves to post up, but he's
not your typical post player because he has so many guard skills. He can back-
dribble, he can get space. He's a great passer. He's really good at gapping
people and drawing a little bit of help and then finding other people off a
pass.  
So what we really -- the only game plan we kind of really put together is that
we were going to, like Lee said, change things up. We switched off a couple
times and Trent had a chance to guard him. Quite a few times, Jonathan had a
chance to guard him. I think Lee guarded him most of the night. But, you know,
the challenge was not to foul and get himself in foul trouble.  
But I thought we were fortunate. He didn't play a lot in the first half. How
we were playing, to be able to go in at halftime with a lead, was I think a
pretty good factor for us.  
  
Q. The past two games you've had some close first halves. What do you need
to do tomorrow to make sure that's not the case?  
COACH ROSE: We need to have a close first half tomorrow, too. That's what you
want to do. You want to get yourself in a position where you're competing and
your guys are playing, and then you can come out.  
You never know the personality of the game. But as a coaching staff, when you
go in at halftime, you hope you're ahead. That's been the case both days. So
we'll try to do that tomorrow, too.  
  
Q. The pace of the game seemed to be particularly slow. Were you worried,
concerned? What was your feeling on the pace of the game? How would you try to
maybe pick it up?  
COACH ROSE: Well, I think that we did a good job of trying to speed up. The
problem is we didn't finish. We turned the ball over seven times in the first
half. And we got ourselves in too big of a hurry. They're very athletic. They
close gaps really quick. They're long. They can tap the ball from behind.  
So we really felt that in the second half we wanted to take advantage of
opportunities. But I think we were a little more patient offensively. And
then, like I said, the last 10 minutes I thought we really executed well in
the halfcourt, were able to capitalize on some real big plays that our guys
made.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Jim Boylen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18166)

### [Shaun Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18189)

### [Luke Neville](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16410)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some comments on the
game.  
COACH BOYLEN: Got to give UNLV credit. They made the plays. Proud of my team.
Held them to 39% on their home floor. Played our hearts out. They created
offense with the dribble. We have to generate offense. They did a better job
of creating the offense in the second half. They made the plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the possession where they got the couple offensive
rebounds, took a ton of time off the clock near the end.  
SHAUN GREEN: We were just guarding them. We had a plan where I was going to
switch out on whoever was going out to set the screen.  
They just shot tough shots, and we just couldn't find Rougeau. He had timely
offensive rebounds. It was one of our keys going into the game, because we
know he's a great offensive rebounder. He seems to get timely ones all the
time. We just couldn't find them when we needed to and it cost us.  
LUKE NEVILL: Along the same lines. We just -- I personally just couldn't get a
body on him. He had a nice running start to get rebounds and I just wasn't
able to hit him and cut him out, especially end of the game when, like Shaun
said, ton of rebounds. He got them. Got them extra possessions at the end of
the game and that was crucial for their win.  
  
Q. Did either of you have a good look at the out of bounds play that they
ruled went off of Lawrence? Thoughts on the call?  
SHAUN GREEN: I was over there, but I couldn't tell whether it went off his leg
or not. So I can't really comment whether it was a good call or not, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks. Appreciate it.  
Questions for coach Boylen.  
  
Q. The possession at the end and the out of bounds call at the end.  
COACH BOYLEN: That was A1 on our board, cutting Rougeau out. We didn't get it
done. That's what he does. That's how he helps them win. He did it last night
against TCU. He did it tonight against us.  
It wasn't the volume of offensive rebounds they got. They got nine. But he got
six of 'em, and he got three of 'em at the right time. Giving up nine
offensive rebounds is not, you know, the end of the world. That happens in
games. But they were so timely, we made stops, we played good defense. I
thought the adjustments we made defensively from last Saturday to today were
outstanding. I thought our defense was awesome.  
But you got to cut people out to finish off the possession, and we didn't do
that.  
About the -- I don't know. Why do you ask me those questions. I can't comment
on that.  
  
Q. Now that you've been through a tournament here, do you have any thoughts
on the tournament being in Las Vegas?  
COACH BOYLEN: I love it. I love it here. What I try not to be is a hypocrite.
When I got the job at Utah, I said to my AD, We'll play anybody, any time,
anywhere. We played at Gonzaga, at Cal, at Washington, at Weber State. We have
a tough league schedule. We played everybody we could that would play us to
give us a home and home to prepare for this environment, to prepare for league
play. I think it's great for the league.  
This league is a league that needs a brand. We need to grow our brand. Being
in Vegas is part of it and I believe in it. I think it's great. I love the
environment. I think it's great that it's here. You're never going to hear me
complain about it. It's where this league is at right now. It's what we need.
It's good for everybody.  
If it could move to a different building someday, I think it will. But right
now this is the best building for our league and our situation. And I'm just
thankful to be a part of it. I'm thankful to be the head coach at Utah. We'll
be back here.  
  
Q. Your team is growing. What pieces do you need to complete the puzzle?  
COACH BOYLEN: What I said earlier is UNLV creates offense with dribble drive,
with talent, with aggressive offensive players. We have to generate offense
through sets, throwing the ball to the post, running pick-and-roll. I don't
have quick guards.  
I love my guys. I love my kids. Luka Drca is one of the toughest kids I've
ever coached in my life, 20 years of coaching. Tough, competitive kid. I love
him. But I have a developing team at the offensive end. I have a pretty damn
good team at the defensive end. In one year we've gone from ninth and ninth to
the top of the league. I'm proud of them for that.  
But that's the difference. You know, I've said that all year, people have
followed us. We've had a hard time guarding one-on-one dribble drive
situations. We've tried to do the best we could. On the other side of it, we
don't have a lot of guys that can do that. And when the game breaks down at
the end of the clock and your sets break down, when you have guys like Terry
and Adams who can create off the dribble and make plays and make guarded
shots, which I think they made a ton of guarded shots in our three-game series
with them, you have a great chance to win, great chance to win.  
Again, they made the plays.  
  
Q. You mentioned the sets offensively. Seemed like the offense struggled to
get going. What was one or two things missing from that offense?  
COACH BOYLEN: Well, I'm going to dispute that first part. Weren't we up at the
start of the game? Weren't we rolling at the start of the game?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BOYLEN: The other thing is, didn't we have better shots than them in the
first half? I thought we had better shots than them. Their pressure picked up.
They did a good job in the second half. I thought we had a hard time getting
the ball where we wanted to get it to. And you have to give them credit for
that.  
But I'll take the shots we had all day long. Shaun Green is one for seven,
0-for-4. All four of his threes were wide open. There wasn't a guy 10 feet
from him. I've said this all along in the Vegas series. We had more open shots
than they did. You got to make 'em. You got to make 'em.  
Were we stagnant at times? Did the pressure bother us at times? Hell, yeah, it
did. You've got to give them credit for that.  
Second question.  
  
Q. Luka, his maturity this year, at one point in that second half he came
over and grabbed you and gave you a hug, lightened the mood. Talk about your
relationship with him, how that's grown.  
COACH BOYLEN: He's my kind of guy. He's a tough guy who plays hurt. He
practices every day. He cares about the team. He's not afraid to call somebody
out. He takes ownership in his actions. He takes ownership in his mistakes.
Utah across his chest means something. He's my kind of guy. He'll be my point
guard and he'll be in my back court as long as I'm here.  
He's a tough, tough kid. He's what, to me, we're trying to build, and that is
ownership and accountability. When you put on that red and white, you're going
to be a tough guy. And he's a tough guy.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the possibilities of playing next week. It's early to
talk about.  
COACH BOYLEN: We'll play in any tournament we can. I think there's no better
proving ground, there's no better place to grow than a one-game elimination
tournament where you have to win to move on. My team needs that pressure. We
need that development.  
I'm hoping and praying that we get to play somewhere. We'll see how it goes.
If not, we'll be in the weight room and we'll start next year. The day we find
out whether we're going or not, if we're not going, we'll start next year that
day. I've been asked to build a program. We're going to build this thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Ryan Amoroso](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18153)

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Lorrenzo Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18152)

### [Billy White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18190)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with general comments on the game.  
COACH FISHER: I want to start by congratulating Beth Burns and our lady Aztecs
for the great job they did to be playing in that championship game tomorrow.
We were hoping we could lock arms with them and return the favor, but we just
didn't get it done.  
But Beth and her squad made us proud. And we're going to be cheering for them.  
I thought with Lorrenzo sitting on the bench for the first half, we did a good
job of hanging in there, keeping ourselves in the game. Had it gotten to a
point, I was prepared to put him back in the first half, but we were able to
maintain, only down one at halftime, had a chance to be ahead at halftime. We
felt good about where we were.  
All year we have struggled to consistently make shots. We had chances tonight
where we just didn't make enough shots. I thought in the second half, whether
it was the inability to make some open looks or a little fatigue, we gave them
easy baskets that we didn't give them in the first half. And that's the
difference between winning and losing.  
Zo and I were talking after the game. Even at that, about five minutes to go,
we had back-to-back opportunities down 5. You know, you cut it again to 2 or
3, but we didn't. So you don't go back-to-back conference champions and not
have a team that's capable of beating anybody. They're very good and they take
advantage of opportunities. They were better than we were tonight.  
We are hopeful that we'll have an opportunity to play again this year. I'm
hopeful that our conference will be represented in a fashion that it should be
with multiple berths, and that BYU and whoever else would get in would carry
the banner proud for the Mountain West Conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ryan, Plaisted was more of a factor tonight than he had been in the
previous two regular-season games. Could you talk a little bit about what was
different tonight in the paint.  
RYAN AMOROSO: I mean, I think for the most part, I didn't do a very good job
of kind of keeping him away from the hoop. I kind of let him get the ball too
close to the hoop. He was able to capitalize. You know, when I picked up two
quick fouls there in the first half, it's kind of a tough situation.  
But I think he played well for the most part tonight.  
  
Q. Billy, early in the first half you had I think it was three straight
buckets when you were really attacking him. Later on you couldn't seem to
develop much offensively. Did anything change for you?  
BILLY WHITE: Just a little bit. Every time they tried to front me, every time
I got the ball, they tried to double-team me and I had to kick it back out.
They did a very good job of not letting me get the ball.  
So, yeah, it was kind of different.  
  
Q. Did that early foul trouble, sitting out for most of the first half, get
you out of sync offensively?  
LORRENZO WADE: It's tough to say. Who knows if I'd have shot the ball better
if I'd have played more in the first half.  
Bottom line, when I did get in the game, I don't think I did as much as I
possibly could to help my team win. I needed to be more - I don't know -
intense out there on the floor and a better leader. They did exactly what they
needed to do to keep us in the game, especially while I was out.  
When I got in in the second half, I don't think I made the best decisions.  
  
Q. Billy, talk about the nerves of playing so many minutes as a freshman and
also the added nerves of being named the freshman of the year.  
BILLY WHITE: It felt pretty good. You know, to be freshman of the year, I try
my best to help my team win every game. I play a lot of minutes because I play
my heart out every game. It's up to coach to play me. I think I did a good job
this year. Hopefully next year I can do a little bit better.  
  
Q. Lorrenzo, I know the decision is not going to rest in your hands. But
right or wrong, do you think you deserve to play again this year? In getting
an NIT bid, how deserving?  
LORRENZO WADE: Statistically speaking, no team in the Mountain West Conference
whose achieved 20 wins in the season hasn't made post-season play. I feel
we're definitely deserving of an NIT bid. We had a couple of key wins,
especially against BYU at home.  
But, you know, it's not in our hands. We'll be prepared if they come calling.
But if it doesn't happen, you know, we'll definitely be prepared to go next
year.  
  
Q. Lorrenzo, even when you were on the bench in the first half, it looked
like you were pouring your heart and soul out into this game. How much does it
hurt right now for you?  
LORRENZO WADE: It's a tough one to swallow. You come into a game like this, I
mean, you have Lee Cummard on the other side. Regardless of what anyone says,
I look forward to matchups like that. To be on the bench, to see my team out
there without me playing, it's definitely tough.  
When I got back in, like I said, I tried to do what I could. But I could have
been better. I could have been a lot better. It hurts a lot. But there's
nothing I can do about it right now. Hopefully we get this NIT bid. If not, I
got a lot of things to improve on during the summer.  
THE MODERATOR: Also, guys, you can go.  
Questions for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. Does playing in a tournament like this lend itself to maybe playing a
little slower paced than you might anticipate or was the health of your team
maybe more of a determining factor in that?  
COACH FISHER: BYU is the best running team in our league. We wanted to try to
run when we created a turnover, look to see if we could run off a miss, and if
we couldn't, we wanted to make sure we got through a set and we had another
one to go into.  
We did not want to get into an up-tempo 80-point game. They've got greater
depth. You know, we've had some injuries and some illness.  
So we felt it was to our advantage to not get into an up-and-down game, but
you can't win if you don't get some easy baskets. So our thought was, can we
score in the first seven seconds or maybe in the last seven seconds?  
  
Q. I know you don't like to get into this thing, but how many kids on this
team were sick?  
COACH FISHER: Well, too many. Everybody goes through it. When you start
carping on who's sick, who's hurt, you're not dealing with reality, because
you play with whoever you've got.  
I'm sure BYU's had some sick and hurt people. So rather than get into all
that, I'd just as soon say that I'm proud of how hard we fought and yet we
just couldn't take away easy baskets for them in the second half. I thought
the first half we did a really good job. By my calculations, they had eight
layups in the second half. You can't give a good team that many.  
Plaisted, to answer your question that you asked Amo, he ain't all conference
for nothing, he wasn't freshman of the year for nothing. He's good. We've done
a terrific job on him in the past. He got a little deeper into the sweet spot.
I think he's playing better than when we played them earlier also.  
So it wasn't my thought coming in here a week ago that Matt Thomas would be
our power forward. But Billy, you know, we played him too many minutes. We
didn't know if he was even going to be able to play.  
But we're going home and they're going on. Hopefully we will learn and get
better. We're all going to get flu shots before the season next year. That's
going to be mandatory.  
  
Q. Considering how much you lost in Brandon and Mo, how much does it speak
to your team's ability to be consistent, win 20 games this year, to be where
you were this year?  
COACH FISHER: You know, everything's relative. But I think we've got a program
now. I think we've got a program that expects to win 20 games. Now we've got
to raise the bar even further. It's been raised for us.  
But we've got to raise it further and say, 20 ain't enough. We want to win
this league. We want to be with one game to go with a chance to win the
league. We want to do what BYU's done the last two years, what we did three
years ago. I think our kids feel that.  
I think what we have done is we've had guys that have been in a program. We've
had a couple of the guys that were here when we went to the NCAA tournament
and won the conference undefeated. Most of them were here when we last year
fought and went to the NIT with 22 or 23 wins.  
You know, I think that's what good programs have. I think we're proud of the
fact that we can say that we've got a good program.  
  
Q. Is there any reason those 20 wins should prevent you from going to the
NIT?  
COACH FISHER: You know, everybody but me two weeks ago started circling and
saying, These are teams. I have not done that.  
I don't have a clue. I hope that we do. I think that we would represent well.
The point Lorrenzo made, I told the team, I think that's true. Somebody that's
smarter than I am told me that no team from the conference who's won 20 games
hasn't gone. So I'm hoping that trend continues.  
If it does, we're going to be in the NIT. But if it doesn't, as Lorrenzo says,
we've got work to do. We will hopefully use that as a motivation to get ready
the next time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Wink Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17064)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Curtis Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18159)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, go ahead.  
COACH KRUGER: I thought you had two teams playing just really, really hard. I
think any time you play Coach Boylen's team, you know they're going to come
out with great effort and intensity, very well-organized and prepared.  
Proud of our guys' response. I thought our guys stepped up there and battled.
I thought both teams did for 40 minutes. Really outstanding college basketball
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. That possession where you had three offensive rebounds, can you talk
about that.  
CURTIS TERRY: I think all the credit goes to Rene, just hustling, flying
around, just keeping the possessions alive for us, giving us another chance to
not only take time off the clock, but also get another look at the basket.  
WINK ADAMS: Just like Curtis said, all things go out to Rene. Rene, he worked
hard. He's on offensive and defensive boards. Whenever we can get extra
possessions, it's always good to our advantage. We was able to score off of
them.  
  
Q. Curtis, you were playing with a lot of emotion tonight. Can you talk
about what this game meant to you.  
CURTIS TERRY: Just trying to be aggressive and trying to do everything I can
to help our team be successful.  
We're feeling confident right now. We like the things we're doing on offense
and defense. We had a lot of confidence tonight attacking Utah. Just trying to
go out there and leave it on the court and try to play another day and try to
make it to tomorrow. We're there now, so we just got to rest up and get ready
for BYU tomorrow.  
  
Q. Wink, you out-rebounded everybody on the Utah team, including Luke
Nevill. Can you talk about the little things this team has to do because of
their lack of size to crash the boards.  
WINK ADAMS: We put all the emphasis just on the defense, you know, boxing out,
all the little things a lot of people don't like to do, but that's the things
we need to do to win games. Tonight I think we did a great job boxing out. I
was able to go in and get some long rebounds for my team. Rene started getting
some rebounds when we really needed it. Everybody was just doing a great job
on the boards tonight.  
  
Q. You blew out BYU here. You lost big up there. Thoughts on facing them for
the title tomorrow?  
CURTIS TERRY: We're ready for a battle. Our first two games so far have been
long, hard-fought games. We're expecting nothing but the best from BYU. We
know they're going to have a lot of emotion and fire, trying to come out here,
both teams trying to compete and win a tournament championship and the
automatic bid to the tournament. That's obviously a big thing and everybody's
goal for the whole season.  
Get some rest and let the coaches come up with something and we'll try to go
out and execute to the best of our ability and try to get the job done
tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. There was a moment in the second half where it seemed like you were a bit
frustrated. You had a few turnovers. You're the captain out there as far as
running the rock. Tell us what you did to get the team back in the groove.  
CURTIS TERRY: Just trying to reassure everybody. Myself, I had a turnover,
dribbled off my foot one time. Rene got on me, let me know about it. I told
him, I won't do it again. Everybody is just trying to be positive and reassure
each other that if we slip up, we'll just work harder the next possession on
defense and get it back, go down and execute on the other end. Guys are just
working hard, working together, testing each other. That's the biggest thing
with us.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thanks very much. We'll let you two go.  
Questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. You were up by two with a minute and a half left. Coach Boylen took Luke
Nevill out of the game. Were you surprised by that? What was your plan to
attack the Utah defense with him on the bench?  
COACH KRUGER: Coach Boylen was playing kind of offense, defense there with
Luke. We were trying to create a mismatch on our end offensively. It's a
pretty normal thing to do, to try to match up with -- Tillie is a little more
active laterally. No, that's what they've been doing. That's what we would
expect them to do.  
I think it's a smart thing to do.  
  
Q. How did it feel to finally have your two biggest players get over 20
points in a game?  
COACH KRUGER: It's great to get points out of anyone. Again, this is a group
that doesn't really care who gets them. They've had different guys step up at
different times. But to have Curt and Wink both score aggressively on the same
night really helps our chances to win, of course.  
But, again, the job Joe did, only scored a couple points, Matt Shaw, those
guys really I thought battled Nevill, who is really a tough matchup, all night
long.  
  
Q. Any early thoughts on the matchup with BYU?  
COACH KRUGER: Just haven't had any thoughts at all other than just generally,
you know, they're our league champion. They've had an outstanding year.
They've got a lot of weapons, a lot of difficult guys to match up with. Very
deserving champions. We look forward to the challenge that we know it will be.  
But they've had just a terrific year.  
  
Q. I know you're looking at nothing but BYU tomorrow. Everyone in the room
is thinking about this. Do you think with the win tonight your team will be
part of that dance?  
COACH KRUGER: My opinion doesn't really matter, you know. I think coaches in
our position would think that, yes.  
But we're not changing our thoughts at all. We've got to focus on tomorrow's
game and line up and play a very good BYU club, not think about anything else.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Adam Nigon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18100)

### [Marcus Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15571)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just take a minute or two and provide
some thoughts, general comments on the game.  
COACH MILES: Well, I've said this before, and I'm sticking with it, I mean,
you got to use your imagination in this a little bit, but those guys remind me
-- BYU reminds me of the Harlem Globetrotters. I mean, they pass, they cut,
they make shots. Oddly enough didn't the Washington Generals wear green and
gold? I mean, it just looked to me like the way they play and the way they
move the ball, you know, they had 23 assists on 30 turnovers, that they really
look like a marquee team to me.  
I was very impressed with BYU. And to our team's credit I thought they -- you
know, we battled for most of the first half. We just turned it over a few
times and allowed transition. You can't allow transition for BYU or they'll
get away from you.  
So credit to BYU. I'm proud of our kids. I thought they battled. They never
gave up all year. That's more difficult to do than you think it is.  
But at the end of the day, they played with great heart and soul, and I just
appreciate that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions for the next few minutes for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcus, what was going through your head when they went on that run in
the second half? I mean, it was kind of like everything they threw up was
going in and nothing you guys could do was right.  
MARCUS WALKER: Well, for me it was just not to let the, you know, lead get too
big, you know, to where we could hopefully get it under control. But, like
coach said, a couple turnovers and a couple mistakes, leaving shooters to try
to help, you know, that wasn't a part of the game plan. Kind of, you know,
messed it up for us, so...  
  
Q. Adam, let's put coach on the spot right here. Do you think you earned a
scholarship for next year based on what you accomplished this season?  
ADAM NIGON: I don't know. I'm not really worried about that right now. I
wasn't worried about it in the season. I just had to keep playing hard and
just kind of earn my way on the team. I haven't even really thought about
that.  
COACH MILES: I don't think you are really putting Adam on the spot there
(laughing).  
  
Q. All told, even though it probably was a little painful against BYU, was
it worth staying overnight, you know, getting the extra day here?  
ADAM NIGON: Definitely. It was definitely worth another day, you know, to play
another team. It's hard when you don't win a conference game and you get
matched up with a team like BYU your second game after the tournament. We just
can't put ourselves in a position like that.  
  
Q. Marcus, it seemed like in the first half offensively you guys were kind
of doing what you want to do, shots were falling, hitting the three-pointers,
getting the drives. What did they do differently defensively that changed
that?  
MARCUS WALKER: Well, I think they played good defense. But I think, you know,
we kind of messed up more offense a little bit and, you know, handed them a
couple turnovers that led to, you know, easy buckets for them.  
So I think it was more or less on us. And, you know, they did play a good
game. But I think it was more or less on us making, you know, mistakes.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Marcus or Adam? All right, guys, thanks.
Questions for Coach Miles.  
  
Q. A pretty remarkable season when you look at it, all told. BYU is a team
that has great what they call spurt-ability. They're the kind of team that,
you know, all of a sudden they put up a 15-1 run on you. When you know you are
playing a team like that, what do you have to do to make sure that that
doesn't happen?  
COACH MILES: Well, you've got to make it as ugly a game as you can in terms of
style of play. You know, when they run and they're able to run, they're
remarkable. And I don't think I'm overstating that either. They really are fun
to watch when they run. I mean, they're as good as a lot of teams across the
country, obviously - and I mean the elite teams. So you just got to eliminate
that.  
And we just -- like we told our guys in the locker room, when it got away from
us, we really played bad offense. We took bad shots, made bad decisions, drove
it, forced a shot instead of stopping and finding the next open guy. Kind of
quick playing for our teammates and we got worked up. When you do that, that
plays right into their hands and they're talented. Now they're just going to
break it down. And now when they're just running down the floor, it's: Katie,
bar the door, it's over. So you have to avoid that at all costs and just muck
it up and make it a low-possession half-court game.  
  
Q. What adjustments do you think BYU made at half-time that made all the
difference in the second half?  
COACH MILES: Well, I thought they, you know, got to some of our actions. Got
to Andre McFarland a little better than they had been. I think they did that
late in the first half actually, then just stuck with it and really solidified
their game plan. We tried to show a few new things. We got that for a while.  
And they're smart. They just made the adjustments necessary. So I saw it more
right toward the end of the first half where they got to Andre McFarland.
Everybody does the same thing to Marcus: tries to deny him as much as
possible, and we need other guys to step up. Nigon did, right? Adam did. But
some of these other guys didn't. Some of the young kids didn't. Josh Simmons
struggled a little bit. Jesse Woodard struggled a little bit early, you know.
And, you know, when you are depending on freshmen, that's what you get some
days.  
But, you know, at the end of the day BYU I thought was just real solid
defensively.  
  
Q. Now I put you on the spot. Does Adam deserve a scholarship?  
COACH MILES: Adam deserves a lot of things. And he and I have sat down and
visited with that. And I'm going to treat him right when that time is right.
And I love Adam. I love him to death. And he's been remarkable for us. His
family's really supportive. And Adam is -- I mean, he knows where we need to
go and he wants to be part of it.  
Now whether I scholarship him or not, I have not decided. We're' just going to
see how recruiting goes, see how keeping the nucleus of our team goes. You
never know what talent you might retain or not retain.  
  
Q. Finally, is there almost some relief that you've got this behind you and
you just go on the road recruiting tomorrow, if not tonight?  
COACH MILES: I told Craig Smith, our ops guy, as the buzzer went off, I said,
Ding-dong the witch is dead. I just have this visual of the house coming out
of the tornado and falling on the Wicked Witch of the West. Maybe that will
translate into slippers next year. That's the optimist in me.  
  
Q. What does your team take out of this, this getting this extra day and all
that? What does that mean for this team and for the future?  
COACH MILES: At least, you know, when you go into your off-season, you don't
go there having lost 18 in a row and just feeling like, Oh, my God. You know,
we're -- you know, we can do anything. At least they have that luxury of
knowing that, you know, Hey, we still remember how to win and the resolve that
they never gave in, you know, that they competed no matter what, tried to play
the game the right way.  
And I put them in a position, you know, that was going to be shorthanded. That
was my deal and they knew that going in and they embraced that. They were
fine. Then we got beat up. That one we just couldn't afford. We could never
overcome that. And the kids, you know, in their credit, you know, they just --
they never complained. They never -- they just played, and they played hard.
You know, they played hard.  
  
Q. In this whole season, obviously obstacles from day one, but did you see
spurts of what you want to see and do you feel like you guys grew enough to be
successful like you want to be next year?  
COACH MILES: Well, we're only going to be successful if we recruit well and
get these guys some help. Now we've got a couple guys sitting out that are
fine. A young guard coming in.  
What I did see real positive were the freshmen; their attention to our game
plan, understanding, okay, you know, where we go, how we're going to double
this guy or how we're going to guard this action. And at the beginning of the
year it was a cluster of bad things. It was no good.  
And now at the end of the year, we had guys out there, freshmen out there,
saying thumbs down, thumbs down, you know, and calling out all of our calls
and bump, bump, bump. When you see that and hear them speaking the coach's
voice, that's very encouraging. And I did see some of that, especially the
last four or five games.  
So I am encouraged by that.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Miles?  
COACH MILES: Thanks, folks.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Neil Dougherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13804)

### [Brent Hackett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16928)

### [Kevin Langford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16929)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just take a minute or so and just your
thoughts on the game.  
COACH DOUGHERTY: Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate UNLV for, you
know, they played very hard. I felt our kids did. And they seemed to just make
the last play of a very hard-fought game. And a lot of credit goes them. They
did win the basketball game.  
You know, outside of that, I probably ought to just take questions, to be
honest with you. As I told my kids in the locker room, you know, we played
very hard. We played well. You know, we made some mistakes at times,
obviously. But I just really didn't have the words yet to describe tonight's
game to them. And I wanted to take some time before I -- before I actually
visited with them in depth about it. So that's what I'm going to do.  
Probably ought to just take questions.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach. For the next few minutes, questions directed
to either Brent or Kevin.  
  
Q. Have you guys ever been in a situation in your career where it seemed
like everything was going down like it was tonight?  
KEVIN LANGFORD: Yeah. I mean, we were just hitting shots. I guess it was just
our time to make shots. Because last few games, like, we haven't been hitting
any shots. So we just -- I mean Coach D, he told to us keep shooting it, keep
getting in the gym. And it just paid off for us tonight.  
BRENT HACKETT: It was a good game as far as just seeing all those shots go in.
A lot of -- a lot of shots that we don't even practice. But, you know, Coach D
instilled just confidence in us the whole time. I mean, that's what we just
kept doing, just kept shooting the ball.  
  
Q. Would either one of you guys just describe kind of that last 30 seconds
defensively, then what happened with that play on Wink at the end there?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: The last 30 or the --  
  
Q. Well, after you hit the shot, Brent.  
BRENT HACKETT: We went into zone, but they just penetrated and I guess he just
got his shot off. They called a foul and he made it. That put them over one.
That's just all it was. We just tried to get a shot off as quick as we could
the last three seconds. It really ain't much I can say about it. He just made
a good shot.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask either one of you guys, did you think -- I don't
know where your vantage point was, but did you think there was enough contact
there for the official to make that call, to make that a three-point play?  
BRENT HACKETT: I wasn't down there. And everything was kind of moving so fast
I really didn't even see what happened. Kev was there, so he can probably
speak better.  
KEVIN LANGFORD: What I think about it, it don't matter. That's just the call
he made. It just matters what's the ref thought, and he thought it was a foul.
So he made the call. And he made the free throw. And that's just how it went.  
  
Q. Brent, what had you coming into this game so confident? Last time you
were in this building you guys didn't shoot that well. You didn't really shoot
that well either.  
BRENT HACKETT: The last game here I think I only had like five or six points.
This was possible -- that was my last game. But I was going into it thinking
this is possibly my last game and I want to just play as hard as I can and
leave it out on the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Kevin or Brent? All right. We'll let you guys
go. Thank you. Good job, guys.  
  
Q. Coach, have you had a chance to see the replay of Wink Adams' play at the
end? And I'd like to get your thoughts on whether you thought that was a foul
or not or should that call have been made that late in the game?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: I'm already in trouble. I mean, what do you want me to tell
you? I'm already in trouble, guys. I think honestly I thought he made a tough
shot. I have not seen the replay. Really when the ball went down, my thoughts
immediately went to the fact that we had no time-outs and we had to figure out
a way to try and get a shot up in three seconds. So all of that processing
hasn't really brought me all the way back to what I thought about that last
play.  
I'll watch the tape just like I always do and, you know, keep it to myself so
I don't get in more trouble.  
  
Q. Coach, coming into this game, strategizing the game, if that's a word,
did you foresee this taking a lot of three-point shots, trying to outshoot
them, hoping you'd get a high percentage like you did or was that an
adjustment you made?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: Have you seen us play lately? We've been shooting about 20%
max.  
  
Q. So as they were going in --  
COACH DOUGHERTY: I think what happens in games like this, and you have to give
UNLV credit, what happens is you had situations where the pressure was so
great defensively that they would take us out of our initial set and then we'd
get into motion and try and run some clock in an attempt to maybe get back
into one to get a shot off. And, you know, college basketball's a funny thing.
You know, you can't explain all of it. You'd be wasting your time.  
But what happened was we got the ball. Brent Hackett got off to a nice start
to begin the game. And he was probably in a rhythm that I haven't seen him in
in a long time. He made a few shots. And then he made a couple tough shots
with the clock going down. Then you get into a situation where it becomes a
lit little built contagious. Ryan Wall, Keion Mitchem, Kevin Langford, where
it gets to the point where normally I'd want them to pass up on that
particular three, but the shot clock was down. We had to shoot it.  
As luck has it sometimes, where I'm hoping for just an opportunity to get a
rebound and extend the possession, the ball goes in. I can't explain why it
didn't go in the last two weeks. And so trying to explain why it goes in
tonight, I'd be guessing again.  
But I think sometimes when kids get their backs up against the wall and you
have to shoot it, you know, coach isn't going to say anything about, This shot
it's got to go up. And they made shots where we were really just hoping to
maybe get a rebound off of it.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you had defended Wink at all well, or the way you
wanted to to start off that last kind of possession?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: Well, I think there were about three people that went after
him and got the ball contained. We wanted to make sure that he didn't get to
the free-throw line, which we didn't do a real good job of. Obviously, he got
there. But he did have a very tough shot, and he made the shot. So you have to
give him credit.  
But we did -- we were able to get the ball contained. We were able to chase
him off of three. And then he made a tough play. He made a big-time play. He's
made a lot of plays like that in his career though.  
  
Q. With the way the second half of the season has gone, especially the last
two weeks, what does it say considering a lot of people wouldn't have blamed
the kids maybe if they had rolled over tonight, that they came out and
competed so hard?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: Well, we competed in every game that we played in the last
two weeks. We didn't always play as well. But our last game at home against
BYU we played very hard. We played hard again tonight.  
I don't think I've ever worried about our kids competing. I mean, they always
compete hard. They're going to continue to compete hard.  
  
Q. Coach, how many teams do you think deserve to get into the post-season
tournament this year, in your opinion?  
COACH DOUGHERTY: You're talking about out of our conference here? Well, you
know, obviously the tournament's got to play out. But if the tournament
stopped right now, I honestly feel like we deserve at least three, okay? And
the next step would be if one of the three that I don't have included on that
list were to go on and win the tournament, we should get four. I don't know on
that. But I honestly feel like we deserve three. And for our conference to
continue to get multiple entries at-large bids, we're going have to continue
to get better in everything that we do from, you know, the teams, the coaches,
teams and how the games are conducted because we can hurt ourself if we aren't
careful and what's put out there and how we handle game night.  
But I honestly think that we should get three.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks very much, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Sam Burgess](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18141)

### [Lee Cummard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17053)

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some general comments
about the game.  
COACH ROSE: It was very competitive game, especially the first half. I thought
that CSU came out and played with a lot of confidence. And, you know, ran good
sets and were able to get themselves good looks at the basket. Converted on I
think six three-pointers in the first half. I thought the second half we did a
better job of getting to their shooters, which allowed us to contest shots.
And then we were able to get out on the break and score some baskets in
transition. And we were able to play with a lot more confidence, I think in
the second half.  
But very competitive game. And we're just pleased to be able to move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. We'll direct questions to either Sam or Lee.  
  
Q. Lee and Sam, could you both describe what it was feeling like when you
just didn't seemingly missed very many shots when it was kind of flowing there
in the second half, just the feeling of confidence that maybe you guys had?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, it feels good. You know, especially after they had a good
first half and everything they were throwing up was going in. And so we knew
we always have big runs in the game and it was just a matter of time before we
hit ours.  
And once we did, I don't know what the run was there at the first half of the
second half, 17-0. But, you know, once we get going in transition, we can make
big runs at a time. So it was good to see that.  
LEE CUMMARD: I would just echo what he said. That's when we're at our best,
when we're getting stops and getting in transition and really putting some
pressure on teams.  
  
Q. Lee, could you talk about your team's shot selection. I can't remember
just a real bad shot taken in that game, you know, from a guy who was out of
his range or not where he's suppose to be on the court. Just talk about the
shot selection please.  
LEE CUMMARD: Yeah, we took good shots today. I think the reason for that was
because we were making extra passes and being unselfish. It's not very hard to
shoot a wide-open shot because your teammate passes up a shot for a better
shot.  
  
Q. Just that throw that obviously came in the second half, is there anything
in particular they were doing as to why it was there in the first half or did
it just take you guys a little bit to get going yourselves?  
LEE CUMMARD: I think it was just because, I mean, they kind of put it on us in
the first half more than we would have liked. And we came out with the right
mindset and just got in a stance and were better defensively. And that led to
a nice little run.  
Also our rebounds rebounding and just getting out in transition.  
  
Q. Talk about the young guys, especially Chris Collinsworth and their
contributions in the first half.  
LEE CUMMARD: They played well today, especially Chris. I mean he's got a
double-double. But he just brings a lot of energy. He generally can hit some
big shots at key moments and Michael Loyd was a spark as well off the bench.  
But Chris can do so much that he doesn't really do -- he lets us older guys
kind of play the way we want to play and he kind of does all the dirty work.
He's great at it.  
  
Q. I just have a quick question for you guys. You guys took an unprecedented
amount of shots from behind the arc in the second half. What were you guys
seeing from over there that made you guys get those many shots off?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, you know, it was just I think our team does a good job of
taking shots that are there. In the first half we just didn't have as many
open looks. And I think the fact that our transition game really opened up,
opened up the floor for everybody, so the few extras passes and somebody was
open and wide open.  
So I think we just -- the way we were playing in the second half with our
transition opened up those shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Lee or Sam? Okay, guys, you can take
off. Thank you.  
All right. Questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Coach, you pretty much started to pull away at the end of the first half.
Was there ever any mention or did you even and your staff even note what the
Colorado State women did to Utah last night as kind of a little bit more fire,
talk?  
COACH ROSE: I think our players, in our team meeting last night, were all kind
of, you know, talking about that score when I came into the room anyways. And,
you know, I think one of the big challenges at this time of the year is to get
your team to play with its utmost sense of urgency. And when you get two teams
out there that are playing with that, you know, great sense of urgency, it's
extremely competitive.  
And that's why it's such a popular game; that's why people come because this
is a great time of year, and you've got players that are really, really
competing.  
  
Q. Was there anything you said specifically at half-time that changed things
around for you in the second half? Or was it just a matter of shots going
in?  
COACH ROSE: We thought the biggest -- our biggest concern in that first half
was the fact they were 6 of 11 from the three-point line. So what we --
traditionally our team's pretty good defending the three-point line. And so we
made a couple adjustments as far as switching out on a couple of flare screens
that they were setting. But we wanted to get to the shooter on the catch and
contest the shot.  
And I believe that that's what really kind of ignited our offense, was the
fact that we got some misses early and were able to get some contested shots,
get some rebounds, then be able to get out in transition. And this team does a
really good job of sharing the ball in transition. We've got post guys who can
run and get and demand attention down at the basket in transition and then
that kind of leaves a guy or two open on the perimeter.  
And when we're playing with confidence and sharing the ball, you know, the
guys can really go.  
  
Q. Dave, could you talk again about the match-up with Burgess defensively on
Marcus Walker and how you thought he did in the game.  
COACH ROSE: I think over the last maybe ten games that Sam has become a good
technique defender because he's always been extremely tough, extremely
competitive. But his technique has gotten so much better over the last couple
of months. And he just did a great job of just being there on the catch.  
We were switching a lot of screens. So a lot of people had Marcus, but I think
that, you know, Sam has really become a lot more cerebral defensively. And he
is better with angles. But the other thing is that he's playing with so much
confidence. I think a lot of that has to do with how familiar he is with the
players and then with his opponents and the scouting reports that our
assistant coaches give to him, where I think that gives him a lot of
confidence.  
  
Q. Dave, it seemed like they were pretty effective against Trent early.
Without any big men in there, he was kind of struggling. Is there anything you
could see that caused that or was he just a little slow starting tonight?  
COACH ROSE: I think that a lot -- one of the questions earlier was, you know,
why there were so many three-point opportunities. Well, one of the reasons is
because of how they were guarding Trent. When Trent got a catch eight to ten
feet away from the basket, as soon as he dribbled it, they brought a couple
players to try to get down in there and knock that ball away.  
And I thought that when, you know, Trent came out early in the first half,
then when he went back in did a good job of hitting Jimmer I think for a shot,
then maybe hit Sam after the ball went into the post, then came back out for a
three-point shot. So I think that's one of, you know, Trent's really big
improvements over the course of this season, is that he's really become aware
of how teams are guarding him. Then he shares the ball really well with the
rest of our team.  
  
Q. Dave, when Chris Collinsworth comes into the game he's very aggressive
offensively. Did you expect that from him or is that a surprise when he takes
off like he did today?  
COACH ROSE: I think Lee put it best, that Chris has done a terrific job over
the course of the season of kind of understanding his role. And he is a great
rebounder - I think the best rebounder on our team as far as minutes played if
you just take the stats, minutes played and rebounds, especially in league.
And offensively he's very aggressive.  
And, you know, those will follow our team over the course of, you know, quite
a few big games he's hit big shots, made big plays for us. And, you know, he's
-- I think he just continues to get better as he gets more confident.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks very much, coach.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Jim Boylen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18166)

### [Johnnie Bryant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18165)

### [Luke Neville](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16410)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin, speak for a minute or two, just
opening remarks about the game.  
COACH BOYLEN: Well, first of all, I want to say I'm a little disappointed in
the media. I tell my guys when they go to class to sit in the front row, and
everybody is sitting way back there (smiling). That was a joke, guys.  
Obviously, thankful for the win. I'm proud of my team. We've been close. We've
been there before. We've been in every situation you can be in. And we've lost
games almost every which way you can.  
I felt like we were a team that was better than our record, played harder than
our record, and just hadn't got a break, hadn't got a bounce.  
I kept telling my team to just fight through, persevere, hang tough, believe
in what we're doing and come together. I'm just proud of what they did today.  
Obviously New Mexico is a very good team. I knew it was going to be a close
game. I told my team that. Every game with New Mexico has been just a terrific
college basketball game.  
I'm proud of Luke. I thought he played very well with four fouls. I'm proud of
Johnnie for his leadership. I'm proud of these two guys because "Utah" across
their chest means something to them, and that's important to me.  
THE MODERATOR: Next few minutes, questions directed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Luke, I wonder if you could take us through the last sequence with the
dunk, the block at the other end.  
LUKE NEVILL: You know, I saw him driving to the basket. He put up a shot. It
kind of reminded me of the Wyoming game last year where, you know, it was make
or break time. I knew it was going to be a close basket, so I just went up
there, blocked it. I just knew I had to do it. I knew I had to risk, you know,
maybe getting called goaltending. I went up there and just blocked the shot, I
guess.  
On the last possession, I was kind of disappointed in my first-half effort,
how I kind of didn't go up strong a few plays. Took a couple plays off
offensively. So I just tried to go up strong and just tried to dunk the ball
every single time. My teammates told me that. They said, You're the biggest
guy on the court, you need to dominate inside. I just tried to have the heart
and just competed.  
  
Q. Luke, talk about playing with four fouls for so long. Did you have to do
anything different during that time period?  
LUKE NEVILL: Yeah, I've been in foul trouble a lot of games. I knew I had to
stay in the game whatever it costed (sic).  
I wasn't going aggressive to the ball as I would if I had a foul to give. A
couple of times I gave them a layup, gave them an open shot because I just
needed to stay in the game.  
I thought maybe giving them a layup would be less costly for us than me being
out of the game. I was a bit passive on the defensive end. I just knew they
needed me there for the offense and they needed me there for rebounding.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't have a lot of time to celebrate. Tomorrow night
against UNLV. Talk about the matchup tomorrow.  
JOHNNIE BRYANT: UNLV, they're a great team, very athletic, they like to
pressure the ball. We match up great against these guys.  
We got them at home and they got us last week. It's going to be a real tough
game. We just got to go out there, compete, rebound, take our open looks. Put
ourselves in a place where we can win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you two go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Boylen.  
  
Q. Talk about finishing this game out, finishing the game well. You
sometimes struggled to do that at the end.  
COACH BOYLEN: I feel like a broken record in a way. I've been saying it all
year. We've been in this situation before. Every game it's a three, five-point
game. In the timeouts in the huddles, I just say that to my team, We've been
here before, we got to get a solid shot. We've got to get a three. I kind of
repeat all the things that have happened to us during the year, put it in
their head we can't let it happen again if we want to move to the next level
as a team.  
The other thing I want to get -- this team needs to get credit for, they're a
very good defensive team. That is a very good offensive team we just played.
You know, they made threes, they averaged 10 a game. They made six. They shot
38% the second half. My guys just gritted their teeth and grinded it out
against a very good team.  
That's what you have to do to learn how to win. You have to take care of the
defense. You have to give yourself a chance to win, and then learn how to win.
You know, we've been working on that all year. Today we were blessed to get
one.  
I said on my radio show, I really feel like this team is kind of an iceberg.
There's so many good things, big things under the surface. We just haven't
broke through yet. Maybe this is the win that will give us some confidence for
this year, but also for the future.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your emotions there. Looked like you had the game for
a while, then looked like they were going to win it. In a matter of seconds,
you win the game.  
COACH BOYLEN: I guess that's why they call it March Madness. It's up and down.
It's an emotional rollercoaster. Big plays. Big plays by them. Giddens is just
such a difficult guard for us. He just jumps over us, goes by us. Believe it
or not, we were trying to guard him. We were trying to keep him under control.
Man, I thought he had a monster, monster game.  
I actually thought we did a pretty good job on him. But he's just so talented.  
You know, we had timeouts left. I felt like we were in control of the game
with our timeouts, with our conditioning. I thought we were in a good place,
even when we were down. I felt we were right there. Then when you can throw
the ball to a 7 foot 1 guy, has good hands who can make places and you have
Luka Drca running my offense, I think we got a pretty good team. You know,
that's what we had.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about playing Vegas again. You played them five or six
days ago.  
COACH BOYLEN: Well, you know, we've had a great series with them, too. A great
game at our place, a great game here. 61-61 I think with a minute 36 to go.
They're difficult to play against with their pressure defense.  
Obviously they got a terrific leader over there in Lon Kruger. We just have to
get ready to play, play defense, challenge the three, rebound the ball. You
know, we turned the ball over in the last minute down here last week. I
thought we had the game under control. We made a mistake at the end. That cost
us. We got to try not to do that tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it. Good luck.  
COACH BOYLEN: Thank you.

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Tim Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18150)

### [Andrew Henke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17004)

### [Jeff Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18151)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just take a minute or two and give us
some opening comments about the game, we'd appreciate it.  
COACH REYNOLDS: I thought our kids really battled in the second half. I
thought the game could have went either way. You know, unfortunately, we
didn't make a couple of shots, but really proud of our kids' effort. Just
never-quit attitude and had a chance to win it down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thanks, coach. For the next few minutes we'll just
have questions directed to Andrew or Tim.  
  
Q. Tim, how did you guys change the game and come back in the second half?  
TIM ANDERSON: I think we just had to bring more effort to our offense and
defense. San Diego State's a good team and they jumped out on us. But we had
to, you know, wake up and answer the call.  
  
Q. Hey, Tim, did you ever think that you'd be involved in a game where the
team would score four baskets in the second half and win?  
TIM ANDERSON: I didn't know that fact. But, I mean, that just is a testament
to how tough of a game it was. It was a struggle on both ends of the court.
And so, it was a battle and it could have gone either way.  
  
Q. Tim, can you take us through what happened on the, I think, 15 seconds
left Anwar went up for the lay-up and looks like you had a chance for the tip.
How good was the chance? If you can just take us through that sequence what
you saw.  
TIM ANDERSON: I saw Anwar driving in there strong. It came off and there was
an opportunity for a tip-back. But there was another player there that tipped
it away as well. So it was just a scramble play.  
They got a break and we missed an opportunity.  
  
Q. Andrew, how do you feel about the team, you know, looking ahead? You'll
be the leader next year.  
ANDREW HENKE: I don't think too many of us are focused on next year right now.
We played our hearts out tonight. And every guy in that locker room
contributed to this whole season and to this game even though we lost.  
But I think a lot of us are keeping our heads up and hoping we play another
game.  
  
Q. Tim, this is I guess you guys still haven't won a conference game. Was
this the toughest for you just the way the game kind of went down at the end
of the game?  
TIM ANDERSON: I think every year conference tournament is a tough game. I
can't really say this is the toughest one because in the past few years we've
had some close games as well. And so this was definitely a battle.  
And I mean, I'm blessed with these great teammates and great coaching staff
because they kept us in the game most of the game. And it was a battle and I'm
just happy to be on a team like this.  
  
Q. Hey, Andrew, can you talk a little bit about the first half because they
seem to hurt you guys a little bit with Amoroso around the rim then you really
shut that off in the second half. What were you doing differently there?  
ANDREW HENKE: I think in the second half we took care of the ball a little bit
better. We had 11 turnovers in the first half and that led to some easy
buckets. Amoroso got a couple as well at the end of the shot clock and they
were hitting shots at the end of the shot clock too.  
So we gave them a lot of credit that they hit some tough shots when they
needed to and they made plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Tim or Andrew?  
  
Q. Tim, Andrew mentioned hoping it was your guys' last game this season.
What do you think the chances are for a post-season tournament?  
TIM ANDERSON: As far as I understand it, there's two tournaments that we have
a possibility to get into right now. And so we're hoping for a bid. And
hopefully our conference was strong enough this year to prove that we deserve
a spot.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. Tim and Andrew, we'll let you guys
leave. Good job.  
Questions for Coach Reynolds.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of take us through the last 20 seconds. You get the
charge call. They put on the press. Anwar breaks the press. Were you hoping
he'd pull up, maybe look for a last shot, call timeout or were you glad he saw
the opening and got aggressive and went for it? It was his first shot of the
game.  
COACH REYNOLDS: No, we encouraged him to drive the basketball. In that
situation we knew they were not going to foul. They didn't want to foul. And
unfortunately, he got all the way to the rim and had an opportunity at a layup
and it just didn't go in the hole. But we didn't want to call timeout.  
And we had went over those, the opportunity situations in practice, and just
didn't bounce our way.  
  
Q. It was an interesting game in that you guys -- it's not unusual for you
guys to go stretches without scoring or without scoring a lot of points
anyway, but you went without scoring for four minutes in the first half. And
you had eight points midway through the first half. What was going on there?
Why weren't you more effective offensively early in the game?  
COACH REYNOLDS: I thought San Diego played some solid defense. I thought they
did a nice job of challenging our shots. I thought we had a couple of shots
that went in, just didn't go in, that were open. But I thought San Diego State
really pushed us away from the basket. They did a really good job with their
post defense.  
You know, and we weren't able to get anything generated off of our defense to
get any easy shots.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, did you feel like your guys expended so much
energy coming back that maybe they didn't have enough left in the tank at the
end or how did you see that at the end of the game?  
COACH REYNOLDS: No, I didn't see that. I thought our effort was superb in the
second half all the way to the end of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach Reynolds?  
  
Q. Coach, again, thoughts on chances for a post-season tournament for you
guys?  
COACH REYNOLDS: Well, we certainly hope that we get some consideration. That's
out of our hands right now. The -- you know, what we have told the kids that
we'll meet on Sunday, and proceed accordingly.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, coach. Good luck.

### [Lorrenzo Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18152)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you can begin with just some general comments on the
game.  
COACH FISHER: Three games we've played them, and each of them have been games
that were hard fought, hard to score, and close. And today was another one.
And you win if you are able to make plays, and then make important plays down
the stretch, and we were able to do that. We got beat 46-43 on Saturday and we
were 9 for 18 from the free-throw line. Today we were 20 for 22 and made them
all down the stretch. And the difference between moving on and going home.  
And so we were able to make plays against a team that's hard to score on, and
we feel good about ourselves that we're going but know that we were fortunate
in some areas to win.  
Lorrenzo 10 for 11 from the line, made every play down the stretch. Amo 9 for
10 I think from the free-throw line and Richie, who ran the team for us.  
So it was a good victory for us and one that allows us to take a deep breath
and feel good about ourselves for 30 seconds.  
  
Q. Is there such a thing as a 'bad win'?  
COACH FISHER: Absolutely not, there's no such thing as a 'bad win'. I would
agree with that 100%.  
THE MODERATOR: All right thanks, coach. For the next few minutes we'll have
questions directed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. 20-seconds left, you got the charge call, you put on the press. How
surprised were you when they broke the press that they took it all the way to
the hole instead of maybe backing out and looking for a last shot?  
LORRENZO WADE: Well, with 20-seconds left in the game, there wasn't very much
more they could do. I guess they could have brought it out and tried to run an
offense.  
But any basketball player who has an open lane in that situation is going to
attack the basket. So we weren't surprised.  
  
Q. How confident were you at the end of the game with the free-throw line
because you went there a lot?  
LORRENZO WADE: I was pretty confident. I don't want to go back to San Diego
tonight or tomorrow morning. So I knew I had to try to do whatever I could to
help us win the basketball game.  
Wasn't getting very many open looks in the game. So I knew that I had to try
to get some contact to get to the free-throw line and have some confidence in
myself when I get there that I would make it.  
  
Q. Ryan, have you ever been part of a game where you've scored four baskets
in one half and won?  
RYAN AMOROSO: Well, it's the fourth time I've played Air Force throughout my
dream career. If it was going happen against any team, it would probably be
Air Force. Because it's pretty much a grinding game. And to me that's really
no surprise that we only scored four field goals in a half against the team.
But down the stretch we did what we had to do to win.  
  
Q. What was your health situation like before this game? I heard you were a
little ill.  
RYAN AMOROSO: My health?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
RYAN AMOROSO: My health over the past couple, three, four days hasn't been too
good. But when it came down to it I just really had to put all that behind me
because I knew that my teammates needed me, to, you know, come out here and
perform at 100%.  
You know, that's just what I tried to do tonight. And fortunately we came out
with a victory.  
  
Q. Richie, during that 14-minute stretch where you guys weren't able to get
a basket, how frustrated did that Air Force defense have you guys at that
time?  
RICHIE WILLIAMS: It was kind of frustrating because one of our emphasis was
not letting them dictate the pace of the game. And they're a really good team
in what they do which is dictating and slowing it up and running 35 seconds of
offense. So when you can't get a basket, it kind of converts to being real
sluggish on defense, and that's what we didn't want to do.  
  
Q. Is it pretty tough to keep your cool when things are going like that? And
how were you guys really able to hold it together?  
RICHIE WILLIAMS: Not at all. We got a lot of team comradery, so when one guy's
down, we have another guy to pick him up. Just got to stay positive.  
  
Q. Lorrenzo, down the stretch did you kind of realize that you need to put
this team on your shoulders?  
LORRENZO WADE: Yeah, a bit. During conference play there are a couple games I
can think back on, UNLV at home, also Air Force at Air Force, TCU at TCU, and
those were games that I didn't really perform the way that I should have to
help my team out.  
And I knew that this was do or die. It was win or go home. So I did, like I
said, whatever I possibly could to help us win the basketball game, either try
to pass the ball or try to rebound the ball. But, no, I didn't put us on my
shoulders. These guys did a great job all game long. I just tried to kick in
at the end of the game.  
  
Q. How hard is it to play these guys?  
LORRENZO WADE: Realistically Air Force is going to be the most difficult game
on your schedule. You are not accustom to scoring 17 points in a half, and
maybe 30, 40 points in a game, but that's their style of play. That's what
they do. It's very difficult to play against them, especially because you are
playing defense for so long. They try to fatigue you mentally.  
I think we had a bit of an advantage this time because we just played them a
week ago so we understood what we were facing and it didn't catch us off guard
or by surprise. So Air Force is definitely a thorn in my side.  
  
Q. Lorrenzo, obviously BYU is a team you guys had a couple of pretty good
games with this year even though you split. How confident do you guys go into
this game with them?  
LORRENZO WADE: You know, we're on to our third season. I've always preached,
like coach has told us, you know, we play three seasons. The non-conference
play, you have conference play and you have post-season play. So, I mean,
we're just as confident as anybody else here in this tournament.  
We've played them close at their place. We beat them at our place. And now
we're on a neutral site. So I couldn't be any more confident going into the
game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. We'll let you go. You guys can take
off. Questions now for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. Just what is the overall health situation on your team right now?
Obviously, you know, you got a few guys sick and Billy couldn't start today.  
COACH FISHER: Nobody wants to hear somebody else's problems, and when you give
them, they're excuses. Amoroso goes the emergency room Sunday night because he
thought he was -- I don't know what he thought he was having. He couldn't
breathe and he was in the emergency room three hours for Sunday night, didn't
practice Monday and Tuesday.  
D.J. didn't practice Monday and Tuesday. Billy didn't practice Wednesday. But
everybody has those issues. So you deal with them. And you not use them as
excuses.  
And I was comfortable that we would attempt to do that. Hopefully we'll be
better physically and hopefully we'll play better tomorrow. But everybody gets
sick, and you can't harp on it. You play, and if you play well enough, you
still have a chance. And we did that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Dairese Gary](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18167)

### [J.R. Giddens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16927)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to take a minute or so and talk about the
game, then we'll go from there.  
COACH ALFORD: I thought it was a hard-fought game. I thought both teams played
with an awful lot of energy and urgency. They got one more stop than we did.  
I thought the rebounds, we've out rebounded them I think twice. We got beat on
the boards pretty good tonight. I thought that was the difference.  
I thought all the guys that played in the game today gave incredible effort.
We've been getting this kind of effort all year long and I appreciate that
effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Next couple minutes, questions directed to either of the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. JR, your last shot as a college basketball player, can you talk a little
bit about that possession. It seemed like you tried to fingertip it in there
instead of dunking the ball. Did you feel you didn't have enough time?  
COACH ALFORD: It's not his last shot as a college basketball player.  
You can answer the question, but it's not your last shot as a college
basketball player.  
JR GIDDENS: I didn't feel like I could get to the rim. We didn't have enough
time. So I tried to put the ball in the basket to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. JR, I know this isn't the way you wanted to close out the conference
season. Considering what happened last year, where you finished tied for last,
now you end up in third, what did it mean to you this year to accomplish what
you guys did, not only as a player but also as a team?  
JR GIDDENS: Well, I think we all went out there and worked hard. So we're
going to be proud of our effort.  
But I felt like we came up short. I felt like we had a chance to, you know, do
better in this tournament, you know, possibly win the tournament if we played
our style of basketball. We didn't do that today. Didn't put D stops together.
So we didn't get the win. So I feel like we came up short.  
  
Q. Dairese, you started the game well, scored 10 points in the first five
minutes. Did you feel like you had a chance to get Utah down at that juncture
in the first half? How did you feel about how the first half went?  
DAIRESE GARY: Felt pretty good. You know, shots were falling. Just on the
defensive end, we didn't really execute good. You know, the first four
minutes, we came out and got some stops. After that, it went downhill from
there.  
So we were in it just trading baskets, but we needed to step up and play D.
And we didn't do that, so...  
  
Q. JR, before the tournament you didn't really want to talk about whether
you were a bubble team in your NCAA hopes. Now that you are out of the
Mountain West tournament, what are your thoughts about the NCAA tournament? Do
you think you did enough during the regular season to get in?  
JR GIDDENS: Honestly, I don't know. I don't pay enough attention to all the
college basketball teams out there and the conferences, how many bids a league
has.  
We just focus on going out there and trying to beat the next team day after
day. So I couldn't tell you.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you two go. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Alford.  
  
Q. Do you think what you did in the regular season...  
COACH ALFORD: I don't know. I know we're 24-8. We won 11 league games. We just
got beat in the quarterfinals in overtime on a last-second play.  
We've stayed away from losing streaks. This is our first game on a neutral
floor. We're 0-1 on a neutral floor. We're 8-5 as a road team. We're 16-2 as a
home team.  
This is my first time in the Mountain West. This is my first time to go around
it. 24-8 is a heck of a year. So there's a lot of basketball to be played yet
this weekend Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So I guess we just got to wait and
see exactly what happens.  
But as far as our body of work goes, there won't be a lot of teams 24-8. So
hopefully that's going to be enough, but we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. Why do you think Nevill was so much more effective than from earlier
games? Were you surprised that you weren't able to get him fouled out?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, he's good. He's 7 foot 1. He's really talented. You know,
same as JR Giddens. Those guys are hard to guard. We're trying to guard him
with two 6 foot 9 guys.  
We're not deep in that position. They really present a lot of problems because
if you go trapping him, then it opens up their three ball. They're a very good
shooting team that surrounds a guy that's 7 foot 1 that's got a lot of talent.  
We just don't quite have enough beef to be able to throw a lot of bodies at
him over the course of the game. I thought he made some good shots. That's the
most shots he's taken in any of the three games we played. He made good use of
those shots.  
  
Q. With 10 seconds left, can you go through your thought process when
Prentice was taking the ball? Maybe looking for Giddens instead?  
COACH ALFORD: Sometimes players make tough decisions. DP has been great for us
all year. One of the things we didn't want to do was to drive and try to make
plays with our smaller guards on Nevill. That's one part of it. There were
different things we were wanting to do to Nevill, but not that.  
He's trying to make a play. I always like guys that are trying to make a play.
A lot of times this year it's worked well for us. This happened to be a game
where the last play didn't work well for us.  
  
Q. Your team fought so hard to send the game into overtime. How did you feel
when the game reached overtime about your team's chances?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, a lot better than with five minutes to go. It's about
three games in a row now with Utah we've been behind with five minutes to go.  
We found a way to win. So that's what we talked about going into overtime. We
just couldn't get a stop. I thought for about 30 minutes that wasn't really
our defense. You got to give their offense a lot of credit. Then the last 10
minutes of regulation, we really guarded. We did some good things defensively.  
But then in overtime, you give up 10 points in overtime, you're probably not
going to win a lot of games. We just didn't get enough stops. We had the ball
up one inside a minute, had a crucial turnover. That hurt us. Then Nevill gets
two dunks, uncontested dunks, there in the last minute and a half that
obviously didn't help.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.  
COACH ALFORD: Thanks very much.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Wink Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17064)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Curtis Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18159)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, go ahead and begin with some opening remarks.  
COACH KRUGER: I'd like to start by complementing Coach Dougherty and the TCU
guys. I thought they played just great. They obviously shot it very well. And
I thought our guys stepped up and made a ton of big plays, but had trouble
stopping them on the other end. But I thought Coach Dougherty really had them
ready to play.  
And again, right down to the wire I thought it was heck of a game. And, again,
we made some great plays there late to get us over the top.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Coach, as an understatement you said they shot well. Have you ever beaten
a team that made 17 three-pointers in a game?  
COACH KRUGER: Not in shooting that percentage, I doubt. Again, I thought they
played great. I thought we had late in the shot clock a few times they jumped
up and probably three or four different occasions and made shots. Our guys
were working hard and still they were making some shots.  
But credit to TCU. And, again, always we'll look at it and say we've got to do
a little better job covering. But I think, first of all, I tip my hat to TCU
and Coach Dougherty.  
THE MODERATOR: For the next few minutes let's have questions directed to Wink
or Curtis, then we'll let them go and finish up with you, coach.  
  
Q. Wink, describe the last play and just the pressure of that situation
being down two with seven seconds left. What you wanted to get, is that what
you wanted out of that last play?  
WINK ADAMS: Yeah, I mean, that was the play we wanted, kind of clear out one
side and send it down to Curt because he was kind of open. I just went in with
confidence and kind of floated up and I was able to get the ending one.  
  
Q. Wink, is it safe to say this might be your best game wearing a UNLV
uniform?  
WINK ADAMS: By far. I mean, this is the best game, the funnest game. Even as a
player against a great team like TCU we came in and I never played against a
team who shot that well in a game. Just my teammates behind me, everybody's
making big plays. I mean, it just feels good to be a part of that.  
  
Q. Curtis, talk about everyone knows about the offense. Talk about the
defensive pressure they did differently this time around. You guys played them
twice. It seemed like they did a lot more trapping in the backcourt. Just talk
about that for a little bit?  
CURTIS TERRY: They did a great job on defense. They covered some things
differently than they did earlier in the season against us. Things started by
them making shots and they got confidence early. It was tough for us to go
down on and execute on the other end. But we were able to hang in there and
battle back. Especially in the second half we made a run but then they threw
in some more threes.  
I give them credit for being very aggressive against us and mixing things up
and playing a great ball game.  
  
Q. For either Curt or Wink. What's the feeling like on the court when you
are playing against a team when it seems like every shot that they throw up
goes into the basket? Is it disheartening or, you know, describe the feeling
you see every shot go in it seems like?  
CURTIS TERRY: Out there, I mean, tonight it was amazing just for the fact we
could come down and hit a shot and they would come down and hit a shot. We'd
come back and make a play and they would come back and make a play.  
I told Brent Hackett late in the game, It's like a shootout. He's like, Yep,
it's going to be that way. They did a great job of making shots. I heard they
made 17 threes and I was like, Oh, man. Thought they might have made 20. They
made a lot. Luckily for us Wink made a great play at the end, got the basket
and got the foul. One of the six they did miss was that last one. So thankful
for that.  
  
Q. Wink, just describe the intensity of the game and what it was like
playing out there and did you feel like you got foul on that shot?  
WINK ADAMS: I mean it was fun throughout the whole game. I mean, just for the
team, both teams was playing good. It's a tournament. Everybody wants to win.
And I just think everybody -- just everybody just brought their A game and
everybody was making plays. At the end we was grateful they missed the last
two. Like Curtis said, we was glad we got to the line and got the end one.
Yeah, it was a foul (laughter).  
  
Q. They always say that tight games, these can be beneficial when you guys
go into the NCAA tournament. Do you guys feel that way or would you have
rather have had a nice 20-point blowout where you got a little bit of rest on
the bench?  
WINK ADAMS: We think this game definitely getting us ready for getting our
team better and got our chemistry even stronger tonight. We've never been in a
game like this throughout the whole season. This was our toughest game by far
and we're just going to take it and get better from it.  
  
Q. Similar question, guys. When you got three in three days and you have a
game like this where you don't use a lot of bench and you're out there and
it's intense like that, how difficult is it to get over this one and get some
rest before you have to play tomorrow night?  
CURTIS TERRY: It's usual to get some rest tonight but luckily we don't play
until late tomorrow night. This was a fun game to play it. It felt like the
championship game last year against BYU, and everybody standing up the second
half and big plays being made, it was a lot of fun.  
But I think three games in three days, I think if we get that far, I think our
energy and excitement and enthusiasm will just carry us all the way through
that.  
We can't leave anything on the court. We got to go out there and just play
with everything we have or else the season may be over. But we're going to
take it one step and at a time and get ready for tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Curtis, Wink. Thanks, guys. We'll let you go. Good
job. Questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. Lon, people might look at the score sheet and think this is crazy, but
they had 17 threes. But it's almost like they threw everything in. It's not
like you were giving them. I mean, did you think that you were actually
defending it pretty well and they were just shooting incredibly?  
COACH KRUGER: Again, credit first of all TCU because I thought our guys were
working hard. I don't think it was a case where we were slow coming off the
screens or miscommunicating on switches. I think they made again three or four
of those late on the shot clock when you feel pretty good about the defensive
position you had. Then that's really deflating to a defensive team, especially
a team that takes some pride in defense.  
When you play for 35 seconds, 34 seconds and you feel good and feel like you
got them in a tough corner and they jump up and knock down a three, that's
tough. They did that a few times. No, I thought our effort was good. Again,
I'll credit TCU. And still we have to come back and play better.  
  
Q. Coach, my question to you was, you know, you guys are known for being a
great defensive team. But do you think it was more or less those guys were
just making shots or the effort wasn't there?  
COACH KRUGER: Effort. Again, the effort was good. I thought our guys worked
hard. I think when a team gets on a little bit of a roll and Hackett and Wall
are pretty good shooters, especially when they get it going, then you got
Langford inside where you got to help a little bit on him because he is such a
good player, then other guys on the perimeter can make shots too.  
Again, I'll credit TCU. Yet you always look at it in kind of a self-critical
way in terms of saying, We have to do better, because you just can't accept
the fact they're going to make that many threes. But we'll learn from it.  
  
Q. If you were as confident in the effort as you were, what do you tell them
after they're making so many shots going into half-time? What are you trying
to do to give that team a morale boost?  
COACH KRUGER: Generally the same things we always talk about in terms of need
to meet the ball a bit earlier, need to get up a little bit tougher,
especially on Hackett and Wall, because they made a lot of threes in the first
half. Just stay with what you are doing and do a little better. It's not like
you are going to revamp everything in half-time.  
Again, I thought our guys came out in the second half and opened it with
pretty good activity and took a little bit of a lead, then they made two
threes back-to-back to take that lead away.  
So it was a good game. It was a good game. And I feel for the guys in the
other locker room because I know, you know, it's big extreme where both teams
were even and one team can feel great and one team can feel so poorly.
Everyone's been in that other locker room. Especially since they played so
well, you know, I feel for them there.  
  
Q. Obviously, they probably watch TV and they know going in what people say
they had to do to get there. Can you talk about your team's ability in the
face of that, not to lose this game on their court, when it comes to the post-
season and be able to make play after play? Because obviously the pressure was
on your kids, not the other way around.  
COACH KRUGER: I thought our guys, as we said before, they've done a great job
of focusing on the next game. And I thought tonight our guys made just play
after play after play down the stretch especially. And I think it's real
credit to them.  
Again, TCU answered. So it was just kind of back and forth. But you're right,
I thought our guys, the pressure was, you know, would fall on our shoulders
more than TCU's perhaps in that situation.  
I thought our guys handled that very well.  
  
Q. Obviously, coach, you don't know who you are playing yet tomorrow night,
but could you briefly talk about the match-ups potentially with Utah or New
Mexico.  
COACH KRUGER: Both teams are tough match-ups for us. New Mexico, last eight,
nine ball games of course been playing great. Really doing a nice job. Coach
Alford has got them playing at a really high level. We just played Utah last
Saturday and they knocked us around pretty good.  
So we know either way it goes we've got our hands full for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, has this team done enough to convince the tournament selection
committee that you guys should be in? Or do you have to approach it that you
need to win this thing out this week?  
COACH KRUGER: We'll always approach it like we need to win the next game. Not
anything -- not any advantage to not approaching it that way. But we're not
thinking about that so much as just winning the next game. I think if you
worry about, Well, we got to do this for that, I don't think our guys think
like that. I didn't think they felt like that tonight. I thought they just
lined up and competed to win this game and we have to do the same thing
tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? All right. Great. Thanks, coach.  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Marcus Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15571)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks about the
game.  
COACH MILES: Well, now I know how McGovern felt after he lost 35 straight
states and won Minnesota (smiling). It's political. Sorry folks.  
No, I was proud of the kids. You know, they never quit. They never -- you
know, we had a good quality two days of practice. Finally it felt like we
believed we were going to win. You know, we got tired of losing and down the
stretch when Wyoming came at us we just said, Nope, nope. We've done this
enough. We're going to break that mold. And for that I'm proud of them.
Because they made plays. There's no magic wand. As a coach, there's no magic
play you run. They found a way to make plays.  
It was a good win, and we're looking forward to playing BYU.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Ewing was 21 points in the first half. But he didn't do too much in the
second half. What did you do to stop Brandon in the second half? And this is
for Marcus, what did it feel like to finally win?  
MARCUS WALKER: For the first question, you know, he was on in the first half,
but sometimes you just, you know, you want -- when you are playing the score
you just got to -- either the day going to be on one night and not the next. I
think we did good the first two games.  
He had a real good game. But just containment, trying to stop him in
transition and stop him from getting easy baskets. I think we kind of fouled
him a lot in the first half and we limited him in the second.  
As far as the win, it feels real good. I think tonight I think Andre started
it off for us. I think he had a lot of key shots that, you know, fired up the
team. I just think everybody played good today, and, you know, fed off the
girls' game from yesterday. Hopefully we can just keep playing and, you know,
go as far as we can go. It's March.  
  
Q. This one's for Andre. Just what did it feel like there in the first half
when you finally got going and your family was in the stands cheering you
on?  
ANDRE McFARLAND: Beginning of the game I was extremely nervous. I had the
shakes. I just wanted to come out and relax and just have a good game. I know
my family, they're going to support me to matter what. That wasn't even the
case. I just wanted to relax and have a good game and try to perform.  
  
Q. Adam, wanted to ask you, it seemed like the guy guarding you in the
second half kept collapsing in to help guard Marcus and you guys were really
able to exploit that. Was that something you were looking for or did it just
kind of happen in the flow of the game?  
ADAM NIGON: They put their center on me. They've done that throughout the
year, you know. And when they do that, I just try and use my quickness to my
advantage. When they come out at me I'll back cut and just get easy lay-ups
like that. And fortunately we were able to do that tonight and got a big win.  
  
Q. Adam, how does it feel to be playing another game in the Mountain West
tournament here in Vegas when a year ago you were in rec league?  
ADAM NIGON: Yeah, watching it on TV. It's great. I love this. To keep playing
in this tournament and to go all the way would be just amazing. I'm excited.  
  
Q. Two part question. What does it say about the character of this team that
you went winless in conference season and come and play a game like today? ?  
MARCUS WALKER: I think I'll speak on behalf of the team. We never gave up on
each other. Throughout the season I don't think there's been too much
bickering, blaming each other, you know, for our losses. I think we just stuck
together and believed in one another, that we would get our win, you know,
eventually.  
That's one thing, you know, I feel fortunate about is just being on the team
where, you know, everybody is for one another, and not necessarily, you know,
blaming, you know, each other for our losses. And we just stuck together and
it paid off.  
  
Q. Was there something in particular that was said maybe before the game or
at half-time that really -- besides the girl's game, that got you guys
going.  
COACH MILES: Don't answer that verbatim (laughter).  
ANDRE McFARLAND: Actually it was the night before. Coach put on the film that
inspired all of us. It was Jimmy V, Jimmy Valvano. He did a nice conference in
front of fans of his, of businessmen. Was it the Million Dollar Club?  
COACH MILES: Yeah.  
ANDRE McFARLAND: Just an inspiring film. He was talking about what it took,
where he was, where he was in the present, and where he wanted to be. We just
took that and ran with it. And everybody went to bed sleeping on it and just
thinking about how good it would be to beat Wyoming.  
ADAM NIGON: I think them beating us two in a row almost was enough in itself.
And they talked a little bit of trash, you know. It just all fueled the fire.
It felt great.  
THE MODERATOR: Adam, Andre and Marcus, thanks. We'll let you three go. We'll
continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. I mean, we've seen your guards play and they play well. We've seen them
here and seen them on TV there. They outplayed Jones and Ewing in that second
half. Talk about that. Talk about coming down here, and the inspiration you
gave your team to win the game.  
COACH MILES: Well, we felt like Marcus Walker, Willis Gardner were good guards
in the Mountain West. And, you know, Walker essentially, you know, was right
there leading the league in scoring, you know, and a real go-to guy when teams
were teeing off on him, was able to kind of sustain through the whole season
pretty good numbers.  
And, you know, Gardner's been about playing 65%. Although I just think that
he's at the end of the year and he knows he is having surgery soon. You know,
if we lose tomorrow, he's playing tomorrow night and he's got surgery on
Friday. So I think he wants to avoid that as much as he can. That might be his
inspiration.  
As far as the kids, they just, you know, they listen to you. As a coach, you
know, I've had teams not listen and be really good, which is probably a good
idea for them. But I've had, you know, teams that, you know, these guys listen
and they wanted do well. We just don't have a lot of firepower. But tonight we
were able to do enough, get enough stops and eliminate transition and get
transition.  
So they just never quit. And that's a sign of a bunch of good people.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you don't have a lot of time to enjoy this win. You are
right back on the court tomorrow. Talk a little about the match-up tomorrow
with BYU and the problems they pose for you guys?  
COACH MILES: You know, we weren't bad against them last time we played them. I
don't recall, did Stu play against BYU last time or did we play totally small?
Do you guys remember? I think we were totally small that game. So we didn't
have any centers last time, and Plaisted went eight for eight or nine for
nine. We just kind of hung around, you know.  
And I like the -- this sounds crazy, but, you know, in match-ups, you like
some match-ups, don't like some match-ups. I like this match-up better than I
like some. So they're 20 whatever in the country. They're really good. That's
not saying that I feel, you know, like we're a favorite or anything crazy. But
I really feel like it's a good match-up and I look forward to playing the ball
game.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the lift that Andre gave you. He really played a
whale of a game.  
COACH MILES: We talked about, you know, we need third and fourth scorers,
right? You know, we said some of you freshmen really have to step up tonight.
We just need you to make shots, bottom line. You rarely talk about that. You
shouldn't talk about that as a coach. You know, because talking about your
shot is kind of off, you know, it's taboo. It's off limits. You don't do that.
But we lost enough I figured we could probably bring it up, and just say,
Listen, we're going to need you guys. And we ran a couple different sets for
him and he really liked them and got some good looks. Then you could see his
confidence was on.  
And, you know, we'll need it again tomorrow too.  
  
Q. It seems like in the first half especially you guys were able to benefit
from a lot of offensive fouls called against them. There were certainly some
against both teams, but the majority went against Wyoming. Was that something
you were doing defensively? Was there a little more effort to get tighter on
them and maybe see if you could get some of those or was it just kind of pure
luck that they went that way?  
COACH MILES: I'd say it was a slim majority by the way.  
  
Q. Five to two.  
COACH MILES: Was it five to two? It didn't feel like it. But, no, we ran our
game plan like we always did, honestly. You know, we had one tweak we thought
about using, we didn't use it, a tweak on our zone. You know, I thought about
it just one possession. Then he had a whole bunch, a slew of shooters out
there. And we had Ronnie in, who hasn't practiced full court yet with us. So
we decided not to do it.  
But, you know, I think our kids just moved their feet and did a good job.  
  
Q. Could you enlighten us about the first half T?  
COACH MILES: It was my first career technical at CSU. Well-deserved. I thought
it was well-deserved. I thought that, you know, yeah -- never mind. Anything
you say you get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble here. I'm the new
guy. I got one win.  
  
Q. Did you drop a certain bomb on the ref?  
COACH MILES: When I did this stumble thing? He said, I didn't see it. And I
said, You didn't see this? And I stumbled and fell and showed my athleticism
there. As my assistant said, that was a good technical. You looked like a real
athlete out there falling down (laughing).  
I talked to the officials afterwards and he says, Are we okay? I said, I'm
fine. I just needed to get that off my chest.  
  
Q. Seriously, any chance in the world for Stu tomorrow?  
COACH MILES: I say Stu is -- what did Belichick put Brady? He's got a shoulder
problem and is likely or unlikely or questionable? Stu is probably doubtful.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach, appreciate it.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Brandon Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16406)

### [Brad Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16414)

### [Heath Schroyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18099)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some opening remarks.  
COACH SCHROYER: I give CSU a lot of credit. They played really well. They
knocked down some shots and made plays and we had opportunities to make those
plays and they didn't. I give them a lot of credit and it is what it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Brandon, I have a question for you. That hard foul towards the end of the
game there, did you think that should have been called a flagrant?  
BRANDON EWING: I didn't actually feel the foul, I just felt myself hit the
ground. But my teammates and my coach and a couple of CSU players said I hit
the floor kind of hard and they felt it should have been a flagrant. But the
ref didn't feel that, so it is what it is I guess.  
  
Q. Brandon, could you describe what happened on the driving lay-up that was
blocked near the end of the game?  
BRANDON EWING: I mean, I thought I was fouled, but the ref didn't think I was
fouled. You know, that's part of -- in the weight room progress that you do
before the season starts, that's just a play I got to finish. That's one of
the key plays that win or lose games. You know, big-time players or top
players in any conference got to finish that type of play.  
  
Q. Guys, maybe five minutes into the second half I think you got up and got
the lead up to seven then couldn't score for about five minutes. What kind of
happened in that stretch in your mind?  
BRANDON EWING: Me and coach, we just talked about that. We felt that we just
had a team letdown. We stopped guarding for a little bit. You can't do that at
this time of the season. You know, March, everybody wants to win, everybody's
hungry to get to the tournament. You can't have stretches of the game where
you just stop guarding and stop making shots, because any team, no matter what
their record is, they're trying to get to the tournament just like us.  
I think we just had a team letdown. And like you said, that last five minutes
kind of hurt us.  
  
Q. Brad, can you just talk about what it feels like going out like this and
this being your last game?  
BRAD JONES: It's kind of hard. But all in all I think we had a great season. A
lot of progress was made. And, you know, it's sad to lose any game when you're
a senior or when you are a freshman. But we anticipated coming out here and
winning and came up short. Like coach said, we give all the credit to CSU.  
  
Q. Brandon, did they change anything defensively on you in the second half
from what they were doing in the first half? Seems like you were able to get a
lot more points in the first half.  
BRANDON EWING: Not at all two of our top players Joseph Taylor and Johnson in
foul trouble. I just took it upon myself to keep us in the game. When they
came back into the game I just tried to get them involved, tried to get them
in the flow of the game. We definitely need them to win games. As point guard,
I don't put a lot of pressure on myself. I try to get my teammates involved.
That's what I like to do.  
When they got back in the game, I wanted to get them involved in the game.
Because we need all five guys on the court to get going.  
  
Q. Seemed like late in the game they hurt you a lot with Nigon, coming in on
those teed feeds. Defenses were kind of collapsing on Walker. Was that
something that caught you guys a little off guard or was he just able to get
by somebody that was suppose to be getting him?  
BRANDON EWING: Walker is a tough player. Any time he drives, everybody has to
collapse because he is capable of hitting tough shots. Tough throwers in the
lane, tough runners in the lane. Everybody has to be aware of where Walker is.  
Since all of us was collapsing, we did a great job of finding Nigon. His
teammates did a great job finding him as well. Him being the player he is, he
just made big-time shots. He is probably one of the reasons they won.  
  
Q. With Johnson and Taylor in foul trouble like that, I know they had good
games against them at Fort Collins. How much did that just throw a lot of
things out of whack as you really couldn't exploit a potential strength
there?  
COACH SCHROYER: I think it really hurt us. I think that was a huge part of our
game plan, was to try to use these two guys, to play small, to match-up to
those guys. You know, then when we -- when those guys had, you know, foul
trouble in the first half, then we went big. And then McFarland and Clayman
were able to knock down shots because we were guarding them with 6'10" guys.
So then we went with Derm at the four, which we rarely do. A lot like Tim,
we're only playing with eight scholarship players. We just didn't have the
depth to match up when those guys got in foul trouble. Offensively it really
hurt us. Luckily Brandon was able to knock down some shots in the first half
to keep it us in.  
But when we can't get the production out of those guys, we just don't have
enough, you know, to win in March when those two guys aren't playing because
of foul trouble.  
  
Q. You talked about Brandon's game there. We talked about this week all the
little things he does in getting his other teammates involved. Did you feel he
did enough of that in the second half?  
COACH SCHROYER: I thought Brandon had a great game. Brandon's a really good
basketball player. And, you know, I'm really proud of him. I mean, I thought
he kept his head. You know, he had a couple, you know, turnovers here or
there. You know, it was just one of those things, if a guy's making a play,
you know.  
But I have no fault whatsoever with Brandon. I mean I think Brandon played
really, really well. I think that, you know, if he wouldn't have played that
well in the first half we'd have been down by double-digits.  
  
Q. Can you summarize this first season and what are the top things on your
checklist you have to do to get ready for next year?  
COACH SCHROYER: Well, I think that we've come a long way as a program. You
know, March 23rd was a day they got on campus. I think that we've accomplished
a lot. I think that we've played pretty good basketball at times. I think, you
know, there are a lot of issues that allowed us not to play very good
basketball some of the time.  
But, you know, I think that we're heading in the right direction as a program.
You know, there's no question, I mean, I've been through this before. I
understand the process that you got to go through. I think that we've laid a
great foundation.  
I think that, you know, we're only going -- you know, I think we'll take a
major step next year and hopefully we'll, you know, continue to add the pieces
to the puzzle that we need.  
I think the guys in the program need to get better. This is a big spring and
summer for us. Most of the guys that are our recruits are already on campus
sitting out. So this is a big spring and summer for us.  
  
Q. How bad of a taste does this leave in your mouth I guess as the season
comes to an end?  
COACH SCHROYER: Well, I think that, you know, any time you lose, you know,
it's bad taste. I mean, you know, I've said it all for over a week that, I
mean, it's really hard to beat a team three times. I think it's really hard to
beat your rival three times. It doesn't matter what their record is or what
have you, it's just really hard the third time to beat your rival.  
And I think that, you know, the ball didn't bounce our way a couple times. We
had -- you know, I haven't watched the film yet, but I bet you we had 10 or 15
lay-ups that we missed that we normally make. If we make half of those, you
know, we win and we move on.  
But, you know, it's always hard. It's always hard to lose. It's always hard to
look at your seniors in the eye and know that, you know, they just played
their last game. So it's always hard.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that the transition defense, I think they had nine
fast-break lay-ups in the game, and then combine that with...  
COACH SCHROYER: Our transition defense was the worst it's been all year. We
didn't get to the hole. We didn't, you know, find shooters in transition. And
the combination of that and, you know, missing a lot of lay-ups. You know,
when you want to win any time of year - especially in March - you can't give
up easy baskets. And when you get a chance to have an easy one, you got to
make them. And we didn't do either one of those.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH SCHROYER: Thank you.

### [Joseph Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13903)

### [Dominique Kirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17779)

### [Donald Sloan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17780)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll, start off with a statement from Coach Turgeon, then open
up the floor to questions for the student-athletes. Coach, whenever you're
ready.  
COACH TURGEON: I'm proud of my group; really disappointed in the outcome. You
never want it to end, especially the way we're starting to play. We just keep
getting better every time we step on the floor. We controlled the whole game.  
I feel like we were in control of the whole game. And, you know, we did a good
job against their defense, their pressure, and it just came down to Love and
Collison at the end just making plays. I mean, Love made two unbelievable
shots and we couldn't guard the ball screen late, and Collison made two big-
time shots, and that was the difference in the game.  
Wouldn't change a thing. Just proud of our group. I feel awful for my seniors
who have done so much for this program, so much. And I just hate to see it
end, because I think we were just really coming on.  
  
Q. Talk about the final play and kind of what you saw and just your emotions
in general?  
DONALD SLOAN: We had a designed play set up to get our shooters open, and it
wasn't that drive, so I drove, and went up to shoot a layup, I guess, and it
was brought back down either by my force or somebody else's. Leave it up to
other people to see, but it didn't go our way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half and kind of what happened. In the
first half you guys decidedly had the difference in the paint. I mean, what
was different in the second half with Love coming up with all of those blocked
shots and things like that?  
JOSEPH JONES: He just made some great plays. He hit two key shots for them
that they really needed, and that's the only difference it was. After I played
tough defense, he just hit two big shots for them.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how far this program has come from when you
got here to the point you are at now?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's been just amazing. How this program grew from, you know,
four years ago. You know, we came in, you know, we worked hard to get to this
point. And, you know, it's pretty sad how it ended. I think we really had a
good chance to win tonight. I mean, a real good chance. I think we played
great. They made plays, and we couldn't really get shots. I mean, it just was
just amazing how this program grew. I mean, just amazing.  
  
Q. Dominique, while it never appeared that you guys lost your cool, only
three field goals in the last ten minutes. Did they just crank up their
defense, or did things just not work as well?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, you know, UCLA is pretty well known for their defense. I
mean, they had good defense out there, but also we did miss a lot of, you
know, good look shots. You know, I know there was a couple of them that I
missed, and I was wide open, and I should have made, and I didn't convert.  
You know, it just -- it's pretty frustrating, but you know we played on the
defensive end -- I think we played great on the defensive end. It was just a
great defensive battle.  
  
Q. The same question that Dominique got asked a little bit ago about just
your general thoughts about where this program is now compared to where you
came in.  
JOSEPH JONES: Words can't even describe it. This program has came a long way.
It went from not really known on the national basketball level, at the
national basketball scene, but now we are up there with the best. The program
is upward bound. We keep getting better and better each and every year.
There's no telling where the program might end up.  
Right now it's looking great for us, and it's going to keep getting better for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right thank you, gentlemen. Open up
to questions for the Coach.  
  
Q. Y'all had them 26-6 in the paint in the first half, and then it wasn't
like that in the second half. Was it adjustments they made or can you talk
about what the difference was?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, they blocked about every shot we had in the paint, it
seemed like, and we turned it over against their double-team. The first half
we made plays against their double-team, and the start of the second half we
made plays against them, got them out of doubling the post.  
And, you know, I thought we were in total control. I thought we were always
one step ahead, whether it was the ball screen action or doubling the post.
But, no, we just didn't make the plays in the second half. We had the ball
right there. We had a number of times we had it right there. And, you know,
they obviously blocked a lot of shots in there. So, you know, our guys aren't
use to getting chinned, getting the shot blocked like that.  
I don't know if it was blocked, but we kept going in there and, you know, then
I -- we went with our ball screen series because we started to turn it over on
the post, so I was getting frustrated when we'd turn it over. If we just
wouldn't have turned the ball over, we would have kept the lead; I think our
turnovers got them back in the game.  
But, no, you got to give them a lot of credit. I think Love just -- I think he
turned it up. I mean, he got every rebound, blocked every shot, and made --
the kid just turned it up.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that final time-out. Was there ever a shot to set
up a three for Dominique or Josh?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, that's what we were doing. Sloan went crazy on the play,
but we had a three set up for Dominique and using Josh as a decoy. And I was
watching that action, and all of a sudden I saw this blur coming by, and I saw
-- you know, saw him get bumped. And, you know, I don't know, you'll be able
to see it. They'll show it a thousand times on TV.  
Yeah, I was going for a three. I was going to run out of here with a one-point
win. That's what I was looking for, whether it would have worked, because
Sloan went so fast, I don't know, but something we've practiced a lot,
something that's worked for us, and I got a lot of confidence in.  
I thought it would be hard to get a three for Josh. We had two sides of the
play, but I thought we could sneak one out for Dominique. I was kind of
watching that action, and Sloan just went a little too quick, but he was
feeling good about himself and thought he could get to the basket, and that's
what he was trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about assessing this season and where you go
from here for next year and just kind of wrap it up that way?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it took a long time, but I finally had them playing the
way my teams play. We're not playing as fast as I'd like to play, eventually,
but I thought our execution was at a much better level. Our defense was at the
level it needed to be at, finally got them rebounding. We didn't shoot free
throws all year the way my teams will in the future, but I thought we were
going to win the national championship.  
I thought we were going to win today. We're getting better. We played the
number one seed on their home floor last week; had last possession. We played
another number one seed on not their home floor but -- and, you know, I
thought we were going to win tonight and win the next one and win the next
one. I really believe that we're just getting better every time.  
So I'm proud of the way we're coming along. I think, you know, was it a great
year? It was close to being a great year. We lost a few games probably
shouldn't have lost on our home floor, and it would have been a fantastic
year. But we did some really nice things with a new coach, and losing the
players that we lost last year, and kind of bringing the young kids along.  
So as far as next year goes, I can't even -- I'll just try to survive this
one. Hopefully we can continue to improve. It won't be easy. We're losing
three warriors. You know, Beau and Dominique and Joe; that meant a lot to us.
But our young kids got to grow up. If you want to assess next year, they got
to grow up. They grew up tonight. D-Ro was fantastic, played with great
maturity. Davis was pretty good but our young kids got to grow up to keep this
thing rolling.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the turnovers a little bit more. Seemed like
that was when the -- they got energy from them, and the crowd got into it
because of that energy.  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. We only had 11 turnovers, which is pretty good defense
against them. Five at half-time and six in the second half, but our post had
too many of them. DeAndre had 4 in 15 minutes. Bryan Davis had 2 and Joe had
2. They had 8 of our 11, our posts.  
We had one day to prepare; we knew it was coming, the double-team, and just
didn't make the plays out of it. And knew they were going to be strong. We had
to be strong with the ball, but we had opportunities to make plays against the
double. We made a few plays against it. We actually got them out of the
double-team in the second half. We hit a three and got another guy, we got
D-Ro for a layup, but that was the whole -- we just couldn't handle their
double-team the way we needed to handle it.  
And we just made bad decisions. We had a guy lifted, and all we had to do was
throw the ball back out to him. We just didn't make the right decisions at
times. But you got to give their defense -- I mean, they're big-time defensive
team, and you got to give their defense a lot of credit.  
  
Q. You talked about Roland as well. It seemed like when you came back in the
first half, Derrick came in and took Collison out of the game for a little
while. I mean, he wasn't out for very long, but Derrick did the good job on
the defensive side there?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, he did, and I was really proud of him tonight. Thought he
made a lot of really good decisions offensively and played with poise, made a
couple of big buckets for us, and he did a nice job on Collison. Collison's
really good.  
And those two plays -- but we were using that group at the last line-up and
thought about subbing and putting some defensively different guys in, but we
went with those guys. But D-Ro was great tonight. He's got to be more
consistent with for us in the future for us to maintain this thing and keep it
going in the right direction.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Thank you, Coach.

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Mitch Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18248)

### [Brook Lopez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18422)

### [Doug Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18421)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, obviously if they're going to play this way I think I
need to stay away from the games all the time. That's all I have to say. I
think I want to turn it over to Coach Oliver, who has been coaching this team
all year long anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you want to make a statement?  
DOUG OLIVER: I mean it was the type of game that we've experienced this year,
time and time again. We've been in close ball games; for the most part we were
able to keep the game in the half court, and it was just it was a hell of a
basketball game.  
I mean I thought that Marquette answered when we got up a little bit. We
showed some composure down the stretch and got it to overtime and, you know,
that's why you play these games. I mean, the interesting thing is it's ironic
that during practice I coach the team, the other assistants take the team, and
Coach Johnson officiates. So, I mean, that's the ironic part of it.
(Laughing).  
So the kids are used to hearing my voice; that wasn't even a problem. And we
all stayed on the same page, and we just played good basketball, and so did
they.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Brook, I wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through what was going
through your head that last possession.  
BROOK LOPEZ: Coach called the play. He wanted to bump; he wanted me to post up
on the block and just bump my man off. Fred did a really good job just getting
me open, and then Mitch just gave me a really good pass, you know, so I got a
good look. I mean, it was a good look, thanks to Mitch. I was on the floor
looking at it, so I don't really know what to say.  
  
Q. Mitch, just what was going through your head and your teammates' head
when you see your coach get ejected like that that quick, then get down 11
pretty quickly after the that?  
MITCH JOHNSON: We just talked about staying together. It's kind of been the
theme of our team for whatever reason this year. We just really wanted to stay
together. Talked about a lot of mental toughness. Coach Oliver got us together
very quickly and said, "Let's just try to end the half out." I think there was
about three minutes left. He said, "End the half out right," and I think that
was huge. Kenny Brown hit a big shot. We came in at half-time and kind of got
that emotional high and kind of regrouped a little bit and took a deep breath
and just got back to playing basketball.  
  
Q. Brook, were you actually behind the backboard when you shot that? It kind
of looked from that angle that you were.  
BROOK LOPEZ: I think I might have been a bit. I think my hand was in front of
it, luckily. The rest of my body was behind it. Like I said, I was pretty much
watching from behind the backboard the whole time, and the ground. So I guess
I got a nice bounce or something.  
  
Q. Have you had a game winner like that, and obviously anything close to
that kind of pressure on that kind of shot?  
BROOK LOPEZ: I don't think so, really. I remember Gonzaga a year ago in
regulation I missed a fade-away bank shot, so I was really looking just to
attack the basket this time.  
  
Q. Brook, it seemed like there was a lot of emotion in the paint tonight.
Did you feel like they were trying to get you guys off the game by being
really physical and talking to you?  
BROOK LOPEZ: No. You know, I got to really cherish these games that are really
physical, you know, and you got guys talking to you, you know, and you just
got to let your game do the talking, so I just kept attacking.  
  
Q. How did you guys feel about your size advantage early on when you guys
got that 7-0 lead or 9-2 lead on your brother's back early posting up?  
BROOK LOPEZ: We came in wanting to play inside out, and Robin did a great job
of just getting it inside, playing slow, you know, looking what the defense
gave him. If they came to double, you kicked it out. If it was just one-on-one
you attacked the basket.  
  
Q. Mitch, you looked a little more aggressive early for your shot. You were
three of three from three. Were you trying to be a little more aggressive
offensively?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I kind of saw at the start of the game, looked like they were
kind of really sitting in our big guys' laps. I thought if we could hit a
couple perimeter jump shots, which Kenny did, and Anthony as well, I think
that can always relieve pressure of our big guys.  
We talk about it all the time, going inside out. I think the NCAA tournament
these past two games have been the best that Brook and Robin have passed out
of the post. I think that's a big thing for them because then it's almost kind
of pick your poison. If we're hitting our shots -- I know I think he scored
twice in a row in overtime, then passed out to me, and I hit a three, and I
think that's huge, because now they really can't double him too much, and he
can score usually one-on-one; we'll take our chances.  
  
Q. You told us a little bit about the mindset that you had after your coach
was ejected, but it's pretty rare thing that happened here. What was your
initial response to seeing him be ejected?  
MITCH JOHNSON: Um, you know, I don't think we really knew what happened at the
beginning. I thought it was just one technical, then I kind of saw someone's
arm give him the umpire "You're out of here." And just, you know, at that
point I just knew we really had to regroup, and we had a couple emotional
times there, like I said, before half-time, and Coach Oliver did a great job
of really pulling us together and just regrouping and having everybody kind of
use that kind of adrenaline into the second half and the rest of the game.  
So I think we also had a little extra adrenaline, because Stanford hasn't been
past the second round to the next weekend for a while, and I actually haven't
talked about it, but I knew that was something that I really wanted to do. So
there was definitely a little bit of extra adrenaline and emotion in this
game.  
BROOK LOPEZ: I was thinking the same thing, really. Once I realized what
happened, we really wanted to regroup. Coach did a great job of calming us
down and just preparing us for the game, and our team was just really good
about it.  
We've been playing together for so long we knew what we had to do. We just had
to go out and play our game, play inside out and try to "D" up as much as
possible.  
  
Q. Mitch, I wanted to ask obviously you played a lot of great games, high
school, college. Where would you put this in terms of the stakes, in terms of
the drama?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think I'd have to put it number one, just because of the
magnitude of the game. I won a couple state championships, but that's not
anything compared to the NCAA tournament play for the Sweet 16 and the way
that we had to battle for 45 minutes and just really show our toughness and
character, and I put it as probably the most intense game, considering the
magnitude.  
  
Q. Mitch, as a point guard, what are you seeing when you're trying to feed
the ball inside to Brook and to Robin? What do you see as a point guard, as
far as your keys to try to be able to get them the ball at the correct time?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think a big thing is the weak side. A lot of times, you know,
guys want to sag off certain people, or the other big guy will be kind of on
Brook's back almost as a double-team, so Robin and Taj and our other post a
lot of times do a great job of flashing, so that guy has to get away.  
At that point it's just Brook to give me the angle to pass it to and kind of
try to put it right on the money, so he gets it and usually can turn and get
one or finish, and that was kind of what he did when we needed it.  
  
Q. Brook, you had 28 in the second half in overtime. You've had a couple
games this year where you struggled in the first half with foul trouble then
had a big second half. Were you able too draw on some of these experiences?  
BROOK LOPEZ: Yeah, it really did help. I just had to put the first half behind
me, you know. We were basically down 6-0. So we knew we had to get back in the
game without Coach, so I was just attacking the basket and playing defense.  
  
Q. Was Coach Johnson waiting for you at half-time? What did he tell you if
he was? And what was the mood and discussion like at half-time?  
MITCH JOHNSON: When we first came in, I think I was the last person in, but he
was kind of off to the left. When I looked in the locker room real quick, he
met with the coaches before he addressed the team. We just talked amongst
ourselves and said we got to regroup.  
He came in and went over the pointers and said we've shown mental toughness
and character the whole year, and he just wanted us to show it. Like Coach
Oliver said, we've had different coaches and different voices. We stay
together no matter what. That was kind of like I said, the theme to stay
together no matter what happened. I think Marquette had us on the ropes as
couple times, and we really showed a lot of character tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one last question for the student-athletes. Seeing
none, we thank you gentlemen. Good luck in the next round.  
We now open the floor up for the coaches.  
  
Q. Can you just walk us through what happened on the play where you got
ejected, just sort of play-by-play a bit?  
COACH JOHNSON: Basically, you know, I was out of line. Bottom line was I was
trying to fight for my kids, and there was no profanity or anything like that
used, but I had been warned prior to that, and I put our team in a bad
situation, and it's unacceptable.  
  
Q. What were you warned?  
COACH JOHNSON: He had warned the bench when he told me to sit down, and told
me to calm down a little bit. Although I thought I was pretty calm. There's a
fine line for me with my intensity on the sidelines in terms of fighting for
my guys, especially in the magnitude of the game and knowing how aggressive we
need to be.  
But the bottom line is I put the kids in a bad situation, and I'm very
thankful and very fortunate to have guys like Doug, who actually was an
assistant coach when I was a player and Nick Robinson.  
  
Q. What were you doing after the ejection? Were you watching it on TV, were
you in the hallways, how did you spend the time?  
COACH JOHNSON: I was basically in the locker room watching it on TV.  
  
Q. Were you calm?  
COACH JOHNSON: There was nothing I could do. Actually, it's interesting, and
that's what I think gets me in trouble a little bit. My facial reactions and
demeanor gives you the impression, or most people, that I am angry and out of
control, where it's just the sideline intensity. I was very calm in the locker
room.  
Like Mitch said, when the kids came in, you know, my responsibility is to make
sure that they're not out of control or lose their composure like I did.  
  
Q. Trent, if before this game, if most people were asked who is the gritty
team, they would have said Marquette. Do you think if there was doubts about
the grit of your team before this game that some of that has shown through
tonight?  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, we see these guys every day. We know our level of
toughness. We know our level of competitiveness, and I don't get caught up in
comparing our team to anybody else's teams, because I don't see those teams
every day. I just know our guys have been very good all year long and very
competitive and very responsive to coaching.  
  
Q. Obviously a close game throughout. If this team had lost, would it have
been your fault?  
COACH JOHNSON: No question. Technical, six points, no question.  
  
Q. Did you have any past history? It seemed like you had something early on,
maybe even the first foul with that. Had there been anything before that?  
COACH JOHNSON: None whatsoever.  
  
Q. What did you tell Coach Oliver when you left and having played for him
and coached alongside him? What did you expect to take place when you put it
in his hands?  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, I think the kids emphasized it to their best. They're
used to hearing a bunch of voices. This is a coaching staff; it's not like
these guys answer to me. Doug has a wealth of basketball knowledge, so I
didn't need to tell Coach anything. We did the normal things we do at half-
time.  
We talked about our adjustments. I was watching the game and his role
throughout game, which is like at practice; he has defense at times, he has
offense at times. Donny has defense at times and has offense at times.  
  
Q. You had a big decision in the second half when you took the twins out for
an extended period. I mean, what was the thinking of when you were going to
bring them back? I guess they came in with about seven minutes left.  
DOUG OLIVER: It was going to be dictated by the score. We were fortunate to
have a cushion of five, six points when both of them picked up three fouls and
we went small. We were able to run a couple things that spaced the floor, took
time off the clock, so we got from nine-and-a-half minutes to seven, you know,
and the game was tied, or it was a one-point ball game.  
So we put them back in with three fouls, and that was going to be good enough.
We were happy where we were bringing those two big guys back on the floor at
that time.  
  
Q. Doug, when Trent was ejected, how much calming down did you have to do
with the players? What was their demeanor at that time going into the last few
minutes?  
COACH JOHNSON: Tell them it was just like when you threw me out of practice
when I was a player. (Laughing).  
DOUG OLIVER: Earlier when someone asked the question about what we discussed,
Trent, when it was time, he walked off. I looked and maybe thought he would
say something to me, but he just made his exit. I turned back and the kids
were -- they weren't chippy; they were sort of emotional.  
I just yapped at them a little bit, got their attention, so that they would
hear one voice to calm down, and Mitch said it best. We were down 11, and we
were able to get to half-time down 6, and that's really the only thing that
took place.  
  
Q. Doug, I think you put your hands to your head as soon as the ejection
signal was given. It looked like you kind of went like this. Can you just give
us --  
DOUG OLIVER: I didn't see the first technical, so -- I didn't see the first
technical. When I saw the hand go up to leave, I was a bit shocked, I mean,
and caught off guard. And, you know, I watched Trent a little bit, and then I
just -- I actually started to work into the moment of head coach again.  
I mean, I've done this before, so it was like having to take a deep breath,
think back and get the attention of the players. It's about the kids. I've
said it a long time, and Trent knows this, X's and O's are pretty simple. It's
about emotion and about young men and getting them on the same page, and we
were able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach Oliver, did you throw Trent out of practice when he was a player
and you were an assistant? And what was it for?  
DOUG OLIVER: The answer is yes. The answer is yes.  
He remembers the incident vividly. I guess it scarred him, I don't know.
(Laughing).  
But, you know, there was a -- he was mixing it up with one of the guys. I said
that was enough, because it was screwing up my drill, and he wanted the last
word, and I wouldn't let him have it, so he made an exit, and we continued on
with practice.  
  
Q. Trent, it's not every day that a coach gets thrown out of an NCAA
tournament game, and it didn't look like you said very much. There wasn't a
long conversation with either official. So there were really no magic words.  
COACH JOHNSON: No magic words. Hey, look, the officials have a tough job to
do. And, you know, the bottom line was the responsibility was on me, and I was
out of line, and just leave it at that, if you would, please.  
  
Q. Watching it on TV, was this Brook's finest game minus minutes as a
college player?  
COACH JOHNSON: I thought he was impressive the second half. Mitch had 16
assists, 1 turnover against this type of pressure, so I would have to say he
had a lot to do with that, too.  
  
Q. Doug said he was waiting for you to tell him something, before he knew it
you had left. Was that done deliberately? Did you leave without saying
anything --  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, I don't know if it was done deliberately, but I never
think Doug Oliver needs me. You know, the bottom line is he's been a head
coach for, like, 13-plus years. He was the assistant here and probably didn't
get enough credit for building the tradition and the foundation of this
program when he was by Mike's side, so it's not like he needs it. He's been
better for me than I have been for him.  
  
Q. Trent, just a little follow up. When you actually got ejected, you looked
a little surprised. Was the whole situation -- did it unfold quickly? Were you
surprised?  
COACH JOHNSON: I was shocked. I was shocked, believe me. Again, it's
unacceptable. So you can say it's the high road, you can call it what you
want; it's still unacceptable.  
  
Q. Will you ever get ejected from a tournament game ever again?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I don't think I'll ever get up in a tournament game
again. (Laughing).  
THE MODERATOR: At that, we'll thank the coaches. Good luck in the next round.  
  
"With 3:36 left in the first half of today's second-round game in Anaheim
between Stanford University and Marquette University, Stanford head coach
Trent Johnson received two technical fouls for unsportsman-like behavior.
Specifically, he was out on the playing floor, and out of the coaching box,
disputing calls. The first technical foul was assessed by David Hall. After
Coach Johnson failed to comply with instrucitons to return to the Stanford
bench, a second technical foul was assessed by Curtis Shaw, resulting in Coach
Johnson's ejection from the game."

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Dominic James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13757)

### [Jerel McNeal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18123)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
COACH CREAN: Congratulations to Stanford; they played an outstanding game. It
was a great game down to the wire, and I'm proud of our guys' effort, proud of
their toughness. We did some really, really good things, but the one thing we
didn't do when we had the opportunity in the second half was deliver the
knockout punch.  
And it was close a couple of times, but we just couldn't do it, and they
continued to play through it. We knew they would. They're too experienced;
they're too good. They're too tough to go away, even with what happened in the
first half with Trent.  
We knew they'd continue to play, and our intensity was fantastic, but it had a
few lulls when we had the chance to deliver, like I said, that knockout punch
that we never really got to. But it was a possession-by-possession game,
possession-by-possession overtime. They made an extremely difficult shot, and
that's the way it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. Can you explain what it's like losing the game like that? I mean, it kind
of came down to, you know, the big guy versus the overmatched guy. But it
seemed like, you know, you had position, and it just was a shot that just
happened?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Just like Coach said, it was an extremely tough shot. He had a
number of tough shots down the stretch. Our guys were battling down low, and
it just happened to fall. But, you know, those guys fought, being beat up, and
people were doubting them throughout the entire season, not only this game but
throughout the entire season, even though they got the final say with the last
basket.  
This team is all about facing hard times and people doubting us and our back
against the wall, and those guys step up every single time. That's what this
team is built of, character. We showed a lot of character throughout the
tournament, throughout the entire season. I wouldn't ask to go into battle
with any other guys than the guys I was out there on the floor with today.  
  
Q. Jerel, you had an outstanding second half, especially 30 points for the
game. Can you describe how you felt during the second part of the game and
early in overtime?  
JEREL McNEAL: The main thing, I was just trying to do whatever I could to help
my team win. We just knew we were battling back and forth there for a while,
and we just didn't get enough stops down the stretch to come out with a win.
We've been known in the overtime, in the second half, for the crunch time and
shooting jump shots, and they were shooting layups and percentages. They were
going to win shooting layups over jump shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen. Questions for Coach Crean?  
  
Q. You guys got through the hoop of getting past the first round with this
group of guys. Can you see how this is going to build toward future years and
their senior year?  
COACH CREAN: I hope it does. I hope it does. We did a lot of excellent things
this season, and we came out here and, you know, we battled as hard as we
could, and not always as smart as we could. But we battled as hard as we
could.  
And, yeah, I think we can build on it. You know, it's so hard to put
perspective on next year when you just ended a half-hour ago, but I love their
character.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel about the play your big man Ousmane Barro on the
Lopez brothers?  
COACH CREAN: When Ousmane went down with the fouls, there's no question it
changed for us a little bit, and our ball pressure wasn't as good as it needed
to be to keep the ball out of the post, and that's the best form of post
defense is your ball pressure. And frankly. We didn't take -- we didn't follow
the game plan a couple times on a couple of moves he made inside of the game,
but the shot he made at the end was a tough shot. Our big guys have gotten
better, but we obviously need to keep -- you always want to improve your team
in every position, and there's no doubt that, you know, as we go down the
line, we've got to keep improving our inside play.  
  
Q. Coach, considering that their coach was ejected for protesting fouls,
surprised at the disparity in free throws and fouls, particularly after that
point?  
COACH CREAN: No, I'm not surprised. I mean, I have no idea what he did to get
the technicals. You know, I saw him on the floor, but I was coaching my team,
and I'll just say this: We knew they weren't going to go away. We knew
Stanford was going to continue to battle and, if anything, take their
intensity up another notch.  
And we certainly -- we matched it a lot, but we didn't match it a couple
times, especially early in the second half. You know that's the disappointment
to me, that we did not come out and absolutely impose our will in the second
half. And whether it was a subtle jump shot, whether we just weren't as good
inside, you know, that's what we have to continue to learn to do. That's the
next step for this team.  
That's what the Big East and things prepare you for is to look for those areas
where you can really take the next step, and we didn't do that. We didn't do
that at the end of the first half, and we didn't do it at the beginning of the
second half.  
  
Q. Given the mismatch that you had in overtime and the situation, could you
really have asked for a better defensive effort from -- I think it was Burke
on the -- I mean, they seemed to have him pinned --  
COACH CREAN: Again, our ball pressure wasn't nearly as good as it needed to
be, and we wanted to come down off the pass. They're as good any team as in
the country with those two on the blocks. I liked our zone today, but we were
a step slow on the zone as the game wound down, and we had to keep that
pressure on with our man-to-man, and it wasn't as good on the ball with
Johnson getting it in, and we did not do a good enough job. When they made --
the toughest play made all day was the last one at the end of the game.  
  
Q. That's what I was talking about; I mean in that situation.  
COACH CREAN: He took a tough shot. I mean, he takes tough shots. The twins
have a real ability to make those plays. And, you know, we knew going in -- I
mean we're not -- we can't simulate two seven-footers in practice, but we
could have done a better job on the scouting report as far as following the
report a couple times, you know, in that post, taking away a certain shoulder.
But, again, they made some tough plays. They're outstanding players, and, you
know, Brook made big plays, and he caught it so deep that we couldn't get our
double-team down there.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Darren Collison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17166)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Kevin Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18266)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll lead off with a statement from Coach Howland and then
open it up to questions for the student athletes, then questions for Coach
Howland.  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, that was reminiscent of a lot of games we seem to be in
lately, where we're having to make dramatic comebacks in the last few minutes,
but the one thing I love about our team is that they know in their heart
they're always going to win the game. They're going to find a way.  
And we did not play well the first 35 minutes. That had a lot to do with Texas
A&M and how well they played. They are a very, very good team and very well
coached. They took advantage on us in a lot of different areas. They shot a
very high-percentage the first half.  
I thought the first ten minutes our defense really tightened, but we did a
much better job. Obviously there were huge shots down the stretch for us.
Kevin's two little fall-aways were incredible shots. Speak of horse shots,
those were like horse shot plays, unbelievable with that kind of, you know,
stuff on the line there. Your season's on the line, and you can step up and
make those plays, that's why he is a great player.  
And Darren's two plays down the stretch, Darren really kept us in the game
initially by all his threes. They were giving him threes. They were going
underneath the ball screens and saying, that's how you're going beat us, so he
did a great job of reading that. But I'm just really pleased we were able to
sneak out of here with a win.  
These are the kind of games you have to come out on top to be able to advance
in this tournament. The seedings mean absolutely nothing in the NCAA
tournament. So for anybody who doesn't understand that by now with all the
different games that are going on and going every year, this is another class
example.  
A 1-9 seed, and the margin between these two teams that played today is very,
very slight. Obviously the work we did in the regular season, and therefore
playing close to home, was a big advantage for us as we made our comeback.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. On the last Texas A &M shot there was a little confusion as to who
blocked it and how it was blocked. Could you tell us the details of what
happened underneath?   
KEVIN LOVE: Well, you know, I saw him driving in there -- was it Sloan that
was driving in there? I saw him fake it to the basket. There was only a few
seconds left. I was going to try to step up and block it. I thought I had the
right timing, but I think it was Josh who stepped up and blocked it. So many
things were going down, and it was down to the wire that I didn't understand
or see who blocked it, but after the game in the locker room we were talking
and it was Josh, and he made a great play.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you describe how physical the battle was down low with DeAndre
and Jones?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, it was pretty physical. I would definitely say it's up there
with Stanford, with the Lopez twins, and also Brockman and Wallace from
Washington as well.  
It was a very physical game. We expected that all along. Coach Howland was
stressing that throughout the week. Since we beat Mississippi Valley State, he
said it's going be probably the most physical game of the year, and it was
right up there.  
  
Q. Kevin, as Ben alluded to, you guys had worked all year with the idea of
getting here for the first round. Having that crowd and having the noise level
the way it was and the support that they gave you, how much -- how
instrumental was that in putting you guys over the top? Would you have won
this game if you had played it in another site?  
KEVIN LOVE: I don't really know if we would have. You want to answer that one,
Coach?  
COACH HOWLAND: I say yes.  
KEVIN LOVE: He said, yes, so I'm going to say yes too.  
COACH HOWLAND: One thing that just popped out at me as I was looking at the
stat sheet here that -- it's incredible that I didn't even know, because we
just came right from the locker room out to here. There's a time constraint
and everything. Eight blocked shots by Kevin today. He almost had a triple-
double with rebounds, points and blocks.  
Now he is not known as a shot blocker, per se, but that's pretty incredible.
Eight blocked shots is big time.  
  
Q. Speaking of the blocks, you had two underneath and then got the ball, got
a foul and went over to the fans and kind of was pretty pumped up at that
point. Did you feel like that right there was the moment that really got
y'all's engines revving and got you going?  
KEVIN LOVE: It's tough to say. I just wanted to get the crowd on our side. I
wanted to get the momentum going for us. I felt like at that time the momentum
was going our way. I just, you know, basketball's an emotional game, whether
you like to show it or not. I was just very into it.  
I think I flexed so much, my muscles kind of hurt after this, and also I stuck
my tounge out so much that, you know, it was pretty crazy.  
  
Q. They outscored you 26-6 in the paint in the first half. What adjustments,
what changes did y'all make in the second half?  
KEVIN LOVE: They were just more physical than us in the first half. You know,
they played a very, very good game, and they're physical inside. They got a
lot of players, four or five players 6'9" or taller. That's a team -- I think
they're 25-7, and they kind of underachieved for the year, but they're a very,
very good team.  
Like Coach Howland said, for being the nine seed all the way down to us, a one
seed, there wasn't much of a difference in our teams. They are very, very
talented and very well coached.  
  
Q. You guys were down ten points early in the second half to a team that was
playing well. Did you at any time think, my God we could blow it here? And at
what point did you think, okay, we got it?  
DARREN COLLISON: It was still a ball game to be played. Once that buzzer goes
zero, zero, the time clock goes zero, zero that's when we'll stop playing.
We've been through that all season. Ever since I've been here we've been
through adversity, especially in the tournament. So there's not quitting.  
We had some games coming into the tournament where we've been down; We just
stayed focused. We knew what we had to do; we knew who was going to win, and
all the coaches said we just had to do the right things to win the game.  
  
Q. You guys scored 40 of your team's 53 points. Did you feel like you guys
had to shoulder the load more than normal?  
DARREN COLLISON: Say again?  
  
Q. You scored 40 of your team's 53 points between the two of you. Did you
feel like you had to shoulder the load more than normal?  
DARREN COLLISON: The plays are designed for us. We had to create -- whether it
was me on the ball screens creating for myself or my teammates, or whether it
was Kevin getting it down low and getting an easy shot down low. The plays are
designed for us; can't be any better way, and we just took advantage of it.  
  
Q. And sort of a follow-up to that, Kevin. Is there a point in the game
where you sort of said, I'm the main thing that's working today, and I sort of
have to take the team on my back and try to win this game? I know you are not
trying to score every point, but the way things were going, did you ever sort
of feel you might have to come through to win the game?  
KEVIN LOVE: I felt like I had to get on the offensive boards, defensive glass
as much as I could. Rather than that I was just finding the openings. The same
thing with Darren as well. We did score 40 out of the team's 53 points, but
it's team game. I'm never trying to be bigger than the team. I just found
openings. The fall-away two buckets at the end felt good for me. Darren found
the seam in the lane and hit big shots. So those last four shots are very,
very big shots.  
  
Q. Darren, you've played in Final Fours, you played against Gonzaga and
Oakland. Can you rank this game as far as game pressure in the last five
minutes or so and also the atmosphere?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think it's been the same every second round game since I've
been here. My first year we played against Alabama; it was pretty much like
this, and Indiana last year. Like Coach says, the seedings right now, it
doesn't matter who we play. Every team is going to give it their best shot.
Today against Texas A&M, that's a very good team, it just shows everybody who
plays is capable and tough.  
  
Q. Kevin, speaking of your last minute shots there, what your coach called
horse shots, describe what goes through your mind as you lean back for a shot
like that?  
KEVIN LOVE: I'm just looking at the back of the rim just trying to put it
through the basket. You kind of dream about shots like that. You know,
advancing to the next round, hitting big shots for your team. I just wanted to
help us put us over the top any way that I possibly could.  
It happened to be scoring. Other times it's passing, rebounding, taking
charges. But, you know, what's going through my mind on those, I'm just, you
know, praying that I make them and, you know, it goes through the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen. Good luck in the next round.  
Questions for Coach Howland?  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difference in the paint between the two
halves?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, I thought a lot of their points in the first half were
actually off of ball screens, where Sloan was getting into the paint and
creating shots for himself and for others. I thought that DeAndre Jordan came
in and hurt us around the basket. He is big and long, and it's a really,
really good Aggie team.  
We knew that last year with our tough experience against them here a year ago,
and I think they're better than they were a year ago; at least, against us
they were for sure, because we're a better team, and they were handling us for
a lot of that game.  
Second half, especially the last ten minutes, we did a better job of hedging
and staying with our hedge in the middle of the floor, and that's a little
adjustment we made, to tell Kevin stay there and hold it longer, because he
was just dancing around them.  
Then when he got in the paint, we were matched up. Lorenzo got matched up and
fell down. Kevin got beat a couple times with Sloan coming at him, so we
probably should have read it, should have doubled it, but maybe we'll have to
look at that in the future.  
  
Q. They were saying you lost your voice, so obviously it was pretty loud out
there. Going back to my earlier question about the atmosphere here and the
support you got from this crowd and, you know, it probably did help push you
over the top, that's something you guys have used all year as motivation.  
Is that something that can reinforce it in the future, if you tell your guys,
hey, this is what we're playing for, and this is the result, this is what can
happen?  
COACH HOWLAND: You want to come talk to our team, Jim? (Laughing). We meet
again on Tuesday. That's pretty good. I'm impressed.  
  
Q. I've been coaching from press row for years, so you know how that goes?  
COACH HOWLAND: What we talked about after the game was that, you know -- and
the same thing's been true, we're getting everybody's best game. It doesn't
matter if we're at home or on the road. We've actually played better on the
road than we have at home. And, you know, when the backs are more against the
wall, and it's us against the world mentality, every game in this tournament
is hard.  
And that's why this is the greatest sporting event in all of American sports
is because anybody can beat anybody. There's the little guy, the big guy, I
mean the San Diego win over UCONN yesterday was incredible. The Western
Kentucky win, unbelievable. That's why this thing's so great when you just
look at following all the scores.  
I mean, Belmont comes this close to upsetting a great Duke team. We knew it
would be a dogfight. Every game is tough, and we understand that.  
  
Q. Coach, everyone's talked about Kevin's two shots, but could you discuss
Darren's two baskets at the end of his drives, and was that planned so he
would maybe get fouled and get to the line?  
COACH HOWLAND: Actually that was vintage Darren Collison. Driving down the
lane, going right, high off the glass, kissing it in. The second one was
really a blessing because that thing kind of rolled in had for us. And,
believe me, I'm very thankful.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how frustrating it is when two of your people who
you depend on scoring just had off nights, Shipp and Westbrook? They had very
difficult times scoring in the first half, and even to a large extent the
second half. How do you deal with that?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, you know, you are always going to have games where
certain players may have an off night, but when you have a good defensive
team, and they both played great defense, you stay in games and you find a
way.  
And really talking about it, it was Josh's defensive play up to -- at the end
of the game, Russell gets a dunk. That's one of his three baskets. Josh made
the play down the stretch, and he made a couple of rebounds. Luc did not play
well today, and you could tell from a week off, from not playing, especially
in a game, it hurts you.  
But he steps up and makes big rebounds down the stretch. Russell made big
plays down the stretch. So some people only see things from an offensive
standpoint; whereas, I see the complete game. And at the end of the day these
guys helped us win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach? Thank you, Coach. Good luck in
the next round.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 21, 2008

  

### [Taj Finger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18249)

### [Anthony Goods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18381)

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: So open the floor to questions.  
  
Q. This is for either of you. Just wondering what the difference is between
the Lopez brothers. How would you describe the differences between them, their
personalities, either?  
TAJ FINGER: Off the basketball court?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
TAJ FINGER: Um, I'd say maybe Brook is a little bit more laid back off the
court, and Robin can definitely be more intense. And, you know, they're both
goof balls, you know. But I guess that's really it.  
ANTHONY GOODS: I think everything Taj said is pretty much correct. They're
funny guys. They're characters.  
  
Q. Can you give me an example of something.  
ANTHONY GOODS: I mean, everything's real serious with Robin off the court.
Anything like competitionwise is real serious with Robin. He's a competitor.
And, you know, Brook, he's kind of laid back, has a little more fun. But, you
know --  
TAJ FINGER: Robin also loves to sing off the court.  
ANTHONY GOODS: Yeah, he does. Robin loves to sing. Brook loves to tell Robin
to shut up. (Laughing).  
  
Q. What do you think of the singing?  
TAJ FINGER: Pretty good.  
ANTHONY GOODS: It's an acquired taste. (Laughing).  
  
Q. What does he sing?  
ANTHONY GOODS: Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, just, you know, just depends on
what he feels like at that time.  
  
Q. Anthony, what are your impressions of Dominic James? I'm sure you
probably watched some game film of him since last night.  
ANTHONY GOODS: He is definitely one of the most explosive players I've seen on
tape. Looks like his second and third step is just as quick as his first.
Really, he can jump; he can get off the floor, and he finishes well. It's
going be tough to try to keep him out of the lane.  
  
Q. Does he remind you of anyone you guys have faced this season?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I would probably say he's got like a -- his handle kind of
reminds me of like a Tajuan Porter a little bit. You know, like he's got like
a -- he's real athletic. He's kind of like, I don't know, maybe -- I really
can't describe it. The way he dribbles, it reminds me a lot of Tajuan Porter.
Obviously he is a little bigger and can finish a little better around the
basket. He is something like Tajuan.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you talk about what it's like as a guard to play defense and
have the twins playing behind you, I guess what liberties that affords you?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I mean, you know, it's kind of a luxury. It's kind of like, you
know, going into a fight with your older brothers behind you, you know.
Usually we try to pressure the guards and, you know, if they happen to get by
us, it's definitely a luxury to know you got 14 feet in the paint willing to,
you know, come and help and block shots and what not. It's definitely a
blessing for our team to have two of them out there.  
  
Q. Marquette's almost certainly going to try to, you know, force the tempo
and run up and down the court on you guys and try to get some easy transition
baskets. Anthony, can you talk a little bit about, you know, are you going to
try to play that style with them and try to slow the game down? Are you going
to try to do anything in terms of what you want the tempo to be?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I think we'll probably end up trying to slow the game down.
Because, you know, they excel in transition, so I think we're going to have
our perimeters get back and try to stop them from getting a full head of
steam, and getting those transition baskets and playing slower is going be to
our benefit because we have size and we have strength down low. So we're going
to try to slow the game down and pound it in the post.  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have any further questions? All right, seeing none, good
luck tomorrow, gentlemen.  
Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH JOHNSON: Glad to still be playing, that's for sure. We have a very, very
tough match-up tomorrow for us. Marquette is extremely explosive, and one of
the better teams coming out of the Big East, so I know our guys are looking
forward the challenge.  
  
Q. Trent, obviously, I'm sure about 80% of your questions almost center on
the Lopez twins. What do you think are some of the key areas that are not
being asked about with your team and some of the secrets of the success this
year that have not been about the Lopezes?  
COACH JOHNSON: Probably one of the most important things is our ability to
take care of the ball, which is going to be a key tomorrow for us. The play of
Mitch Johnson at the point. The selflessness of Lawrence Hill being an all-
league player last year and now deferring and trying to do other things
better, whether it be rebounding or defensively.  
[Fred] Washington's ability to take care of the ball and defend, Taj Finger
coming on the off the bench and probably one of our better defensive players.
Again, for us you can pick a number of guys. For the most part this has been a
very, very good basketball team. I made the comment, I want to say about a
month ago, in the PAC-10 statistics we had 6 guys in the top 20 in rebounding,
and we didn't have one guy in the top 20 in minutes played, so that speaks
volumes to how balanced the team is and how solid a team I think we have.  
  
Q. Trent, you mentioned yesterday that Dominic James was a special player.
What about him do you think is most special? Why do you respect him so much?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, number one he is probably one of the more explosive
guards in the country, and he's extremely difficult to guard, and I haven't
been seen anybody able to keep him out of the lane and where we wants to go
with the basketball.  
Then his demeanor on the floor; he is very competitive but always under
control, so he is a catalyst for their basketball team. I think the number one
ingredient is he is an extension of Tom on the floor.  
  
Q. You mentioned Mitch kind of coming out of his shell this year. What do
you think were some of the steps for that happening? Was it just a matter of
time and experience? Or was there more to it, kind of an Eureka moment?  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't think Mitch came out of his shell. I just think last
year what we saw was a very inexperienced team, and we saw a very competitive
individual, and Mitch Johnson is a winner trying to do too much at times.  
Mitch Johnson has never lost confidence. The bottom line was he is trusting
more in what we're asking him to do. And us as a staff, and me as the head
coach, we put him in a better situation where he can manage our team and be
more effective. So there's a lot of trust from me and from our staff in making
sure he's capable and he runs that team and is running the game and managing
the game.  
  
Q. Just to go a little further on Mitch. Obviously last year's tournament
game was tough for him. What was that like for you? Because you obviously put
a lot of faith and responsibility in his hands?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, it was extremely tough. I mean, I think I made the
comment on the podium at this time last year that I didn't feel like I did my
job in getting those guys put in a situation where they could be successful.
And so during the spring, during the summer there was a lot of emphasis put on
ball handling, skill development and understanding the type of situations we
were going to put in, multiple types of pressure, our ability to handle the
ball, our ability to make good decisions and our ability just to stay relaxed
and play within ourselves.  
I mean, we are who we are; make no mistake about it. We have to play on the
half court to be effective. We're not as explosive as a lot of teams in the
post. We're not as explosive as a lot of teams on the perimeter, but we do
have size and we do have strength and we do have some strength on the
perimeter, so our ability to wear people down has been effective for us this
year.  
  
Q. Notice you and Tar are friendly. Just wonder what that relationship is
like. Does it mean something to you? Probably not going to a Bruce Pearl
moment but to be that close to a women's program like that?  
COACH JOHNSON: I'm glad you mentioned Bruce Pearl, because I don't need any
color. For the most part Tar has been great to me, and I respect her in every
fashion. She's probably one of the best coaches I've been around, regardless
of a female or male, and I just like watching good basketball, always have.  
I have a daughter who was very competitive, ran track and field at Arizona
State, so I know what it's like. I just think she's been very good to me. We
talk a lot, and we're each other's best supporter, no question.  
  
Q. Does that date back to when you were an assistant at Stanford?  
COACH JOHNSON: No. When I was an assistant I was too busy trying to do my job,
which was recruit, but I was always observant, always respected her from afar.
She is a very good coach, but she is a very tough-minded person. She is also
-- she's what this game is about. She pays attention to detail and her team
has the utmost respect for her. She is a team person.  
  
Q. You mentioned Hill as a guy who is selfless this year. A lot of stuff you
hear written, he's fallen off from being a star player last year to being kind
of in the background and maybe losing some of his confidence. Do you disagree
with that? Do you feel like he hasn't fallen off?  
COACH JOHNSON: When you say, fallen off, he hasn't made the shots that he made
last year. He is shooting the same shots. He is taking better shots. The ball
is not going down for him. But we're 27-7. Lawrence is a winner. He tried to
do other things; he came off the bench yesterday and had ten rebounds. He
improved his ability to defend, he improved his ability to make good decisions
and handle the ball better.  
I think sometimes for me personally we put too much emphasis on scoring points
and all the other things. Lawrence is becoming a better and more complete
player. Most important thing is he understands the team and he understands
winning.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.

ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

### [Darren Collison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17166)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Josh Shipp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17143)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Just going back to last year's game, when you played these guys obviously
you've added Kevin since then. They've lost Acie, they have a new coach, so
it's not a really fair comparison in a sense, but what do you kind of expect
this game to come down to, based on what you've seen?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think they'll use it as a motivation for this year's game.
It was a close game. Went down to the wire. Both teams could have easily won
it. I thought we played really excellent down the stretch last year, as I
remember. The difference now is we got Kevin, so think it's going to be a lot
more easier. Doesn't mean we can't play hard. We are going to play hard.  
It just comes down to us being physical with them. We got to be able to match
their intensity. If we do that, we should be all right.  
  
Q. Kevin, just obviously that is going to be a key to the game is they're
going to -- they've said they're going shuttle a bunch of guys in to deal with
you. You just expect to pretty much get pounded? Are you mentally, you know,
thinking that way right now?  
KEVIN LOVE: Yes. And Coach Howland actually talked about that with me, that
they're going to send a few guys in, and they are going to pound on me. I
think I counted it was four or five guys over 6'9", and those guys are
physical inside.  
And Coach Howland said last year was an all-out battle, all-out war against
them. So I'm just going to have to go in there, and even if I get fouled hard,
whether it is a flagrant foul, I'm just going to have to keep my mind on the
game and not feed into that stuff.  
  
Q. Kevin, DeAndre was talking a lot about y'all's relationship. Do you just
talk about how you see him and what kind of friendship y'all have?  
KEVIN LOVE: He is a great friend of mine. I've known him since about seventh
or eighth grade; we've been playing against each other. We've been texting
each other back and forth now. I just saw him before I came here. He is a
great player. He's going to have a great run. I hope I get to play against him
a little bit tomorrow.  
And when he decides to go to the NBA, whenever that is, I think he's going to
be a lock for a top-five pick, just because he has the size, has the
athleticism, and he is a great kid. So I wish the best for him, and we've been
good friends for a long time.  
  
Q. And I think its fair to say, he hasn't had the season that many projected
him to have and stuff. I mean, how much have you talked to him this year? How
frustrated was he at the way it all went for him?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, you know, if I was the coach -- I was talking to Coach
Howland today, asking why he didn't recruit him. I know his mom pretty well. I
know they wanted to stay close to home, but if I would have -- I would have
had him in there. He is a great player. He is a great friend of mine as well,
so I would have had him playing, definitely.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about, as close as you and DeAndre are, as good as
your friendship is, how well you know each other's game as you play against
each other tomorrow?  
KEVIN LOVE: I think the last time we played against each other was probably
the Round Ball Classic in Chicago my senior year. And, you know, he is the
type of guy that, you know, you put up a shot, he is going to contest every
single one.  
He changes every shot, and what it comes down to when he gets picked in the
NBA draft, he might be something like an Andrew Bynum. People might pick him
as like a project, but he's got a lot of upside, and I think he can do a lot
of great things.  
  
Q. Darren, can you talk about their guards and what sort of problems they
pose for you guys? And does it matter that they can shuttle guards in and out,
because they're pretty deep that way.  
DARREN COLLISON: Just like the inside game, their perimeter is just as good.
They got a lot of good shooters. Coach was talking about one of their players
that Russ is going to be guarding that we have to step up and contain. Me and
Josh are going to be having a load on our hands. If we continue the pressure
like we've been doing last couple games, we should be all right.  
We can't let them get no easy shots. We can't leave nobody, and we just got to
contain them throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. Darren, obviously you guys will have Luc back starting tomorrow. Haven't
seen him for a few games. Do you think he is going have like a little extra
just going because he's had to sit it out last couple games? Think he'll be
particularly motivated to get back in and try to make a difference?  
DARREN COLLISON: Say it again.  
  
Q. You guys haven't had Luc the last couple games. Do you think just having
him -- him having to sit out and watch from the sidelines, do you think he's
going be bringing it extra hard tomorrow because he hasn't had the chance to
play yet and really get in the mix?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think Luc's fine. We seen him work earlier today. He looked
fine. I don't think there's no holding back. I think Coach Howland is pretty
cautious, being on the safe side, so he wouldn't get in the game yesterday.
But he is fine. He is ready to go. And I think he's going to help us out a
lot.  
The last two conference games when we won the conference championship he's
been a big part of that. If Luc can play with us, he can help Kevin on the
boards and bring a lot more to our perimeter game as well.  
  
Q. I know you don't play Stanford tomorrow, but they have a game also, and
you've played them this year with some success. What is the key to playing
against the Lopezes, and how do you get the best of them?  
KEVIN LOVE: That's a tough question, to get the best of the Lopez twins.
They're two trees in there. They're monsters. You have to try to send our
whole team at them, pretty much, just to keep them off the boards and make
their guards take tough shots and just allow them to try to rebound and limit
Brook's touches, because he's going to be another top pick in the draft
whenever he decides to go out.  
You know, talentwise those two are very, very good players and, you know, when
you think you have one up for a shot fake, you step through and the other
one's right there waiting for you, so that's a tough question.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk -- Coach Turgeon was talking about how he thought
maybe the first team to 50 points wins this game. Do you feel that way? And
after yesterday's 29-point performance, does that sound like some crazy
scoring?  
JOSH SHIPP: For us, bottom line, we're trying to win games. We don't care what
the score is. We're going to come out and play hard defense, and hopefully we
can limit teams and not let them score a lot of points. Bottom line is we
don't care what the score is as long as we're on top.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Kevin, I hate to be a broken record here, but you know just with your
back, have you been trying to like sit down a little extra when you can and
when you have been standing up today, are there any spasms or anything like
that?  
KEVIN LOVE: Not really. But I'm glad you're concerned. (Laughing).  
  
Q. I gotta write with something.  
KEVIN LOVE: I hear you. Everything's fine. I practiced on it today. It think
the game yesterday was a good test for it. I know I only played 21 minutes;
just getting into it and getting a good sweat going was very good for me and
very good for my back as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. That will do it. Thank you,
gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open things up with a statement from Coach Howland, then
throw it open to questions. Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH HOWLAND: I'm open for questions.  
  
Q. Does it do any good to look at the film of last year's game with A &M,
given all the changes?   
COACH HOWLAND: It does from the standpoint, a lot of the personnel is the
same. That was the most physical game we played, last season. I mean, no one
played us more physical than Texas A&M. I see that in them again this year. So
the good thing about it, we showed our players, look that's where they're
playing against us a year ago, they can generally get the sense of how big and
strong and tough they are and how well they shoot the ball.  
Obviously, they're very impressive, and that was a great win over BYU. BYU is
a very, very good team. So to beat BYU is obviously an outstanding win.  
  
Q. Ben, can you talk about the way Lorenzo handled love coming in here and
having to give up his position after all this time and being a senior?  
COACH HOWLAND: Yeah. Lorenzo's done a great job all year long. He as you know
started on last year's Final Four team. I think he started every game, which
was impressive in itself, because he's had a lot of injuries over his four-
year career. But he's been great all year, very supportive of Kevin. He's
helped him learn a lot of things that, you know, a senior would help a
freshmen with on the floor, the little things, and been really a good friend
to him, a good mentor, and also a great back-up.  
They've played together some. As you know, we've played them about eight or
ten minutes together in the championship game against Stanford in the
conference tournament. But Lorenzo's just had a great attitude from day one.
Really proud of him, not only as a player but as a person.  
He is going graduate on time, will be the first person in his family to
graduate from college; that's pretty special.  
  
Q. Coach, you just mentioned Stanford. I know you don't play them tomorrow,
but you've played them and played them well this year. What is the key to
matching up against the Lopez brothers? How do you have success?  
COACH HOWLAND: You don't match up with the Lopez brothers. There's nobody in
college basketball that's matching up about these two big twins. And we were
fortunate in that we played them the first game in the conference on the road
and played very well that night. That was a big win for us.  
I think they've improved dramatically as the season's progressed, especially
when you consider Brook missed the first nine or ten games, in terms of their
whole team being in sync. We were very fortunate to beat them in the second
meeting at Pauley.  
We had a free throw with a blessing from God that, you know, hit the back of
the rim, the front of the rim and rolled in there by Russell Westbrook. So we
had a lot of things go well for us in the last minute of that game. They
played very well.  
It was really a big win for us to beat them the third time in the conference
tournament. I don't think you match up, I think you got to do it as a team. We
double the post. That's what we did against them. If you try to play those two
one-on-one, I don't think you can because they're just too skilled and too
big.  
  
Q. Ben, do you need more out of Josh Shipp?  
COACH HOWLAND: Josh has helped us get to 32-3, so I think he is doing a pretty
good job. And, you know, we would not be where we are now without Josh. I
think Josh has played well and exhibit all year long.  
  
Q. Just kind of wondering how much you're paying attention to what else is
happening in your part of the bracket today. Any thoughts on all that?  
COACH HOWLAND: Not really. I'm just focused on our next game. Really, I think
any time you start to look ahead or -- I haven't watched another game since
the tournament's begun. You know, I watch Sports Center at the end of each
night and see who's won the games, just because it's hard for me to sleep. But
I do understand that San Diego beat UCONN, I think, in overtime, I think, by
one, which is a great win for Billy Grier. He is doing a great job in his
first year as the head coach, and that's an outstanding win for the University
of San Diego. I have great respect for Coach Calhoun and that program, so
that's a big-time win.  
  
Q. A lot of the A &M players talked about because of last year's game
they're not nervous or concerned about playing UCLA. I wonder how often do you
see that anymore in non-conference play or in tournaments like this? How often
any more do teams just fold when they see those four letters?   
COACH HOWLAND: We don't, unfortunately, get that luxury. I wish someone would
do that. What we see typically is a team have their best effort of the year to
play their very best game because we're UCLA. And we see that night-in and
night-out through our conference and everywhere you go. So that's really made
this team a battle-hardened team, when you have everybody giving you their
best effort.  
Obviously in the NCAA tournament you wouldn't be here unless you are a really
good team. Of course Texas A&M's played against a lot of really good programs
both in their conference and outside. We know what's in store. It's going to
be a very hard fought, tough game.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about similarities, but there are, you know, Acie Law's
gone, Aaron's gone, Kevin Love is here now. What kind of differences could
that make in tomorrow's game?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, you just named two NBA guards, one from each team that's
left and gone to the NBA. So those are both great players. Aaron was our best
player last year, and Acie Law was their best player. We've added Kevin Love;
they've added DeAndre Jordan, who is a very good, fine big man. You look at
their team, they've got a lot of players that were here a year ago. They're a
year older and a year better.  
So it's going to be -- we know how hard it's going to be. It's going to be
very, very tough.  
  
Q. How about schemewise when you look at them with the coaching change? What
is different about the way Texas A &M plays?   
COACH HOWLAND: You know, they're basically two very similar styles from Coach
Gillispie to Coach Turgeon. Both man-to-man defense, primarily. [Cell phone
rings].  
Excuse me, our bus broke down, and so I had to figure out a way to get our
team here. So we still got the guys here on time. Thank goodness.  
They run motion they do play it inside out. They get it into their bigs.
They're obviously a team that has very good shooters, notably Carter, who had
six threes last night in their last game against BYU.  
They're a very good offensive rebounding team as they were a year ago. So I
think they're very similar from one year to the next in terms of the style of
play.  
  
Q. You mentioned how DeAndre Jordan is a fine, big man. His production
hasn't been quite what people thought it would be this year. What concerns you
about him?  
COACH HOWLAND: Just the fact that one-on-one he's so big and so long; he
scores on you when he gets you angled. He is a good shot blocker. I mean, he
is seven feet tall. He poses a lot of problems in terms of changing shots and
blocking shots and scoring around the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, where did the bus break down? What went wrong and did you have to
get a new one?  
COACH HOWLAND: You know, I had to bring three of our players who were due to
be here on the podium early. I brought Kevin, Darren and Josh. The bus
wouldn't start. It went dead. I'm not sure what's wrong with it, so we had to
get four, like, vans from the hotel. We weren't at the hotel; we were at our
actual practice. We practiced at a local high school.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Joseph, just talk about last year's game here against the Bruins. You
guys almost pulled that off. You lost by three. Kind of what do you remember
about that game, and what do you think sort of came down to the difference
that maybe you can change this time around?  
JOSEPH JONES: Last year was a great game. Like you said, we lost by three.
Both teams played very hard. A tough, physical game. They hit some big baskets
last year. I think Afflalo came in the second half, and he was doing a great
job for his team. I think they're just a great team. Nothing really sticks out
from last year.  
I think the three point at half-time is what really hurt us going into second
half. This is going be another great game, a defensive effort and hope we come
out with a win this time.  
  
Q. Does it do much good to study last year's game given the personnel
differences on both teams this year and the fact that you all have a new style
with a new coach?  
JOSH CARTER: Not so much. I mean, I've looked at film from UCLA this year. So,
I mean, they're a new team; we're a new team. So last year is kind of out of
the window. We just got to look at what they do now and what we do now.  
  
Q. Josh, you know, with the way BYU played defense, you got a lot of open
looks. Can you talk a little bit about UCLA's defense. Just how much tougher
it's going to go, those same kind of looks?  
JOSH CARTER: I'm sure they'll do a good job. I don't know what they're going
to do. I don't know their game plan, just try to get open just like every
game, and we'll just see what happens.  
  
Q. There's so much mystique associated with a number one seed. Everybody
fast-forwards them through their brackets and stuff. Can you just talk about
that, playing the number one seed. This will be the first time A &M's ever
done that.   
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's just going to be great. You know, UCLA is one of the best
teams in the nation. We got to go out there and have our hard hats. We got to
go out there and play hard, because it's going to be a physical game, going to
be mostly a defense game. So we got to go out there and just play hard.  
JOSH CARTER: I think it's good. I mean, UCLA's a great team, like Dominic
said. I mean we're just going to go out there and try to play hard and
compete. They're great team. Like to think we're great team too. We're just
going to come out and try to win.  
  
Q. Dominic, you guys are going for a second straight trip to the Sweet 16;
they're guy trying to get to the Final Four. Can you talk about both programs
playing for so much and everything being on the line?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's great. You know, both programs going out there to try to
get far. So try to get to where we didn't last year, just going to be a great
game. It's going be a big battle for us. It's going to be a big battle for
them. Just got to go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk to you guys just a little bit just about these four
years and what they've been like for you guys. Could you all imagine ever
having the kind of success that you guys have ultimately had here?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, it's amazing. It's just been a fun ride. Four years, you
know, it went by so fast but, you know, we had a great time, and eventually we
worked hard to try to get to this situation right here, but it came early for
us, our sophomore year, and it's just been a great ride.  
JOSEPH JONES: When we first came here we didn't think it would be this fast
and this special. Like he said, we got to the tournament early as sophomores,
and it's been great ever since, been the best four years of my life.  
  
Q. Joseph, could one benefit of last year's game possibly be y'all have seen
that so-called UCLA mystique? I mean, you've seen the team; you've played
against that team before so there's not that little mystery about playing
UCLA. You've done it.  
JOSEPH JONES: Like Josh said, they're a totally different team now. They got a
lot of key guys on the team. They're doing a great job for them this year.
They got a couple of great guys like Kevin Love, and Westbrook is starting to
play more. They're a totally different team. They run a lot of different
assists, but at the same time seeing them play last year gives us a better
look at them and just what they can do and what they have done.  
  
Q. How much has your confidence changed both as a team and you specifically
since maybe a week or two ago heading into the Big 12 tournament?  
JOSH CARTER: I'm always a confident player. I mean, it does boost your
confidence to see shots actually go down. But, I mean, I'm just going to play
hard. My teammates want me and expect me to make shots, so I'm just going to
keep shooting and hopefully they'll keep falling.  
  
Q. Dominic, can you talk about just your play, personally how you've been
the last couple weeks. You really elevated here lately. Just talk a little bit
about how you are feeling.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I'm just trying to step up for the team. Just trying to go out
there and be more aggressive than I was earlier in the year and just trying
not to just -- you know, just go out there and play hard. I know it's my last
tournament and everything. I just got to go out there and keep doing what I'm
doing for the team and just trying to keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Dominic, would it be fair to say through the ups and downs of the season
beating UCLA would make this a successful season?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, you know, UCLA is a great team and everything, but, you
know, if we beat them, you know, we still got games to go. So I mean we can't
really just dwell on that and everything. We just got to go out there and just
keep playing if we win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck
tomorrow.  
We'll open it up with a statement from Coach Turgeon, then open the floor to
questions.  
COACH TURGEON: We're excited, obviously, you know, live another day. And, you
know, you'd rather not be playing the number one seed in their backyard, but
we kind of dug our own hole, lost a few home games we shouldn't have lost, got
us to an eight or nine seed, and UCLA deserves this. They've had an
unbelievable year, won a lot of games. They deserve to play close to home.  
Be a big-time challenge for us, but I know our young men are looking forward
to it, and should be a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Mark, does it do much good to look at the film of last year's game given
all the different personnel changes for both teams and the coaching change at
A &M?   
COACH TURGEON: I haven't looked at it, and I won't. I haven't done that all
year. So I don't know if my assistants did or not, but Kevin Love makes a
little bit of difference on their team, and Collison is stepping up. Then
we're completely different now without Acie Law. So, no, we won't watch that.  
But, you know, our kids are familiar with them and of course playing them in
this building, so that helps. It all helps.  
  
Q. Coach, can you kind of contrast the ability that DeAndre Jordan has
versus maybe what he's done this year productionwise?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, DeAndre has a chance to be one of the all-time best
defenders if he commits himself to it. I think that's where his ability lies
right now. He's got great length, great body, pretty good timing, and pretty
good understanding. I think defensively is where we won at Baylor. DeAndre was
phenomenal, six blocks. That's where we kind of dictated the game.  
That's what we need him to do tomorrow when he gets in there. Offensively it's
never been easy for him. A lot of points he got this year were on dunks or he
had angles and things, so he continues to improve. He's got to get a lot
better at that end of the floor, and it's just going to take time. Whether
it's a year from now, two years, four years, I don't know. But right now he
has a chance with his ability that you are talking about to affect games more
defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about DeAndre's role tomorrow, might be a little more
than what it was yesterday with the big, physical game expected?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. We need him to play well. He went in against Kansas and
couldn't play in that game; they went right at him and got three quick fouls.
So we need him to play well. We need him to play with confidence. We need his
length.  
We need Junior Chinemelu to play well too. It's going to be a war out there,
be very physical. They're great on the boards, but we're going to need all
four of those post guys to play well tomorrow, so hopefully they'll be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, wanted to ask you, DeAndre just a few minutes last night, was he
feeling okay?  
COACH TURGEON: He was fine. They played a small line-up, so we played Beau at
the four. I thought Junior did a great job on Plaisted when he was in there.
You know, I just thought he was more physical when he was out there, so I just
went with that line-up. That's the line-up that played well in Kansas City,
and it played well last night. And, you know, if DeAndre goes in there and
plays well, he is going to play more.  
But we're just trying to win as many games as we can here.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk a little bit about Kevin Love and what really
impresses you?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, you just got to love watching him play. A big kid like
that moves so well and knows how to play. He's got the full package. He's
become -- I just watched film from earlier in the year till now how much
better a defender he's become throughout the year. He can shoot the three, he
can post up, he can pass it, he can dribble it, he's a great screener, great
offensive rebounder. He does it all. He's good.  
Probably the thing he does the best is his outlet passes. Have you guys seen
these things he throws? You haven't seen that in years. So got to try to slow
that down somehow, because that leads to their break. So he's really good.
It's a tough match-up for us.  
And what makes him even better is they put him and Collison together on those
ball screens. You got a heck of a point guard and a heck of a big guy that can
shoot it or roll to the basket, so makes it very difficult. I think they
compliment each other and make each other look pretty good out there on the
floor.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about kind of what
Joe Jones and Kirk have given you in terms of leadership and even playing
ability. I know for both of those guys at times it's been a little bit up-and-
down this year. But later on, I mean, it seem like they really came through.  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it's a long season, and you are going to have ups and
downs. But they've been great, I think, all year. You've heard me say early in
the year this is a very immature team. We're still immature. We just hide it a
little bit better, so it was hard for them to lead this team, just like at
times it's been very hard for me to coach this team.  
But they just stuck with it and stuck with it and stuck with it and continued
to lead, and I think Beau coming to the forefront here, too, being a senior,
he has kind of stepped in there and helped them with some things. But Joe's
been great all year.  
It's not easy to lead your peers. He's been great. I think Dominic does it by
example, brings it every day, so they've been great. And they've had an
unbelievable career to this point, and, you know, last night made me think
about the K-State game, the big rebounds that Joe had and the big shots
Dominic had, then last night the big rebounds that Joe had and the big shots
that Dominic made. They've been there.  
You can tell the veterans last night, Sloan, Carter, those two guys. Those
guys were really making the plays. They've been here and done it before, but
those two have been great all year. I wish I could coach Joe Jones and Dominic
Kirk the rest of my life, then I'd be a happy coach, because they're fun to
coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you're able to get Josh Carter a lot of open looks last night. How
much tougher is it going to be against UCLA to get those same kind of looks?  
COACH TURGEON: He's not going to get those looks tomorrow. They're going
double the post; that's what they do. If we can handle that, we might sneak
one out for him. Might sneak some out in transition; you never know. He might
get some, but he won't get as many open looks as he had last night.  
We had them doubling the post early. We know UCLA is going to double us, too;
they just do it a little better than BYU. Something they do every day, and
they're very physical with it. We might sneak out a few shots, but they got
the PAC-10 player of the year that's going be in most of the night, so some
other guys are going to have to step up.  
  
Q. I know you guys are thinking about tomorrow, but he's got a lot of people
whispering in his ear, it sounds like, about the NBA. I am just wondering what
you make of that, thinking he needs two or three more years to develop?  
COACH TURGEON: I didn't say that. I didn't say he needs two or three more
years. Where is he from?  
  
Q. Riverside Press-Enterprise.  
COACH TURGEON: Here in California?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH TURGEON: I can't control any of that stuff. I can't control any of that
stuff. I just got to coach this team. That's what I'm trying to do. People
been on my ass all year about coaching, and I think I've done a pretty good
job. I'm trying to coach this team the way I can help us be successful.  
But, you know, I do think that he's got a ways to go in a lot of areas, but
he's come a long ways this year. So when I say two or three years away, you
know, what are you talking about? Talking about college or pro? But, I mean,
everybody gets better as they get older. He is 19 years old.  
  
Q. Along those lines, the players were talking about how pumped up they were
when they saw the draw and the potential second round match-up. I know you
were probably pumped up, as well at the opportunity. What does this mean to
you and trying to get this game and get this win for this program?  
COACH TURGEON: I wasn't quite as pumped up when this draw came, but our guys
were excited. I think maybe it was the west coast. I'm not sure they knew how
good BYU was going to be, and I did. So that's why I wasn't excited. Then
having to play UCLA in their backyard, this might be their best team. They've
had two Final Four teams, and this might be their best team.  
We're looking at it as a great opportunity. We played the number one seed last
week on their home court and did pretty well. I think we're a better team
today than we were last Saturday, and we'll see. Obviously we're going to have
to figure out a way to score baskets to stay in the game. If we can do that,
we'll give ourselves a chance.  
You just want to have a chance the last ten minutes of the game. You know, I
don't think about stuff like, you know -- I'll think about that after the
game. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to guard UCLA and the best
way to try to attack their defense. That's all that consumes me, especially as
good as they are and as well coached as they are; it should consume you.  
Then if we're lucky enough to pull something off then you think about what
it's going to do for your program. It's a long ways between now and that
happening. We're going to have to play one of our probably play our best game
of the year for it to happen.  
  
Q. I guess physically Joe is best equipped to bang down low with Love. When
he steps out to shoot threes, are you confident he can get out there and stay
with him when he steps outside?  
COACH TURGEON: We'll throw a lot of different guys at Love tomorrow, and all
our guys have gotten better about guarding the perimeter. I think it's been
pretty obvious. Something that kind of hit us between the eyes at Texas Tech,
and we've really worked hard at it. We did an unbelievable job on Tavernari
last night. He got a drive for a layup late, and actually Dominique was
guarding him when he hit a three, so I'm confident, you know, but the hard
thing is you got Collison coming off ball screens and then him popping, so
that makes it pretty tough.  
So you got to figure out a way to guard both in that situation. But, no, I'm
confident that our guys will be close enough to him to, you know, hopefully
play his shot on certain situations, and hopefully we'll be physical enough to
keep him off the glass.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about both teams being really good on defense. Is that
the kind of game that you want? Like a game, the first one to 50 wins or the
first one to 60 wins, because that was the score last year. Both teams were
still known for their defense.  
COACH TURGEON: I think that's what it's going to have to be for us. I mean,
we're not going to go out there and score 80. We haven't scored 80 in a long
time. And so it might be the first team to 50 wins tomorrow. Yeah, we're going
to have to make it that kind of game.  
In this building with their fans, we can't get into an up-tempo game. We got
to run when we have chances and take advantage of certain situations, but
besides that we're really going to have to execute and try to take care of the
ball best we can and just guard them. And put together a game plan that we
think is going to work and try to execute it and see what happens.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier that people have been on you all year about your
coaching. Do you sense that regularly and do you still feel like you have
something to prove to people?  
COACH TURGEON: When they're on me, I don't have anything to prove. I know I
can coach a little bit; might not be the greatest coach in the world. Don't
ever claim to be, but I'm really proud of what we've done here this first
year.  
Losing the players that we lost, new coach, the league being as good as it is,
and so, you know, and taking over, just all of us getting used to each other.  
But I just think that, you know, when we started to lose, I just thought it
was a little bit too much coming after me, but that's fine; that's part of the
business. That's why they pay us so much money. You gotta quit being so
sensitive.  
  
Q. What did you feel like?  
COACH TURGEON: I just felt like it was -- I don't read anything, so I don't
know and I don't listen to anything. But I just felt like -- I can hear it.
You can tell. You can tell.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Jerel, this is for you. Could you talk about your commitment to defense.
And I understand you sort of take it upon yourself to get people going and to
make sure you're playing hard and trying to shut them down on the defensive
end. Where did that come from? Is that the way you look at your role or at
least part of your role?  
JEREL McNEAL: I mean, most importantly I think it's just the biggest key for
us to win games. We're a defensive-minded team. If we're not putting pressure
on them and trying to turn them over and getting big stops down the stretch
and things like that, we're not a very good team.  
We're not a team that's going to come out and outscore anybody 100 to 90. That
is not the type of team we are, so I do take it upon myself to come out and
just make sure everybody's locked in defensively and doing the right thing so
we can come out and get stops then start running our fast-break and try to get
easy baskets.  
  
Q. Dominic, how important would you say guard play will be tomorrow?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Very important for us especially. You know, we've been
combatting other teams' advantage, especially in the post you know with our
guard play. Going down there and compensating for our lack of height. But we
got a guy down low that is really battling.  
Lazar Hayward and Ousmane Barro stepping up and making big plays for us. We
know we're a guard-oriented team, and it's our job, especially on defense, to
help those guys out, and on offense to put them in positions where they can be
successful and score the ball.  
  
Q. Coach Crean put such great emphasis on toughness. Can you talk about how
that carries over on the court, maybe even during practice?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think it's pretty evident. I mean, you can see it every
time we play, every time we step on the court that there's a toughness factor
that all of us, you know, we instill in each other and we bring out in each
other.  
I mean that's the way we play. That's the way this game is played now, with
toughness and intelligence, and that's what we pride ourselves on.  
  
Q. Can you talk little bit about the size that Stanford will present for you
guys tomorrow, how you plan to combat that?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I mean, you know, it's pretty obvious that, you know, they have
two seven-foot brothers. And, you know, those guys work really hard, and they
play hard, but so do we. And we got to do a good job of blocking those guys
out and stopping them from getting easy points, but they also have to guard
us. So, you know, it's just going to come down to who works the hardest, and I
wouldn't choose anybody over Ousmane to go into battle with.  
OUSMANE BARRO: Like Lazar said, its going to be a big challenge for us because
we never played, like, two seven-footers in one game, so it's going to be a
battle down there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask Dominic to follow up on that same theme. Even though
guards don't play seven-footers man-to-man, they affect the game. How do they
affect a guards game and how can you counteract such height and skill in the
paint?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Obviously we want to make this an up-and-down pace game. We
want the tempo to compliment our style of play. Just like they said, they got
to play both ends of the floor, you know, and we know they're going to be
factors on both ends of the floor.  
So combat their size with our athleticism and quickness and things like that.
So we definitely got to execute in that matter. We got our advantages and they
have theirs, but it's going come down to who executes and who exposes each
other's weaknesses from start to finish.  
  
Q. So you want to go back-and-forth tempo?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Most definitely. We want to control the tempo. We don't want it
to be a slowed-down game. We want it to be up and down. We want to expose some
of their weaknesses. We want to have our quickness and our athleticism and use
that in our favor.  
  
Q. Jerel, along that same theme, how do you think that will affect your game
tomorrow, what you can do to combat with -- both when you are playing defense
and they're pounded into the post like that and also on the boards? How do you
think that you will be able to help out there?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think more importantly we just got to come out and play the
way we always play. It's going to be a real big challenge for us, just because
of their height and size, and they have a lot of big guys.  
But we got to come out and battle and try to keep those guys off the boards
and do what we can on our low-post defense. So I think if we keep them from
getting good position and, you know, easy baskets throughout the game, that
we'll be in pretty good shape.  
  
Q. A minute or two ago you were saying that when you were talking about this
challenge of facing the big guys on Stanford that there's no one you would
rather go into it with than Ousmane. Can you describe what it is about him
that makes you feel like he's definitely the guy for the job?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: Well, you know, because I know Ousmane will always give 110%,
and he's going to always play his best. He is very tough. It's evident when
we're playing our games. And the toughness that Ous brings out in me, we play
really well together. When I'm playing really tough he plays well. So, you
know, we bring out the toughness in each other.  
And I think that's what we're going to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ousmane, how will this compare with going up against Roy Hibbert?  
OUSMANE BARRO: I mean, it was tough. He is like 7'2." He is one of the bigs in
the Big East, so it was quite challenging for me, but it was just another
game.  
  
Q. I assume he was matched up against you. What did he do to shut you
down?  
OUSMANE BARRO: Roy Hibbert?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
OUSMANE BARRO: I don't think he shut me down. The main thing was following our
game plan and staying with the game plan. That's real big when we play them
throughout the years, and especially four weeks ago when we played them at
home. We just had to stay with the game plan and tried to execute our game
plans.  
  
Q. Jerel, is there a different mindset that goes into playing the first
game, being the favorite or a lower seed at least, and the second game? You
know, now you are playing probably a favorite or at least a lower seed in
Stanford.  
JEREL McNEAL: Nope.  
I think the most important thing that you got to remember once you get to this
time of year is that, you know, there's a field of 65 teams. Everybody earned
their way in here. There's no easy games. I mean, you look at some of the
scores around the country you see that. There ain't no easy wins at this time
of year.  
We didn't look at ourselves as a favorite against Kentucky. We won't look at
it as being the underdog in this game. You got to come out and do what you do.
That's the most important thing. You got to come out and be the team that you
are and play the way you have been playing all year that got you to this
point. If you do that, you can't ask for much more. You toss the ball up and
see what happens. That's what's going to happen tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, gentlemen.  
Coach, the floor is yours.  
COACH CREAN: First off, we know it's going to be a monumental challenge to
match-up with Stanford on size alone, because not only do they have the Lopez
twins who are just dynamite and play so well together, but they have numerous
other players that make plays and make contributions. They have their
starters, they have outstanding depth. They know exactly what they want the
do. They're very -- they're creative offensively but also very disciplined in
what they want to do.  
So we've got to make sure that we do not become mesmerized by one or two
people, that we do not stand. We've got to have great weak-side defense. We've
got to have the ability to put pressure on the ball.  
You know, I don't know what the pace of the game is going to be, but we have
to be able to play inside of it, whatever it is. And our guys are very, very
excited. I mean, very respectful, and the films that we've watched I think we
have a great understanding of just how good the PAC-10 is when you watch
Stanford play UCLA or watch Stanford play USC or Arizona, and we feel like our
preparation of being in the Big East has been very good for us to come out
here and have an opportunity to play a game like this and compete at a high
level.  
  
Q. Tom, for guys who haven't seen you play a lot, how have you done in
match-ups when you have been in a disadvantage like this in size?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we've played against some really, really good big people in
the Big East. I mean Luke Harangody as a center was the player of the league
in our -- of the year in our league. We've play against different combinations
-- Rob Kurz is a really good player at Notre Dame. We never played against a
team that would have two seven-footers like that. We've had our times that
we've been very good.  
When we've been disciplined with our schemes when our ball pressure has been
good, when we understood what we wanted to do down into the post, we've been
good. When we've been a step slow or our ball pressure hasn't been as good or
we've allowed weak-side rebounding to become a big factor in the game, we
haven't been as successful.  
That's probably one of the biggest problems we had when we played UCONN. We
challenged Hasheem to beat us, and weren't too good on the weak-side board. We
had our moments against Roy Hibbert a couple weeks ago. We had 21 points, but
I thought he had to earn every one of those points, and he is an outstanding
center. Again, we've had our successes, we've had our minuses, but we've had a
lot of experience.  
  
Q. Just to put you back on that question. You place such a premium on
toughness going against two seven-footers. How do you expect that to manifest
itself in toughness, even more important in a game like this?  
COACH CREAN: I think the mental toughness is certainly going to be equal to
the physical toughness that you have to have, because we've got to be able to
play possession-by-possession. You've got to be able to talk pass-after-pass.
You've got to be able to, you know, close out, get down into the post, get
into a weak-side rebounding stance, all those different things that go into
it.  
You know, there's a huge physical element to that, but there's an even greater
mental element to that. I think when you play in a league like the Big East or
the PAC-10 you become used to that. And so, you know, I'm excited about our
team. I know they're confident and excited to play, and, I mean, they're
looking forward to the challenge.  
I mean, we know it's going to be a huge challenge, and it's far more than just
the Lopez twins because of what they do on the perimeter, how tough their
guards are. I don't know Trent very well, but I would venture to say he puts a
pretty strong premium on toughness, and they really appear that way when you
watch them on tape and even in yesterday's game.  
  
Q. Tom, Barro, when he was in high school and he was recruited, he wasn't
playing for his high school team. Can you describe a little bit about how you
guys caught on to him? What impressed you about him and where you were able to
make a connection and see him and evaluate him?  
COACH CREAN: Sure. Actually he never played a high school game. He never
played in any organized basketball competition. He did some men's league
things, I think, when he was in high school, but I got to know him through the
gentleman that brought him to the States, Loren Jackson, who was the coach at
Julian high school at the time and just had an opportunity over a couple years
to watch him grow and develop and watch Loren just do a fantastic job with
him.  
I mean, he treated him like he was as good as any player in the country, and
he never played a game for him. Whether it was 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning
workouts, whether it was practice-after-practice, you know, after school, you
know, I mean the team would practice, then he would do more work. And every
chance we had to see him, we just saw that spirit. He was a hungry, hungry
learner.  
And there was no doubt in my mind that with his personality, with his
attitude, with his work ethic that we were going to try to sign him if we
could. And I think it pretty much got down to Louisville and ourselves, and
Louisville took Brian Johnson. I very much think he could have ended up at
Louisville if they hadn't signed Brian Johnson.  
We were able to get him, and he's been a starter. He started a couple games as
a freshman and has pretty much been a mainstay in our line-up for the last
three years.  
  
Q. He said that he had been a soccer player in Africa and that when he
arrived in Chicago that was the very first time that he was introduced to
basketball. I mean, did he look like a guy who had only been playing the game
for a very, very short time when you were evaluating him?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, no question. When you looked at him, you looked at him in
just size an upside. You certainly didn't look at him in skill value at that
point, but he was always a little bit better every time we saw him. And our
looks are somewhat limited unless it's the summertime. So when you would see
him, and you might see him a month later, you might see him two months later,
there was always something he had added to his game.  
He had a real eagerness to learn. And the other thing that was impressive is
how his body was changing, because he was finally lifting weights and things
of that nature. But he's had a real interesting upbringing, and he's been a
joy to have in our program. And what's even more amazing based on, you know,
what he didn't have as far as background academically, he's going to graduate
on time in May. And that's really, at the end of the day, will be the most
special thing, because we know where he was and his background versus where he
is right now. So he's grown in every area at Marquette.  
  
Q. Tom, let's say you are able to mute Brook Lopez inside. What scares you
most then about Stanford?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think they know how to win. I mean, they're not going to
beat themselves. I know that's one of those old coaching, you know, sayings.
But they're just too good. They make the next pass. They cover the boards
extremely well. They can make open shots. I think when Taj Finger is in the
game he is as dangerous as anybody. He plays so hard. He makes things happen.
You know, he is always in perpetual motion. I don't think there's any one
thing that you can look at and say, okay this has to be done for us to win. I
think its more than that.  
And I think we're going to have to be solid, more than solid in a lot of
areas. Weak-side rebounding, our ball pressure, how we play the post, our
transition defense, you know, really. But, again, when you come out of the Big
East, it's not like you go into the Big East and think, okay, we're going to
win this game this way, or we're going to do these two things and we can win.  
You know, you have to be really strong and you have to be very much in a
possession-by-possession mentality to win. From what I see, I think the PAC-10
is exactly the same way.  
  
Q. Tom, you guys -- when people play you, you know they're going to face a
good defensive team and a team that's tough. How much of that is because of
McNeal, as far as him setting an example? And, also, I saw he was defensive
player of the year in your league last year. Did he slip this year, or is that
just one of those things?  
COACH CREAN: That was two words, Hasheem Thabeet. He was one of only four -- I
think I could be wrong on this statistic, but one of four nonbigs to win that
award. I could be wrong. I know John Linehan won it and Allen Iverson as a
sophomore. He didn't slip. Hasheem Thabeet changed everything in the lane, and
rightfully so. On our team Jerel does a great job defensively, and so does
Dominic James. Dominic can guard the dribble. He is outstanding. Wesley has
improved tremendously on defense. He can put pressure on the ball.  
Our big guys have steadily improved. We're not great up front and we're going
to have to have great team defense to be successful tomorrow, but they've all
improved. Jerel has not slipped. He's only gotten better. And one area he's
really gotten better is off the ball.  
  
Q. I understand Dominic's been a little bumped up this season, little
injuries here and there. How important has he been to this team and that he
has gotten through these things and stayed on the floor through this time?  
COACH CREAN: He's shown great mental toughness throughout the year. The injury
he sustained in the Seton Hall game back in January was needless; it hurt his
wrists. He played with that for well over a month, and it was tough to do that
because he was having such a great year.  
But what he did is he never complained; he dealt with it. He never tried to
get out of practices. I mean, I was very conscious of his minutes and very
conscious of the contact at times. He didn't like that. He wanted to be in the
action, never missed games because of that.  
And then he had an ankle injury, he got the flu before the Louisville game. It
wasn't till 4:00 that afternoon for a 6:00 game that we knew we were going to
have him. I didn't start him in that game, and it was never the same. Our team
has relied on him for a lot of things; The number one thing is his spirit.  
And he's got a great spirit. An outstanding toughness, and you see him you can
see the physical strength. He's got very good mental toughness, and when he's
been at his best is when we've been at our best.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up with a statement from Coach Howland, then open
it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach Howland, the floor is yours.  
COACH HOWLAND: We really played good defense tonight, obviously. Real pleased
with the defense. We had 13 blocked shots; that's a lot of blocked shots. I
think when you look at that right now, James had 4, Kevin had 4, Lorenzo had a
couple. But more than anything, I'm just pleased with the way that they shot
from the field. Shows that we played really hard.  
I thought that our players who came off the bench did a good job and gave us
good minutes.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Kevin, tell us about your adventure there at the start of the second
half, getting that ball down so the game could go on.  
KEVIN LOVE: The guy shot it, and it actually got stuck up there. That actually
happened yesterday in the shoot-around. I don't know if you guys could be
around even to see that, but we had to knock the ball out of there. The ref
just told me he couldn't do it, and I knocked it out. And he told me
afterwards I showed him up. I said, you know what, I had to get the ball down
somehow.  
  
Q. Kevin, didn't seem like the back was bothering you very much.  
KEVIN LOVE: No. I actually got treatment ever since the game was done on
Saturday against Stanford. And since then, just been working on it. For the
first 30 to 45 minutes, I'd be standing up, and my back would start spasming a
little bit more, but I just got some treatment. And also, you know, did a lot
of sleeping and a lot of stuff like that, just to rest my back.  
But today, it was fine. Had to get a little more loose than usual, but just
played through it, and only had to play 21 minutes today. Hope Friday that
will help me in the long run.  
  
Q. Just follow up on the back. Are you going to continue this treatment for
the foreseeable future?  
KEVIN LOVE: Just as a preventative measure. That's probably it. As of right
now, it feels fine. Feels 95, 100% I'm just going to keep it going from here
on out.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, can you take this one. Did you guys feel a little bit like you
were playing your younger brothers or kind of the boys in the school yard
against the little kids with all those blocks?  
LORENZO MATA-REAL: No. I mean, we just come out and played hard no matter who
we're playing. We don't take nobody lightly. No matter who we're playing, we
just come out and play the way we do all the time. Our defense dictates what
we do. And I feel like, I mean, we played great defense today.  
  
Q. Kevin, what do you guys know about Texas A &M Saturday?   
KEVIN LOVE: Coach Howland mentioned they're a very physical team. They have a
good friend of mine, DeAndre Jordan, on their team, who is seven foot. He's
got a real long wingspan. Their whole team's long. I think he mentioned nobody
on their team is below 6'3", so we're going to have to come out and offensive
rebound.  
Those are things we gave up a lot today in the first half. I think through the
first four or five minutes, we had already given up four or six offensive
rebounds. We're going have to get on the boards with them because it's going
to be a real physical battle.  
  
Q. Kevin, back in November, you talked about getting to this point in the
season. What was it like in your first NCAA appearance?  
KEVIN LOVE: It was a lot of fun. My teammates and coaches made it fun for me,
as well. We had mentioned a bunch of times throughout the week that a 16 seed
has never beat a 1 seed, and we didn't want to be the first one.  
So we had to come out and jump on them as much as possible. I felt like we did
that. Coach Howland also mentioned in the post-game talk that not a team since
1949 hasn't scored that many points, 29 points, so we did a great job on the
defensive end.  
COACH HOWLAND: I think.  
  
Q. You were the Defensive Player of the Year in the PAC-10 this year,
Russell. And seemed like you had a lot of help out there today. I think you
guys had a season-high in blocks with 13. Could you just comment on the team
performance defensively.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: We came out great on defense. We held them to the season
low, or whatever, 29 points. It think we did a great job of helping, you know,
doubling the post and rotating the defensive end.  
  
Q. Kevin, did you guys almost feel bad for them a little bit toward the end
of the game?  
KEVIN LOVE: No mercy. That's all I can really say. No mercy out there. We
didn't feel too bad for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Good luck on Saturday.  
COACH HOWLAND: In reference to that, Stanford Speech came up with me with
about seven minutes to go, and he said, "Coach, I hope you guys win the whole
thing," and that was really classy of him to do that in the middle of the
game.  
So they have a bunch of really good kids. They work very hard. A school that
is 3,000 people, and those kids are all really good kids. I don't know if you
saw one of their kids after the game was crying his eyes out. I mean, it's
their last game as a senior. So I would never make light of, or make fun of
someone in that way. I think that's, you know, being rude.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the, I don't know if you want to call it emergence,
but make something positive out of a possible negative, the emergence, what it
seems, of James Keefe. Again, it seems solid minutes there. Do you think you
may have gotten some benefit from the Luc injury and forcing James to have
more minutes now?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, it gave him an opportunity, obviously, to play more
minutes with Luc's injury, starting with the SC game, as well as the
championship game against Stanford. Again, he came out and played very well. I
think he is gaining a lot of confidence.  
Remember, he came into this season off a shoulder surgery, so he didn't even
get to start practicing with contact, I don't think, until sometime in the
middle of November or maybe even December. I can't remember. But he wasn't
even able to be cleared for playing until sometime in mid-December. I think
originally, we talked about him playing against Idaho State, and I'm just
really thankful that we didn't red-shirt him. Obviously he's been a huge
difference-maker, and he's coming on right now. I'm really happy for James. He
had seven rebounds and four blocks today.  
So I thought we did a lot of good things rebounding-wise, though. Alfred had
six rebounds in his minutes. James had seven. Kevin had nine in 21 minutes. So
all three of those guys did a very, very good job attacking the glass. And
Lorenzo had nine rebounds. So it was spread around pretty good.  
  
Q. But when you are back at full strength, which I guess you're hoping for
Saturday. Or at least the next week, assuming you win --  
COACH HOWLAND: In reference to your question, I think is that Luc will start
on Saturday, for sure. I initially had planned on doing that. And then as I
thought about it, I felt comfortable that we would be able to probably get
this one without him. I didn't, after giving it more thought. And I think we
had a meeting here yesterday. I honestly had planned to start him today until
late last night when I had given it a lot of thought.  
But, you know, in reference to James, I think his play has earned him more
minutes and more potential to play as we move forward into Saturday's game.
And we're going to need him.  
These guys from Texas A&M, that was the most physical game we played in the
last year here in the Wooden, where Jones is just a big, strong kid inside.
Davis is huge. They have a kid with an African name that comes off the bench
now who is an animal. They're just so strong and athletic.  
Obviously, DeAndre Jordan that Kevin alluded to, they have as big a front
line, as athletic a front line as there are in the country. Then their wings
are 6'5" and 6'6." They really shot, especially Carter. So we have our hands
full and we're going to need all.  
  
Q. To get that steal when you were already up 30 --  
COACH HOWLAND: I thought it was a great play. What I always preach to our guys
is, when you don't get on the floor, and you see it happen all the time when
you follow this game, when you don't dive on the floor, that's when you get
your knees taken out and you end up with an ACL, by diving on the floor. He
actually avoided any kind of injury potential, but that was great. He dove. We
got the ball. Then there was a great finish at the other end where I think
there was a pass for a layup. And that was really, really nice teamwork and
good hustle started by Darren's hustle.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH HOWLAND: Thank you.

### [Louis Dale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18237)

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

### [Ryan Wittman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18236)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will open up with a statement from the coach, then questions
for the student-athletes first.  
So, Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH DONAHUE: Obviously played a very good basketball team. I was extremely
impressed with Stanford, and just speaking to a lot of their teams they played
this year, everybody you speak to talked about how disciplined, how hard they
play. I think that's what you saw in the first half. I thought they did a
terrific job. Occasionally you walk into the situation, I was telling the
guys, that you can get a team that doesn't respect you. You know, then we're
dangerous.  
I think the first half they came out and really guarded us, made it tough on
us, and I thought we missed some shots we normally make. But for the most part
Stanford just played a terrific basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Wanted to get your thoughts, if you think that Cornell has faced a team
that defends with as much length as Stanford did today on the perimeter
shots?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Um, you know, probably not. They've got quite a few guys, Fields
and Hill, who are pretty long on the perimeter. So then, you know, they have
the two seven-footers down low. So even if you shot fake and try to drive in
the lane, they can alter shots as well. But, you know, they've great defensive
team, probably one of the best defensive teams we've played all year.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, for either of the student-athletes, if you feel like
you guys would have been a better match-up or had a better chance against a
different type of team? Obviously, your height advantage doesn't play as well
against the Lopez twins and what Stanford brings to the table.  
RYAN WITTMAN: You know, they're obviously a really good team. They do have a
height advantage over pretty much any team in the nation, but I think it was
difficult for us to block out. They're one of the best rebounding teams in the
country. I think it was difficult for us at times. You know, there were a lot
of possessions, especially early in the game where it seems like we played
pretty good defense. Then they get the offensive rebound and put it back in.
But that's how they beat teams.  
  
Q. This is for Louis. How do you put this year in prospective? A lot of you
guys are coming back. And sort of what you were able to do, break Penn and
Princeton's strangle hold on the Ivy League even though it ends like this?  
LOUIS DALE: We had a great season. Something to be proud of. And I think this
game that, you know, we just played today, kind of let's us know that we need
to get better for next year, and that it's still going to be difficult to make
it back here next year. And I think that's what we're going to focus on.  
And, you know, we're going to try to get better each and every day in the off-
season. And hopefully we can improve our season next year.  
  
Q. Can you comment on what Jeff Foote has meant to this team since he came
on board in December?  
LOUIS DALE: He's meant a lot to our team. He's a great defensive presence back
there, especially in the Ivy League. And he's a great offensive rebounder and
scorer. So, you know, this year he's helped us out tremendously, being a shot-
blocker and someone who you can pass into the post and who can score and can
also find open teammates. I think he's made us a tremendous team this year.
And, you know, we look forward to the future.  
  
Q. Louis, I wanted to ask you, I think you missed your first ten shots. I
might be wrong on that, but, you know, a tough shooting day obviously for the
team. How much of that do you think was Stanford playing tough defense and how
much, if at all, do you think it was being at the NCAA tournament, being on a
higher stage, you know, for the fist time?  
LOUIS DALE: I think they're a good defensive team. They're very physical in
the perimeter. I think that played a part into it, too. And so you had to work
hard to get past the perimeter defenders. And then there's two seven-footers
there waiting to block your shot. So it makes it kind of hard for someone to
just penetrate and, you know, get an open shot. And I think that played into
today's game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes. All right.  
Thank you, gentlemen.  
Now questions for Coach Steve Donahue.  
  
Q. Kenny Brown played four minutes in the PAC-10 championship game against
UCLA. Obviously he was a big factor today. Did you anticipate that? Was there
very much attention paid to him, you know, this week as you were preparing?  
COACH DONAHUE: You almost have to pick your poison here, and my feeling was
that once they saw what we were doing, that they would go to some more
shooters, Fields, you said Brown, also they play Hill, Shiller. I thought they
would do that. We were scraping from the perimeter. We just couldn't afford to
leave another big and double from the post. And I thought we did -- you know,
it's funny. These guys played the game plan. I'm disappointed in the results,
but the game plan, and someone mentioned the stage here having an affect on
them, I really don't think that.  
I think Stanford really had -- as I said in my opening comments, they have
respect for you. They play hard, disciplined, and that was the difficult part.
And my feeling was, if they brought in shooters, then our strategy's going to
be really hard at that point. And they made us pay for it.  
  
Q. Steve, you guys played Duke, played Syracuse this year. Did either of
those two games prepare you for the kind of length your guys had to shoot
over?  
COACH DONAHUE: You know what, Brian, it wasn't even the length. I said this to
Coach Johnson. His kids play this style, it's almost a brand, it's Stanford
basketball. No matter who you are going against, they're not going to allow
you to beat you with your better players. They get physical with you.  
Duke is a team, and someone mentioned a match-up. To be honest with you, a
match-up like a Duke would have been better for us. A team that's going to try
to challenge us full court, let us get loose for some shots, make us feel
good. When you got to grind it out in a half court set against a team like
this, that's a difficult match-up for us.  
So this team was way different than those two teams strictly for the defensive
ability. They're disciplined. Besides all the length you are talking about, I
respect that they play us as hard as they did.  
  
Q. Coach Donahue, what was your message for the team during half-time and
even after this game?  
COACH DONAHUE: At half-time, obviously we're in a difficult thick. And I want
to try to win four-minute segments. Let's try to get it down to ten with ten
to go.  
That didn't happen obviously. But I thought if we could make some shots early
in the first half -- second half, excuse me, we came out and ran and executed
a three for Ryan in the corner. I thought if we could start making some shots,
maybe they'll press a little bit. But they didn't do that.  
And towards the end of the game, every timeout, which is obviously very long
in the NCAA tournament when you are down, especially this amount, I just
talked about our pride, and our heart, and so many people that have supported
us, and they expect us to go out and play. And these guys did. They played
their tails off. They did everything I could ask.  
I'm more disappointed in myself that I couldn't come up with another way,
another strategy to help us compete against a team like this.  
But in reality that's a very good team that played very well today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just speak about the crowd. Coming here to California, I
thought myself that we'd be outnumbered, Cornell would be outnumbered, but it
seems as if Cornell was just as loud if not louder than the Stanford fans?  
COACH DONAHUE: It's been an amazing run. And a lot of it has to do with the
people that have supported us. And I've been at these events a lot as a fan
and as a coach at the University of Pennsylvania. Never did I see that kind of
support. I mean, not only did we sell our tickets, but, obviously, there's a
lot of people and alum in the area that came out to support us as well, which
is great. I mean, it's an unbelievable university with great people. Proud
that I coach at an institution like this, and I would have loved them to have
a better effort.  
But I think they understand that this was a very good basketball team that we
faced.  
The other thing I say is, we are very young. All these guys that you saw, six
out of seven are sophomore-eligible. This is their first experience, not only
just for the experience thing, but strength. As we get older and tougher and
bigger, we'll play better next time when we're here, I'm positive of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement from Coach, then open the
questions from student athletes. Coach, when you're ready.  
DAVE ROSE: I thought it was a very competitive game. Both teams playing really
hard, and they got off to a really good start, hit some big shots. But we were
able to fight back and get back into the game, get a lead, and then it came
down to the last couple minutes of the game.  
And they made some big shots and got some big rebounds and, you know, we
competed really hard. Just felt like they made a few more plays than we did.  
  
Q. Is that the reason for the start for you guys, 0 for 8, then 2 for 12?
Was it nerves, what they were doing on defense, or why you guys came out so
cold to start the game?  
LEE CUMMARD: We didn't start the game with a lot of energy, playing flat, and
we were rushing shots and not taking shots that we normally take.  
  
Q. The big guys' free-throw shooting, I guess, has been a problem most of
the season, and tonight the three, you were 3 for 10. Is it physical? Is it
mental?  
TRENT PLAISTED: All mental. It's all mental. All of us have good strokes.
We're good shooters; we knock them down in practice. We practice it all the
time. Today just didn't work out for us.  
  
Q. Trent, can you describe -- a big issue obviously in the game was Texas A
&M's inside presence. Can you describe what it was like to play against those
guys and trying to rebound against them?   
TRENT PLAISTED: You know they're really big bodies, and they use their
physicality to their advantage, and they're hard to guard. You know, they had
that cross-screen going and it's hard to keep good position on them when they
get that cross-screen. But credit those guys, they gave great efforts to the
ball and they were able to pull down some big rebounds. And like I said,
they're very big, physical post players.  
  
Q. Lee, you missed that one three, I think it was three or four minutes to
go in the game. Did you have another shot on that? And how were they guarding
you?  
LEE CUMMARD: Just matching up. Kirk was guarding me, really falling out and
trying to stay with me. He is a great defender, and credit to Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Jonathan, defensively it seemed like you guarded a variety of players who
could do a variety of things. What were issues with match-ups you guys had?  
JONATHAN TAVERNARI: Well they just, you know, they're pretty good players. I
mean. They scored inside. Like Lee and Coach Rose said, you got to give them
credit. I mean, they got the ball in spots where, you know, they're pretty
hard to guard. You know, inside, outside, I mean, once you get beaten baseline
in the middle, pretty much in a help situation. So they're good players, I
mean, they're one of the best teams in the Big 12.  
They knock down shots. You got to give them all the credit in the world.  
  
Q. Lee, you guys were trying to break through for that win. It's been a long
time for BYU. What's it going to take for you guys to break through and get a
first-round win?  
LEE CUMMARD: We're going have to do a better job of defending the shot. 54%,
that's not going to get it done. Rebounding, we got out-rebounded by 12.
That's not going to get it done. And shooting 44% is not going to get it done.
So back to the drawing board. Got to compete. A little more sense of urgency
at the start of the game, and credit to Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Jonathan, after you guys wipe out that 11-point deficit and it's tied
going into halftime, did you feel like the momentum was going your way? What
was the sense in the locker room?  
JONATHAN TAVERNARI: We had a chance to win the game throughout, you know,
throughout the whole thing. I mean, it just came down to they made more plays
than we did. Like I said, they're great basketball players. We had a chance to
make plays. A bounce or two that went the other way, I mean, some shots that
went in and out and some rebounds that got tipped up, and we had the chance
to, you know, rebound, but we didn't.  
I mean, could have gone either way. But they're great ball club and, you know,
how we came out in the second half and matched up -- pretty much the second
half was pretty much back and forth, and we were just a couple plays short
this game.  
  
Q. Obviously, all of you guys get the chance to come back if you so wish.
What do you say to the two seniors as they're outgoing?  
TRENT PLAISTED: About our two seniors, you know, we love those guys. We feel
really bad for them. It's heart-breaking to end your career on a loss, but a
lot of people do it. And we wanted to get over that hump and get a few wins in
a tournament. But these guys are great people, and they're going to, you know,
be part of BYU basketball forever.  
They got a banner, a couple banners hung in the Marriott Center, and they'll
always be able to come back and be proud of what they accomplished. We love
those guys to death, and we hope they come back and stay a part of this thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for student-athletes? All right. Thank
you, gentlemen.  
We'll now open up to questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Dave, could you talk a little bit about Jimmer and the effort that he put
in this first tournament game?  
DAVE ROSE: You know, I thought that Jimmer played with a lot of confidence,
and that was a good sign. Ben has had that ankle issue for the last couple
weeks and slowed him down just a little bit. Jimmer's got a lot of minutes in
practice at the point guard, and I thought he played very well in the
championship game of the Mountain West Conference tournament.  
When he came in tonight, he just came in with a lot of confidence. We were
kind of stuck. We hadn't scored for a while, and, you know, we were looking
for a little bit of lift. And I thought Jimmer did a good job of providing
that for us.  
  
Q. Is there anything that you've done during the season to work with the
guys on the struggle with free-throw shooting? Like Trent was saying, you
know, it's mental. Has there been anything?  
DAVE ROSE: We spent a lot of time with all our players. And I think that, you
know, we have had -- those same players tonight that maybe struggled a little
bit have won games for us down the stretch and helped us win, you know, our
second straight Mountain West Conference regular season championship, so it's
a situation where we need to be a little more consistent. We're very capable.  
I think that, you know, a lot more work and time and we can address that issue
of being more consistent.  
  
Q. Coach, down the stretch I know you worried a little bit about the
offensive rebounding. Seemed like in the last few minutes they ended up
getting a few extra shots. I think that was one of the keys down the stretch
of the game is the extra shots they got?  
DAVE ROSE: We did a pretty good job on the boards for the most part. I mean,
they didn't end up with some numbers like they have, 18, 19, 21 offensive
rebounds; they've had that in other games, but they got critical second shots
that really helped them, especially in that last three or four-minute period
when the game was right there on the line for either team.  
And it's, I mean, they're big, physical players, and at critical times they
made critical plays. But that's, you know, that's why they're -- they got 24,
25 wins, because that's how they win, and they did a good job with that.  
  
Q. Josh Carter is a pretty streaky outside shooter. How disappointed were
you to see him get those open looks early and get his team going?  
DAVE ROSE: We were slow, but he was quick to start the game, had a little bit
of space. When he hit that first one, you knew that it was going to be a real
challenge, because he's long and he does a good job of creating space for
himself. They screen really well. Those big post players screen you really
hard.  
And when you get knocked, when you are chasing a guy off a screen and you get
kind of hit -- the first part of the game we were getting hung up, and that
was just giving them that extra time that he needed to get that shot off. Then
he had -- hit his first two or three. He had a lot of confidence.  
Then he hit late in the first half we did a pretty good job of guarding it.
That was just a big shot. Then he hit that first one in the second half, then
we did some different things. Sam got on him and just tried to not let him
gets as many catches. And we controlled him a little bit better.  
But it caused problems for us with dribble penetration because we didn't have
as much help as we would normally have. And they're a tough match-up, tough to
cover.  
  
Q. Dave, can you describe -- you called a time-out early in the first half.
You go to the TV time-out, and you still haven't scored. How did you get the
guys to settle down, or how did you fire them up, or what are the huddles like
during that point?  
DAVE ROSE: No, I think that there are times when we called early time-outs and
really try to jump on your guys and try to get them going. That wasn't the
issue tonight. Tonight it was to try to get them in a situation where we -- we
were in a hurry. We took shots that, like Lee mentioned, maybe aren't what we
normally do. And we were just trying to kind of get our arms around them and
just get us into what we like to do. And when we did, that I thought we gained
our composure, and got ourselves back in the game.  
And that gave us a lot of confidence to continue to play in the situation
where -- last couple minutes we had that game in a position where we could win
if we had made a few more plays.  
  
Q. Dave, how much was their perimeter defense a factor in your struggles
from out there tonight?  
DAVE ROSE: Well, they were right to us on most of our catches. And it's a
credit to Mark and his staff. They did a great job of, you know, getting their
players in a position to contest us on a catch.  
And the strength of our team is that we usually most of our field goals are
assisted field goals. And we're not a team that dribbles in the shots and
creates shots for ourselves. We've got some players who have gotten better at
that, and really Jimmer has done a good job of creating shots for others and
for himself.  
But I thought that tonight, most of the time when we came off screens to get a
shot, there was somebody right there. And that's a credit to their staff and
to their players.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of reflect on your thoughts on the season as a whole
and then looking forward to the future as far as next year?  
DAVE ROSE: Well, you know, I spent some -- quite a bit of time with our team
in the locker room afterwards. And that is kind of what we talked about, was
the great things that this team has done this year. It's not going to make
anybody feel much better right now, but I wanted those guys to leave the
locker room just knowing how -- you know, how proud our staff is of what
they've accomplished.  
And won a lot of games, won them back-to-back, the Mountain West Conference
regular season championship. We beat a team ranked in the top ten for the
first time in a long while. We've got a nice home-court winning streak going.
There's a lot of good things that are going on with BYU basketball. Those are
some of the things we tried to reflect on in the locker room.  
  
Q. To kind of follow up on that, Trent said before the game that he felt
like it would take a win to separate this season from last season. Do you feel
that way, or is the season also a step in the right direction?  
DAVE ROSE: One of the guys said we're going to hang a banner in that arena,
and there's a lot of teams that are going to get beat in this tournament at
some time, and they're not hanging banners in their arenas.  
And to win a championship is quite an accomplishment. And so to separate one
season from the next, when you win a championship and you have an opportunity
to have your players wear a ring around for the rest of their life that says
they're champions, to hang a banner in your arena that says they're champions,
that's a special season.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much, coach.  
DAVE ROSE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a two-minute statement from the head coach,
then we'll open the floor to questions for the student-athletes. Coach, go
ahead.  
COACH CREAN: First and foremost, another Marquette/Kentucky game with two
teams that respect each other, two coaching staffs that respect each other,
and a group of players on both sides of the fence that have ability,
toughness, passion, and endurance.  
And it was one of those games. Again, I'm proud of these guys to my left. I'm
proud of the team that's in the locker room because they came in, and they
just put everything on playing the right way. And we knew we had to defend at
a high-level especially with the shot clock.  
We knew Joe Crawford and Ramel Bradley were outstanding players, and they did
nothing to change that opinion today only make it grow, but our guys were up
to the challenge. We never wilted. We never got that big put-away we were
looking for because Kentucky kept coming back, but we stepped up and made the
plays that we had to make, and that's what you have to do at this time of
year.  
The rebounding game was going to be huge. We were able to win that. We didn't
turn the ball over very much. You cannot do that this time of year. Your best
players got to step up and make plays, which they did. And people have to come
off the bench and really contribute, like Dwight Burke did, like Cubillan did,
like Dan Fitzgerald and Maurice Acker did. Proud of our team, and we're
excited to see who we play next.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Wesley, after what you guys have gone through last couple years in the
tournament, was there any chance you were going to miss any of those free
throws there?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: No. I mean it was just a matter of going up there and making
them. I mean, they're shots that we take all the time, shots that we practice,
shots that you been taking since you started playing this game. You know, it's
easy to make them when your whole team and coaching staff has confidence in
you.  
Coach is drawing up the play to give me the ball in that position, and I just
did my job and made them.  
  
Q. A question for Dominic: Your coach mentioned mutual respect. Can you tell
us why you went over to the Kentucky bench at the end of the game and spoke to
their guard when he fouled out?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Well, you know, that's what competition's all about, two
competitors. I know that's one thing that our coach instills in us. He's a
competitor himself. And, you know, as hard as we work out there on the floor,
you know, the game was pretty much over and he played a heck of a ball game.
35 points. I mean, you saw the performance out there, and he put his heart out
there on the floor.  
So out of respect for him and his teammates, you know, I just told him to keep
his head up and keep playing the game that he loves.  
  
Q. This question is for Jerel. Given the way that you guys got this done and
how you've gotten it done the previous couple years, do you think that this
team has more grit than in the previous couple years?  
JEREL McNEAL: I definitely believe we do. I think we just -- we've grown so
much just since my first year here. The past three years we've been in the
same situation, but we came out today and we put 40 minutes together. You
know, we had spurts through those 40 minutes that weren't always, you know,
the best Marquette team that we could put out there, but the most important
thing, we just stayed with it. Nobody dropped their heads.  
We just persevered through all the tough times and making shots. I'm just
proud of all my teammates, all those guys in the locker room, because I feel
like this is a team that wouldn't have won this game two years ago.  
  
Q. What is different about it? What do you think teams from the past would
have done in the face of the Kentucky rush that you guys didn't do this
time?  
JEREL McNEAL: We would have fell apart. Guys would have stopped talking. You
know, I mean, guys would have started hanging their heads a little bit,
getting a little bit tight, which we didn't do at all. All these guys made big
plays. We just kept pushing through, man, just unbelievable feeling just to
come out and just know that you got guys on the court with you that's going to
make big plays and not give up and keep pushing through everything.  
COACH CREAN: Let me add one thing I think is important that I think has been
totally forgotten in this week. When we came out to California three seasons
ago, these three were freshmen and played and started -- with exception of
when Wes got injured, played and started in every game as freshmen.  
We had Steve Novak as a senior. We had some other Young men, but we started a
senior, sophomore and three freshmen. Last year we played in this tournament
and we weren't nearly at full strength. You're just getting an idea of how
good Jerel McNeal is if you haven't seen us play all year.  
What you see from Dominic and Wesley is what we see every day, consistency of
effort, consistency of purpose. So, you know, this team's been in the NCAA
tournament for three years, but we've never -- we were young. I mean, they're
growing up, they're mature. They understand how to win. They understand how to
do things and they understand how to correct themselves, and I think that's
very, very important. And I think that has a lot to do with why we were able
to be successful today.  
  
Q. This is for Wesley. You said recently that even though the team hadn't --
you know, has had a lot of success in the regular season since you've been
there that it was fair to measure you on the post-season results.  
Can you elaborate on that and also how this feels now to kind of get over that
hump?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: It feels great. I mean, to -- finally after being here for
three years to finally come out and get a win. I mean, when you put so much
effort and work into the off-season and the pre-season and post-season and,
you know, during the season leading up to this point, it's just a great
feeling to finally come together as a team, as a mature team and pull out a
victory, especially against a team like Kentucky.  
What was the rest of that question?  
  
Q. Just about how teams are -- you know, it's fair to measure you on how you
do in the post-season.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I mean that's just how it is. I mean, our other past three
years we've had successful seasons. Our first year in the Big East we weren't
picked to do nearly as well as we did. We ended up fourth place in the
conference. I mean, that's just how it happens. You're measured on how you do,
you know, in the NCAAs, and it's good for us to get out on a good start right
now.  
  
Q. You three scored 17 of the last 18 points to close out the game. Do you
feel that's a fitting way for you guys to close out your first NCAA tournament
win?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Yeah. I mean, we got a coach that's confident, you know,
especially in these three guys up here, Lazar Hayward and other guys. He puts
the ball in the hands of guys he knows is going to step up and make big plays
at big times.  
We got a group of guys that want the ball in their hands. I feel like that's
the best thing about this team, is that everybody is confident in each other
to step up and make big plays. Everybody did that today.  
That's why, you know -- I mean, it's very important that we got this win and
everybody so they could make the big plays to be in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. You talk a little bit in the last few years you guys sort of fell ahead
early in the tournament. Talk about this year being able to play from ahead.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: That's maturity. A sign of maturity. Like Jerel said, a
couple years ago we don't know if we're winning that game, if we're pulling it
out because of the run. I mean with us coming straight out of high school we
were always the go-to guys. We might have started falling apart, like he said,
or trying to take the game over by ourselves, but we're comfortable with each
other. We're confident in each other. Our coach is confident in us. We're
confident in him that he is going to call the plays then we're going to
execute them.  
So I mean, that's just what it is. We came out, we had the lead and we didn't
want to lose it, so we kept playing hard. They threw their punch and we threw
ours right back.  
THE MODERATOR: One last question for student-athletes? Seeing none, we'll
thank the student-athletes for coming out and excuse them.  
Open up the floor to questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Tom, you heard them say they felt that, you know, a year ago or two years
ago things might have fallen apart for them in the face of the Kentucky
charge.  
When did you realize that these guys were different, had a different make-up
or they matured to the point where they weren't going to let a thing like that
happen?  
COACH CREAN: It's process, you know, when what I realize is they've averaged
23 wins in their 3 years at Marquette. I realized that we started three
freshman when they were freshmen, and I tend to focus on where we're at in the
moment not where we were a year ago.  
Your team is defined in different ways throughout the season. We've had
different times these guys have been able to pinpoint where they were at.
Pinpoint, you know, that togetherness, that comradery that you need to pull
things out, and it's all part of a process. I don't have one definitive time
for you though. I mean the season's a long season. There is different places.  
  
Q. Tom, what was the game plan going in against Crawford specifically what
did you guys want to do defensively against him?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we wanted to stay down on him. We wanted to not go for shot
fakes. We wanted to make every catch with Bradley and Crawford a little
tougher than the last one and just build our intensity up as the shot clock
wound down. Early in the game, in the first half we were playing zone at the
shot clock and they made an adjustment at half-time, so we made our adjustment
to go back man-to-man.  
But he earned his baskets. He is a great player. We'll see him in Milwaukee,
you know. I don't know if he'll be a Buck but there's 29 or 30 other teams he
could play for. He'll be a pro, and I believe Bradley will be as well. Those
guys are just too talented and they're too tough. But the game plan was built
not only around those two but also on Jasper, because he can make so many
things happen.  
He is a point guard playing the four spot.  
We wanted to make sure that we attacked them on our end. We wanted to put
ourselves in positions to drive the ball, get to the free-throw line. And it
was one of those games. It was a grind-it-out game, which we had a strong
feeling it would be.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Jerel McNeal's play as of late,
including the Big East tournament and today, and how important his
contribution on offense is -- not only defense but offense is going to be
going forward in the tournament?  
COACH CREAN: Well he's got 69 wins in 3 years, so it didn't just start last
week. He's started every game he's ever played at Marquette. I don't see any
reason he won't continue to do that. And it was very, very tough for him last
year and for us to come into this tournament without our MVP, which is what
his teammates voted him last year.  
And what he's done over the year, and especially the last two months, is take
his work ethic to an even higher level when it comes to shooting and working
on his game outside of practice. You know early mornings, in between classes,
sometimes at night, always staying after practice. But that time spent is
really paying dividends for him, because his shot is crisp. It looks like it's
going in. It looks like it's going in every time he shoots it. He's always
been an attack mentality young man. He's always been a guy that plays with an
edge. That's what makes him successful, and his skills just continue to
flourish and get better.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Thank you, Coach.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Green, the floor is yours.  
COACH GREEN: Let's concentrate on a couple things. How good UCLA is and what a
class group and, you know, they're big, they're strong. When it comes to us
competing against a team like that, it would be very difficult if we were at
our best.  
You know, what you saw was no indication of what went on with this group of
guys throughout our conference. Obviously, there is a tremendous difference in
the levels. And we don't want our guys to feel like that this was their
season. I'm very proud of these three guys, and the other guys in the locker
room, and it will be a lesson for the guys that are coming back.  
But it also will be a lesson for the guys that are going on to graduate in
terms of how to compete and make something happen throughout your league play,
how you relate that to life, and, also, the experience that we had. It was a
situation that we hadn't been in, and we didn't respond and show the best of
our abilities in that situation. But, even so, we have nothing to hold our
heads down for.  
Obviously, when you talk about the stats, we didn't get back in transition and
gave them easy baskets. We had some quick shots and couldn't get second shots.
We also gave up the rebounds to them, and obviously when you do that on a team
that's so much better at every position player-by-player all the way down the
bench, you're going to get beat.  
And the score could be -- this score, it could be worse; it could be less.
Obviously it's going be very difficult to win that game. We give them a lot of
credit for being able to play every single possession as hard as they possibly
could knowing that the game was as such.  
So you are talking about a very disciplined, hard-nosed defensive minded,
skilled offensive team in UCLA. So my hat's off to them, but the I still love
my guys, and they all will be successful.  
  
Q. Stanford, you knew obviously it was going to be a tough match-up, but
just what was it like once you were out there with their bigs and trying to
contend with their defensive pressure?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, mainly the defensive pressure wasn't that bad; it was
more of the banging, bumping around. We don't see a lot of that in our
conference. And, you know, it was kind of hard to adjust.  
In our conference we get the little ticky-tack fouls, and out there you had to
play through it. And so the defensive pressure didn't bother us, it was just
the contact, the physicalness of the game. And, you know, those guys, man,
they're great. You know, most of them played McDonald's All-American games,
and they know how to play.  
So like Coach said, we played our best game; we probably still would have lost
by 10 or 15.  
  
Q. This is for all, was this a good experience for you guys? You go up
against UCLA, you said they're all McDonald All-Americans. Is this something
you can take something from later on in life?  
ERIC PETTY: Well, yes. UCLA's a great team, probably one of the best; probably
the best we've played all year, and we played some top teams. It's a great
experience. I'm Junior. I'm going to take this and learn from it and put it
into what I got to do next year and come back and make us a lot better. I can
use it and teach some of this to the newcomers that are coming.  
  
MICHAEL CLARK: I feel like Eric. Me, too, being a Junior and coming back next
year, it will help me learn what I need to get better at for preparing for
next season, being able to tell the new incoming freshmen what it takes to get
here.  
We're very happy to get here, but at the same time look down on the loss, feel
like we could have played better.  
  
Q. What will you tell people when they ask what Kevin Love was really like,
what it was like to play against him?  
ERIC PETTY: I guard him. I guard some big men this season, and he is physical.
Oh man, for a freshman, he's got an outside game. To be that big inside, I
mean, man he's going be great, I know that; he's going to be great.  
COACH GREEN: I think most of our guys, if they feel some of what I feel, it
looks like we spent one day playing and coaching in the NBA playing against
him.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for student-athletes. With that, thank
you very much.  
  
Q. Coach, that ball got stuck there early in the second half. Were you kind
of hoping maybe they don't get it down and we can just kind of get this thing
over with?  
COACH GREEN: You know, that's a difficult play, but we worked on that.
(Laughing). Our whole plan was to delay the game as much as we could, and that
was a great play. I mean, I was really a little bit excited about it, hoping
they would be a little bit distracted.  
  
Q. Maybe it's not the right time, but talk about how far you think UCLA in
your mind can go in this tournament?  
COACH GREEN: Well, you know, it's really -- they can win the National
Championship. Whether they will or not, obviously, will depend on how some
other people play on that particular day.  
To win a National Championship, it's hard to predict who will win, because I
think there's a lot of good teams out there, but I know they're very capable,
you know, because they have all the parts, and they play with the passion that
you need to play with in order to get there. So I think they have a great
chance of doing it. Whether they will or not, you know, just depends.  
Some days you shoot it a little bit better, some teams come in and do some
different things against you that maybe will exploit some weaknesses, but we
couldn't see those weaknesses for sure. There will be some teams that will do
a better job in some areas than what we could do.  
For instance, getting back in transition. That's something that will get the
them in a half-court game offensively, and then being able to play against
their bumping and grinding and having a guy that can play a lot in the post
area that maybe can come out and defend out on the court also, those type
match-ups. You never know who they'll match-up with throughout the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? I think that will do it. Thank you very
much, Coach.  
COACH GREEN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll open up with a statement from Coach, then open it
up to questions for the student athletes. Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH TURGEON: That was a great win for us. We beat a really, really good BYU
team. I think they won 13 out of 14 coming into this game. And, you know,
about the ten-minute mark they took a two-point lead and I was a little
worried. We were confused defensively.  
We weren't making open shots, but we just kept guarding. I thought defensively
the last eight minutes of the game we were really good. We gave up two threes.
Dominique helped off of a 45, shouldn't have done it. Then Sloan who hasn't
practiced with us helped off and Fredette hit a three. Besides that we were
great defensively and we rebounded.  
We really rebounded the second half. We boxed out. Our guards helped us
rebound. Offensively we were as good as we've been in a long time executing.
We really executed, executed, executed. They went box-and-one on us one
possession; we got a three for Dominique.  
We ran our plays. We got the ball into the post. The guys set good screens and
we finished. Made a few adjustments at half-time to get the ball a little
deeper in the post, and just executed at a high level. I thought Beau made a
good decision not to shoot the ball in the corner, penetrated, and he got the
ball to Dominique who hit two big threes for us like he's done his whole
career, just guarded well.  
So a great win. I'm really, really proud of our guys.  
  
Q. I'll direct this one to you, Josh. How good did it feel to get out there
and hit three three-pointers to start it out and get nine points in that early
11-0 run?  
JOSH CARTER: I felt great. My teammates kept telling me all week to just keep
shooting and it would begin to fall for you, and it was great to be able to
get off to a great start.  
  
Q. Bryan and Joe, could both of you guys talk about their big guys in the
middle and how you had to guard them better in the second half, and both --
just the whole battle inside?  
JOSEPH JONES: Their big guy, Trent Plaisted is a very good player. Coach told
us just do the best job we can. Just try to keep him away from the basket and
just play defense on him. We knew he didn't want our guards to run down and
give up a three-point shot. The game was on the big men. We got four big men,
and we were just going to keep coming at him and just try to do the best job
we could.  
BRYAN DAVIS: He just told us, "Let the bigs beat us, and make sure the guards
stayed out on the perimeter and don't sink in," and that helped to our
advantage today.  
  
Q. Josh, did you feel like you were being guarded the same way today as you
had been like in the Big 12? Like you kept talking about being fronted a lot
this year.  
JOSH CARTER: At the beginning, no. I got three wide open looks. But after I
knocked those three down, they started facing up on me a little bit more. So
early they didn't guard me, then they started guarding me just like everybody
else.  
  
Q. Dominique, could you talk a little bit about your two threes down the
stretch. You hadn't shot a whole lot during the game but you got those.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: At the beginning I really couldn't knock down shots, whatever.
And, you know, my teammates just told me keep shooting it's going to fall for
us, and, you know, just going out there and just believing in it and just
hitting them two threes and it just felt good.  
  
Q. Joseph, you led your team with 12 rebounds. Half the rebounds were about
equal between the teams, but then you guys got a lot more the second half. Did
anything change?  
JOSEPH JONES: Not really changed. We just wanted to start going and get the
ball. We feel like we needed to get some second chance points and just
dominate the boards. That's been one of our goals this whole season, dominate
the boards, box out and just keep rebounding and it did a great job for us.
Once you get them stopped from getting rebounds, you got a good chance of
winning.  
  
Q. Josh, off-and-on year, probably frustrating at times. Does it all feel
better now with this performance?  
JOSH CARTER: It feels good to have a good performance. But, I mean, we didn't
come here to just win one game. We just want to keep it rolling, and whoever
we get tomorrow we're going to play hard, and we just want to keep doing it,
keep winning.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about -- you said you didn't come here to win one
game. If UCLA wins that next game, obviously that's going to be a pretty tough
match-up. You guys played them last year. Can you talk about the team this
year with the addition of Kevin Love, how tough that match-up makes them?  
JOSH CARTER: Well, I've watched him on TV all year and they're great team. I
mean, we're just excited. They have great players. I mean, we'll start doing
scouting on them tomorrow I guess. But I mean, they're going to be hard to
guard, I'm sure, but I mean we're a great team, too, and we're just looking
forward to that match-up if it happens.  
  
Q. Your three-pointer, when you got the pass from Beau, were you expecting
to get the ball in that situation, or were you kind of surprised that he
didn't put it up himself?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Not really. When I passed the ball I thought he was going to
shoot it. But he just made a great move, penetrated. And in the pinch I was
just getting ready, man, like we do in practice all the time. He seen me right
there on the wing, and I was just ready to shoot.  
  
Q. When you guys had that 11-point lead, then they came back, what was it
that kept you guys from folding and sort of letting them taking over the
game?  
JOSH CARTER: I think we pride ourselves on toughness and being poised. We were
able to just fight through it and not get down on ourselves, like we would
have in the past, and we just come together as a team, and we were just able
to battle and keep fighting.  
  
Q. Dominique, some of the games where Josh has gotten hot early, that seems
like it turbocharges you guys. Texas, K-State, some other games. I think, does
it, as much as it seems, when he gets going early, does that jolt the whole
team?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Oh yeah. Well, when we get Josh rolling, it opens up a lot for
us, because they're going to, you know, pay attention to him a lot. Then we
just throw it down inside to Joe or B.D. or one of the big guys and just play
from there.  
  
Q. Dominique, on the defensive end, they're a team that likes to shoot
threes. How conscious were you of that and does it really keep you on your
toes, knowing no matter how far they are they can launch it?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: They're a great shooting team. Coach told us that's why we had
the big guy guarded one-on-one. We just got to stay close to shooters because
they're really a good three-pointer-shooting team. We just got to keep
battling with them. They did a great job shooting, and we just tried to do our
best.  
  
Q. With their big men, they're not very good free-throw shooters. How much
did that -- did you take that into consideration in terms of a defensive game
plan?  
BRYAN DAVIS: We just all wanted to play as solid as we can and make them shoot
overhand every time.  
JOSEPH JONES: We're not trying to foul. Just trying to play tough defense and
make the hard, tough shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Well, thank you, student-
athletes. Good luck on Saturday.  
We'll know open the floor to questions with the head coach.  
  
Q. Mark, do you have an explanation why, was it just the loss of Aci Law, or
why do you think that Josh has been so inconsistent shooting the three this
year?  
COACH TURGEON: That's the majority of it. His role changed. Went from Aci Law
on Joe's team to where he had to become a big-time scorer for us. And I had a
Sweet 16 team at Wichita State, and we lost one player and it changed
everything.  
Being the new coach here, I couldn't, you know, say Aci was that important or
missing. I couldn't make excuses for why guys weren't playing as well, but Aci
made us all better. And, you know, you lose the first-team All-American, it
makes everybody better.  
But Josh doesn't get a lot of open looks. And when he did get them, he rushed
them a little bit. And it helps us when Dominique's hitting threes or Beau
came in and hit threes. As the season wore on, we got Josh more looks. But
most of Josh's threes last year were stand-still. Kind of like Dominique hit
the one late there, now he's got to come off screens to get them. They're not
there. You can't penetrate and pitch to him because they're not going to help
off.  
So it's whole different game for him this year. And he is a much -- believe it
or not, he is a much better player than he was last year. I mean, the floater
in the lane, coming off the screen, I mean, the kid's come a long ways
throughout the season. He's got a long ways to go.  
He was fantastic. He hit his first one. That was big for us.  
  
Q. Coach, when the jump shots started falling early in the game, did you
have a feeling this was going to be one of your stronger offensive efforts
because the jump shot inconsistency has been one of the main problems this
year?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, you know the reason we got jump shots and UCLA won't do
it, or Mississippi Valley State won't do it, is they doubled our post. We got
wide open looks. And we practiced it all week. We knew they were going to do
it, and we were prepared for it and we knocked them down.  
Then it got to be a little tougher to got shots. We didn't score quite as
frequently after that started. But, no, that was nice. But we were still
disappointed that we hadn't established an inside game. I had somebody yell at
me, "Throw it inside."  
I said, "We're trying," you know, at half-time.  
We made a minor adjustment and got the ball a little deeper to our guys and
our post guys finished. But we're an inside out team. That's the way we have
to perform.  
We had 18 assists tonight. It's been hard for us to have assists, 18 assists
on 25 baskets. We're coming. I keep saying we're coming. It's just taking a
long time for us to figure everything out with this team. And we just keep
getting a little bit better in our half-court offense and our execution.  
Our execution down the stretch tonight was phenomenal. I mean, we got the ball
right where we wanted, we made plays, and against a really good defensive
team. I mean, they're only giving up about 38% field-goal percentage for the
year, and we shot 54 on them. We did a nice job tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like this was a match-up where Josh could really get
going and break out a little bit?  
COACH TURGEON: You know, with this team, I never know what's going to happen
in a game. When he hit his first couple, it just happen to be where he was
open, we did a good job of swinging the ball to him, you know, it helped. The
one thing is, and we scouted the heck out of them, we've been working on these
guys for three days. We did a great job of guarding them. They average 74. We
held them to 62 points. I feel like we knew every one of their sets. I got a
million of them.  
And we might not run them because it's just taken me so long to figure this
team out. They might not know all our sets. With that said, we snuck a couple
baskets for Josh they might not have seen. UCLA or Mississippi Valley State is
going to scout us better, see us in person, those might not be there.  
But I thought we were able to get, you know, more open shots now we're out of
the league obviously. They would probably say the same thing. But our game
plan was pretty solid and our guys did a good job defensively with it. But we
snuck out a few shots.  
  
Q. You said earlier that you knew they were going to double the posts. And
sometimes, does that mean they were sort of daring you to beat them with the
three or they were sort of giving that to you?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, they played three big schools this year. They played
Louisville, Michigan State, and Carolina, and they doubled the post every
time. We watch so much film, I can't even tell you. My assistant coaches did
an unbelievable job. I think I watched -- I think I watched about eight games
myself, which is a lot for me.  
So we felt like we knew exactly what they were going to do. And now, when
things weren't going well, we let down, we turned the ball over and let down.
But we had to take away a secondary break-point, or excuse me, transition
points. For the most part, we took care of the ball, we did that.  
The other way to get threes is when they throw the ball to the post. We took
that part of the game away. And then offensive rebounds, I thought in the
second half we limited them to one shot and it took things away.  
But I can't remember what your question was now. I'm so tired.  
  
Q. Were they, like, daring?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, they were daring us. But if I'm on his bench and you look
at us in warm-ups, I am a little nervous, too. You know, we look big and
strong.  
So it's the right game plan. We just happen to make shots tonight. We made
them, and it worked out well and gave us a nice little lead. We knew they were
going to come back.  
  
Q. Mark, all that being said, can you comment specifically on Bryan and
Joe's performances tonight? Bryan had real fluid moves; Joe with strong
rebounds there.  
COACH TURGEON: I thought Bryan was really good defensively. That's a hard
match-up for Bryan Davis, chasing that kid around all night. We got beat a
couple times on dribble penetration, a couple threes. But they were great.  
We challenged them at half-time. We didn't think our bigs were playing very
well. They weren't establishing anything. You know, I thought defensively,
Junior was playing pretty well on placed. But we really challenged them.  
Like I said, we made a minor adjustment to get the ball to them in a better
position and it worked for us.  
Bryan's jump hooks, I mean, boy, looked great. And they had a great week of
practice. Coach Smith told them before the games it was our best week of
practice with post guys, really worked hard. We got an advantage in there, and
we need to try to take advantage of it, and they did.  
But Joe stepped up and made free throws. I thought we did a great job on
Plaisted. He is a hard guard. He is so fast and he jumps into you. We did
hands-back and maybe guarding Michael Beasley a couple times this year, helped
us guard him.  
  
Q. Is this as complete a game or as good an effort as you have seen all
season from this team?  
COACH TURGEON: We've had a lot of good ones. You can always be critical. You
know, I thought we let down, you know, transition defense, and defensively
right before half-time. We made some really silly mistakes right before half-
time.  
But I think the last ten minutes, we were as good as we've been in a while. I
mean, our defensive effort, our transition, our execution, trying to take good
shots, we forced one shot. Josh forced a shot then had a silly foul. But
besides that, you can't think of many things that these kids didn't do right.  
So, you know, on a big-time stage, they stepped up for me and really executed.  
THE MODERATOR: We have to wrap it up right there. Thank you, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:

## March 20, 2008

  

### [Kenny Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18337)

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Robin Lopez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18336)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement by the coach then open up the
questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach, at your convenience.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you. I thought we got off to a very, very good start
defensively. We knew going into this game, they shot the ball extremely well
from the perimeter, and there were a couple kids on their team we knew we had
to be able to help.  
So it helps to get off to a good start defensively, Cornell, as we all know,
had one heck of a year, undefeated in league, which is really hard to do in
this day and age. And they hadn't lost in 16 games. So it was nice to see our
guys come out and be very aggressive and ready to play, and relaxed.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you just talk about the defensive pressure, particularly on
the perimeter in the first half?  
KENNY BROWN: Our defense pressure on them? It was very important for us to
come out and defend. That's what we try to identify with, that's what try to
identify with, that's what Stanford tries to identify with. We know in order
to go far in this tournament, to go anywhere in this tournament, we have to
play defense first.  
  
Q. Trent just mentioned the word relaxed, Robin. You guys definitely looked
relaxed yesterday going into today. Was there definite a sense of calmness
about this team?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: Yeah. There was definitely a sense of calmness. It helps that --
what really helped was the experience last year. I mean, nobody likes to
mention it but that was in the back of our minds. We knew we had to be
mentally prepared for this game. As coach said, they were undefeated in
league, and they're mentally tough, so we're going to have to be mentally
tougher out there.  
  
Q. Robin, curious to get your thoughts on what it does to a team
psychologically when you take away open looks as frequently as you guys did
today?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: Um, I suppose they're just going to have to react on the
defensive end. They did for a little bit. They were playing with a lot of
energy on defense. And I believe that was the -- that's the result of taking
away open looks.  
  
Q. Robin, you definitely seem to come out aggressively, physically, to block
every shot. Was that your intent, just to show you guys obviously have more
talent than they have, just to show how aggressive you could be?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: I believe that was our team's intent. We knew we needed to come
out there and impose our will or else there would have been a good chance for
an upset. Cornell's a very good ball club.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen, for coming out. Good luck on Saturday.  
We'll now open up the floor to questions for Coach Johnson.  
  
Q. What was the plan on dealing with Wittman? I think Fred was on him in the
beginning and you ran a lot of different people at him.  
COACH JOHNSON: Basically, we had to guard him. We use the term "a lot of
help." Normal defensive principals are not going to help on penetration. I
don't want to say it's like how you're going to back to how you defend in
junior high, you face guard a guy all over the floor. He is a very good
player. We're bigger and stronger.  
But the thing that impressed me the most about Cornell is they're basketball
players. They understand how to play. They have a high basketball IQ. But that
was the plan, to make sure we made him work for everything regardless of who
was on him during the course of the game.  
  
Q. You were talking about being relaxed. Were you worried they weren't going
be relaxed in this situation?  
COACH JOHNSON: No. You know, it's interesting, for the most part, we've had
probably as good a day, good of days coming into this tournament in terms of
preparation. This is a group, like I said earlier in the year, that you can
trust. You pretty much get a good feel on what they're thinking, and their
preparation has been very good all year long.  
For me, I go back to, you know, I want to say middle of December when Brook
became eligible. I thought if anybody beat us from that point on, it was going
be because they were a better team that given afternoon, that given night. So
for the most part, I thought they were ready to play and very relaxed, yes.  
  
Q. Robin mentioned the last year was a thought process for them. It was on
their minds. Was last year a big deal, you think, leading into this game?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, you know, again, as much as I try to not deal with the
past and put it behind us, I think regardless of what you as a coach or as a
staff talk about, it bothers them. I mean, they read the papers, they listen
to the news, and they wanted to come out and be extremely aggressive. But also
they're smart enough to understand that Cornell's not Louisville, with all
respect to Cornell. Cornell's not Mississippi State. So this is a different
team. This is a different team we played. It's a more experienced team than we
have, and we understand that.  
  
Q. Trent, was there anything you were unhappy with today, and how valuable
is the rest some of your players got?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I think rest sometimes is overrated, quite frankly. I
thought we played our best basketball in the PAC-10 tournament three games in
three days. Yes, I was very unhappy. I thought the guys that hadn't been
playing a lot had a lot of unforced turnovers and we got away from what we do
from the standpoint of execution offensively and defensively, but that's what
you would expect when kids haven't played that much. From that standpoint,
still it's one-possession game.  
We're trying to get better. We're trying to improve individually and
collectively. So, you know, it's a nice win, but still there are some things
that we could improve on.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Fred and Kenny's play at the point,
especially with Anthony and Mitch in early foul trouble?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, one of the things that we identified as a staff, and I as
a head coach going back into last year a little bit, we didn't do enough job
of putting these guys in position where they could handle the ball and not be
in a turnover situation. We operated a lot out of a one-guard front. Now we're
in a two-guard set a lot of the time.  
So it takes a little of the pressure off when Mitch is not on the floor. Even
when he is on the floor that Fred can handle it, Anthony can handle it. Kenny
can handle ill. Although Kenny was out front still he was a two guard set. And
we've been able to manage. When I say manage I mean we've been able to at
crucial points in games get the ball to the right people at the right time.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask about the rebounding. You know, you won by a big
margin, 47-25 on the boards. How did you feel that the effort -- how hard did
you feel people were getting after it today?  
COACH JOHNSON: Our effort was really good. Our effort has been really good
probably the last month. And again this is a group -- they're going to
compete, they're going to play hard. Sometimes, because we have size and we're
not rebounding well, it's because we're getting outquicked to the ball and
other teams may have better athletes. For the most part today we were very
aggressive ,but we got a quickness advantage to the ball at times.  
  
Q. You are just done with this one, but do you got any sense on what
Marquette, what the match-up is like there? They got three small guards ,they
spread out I guess a little bit. Any thoughts on Marquette?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah. Everything's at the rim. We're going to have to limit
transition baskets. We got our work cut out for us. They want to play fast.
They want to pull out of pressure. It's going to be interesting. It's going to
be very interesting. Dominic James is special, O'Neal is special, Matthews is
special. But it's pretty much what we've seen all year. I liken them a lot to
USC's explosiveness. Of course, UCLA, they're explosive in their own right. So
we got a day and a half to try to inject some speed in some of our guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck on Saturday.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you.

## March 20, 2008

  

### [Ramel Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16431)

### [Joe Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16439)

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a two-minute statement from Coach Gillispie,
then open up the floor to questions for the student-athletes first, then
question for the coach.  
Coach, go ahead.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I have to go for two minutes?  
THE MODERATOR: You don't. (Laughing).  
COACH GILLISPIE: All right. It was a tough loss for us. We came here with the
intent on winning, just like everyone else does. We came here to win this game
and try to move on and win the next one and try to cut down nets. That's what
we came here for. These guys to my left, that's the only thing they believe in
and that's the only way they've approached things.  
And I'm really proud of our team. I'm not excited about losing today because
that's not what we're all about, but our team never gives up. They never give
in. They've had to overcome so many things. They never whined about any of
those things. Just great effort all season long and I'm really, really, really
proud, even though today's result was not what we wanted.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up the floor to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. When you fouled-out, your opponent, Dominic Jones, came over to the bench
to talk to you. Can you tell us what the conversation was like?  
JOE CRAWFORD: It was just short. He just told me, you know, good game, keep my
head up.  
  
Q. Did you appreciate that?  
JOE CRAWFORD: Yeah.  
  
Q. Ramel, you picked up your fourth foul pretty early in that second half.
How difficult was it playing the rest of the game, as far as aggressiveness,
after picking up that fourth foul?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't think it was really difficult. I just had to watch out
and not foul again so I wouldn't foul out of the game.  
But they were doing a lot of driving the basketball, so I just had to be
careful.  
  
Q. This question's for Joe. Joe, can you just talk about your emotions. I
mean, 35 points, terrific game, but your last game of your college career. Can
you just talk about your emotions?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, you know, I came here to win. So, you know, that's what
I wanted to do. So, I mean, I'm just kind of sad right now because, you know,
I feel like, you know, we had a good chance and, you know, I'm just kind of
down right now. But, you know, overall, I'm proud of what we did as a team
through the season.  
  
Q. Could you tell us what you thought of Joe's game today and the way he
attacked offensively, especially?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I thought Joe played unbelievable for us. I mean, he kept
us in the game. I thought he made shots sometimes I didn't think was going to
go in and it still went in. I think he gave it his all. Unfortunately, we just
couldn't get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Ramel, I think they only had seven turnovers. I mean, they're really good
guard plays. How big of a key was that that you guys weren't able to turn them
over any more than you did?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I think that was key. They rely on their guards and their
guards did a good job getting the basket, and we just have to give those guys
a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen.  
Now, open up the floor to questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Billy, can you just talk about Joe's game. I mean how incredible he was.
Just seemed like for stretches there he just put the team on his back.  
COACH GILLISPIE: He's done that ever since Patrick went down, he and Ramel
both. But the numbers looked like that, I think they had 54 points today, is
that right, 54 out of 66, which is not good for our team. But whatever it
takes for those guys to give, give their team a chance to win, that's what
they've done, even before Patrick went out.  
Those guys, I was around probably the most clutch player in college basketball
last year, and this year, I think I was around as clutch a player as I've ever
been around. We had at times two. And those guys from the time conference
started, they were so clutch, it was amazing. They made so many big plays
offensively, defensively, rebounding-wise. And that on top of leading our team
on the court, off the court, having unbelievable amounts of responsibility,
and never wavering from -- they never ran from the responsibility. They
accepted it. And I really believe they really enjoyed it, and they fostered so
many other guys.  
Like I was saying before, every single time something happened, all eyes came
on Joe and Ramel. And we have a bunch of young guys; those are the only two
seniors. We don't have any Juniors. Every single time something happened, and
there was a lot of things happening, Patrick going out, Jodie in and out,
those kinds of things, that's not anything he could control, Derrick in and
out and whatever, but all eyes from those players were always focused on Joe
and Ramel. And they saw strength.  
It's hard to be the measure of strength that they were on a daily basis, as
strong as they were. And, you know, because as your leaders go, you go. And
when you look at those guys, if they have bad body language or a bad day, they
can't have one-tenth of a bad attitude for that day in our situation,
especially the way we started out the year.  
And those guys were unbelievable as far as showing a great measure of
strength. Every time someone looked at them, body language, facial expression,
any word that came out of their mouth, I've never seen anybody be able to do
as much on the court, you know, in practice and those kind of things, off the
court. Then when the game time started, they were fantastic.  
The thing about it is, everyone knew that they were going to have to play like
that for us to win. And nobody did anything -- they couldn't do anything about
it. And that's great coaches and great teams in our conference, and just like
today, it's very, very good team that has a chance to definitely move and play
for a long time if they make some shots.  
It's Final Four possible teams because of their quickness and depth, and they
knew who had to score for us. And those guys still got 54 points. So that
makes it even more amazing.  
You hate to see those guys walking out of here for the last time. They've made
a definite mark on Kentucky basketball, which is the best tradition in the
history of the sport. And they've -- I'm so proud not to see them going out
with a loss because I definitely thought we could win it all. I know that
sounds crazy, but that's the way we thought. That's the way they thought.
That's the way our whole team thought, because we became such a strong
believing group, we thought we could do anything no matter what the
circumstances.  
You hate to see them walking out, but you are really happy you know they're
walking out with a great foundation that's going to give them a chance to be
basketball players, which is what they want to do. And they're going to do it
with a degree in their hand. And they're going to walk out of here and they're
going to have a fantastic life.  
So this is only a start. It's an ending for today and for our season, but it's
start for our program and it's great start for those young mens' careers.  
  
Q. Coach, was this first season at Kentucky what you expected?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It was better than I expected. It was fantastic. I mean, as
far as wins and losses, no. I thought we would win more games. But if you
would have said that, You are going to have over 40 games missed by a really,
really, really, really good players, I would have said, How in the world are
we going to make it in the tournament?  
And, you know, but the thing about it is, the way you do that is, Kentucky has
every single thing that you need to win national championships. It's been
proven over time. And they've won a lot of them, and, hopefully, we'll win
some more. You have great fans, unbelievable fans. The fans helped us win
eight games at home in conference. I've not seen a greater effort from a group
of fans to be able to help you as much as they helped us when they definitely
knew that we needed the help.  
You have a great administration that understands the importance that it has
not only on the school and to the players, but to an entire state and to, I
mean, the big blue nation. And it means everything to them. And they're going
to give you a chance as a coach to do whatever it takes within the rules to
attain the greatest level of success.  
So for me, I'm a basketball person 24 hours a day. I love it. I couldn't --
there's never a place that you could ever see that, in my opinion, that I
could ever have any greater feeling for, because no matter what the situation
was, even though we weren't playing well, our fans were awesome to me. And
they were awesome to these players. Say, well, we had a tough spell, but we're
going to get them. I've never seen anything like it in my life.  
That's no disrespect to anywhere else I've been. I mean, it's just you are a
special person if you are associated with Kentucky basketball, you are a
special -- if you are a player at Kentucky, you are the most special person in
the world. And they're going to give you the benefit of the doubt over and
over and over and over. So for a basketball nut like myself, I don't think it
could get any better?  
  
Q. Billy, how much did Ramon getting in foul trouble hurt you?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It hurt us because, you know, they're really talented at the
guard spot. They're really hard to guard off the dribble. But I didn't think
we guarded as well as we needed to off the ball. I thought -- they're very
difficult to guard because they can -- they have very, very good skill with
the ball, great quickness and great athleticism. I didn't think -- once they
got past our first defender, we came over and helped. So it meant quite a bit.  
But I thought Mike Porter played great. I thought -- he was great on Saturday.
I thought he's been really good down the stretch for us. I thought he played
really well for us today.  
So, I mean, it's just one thing after another, you know. It's the way the game
goes. We were in pretty good foul trouble over the entire game. Joe was in
foul trouble. We managed to get through the first half with that. But we just
had to kind of work through that a little bit. But we like to have Ramon out
there. He's been a great player for us. And he is a very determined player.
And he's never satisfied, and it's been great to see his growth along with all
the other players.  
But, you know, I thought that Mike gave us some minutes that were really good
today.  
  
Q. Obviously, you have missed Patrick the whole time he's been out. Do you
feel like you missed him even more today considering you really could have
used another option besides Ramel and Joe offensively?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I think, and I thought this would happen, not saying that I
know anything about anything, but I thought the longer we played, the more we
would probably miss Patrick. I'm very, very proud of Perry, and I'm very proud
of all the guys that we had. But the longer you play, the more tape that you
present, and those kind of things, I think that it definitely makes a
difference.  
And, you know, we're asking Derrick Jasper to play out of position. We're
asking Perry to be a low-post presence at 199 pounds and those kind of things.
Our roster is not nearly as complete as it needs to be as far as to be able to
do much flexibility-wise.  
But I thought that, you know, in the Georgia game, even I thought that it
really started to show the definite benefit of having Patrick in there. I
mean, any team would benefit from having him. He is an All-American-type
player, in my opinion, in the future, hated to not have him. I thought it
would probably get worse as we went along and it probably played out like
that.  
But I was proud of the guys we had out there. They tried their hardest. They
played a very, very good team and had a chance to win. Just didn't make enough
plays at the time we needed to to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we'll conclude the interview.  
Thank you, coach.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. For all three of you, when you happened to look at who was going to be in
Anaheim, did you happen to notice Kentucky was here and just kind of slap your
forehead and go, "Oh, our old coach is going to be in the same town"?   
JOSEPH JONES: Yeah. Yeah. That's something that came up. I've been watching
the show. We also seen they haven't called that name yet, and they haven't
called that name, so we thinking we might get messed up with something the
media might want to do. But the next day we were kind of surprised to see them
here with us.  
THE MODERATOR: Dominic or Beau, do you guys want to comment on that.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Just like Joe said, we were surprised, you know, they picked
the same, you know, place to play at and everything. We thought it was going
to be get messed up. I thought they were going to select there, but they
didn't. But we are at the same place though.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how Donald has handled everything that
happened this week and kind of what you guys have done to kind of help him
through this?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think he handled it great. You know, even though -- I mean,
even though it hurts to lose a loved one like that, you know, we went out
there and supported him. And it just -- we just have to be strong for him. I
know he's going go out there and play his best. So we just are out there being
strong for him, and I think he handled it real good.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys. I'd like all three of you all to respond to
this. When you all hit the court tomorrow night, you three guys are going to
play in your third tournament, you'll be representing what has been the best
three-year run in A &M basketball history. I was wondering, you're seniors,
what does that mean to you all, how far the program has come your entire time
in Aggieland?   
THE MODERATOR: Beau, why don't you take that first.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: First off, it's a blessing to be here. I know everybody's happy
to be here, and it's been a good ride. It's not over yet. We still have to
play tomorrow night, but just going to go out there and give it our all.
That's all we'll do, and just compete. And we compete on a daily basis and
just bring our best effort tomorrow.  
JOSEPH JONES: Just like Beau said, it's been a great ride. It's not over. Just
being here the past few years has showed you how the program's on the upward
bound and how the program's starting to become a nationally recognized
basketball program, so it feels good. It feels great, actually, to be here all
three years. So we're just going to come out and put forth a great effort
tomorrow and try to come up with a W.  
  
Q. Direct this towards Beau. This is kind of unique for you to be up there
and, you know, been talking to everybody and I just want to talk to you a
little bit about -- or have you talk a little bit about what it was like going
from being on the scout team last year and this kind of situation to where you
are now going to probably play a vital role off the bench in the NCAA
tournament?  
BEAU MUHLBACH: My whole deal is this is just a dream come true. You know, I'm
the type of player where I'll do anything for the team to win. If it is to be
on the scout team, just getting my teammates prepared, then that's fine with
me. Deep down inside, I just want to win. And these guys want to continue win,
too.  
And like I said, it's a dream come true that I'm starting to play just a
little bit more now and just got to embrace it and be there for my teammates,
whatever they need me to do to help win.  
  
Q. Joe, can you talk about the last couple of days you guys go to Dallas,
you're there for Donald, you have a hard time getting out of Dallas, you get
in here late last night, and finally being able to be here. Can you talk about
what that experience was like?  
JOSEPH JONES: We wanted to go to Dallas and show our support for Sloan. It was
a terrible loss for him. We wanted to go up there and show our support and be
strong for him and let him know we're there for him, anything he needs. Like
you said, traveling-wise, things like that happen. We got to let it go and
just come out and perform tomorrow night.  
Coach said this morning, we came here to have fun, but last night wasn't that
fun, sitting on the plane that long. But you got to forget about it. You got
to come ready to play tomorrow and give it our best effort.  
  
Q. What do you think the run last year did in terms of changing the
perception of your program nationally, the run in the tournament?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think it was a great run for us. We went out there and we
competed, you know, the first two rounds and even the Memphis game we competed
real hard. Just real great for the program.  
I think it's just going to get better by, you know, the years going by. And I
think we're just going to have to continue to just play hard, continue to
compete this year. Hopefully we can get back there.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: In addition to that, I just think that it goes show to that we
can compete with other people on this level. Even with the elite teams, that
we can just -- we can fight till the bitter end to get a W. And it's just, you
know, what this program's about, just toughness and playing hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Could you give us, Dominique, could you give us a scouting report on your
opponent, what you have noticed about them. Same with you, Beau.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, we went over some yesterday and today, and we know that
they got a great team. They got a team that can really spread the floor. They
really play, like, four out, one in. We know they got some guys that can
really shoot the ball, and they got a big man that can really pass it. So
we're just going to have to play team defense, go out there and try to compete
with them.  
And we know they got a great coach over there and a great team and we got to
go out there and play.  
  
Q. Does BYU remind you of any team you've seen this season that you've
'played?  
JOSEPH JONES: I really don't think we've seen a team this season that can
shoot the ball as well as BYU can. They got -- it's basically like a four-
guard offense around one. So we really haven't matched up with any teams this
year that had that kind of offense and the offense capability as them.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Just like Joe said, I really don't think we faced a team like
that, that can have four people out there that can really shoot the ball and
have a big guy that can pass the ball like that. I think the closest team is,
like, Nebraska that we played against, that really has four guys that can
spread the floor out and have a big main side.  
Other than that, BYU is a team that we really haven't seen.  
  
Q. Dominique, with the run you guys had in Kansas City, two wins and you go
toe to toe with Kansas, are you guys in a pretty good frame of mind right
now?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think we started to build confidence as a team. I think we
-- I think we learned how to start to compete a lot better now, and I think we
just have to continue to do that. You know, as far as the play against a team
like BYU, we just got to go out there and just give it our all. Give it our
best, and hopefully it will take care of itself.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we're going to release the student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
We'll open up with a statement from the coach, then open up the floor to
questions.  
Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously excited to be here. You know, pleased with the way we
finished in the Big 12 tournament, down the stretch in the league, then in the
league we played well. So we're looking forward to this. We know we got a
tough draw in BYU. But, you know, if you look around, all the brackets
everybody's got a tough draw.  
So we're looking forward to it and we know we got a very skilled, very smart,
very intelligent, very tough team that we're getting ready to play tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about what Beau's brought to you guys
this last five, six games? And what kind of person he is to come from, like,
just practically playing on the scout team most of the time to doing what he's
doing now?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, obviously very proud of him. We gave him chances earlier
in the year, and he didn't do quite as well. And we have been looking for
someone to step up for us. And, you know, we opened up practice, opened up all
the starting spots after we lost at home to Nebraska, and we took advantage of
it, and he's played well in the games.  
Beau's always been a really good practice player, but hasn't performed as well
in the games. And recently, he's performed well. I think what he gives us is
we're a much better defensive team, team defense, individual defense. When he
is on guys, he's got some strength. And then he gives us versatility, which we
didn't have. I mean, we can go big, you know, with him at the three. We can go
small with him at the four. So it will help us against a team like BYU that
can really stretch you at the four position.  
So it's been a pleasant surprise. He's made some open shots for us, too,
which, as you know, we're always looking for that. So it's -- he's been good.
I'm really proud of him, the way he's handled it. I just want him to stay
within himself, not try to do more than he's capable of doing, and continue to
play with the toughness that he's played with.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last couple of days, Coach. You know, you go to
Dallas for Donald, you have the trouble getting here, you finally get here
late last night, and now, finally being here and getting ready to workout?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, yesterday was a tough day. We were hoping for a Friday
game, but it didn't work out that way. But, you know what, mother nature had a
little bit to do with it and you can't control that. The charter, I thought,
was way too late, but it happened. We got in late. We let the kids sleep in.
You just -- players are resilient. It's the greatest time of their life.
They'll be ready to go.  
Yesterday was a tough day. Then just being -- you know, Sloan's mom's funeral
was tough, you know, to see your teammate in pain like that, or one of your
players in pain, it was difficult. But I'm glad we did it that way.  
Inconvenienced a lot of people. We had to ship our families and everybody up
to Dallas to catch the charter, but it was worth it. And so, you know, we got
a good night's sleep and we're excited. They'll sleep well tonight and be
ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think it was a complete accident that Kentucky ended up in
Anaheim? And did you, at least, slap your head and have a little bit of a
smirk that they were here, and that Coach Gillispie was here, too?  
COACH TURGEON: I didn't really think about it till I was going to this coach's
meeting today, and I said, "Billy's going to be here."  
But I really thought, and they say they don't do it, but I really thought we
were going to be playing Kentucky. Originally in an 8-9 game, then they lost
to Georgia, so I thought, well, maybe we moved up to 7, and they were going to
put us in a 7-10 game. I was hoping they wouldn't do that to the kids, the
players, and to Coach Gillispie. But, no, it's -- you know, I've heard a lot
of good things about him since I've been there. It's tough shoes for me to
fill.  
The guy was real successful in College Station. But I don't think it's that
big of a deal because we won't see them play. They're in the early game, we're
in the afternoon game, and it's big city, so won't see him a lot.  
  
Q. Following up on the big shoes to fill, if you could talk about what it
takes to sustain success at a program that hasn't always had, you know, great
basketball tradition and what's that been like for you?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, we won 24 games this year. I think it's the third most in
our history, maybe tied third most. And we spoiled them quick in College
Station. You know, I think at times they thought they picked me up off the
street, you know, to coach this team. Personally, it's been tough, but we've
overcome it. The kids have bought into me. We're starting to play at the level
I thought we could play at. And, you know, we have a lot of limitations as a
team, but we're overcoming them.  
With that said, we got to recruit well. We got to continue to recruit well.
Had a lot of national TV games this year, which is good for our program. We're
back in the NCAA tournament three years in a row. We'll see what happens in
this tournament, but that's important.  
But for us to sustain it, we got to continue to recruit in-state well, and
continue to get good players. And this year was tougher because our league was
so darn good. Our league was better than it's been in three or four years.  
But it's all about recruiting and getting players to sustain it. But getting
into this tournament really helps, really had helped.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think all the things that have happened over the past week
in a kind of weird sort of way can serve as a rallying point and serve to make
your team better?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, our guys are better when their backs are against the
wall. You know, we lose three in a row, backs against the wall, we play well.
Lose three in a row again, we play pretty well. We had to win at Baylor, had
to to get in the NCAA tournament, we did. We had to perform well in Kansas
City to get in the NCAA tournament, we did. And now the guys don't want their
season to end.  
You know, I expect us to be pretty good tomorrow. Whether it's good enough to
win, we'll see. We're playing a heck of a team. But I think we've come
together. You know, I think we had some guys step up in Kansas City, whether
it was Beau or Chinemelu Elonu step up, and it kind of brings your team closer
together. Then to go through what we went through yesterday, you know, that's
tough. That's tough.  
And I know that the relationship with our players and Sloan have changed, and
my relationship with Sloan's changed. I feel closer to Sloan than I've ever
felt because of what he's gone through and I think he's had to lean on us
during this time.  
So, yeah, I do think we're closer. Is it going -- you know, I don't know how
much it affects us, but, you know, I know when we were sitting there
yesterday, and I was sitting behind the players, I know a lot of those guys
were thinking about their moms, and feeling lucky they still had theirs -- and
most of them. But I think its bringing them closer together. Then to see Sloan
smiling today for the first time, I mean, he seems to be back.  
Has it brought us closer together? I think it has. Is it going to be the
difference-maker in this tournament? I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. But I
do expect us to play well.  
  
Q. Coach, where in particular do you think you guys need to be really good
tomorrow?  
COACH TURGEON: Transition defense and guarding the three-point line is
everything. I think defensively they're fast and great passers, and they
really stretch you, one through four. Then the sub, you know, sub-shooters.
Those are the two things.  
Then Cummard, you know, just does so many little things. You know, how we
handle him is going be a big part of it. Keep him off the offensive glass,
make him shoot jump shots overhand, just being aware of him. Making it hard
for him to be a great passer, which he is. He just does so many little things.
I think that's important.  
Then, you know, we have a lot of big guys, and how we do on Plaisted is real
important. We're going to throw a lot of bodies at him and, you know, see how
he handles it. Those two in particular. Of course, Tavernari, big time
shooter, that's hard for us. If this game would have been played, you know, in
January, we wouldn't have won this game.  
But we've had to adjust, get use to quicker, shorter teams that shoot the ball
well. We've become much better at that over the last two months. Now, whether
we'll be good enough tomorrow, we'll see. But guarding the three, transition
defense, and handling those two guys that I talked about, you know, earlier,
is, I think, the key. We got to make shots. I mean, it's hard for us to score.
I mean, I don't have to hide that from anybody. We scored 71 against KU, felt
like 200 for me. So we got to make some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess from your days at Wichita State to now, and the conference
play, what kind of an advantage is that to compete against the Kansases and
Texases and do your players maybe not buy into a Mountain West Conference
opponent sometimes with that?  
COACH TURGEON: No, they're buying into this team because we know how good --
we can show them film of beating Louisville, taking Carolina to the wire, and
Michigan State to the wire. So they're buying into this team, but -- and
they're favored. I mean, they're an eighth seed and we're a nine seed. So
we're going to be wearing the dark uniforms, they'll be wearing the white
ones, and so our guys will be dialed in.  
You know, you just -- you can't take anybody for granted. I just think those
numbers in front of people -- I mean, you look at Notre Dame, I think they're
a five seed. They got George Mason. I mean, they just got to be thinking, what
the heck. I mean, we had a heck of a year and did a great job in the Big East,
and they get George Mason. I mean, there's just no easy games at this time of
year.  
You know, I've watched BYU enough to know that if they would have played in
the Big 12, they would still have been an NCAA tournament team. They got
enough good players, enough maturity, and they got all kinds of skill, and
they got a toughness about them that they'd still be in it. So our guys will
be really dialed in had tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.  
Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Kevin Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18266)

### [Josh Shipp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17143)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We can open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. Kevin and Josh, first of all I'd like for you to talk about the condition
of your back. How much do you think it will limit your -- if you think it will
limit you at all? And how you guys feel about being such a big favorite in
this contest?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, to address your first question, my back is fine. We're
actually in practices yesterday with, you know, Josh right here and Russell,
we were actually having a dunk competition yesterday. So my back is fine. It's
not going to limit me at all. I got good work with my trainers and everybody
else who is helping me stretch out, you know, get it iced, get it rubbed down
and doing electric stim and things like that on it. So my back will be 100%
come game time.  
To address your second question, being such a heavily favorite team, and we
know that 16 seed has never beaten a 1 seed, and they're 0-92 against the one
seeds, we're just going to take it like any other game. They're guys are going
to come out and know we got that bull's eye on our chest, knowing that we are
UCLA, and we're just going to go out there and fight.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys have been in some blowout wins this season, 30-something
almost, one game, 40 points. When you are in those kind of games, you know,
what's your mentality in terms of keeping your minds in it, what you are
working on in the game. What can you benefit from when you are in that type of
situation?  
KEVIN LOVE: Um, you know, I can just say probably looking at the bigger
picture. We know we have a bigger goal in mind. And, you know, if you take a
playoff, anything can happen. You can get hurt and you just got to keep
playing as hard as you possibly can when that stuff happens. We might get a
chance to rest, you know, for the next game, which is going to be crucial
coming down the stretch here. Because you saw that in the PAC-10's, as well,
PAC-10 tourney, and when that happens, we just have to keep our mind focused
on, you know, what we want to accomplish.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys have been setting your sights on some big goals here this
year, including a national championship. Is there a line you have to guard
against between being almost overly ambitious and not focusing on the
immediate task at hand?  
JOSH SHIPP: I think our mindset is simple. It's been the same thing for the
past few years, since I've been here, we just focus on the next game at hand.
We do set goals at the beginning of the year, but we do them in sort of
stages. First was the PAC-10, and then the PAC-10 tournament, and we
accomplished those. Now, we're trying to get the third goal, to win the
national championship. The main thing is just to take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Josh, you've been in a couple of these kind of, looked like, mismatches
on paper before in the first round. What kind of things does Coach Howland say
to try to keep you guys from being overconfident or keep you focused on the
task at hand?  
JOSH SHIPP: He just makes it a big point of emphasis that anybody can lose on
any given night. I mean, if we don't come out and play, we could easily go
home. For us, when the guys hear that, hopefully it keeps them focused and
hopefully we're fortunate enough to win this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Josh, you've been here before, so you know what the big lights and the
bright lights are on this particular level. What information or what advice
can you give to your teammates, such as Kevin even though he's PAC-10 player-
of-the-year, that will help him get through all of this?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, we've had a couple of tournament like-games this year, a
lot of close battles. So, I mean, those guys, they have that experience. They
know how to play in those games. I mean, Kevin, he's very mature for his age.
I mean, we're not worried about him. We know he's going to come and play and
bring it every game.  
  
Q. Kevin, could I ask you, even though you are new to this stage, as Josh
just said, can you talk about what you feel March Madness has become? Is it
something that's sort of like the whole nation focuses on a little bit even if
they're not sports fans?  
KEVIN LOVE: I think so. Especially because, you know, this is when it really
starts to get fun and you see the upsets, you see, you know, different teams,
you know, bubble teams getting in, certain things like that. You see the
George Masons getting to the Final Four. So it makes it real fun.  
But also you get Cinderella stories, everything like that. I think everybody
does focus on March, and they have good reason to just because of those facts
alone, and we're hoping to make a run of our own.  
  
Q. Does it transcend sports fans. Do you have people who maybe don't follow
the sport, who suddenly when March comes --  
KEVIN LOVE: I think so. It's funny, everybody is filling out the brackets,
even the people that only pick the mascot in the next game for the bracket. So
it's kind of fun.  
  
Q. You guys often talk about your defense is kind of the key to winning. Can
I get each of you to describe your half-court offense and how you guys each
feel about that?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, we feel good about it. I mean, it's stagnant at times.
Sometimes we have our problems. But, I mean, like you said, our defense is the
main thing. As long as we're playing that hard D, we have a chance to win on
any given night.  
KEVIN LOVE: I feel the same way. You know, if our D's on top of our game, our
offense is going to come. Even if we're struggling a little bit, and we're
kind of getting short in there and it's tight inside, our defense will
helpfully pick us up. Our high court offense, we have to be able to hit the
three-point shots, spread a little stuff out for me inside so they can't
double- and triple-team. And I got to find cutters, you know, find Josh on the
weak side, and Darren on the weak side.  
Darren is on top of his game right now. So we're hoping after that PAC-10
tourney, he'll come steam rolling into the NCAA tournament as well.  
  
Q. Josh, after the last two post-seasons and two Final Four runs, is it
almost to the point that if you don't win a national championship, this season
will be something of a disappointment?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, it's tough to say it will be a total disappointment. I
mean, we've had a great run so far. Like I said, we do have another goal that
we want to accomplish, and it would be a great season if we do accomplish that
goal.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys have been down here, you particularly have been down here,
playing in the Wooden Classic. When you come here, does it -- is there an
extra comfort level that maybe you don't have in another arena where you sort
of know the lay of the land, you know the shooting background, just everything
that might trip you up in another place, you don't have that here?  
JOSH SHIPP: Just being so close to home is definitely a huge advantage. Have
your friends and family be able to come down and watch you play, that's
definitely big. Like you said, we played in this gym before. It's not a new
court to us, so that should definitely help us out, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Kevin, you want to discuss that or talk about that, just
playing here?  
KEVIN LOVE: I mean, we've only played here for one game, but, you know, we got
a win here, and also, like you said, we played down here for the Wooden
Classic. But this is only my first year at the NCAA tournament. I'm just
trying to look up to Lorenzo and all the upper-classmen that have been here
just to learn stuff from them.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how much you guys feel a sense of responsibility because
you play for UCLA to do things like win national championships, or is that
ancient history?  
KEVIN LOVE: No, I think we got to, you know, make the people that have came
before us very proud. And Mr. Alcindor, Mr. Walton, all the way back to Mr.
Hazzard, they won those national championships, Coach John R. Wooden, the
greatest coach in basketball history, we're trying to make those guys proud.
We wear that UCLA symbol across our chest, you know. We got the -- seeing gold
for the Hundred National Championships. We're just trying to hang another
banner up there and go for number 12.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions. Seeing none, we'll excuse the student-
athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow. We'll open up were a statement from
Coach Howland, then open the floor up to questions.  
Coach, as soon as you're ready.  
COACH HOWLAND: Happy to be here. Looking forward to playing tomorrow. Excited
that we fulfilled our goals in the regular season, which was to win our
conference, win our conference tournament, and, therefore, play as close to
home as possible in the NCAA tournament.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Ben, can you just give us an update on Luc. How he's looking?  
COACH HOWLAND: In practice today -- he did some shooting, but today he went
through a full practice. We only went for about an hour. We probably did
contact for about 15 minutes, and then a number of other things, five-on-zero
at full speed. And, you know, it still causes him some pain, to cut on it in a
certain way.  
But he'll start tomorrow. And he'll battle through, you know, the pain, and I
think it helps him to play tomorrow to get ready if we're fortunate enough to
win for a Saturday match-up.  
  
Q. Just wondering, in the course of just normal preparation, is it a little
tough tracking down, like, video on a Mississippi Valley State?  
COACH HOWLAND: We're one of the few schools in the country that I'm aware of
that does such a good job of archiving games throughout the year. So I have an
administrative assistant, Doug Erickson, along with our video coordinator,
Clay McKnight, but primarily Doug Erickson, and one of our managers that works
recording every game in the country that's on television throughout the entire
year. So we have over 1200 games when that tournament comes out on Sunday.  
We had three games on Mississippi Valley State because that's how many times
they played on TV on some satellite we were able to pick up. We had 11 on BYU
and 27 on Texas A&M.  
And so we're able to go to work right away as soon as 4:00 rolls around and
get our assistants going, and that makes a big difference. We have since sent
out and received more video on Mississippi Valley State. So we have about six
films on them now, which is, you know, about normal in preparation for a game
as we get ready.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their bigs, specifically Larry Cox and what you think
of them?  
COACH HOWLAND: I think Cox is really a good player. He's long. He's athletic.
He's got a very good jump hook. You know, he can face up and shoot at 17 feet.  
I like Speech. He's a very good shooter. He started, as well as coming off the
bench.  
Lucas is an outstanding player.  
Watson is very long and athletic.  
Clark can play.  
They have a lot of good players. And their two-point guards are very good,
Harmason and Davis. Davis is a young man originally from Los Angeles, very
quick, handles the ball well. So they're a team that, you know, out of this
SWAC conference, typically most of those teams have to play a murderous non-
conference schedule to earn revenue for their school.  
They probably play seven or eight guarantee games all against power
conferences, which is brutal. But when they got into their conference, then
they start to gain some confidence. They were 12-6. They finished in second in
their league, won their conference tournament. They're a team that's a veteran
team that primarily plays juniors and seniors for the majority of their
minutes.  
So we understand that we're going to have to play well to be successful
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Ben, you've had such great tournament runs last couple years and you
mentioned you've accomplished your regular-season goals. The post-season goal,
I am assuming, is a national title. Do you have any concern level at all that
if you don't reach that ultimate goal, that some people in the program are
going to be a little disappointed with this season?  
COACH HOWLAND: What people and what program?  
  
Q. Well, whether it be your own players or even boosters, alumni?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, of course we'd be disappointed if we don't win out. I
mean, but I think there's a lot of teams that feel that way.  
I mean, there's a lot of teams that enter this tournament, and I think that
there realistically is probably as many as a dozen teams that would have a
good shot of winning this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right seeing none, we'll thank Coach
Howland.  
COACH HOWLAND: Really? Is that all there is? I walked all the way down here
for four or five questions.  
  
Q. At Pittsburgh and NAU, I think you went to Utah, how much of it is an
advantage, like today. You were able to practice at Pauley, you know, 24 hours
before the NCAA tournament. How much of an advantage is that instead of
getting on a plane, getting into a hotel, finding a place to practice?  
COACH HOWLAND: No question it's an advantage to play close to home, also for
us, the fact that we're in finals right now, we had to move finals up. We are
actually in finals week. We had players that are still studying for finals. We
have a couple, you know, still taking finals tomorrow on the road or, excuse
me, Friday, being proctored. We're -- or back at school depending on our win
or a loss.  
But there's no question that being closer to home is an advantage for us to
not have to get on another plane at this time, and we earned that, though. We
understood that that was a goal of ours, was to be able to stay close to home
by winning the conference and then ultimately winning the conference
tournament.  
  
Q. Did you even speak about it in terms of more so than a one or two seed,
it was just staying in Anaheim?  
COACH HOWLAND: For me the most important thing, regardless of our seed, was
going to be to be kept in the west. Now, my understanding is that you're only
protected in that respect in the first or second line. So unless you are a one
or two seed, you could be sent out of the area. But that's why it was
important to be at least a two seed.  
  
Q. This team won some games early in the season by 30 or more points. When
you are in that kind of situation during a game, what is it that you look to
accomplish or maybe set yourself up for for the next game, whether it's
getting some guys rest or what can you make in those situations that will help
you down the road?  
COACH HOWLAND: Boy, I just hope we have another game like that, that would be
great.  
We did have a game like that against Cal last Thursday in the first round of
the PAC-10 tournament. We were up 30, and that actually afforded us to get
some rest for the guys for the next game the next day. But that's a good
problem. I can't even imagine thinking that way right now.  
  
Q. How much time do your assistants -- I know you already, when you get the
first and second round match-ups or potential match-ups, assign assistant
coaches to those other teams. How well do you know BYU and Texas A &M at this
point and how much time --   
COACH HOWLAND: Pretty good. There's probably four or five films watching each
of the opponents in the second round. If we get past the first, then obviously
we'll watch more including tomorrow's game, which will be the most recent game
they've played to be able to study.  
So we try to do a good job in that way.  
Thanks. Appreciate it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Taj Finger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18249)

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Mitch Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18248)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get, Mitch, your impressions of Cornell's three-point
shooting ability and what you feel Stanford has to do to try to limit those
open looks?  
MITCH JOHNSON: From the film we've watched, definitely very good shooting
team. I think we watched some of the game film against Duke, and they
definitely didn't look very intimidated at all and played very aggressively
and seemed like they do a lot of good things to get their perimeter open for
three-point opportunities. I think they shoot over 40% on the year. So that
will definitely be something we'll focus on going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. And if you could extend that also to Wittman, in particular, and how he
gets his open looks and what Stanford has to do against him?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think they do a good job of floor spacing. I think he does a
very good job, too, of, especially early on in the play, kind of getting his
feet ready. He catches and shoots pretty quick. I think we'll just have to do
a good job of staying with him and not really getting lost in transition and
giving up some three-point shots in transition.  
  
Q. This is for both players. How are you guys handling this? You know, you
guys are expected to win now. It's different for you guys. I mean, how are you
guys handling this as the favorite?  
TAJ FINGER: You know, basically just like any other game. We know that
Cornell's a tough team. Obviously, they won the Ivy League. Anybody can beat
anybody on any given night if you are not going to play 100% and play real
hard. So everyone's real focused and we're just going to play really hard no
matter who we play.  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think, like Taj said, I mean, it's the NCAA tournament, so
you think everyone will be up and ready for the game. You know, now, if you
lose, there's no second chances, no tomorrows. So I think everyone's playing
with their backs against the wall. And we're just excited to go out there and
play in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. This is for Mitch. Does it ever enter into your game preparation or
thinking about your opponent, someone like Cornell who you know, are going
through some of the same academic difficulties that you guys might be going
through. Does that help in your preparation or is this just basketball?  
MITCH JOHNSON: It's just basketball. I think, you know, however people's
schedules fall for academics and things like that is pretty minor. I think at
this point of the year, you play 30-odd games, you've been on the road so you
know how to kind of juggle all that at this point. If you've been successful
enough to get to the NCAA tournament, all the outside factors are basically
thrown out the window and it comes down to that 40 minutes of basketball.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, Mitch, then, what do you think of the people
who are calling this the battle of the nerds?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I mean, that's fine. I mean, we both go to two good academic
schools. And I guess I'd rather get publicity for going to a smart school than
not a smart school. So at the end of the day, I guess it's just another
feather in both our hats and Cornell's, that we're able to be successful in
basketball and be able to go to such successful academic schools.  
  
Q. Mitch, curious, when you saw film of Louis Dale, what your impressions of
his game were and what he does within Cornell's system?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think he a key to a lot of what they do. I think he plays at
a very good pace. I think he pushes the ball, but really never gets too out of
control, from what I've seen. He makes a lot of those guys better on his team.
And seems like he hits a lot of open jump shots when you might start helping
too much on the other guys. So I think he kind of is just their general and
does a lot of things.  
And, you know, he's a tough player. Be exciting to go up against him. I think
he was player of the year, too, in their conference, So he is obviously a big
part of what they do and will probably come out and be very aggressive
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Taj, you guys obviously are going to decide things on the basketball
court tomorrow, but if it came down to a classroom match-up which school do
you think might prevail?  
TAJ FINGER: I'm not going lie it's probably going be them. Hopefully tomorrow
we'll show we're the better basketball team. But, you know, we have a ton of
smart guys on the team, but I think we might be a little bit more geared to
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Taj, I will ask you, being a New York
native, are you familiar with Cornell?  
TAJ FINGER: Not really. I think I've got one friend from high school who goes
there, but I think it's about five hours from my hometown, so not really.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll dismiss the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
We're joined by head Coach Trent Johnson. As usual, we'll open it up with a
statement from the coach, then open the floor to questions.  
COACH JOHNSON: Needless to say, we're excited to be here, and, you know,
probably more excited to be out of an extremely tough PAC-10 conference season
and PAC-10 tournament. So we're looking forward to playing somebody else quite
frankly.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up the floor.  
  
Q. You were talking about the PAC-10 and everything, and how much of a toll
do you think that takes on teams as opposed to how well it prepares them for
something like this?  
COACH JOHNSON: I think the most important thing is it prepares you for
something like this. You know, there's not a level of skill, level from a
player's standpoint, there's not a team in terms of what they can throw at you
or throw at us, that we haven't seen up all year. So I think more importantly
it prepares you for the NCAA tournament. Throughout the year, if you lost
focus on a possession defensively or offensively, in our league, you were
going to struggle and probably going to get beat.  
Now you go into the NCAA tournament, where it's one game and if you don't play
well you go home. So I think it's prepared us.  
  
Q. For years, the PAC-10 and the Ivy League were the last two conferences
that didn't have post-season tournaments. Now obviously the PAC-10 has one and
the Ivy still doesn't. Are there any disadvantages or advantages that you see.
I mean, Cornell's had a lot of time off.  
COACH JOHNSON: They're probably more rested and fresh. No, not at all. I don't
think there's any advantage or disadvantages. You know, for us, we just know
there's about three to four things that we need to do really well that we've
done decently well all year - that's defending, rebound, and take care of it.  
Cornell is a basketball team that's won 15 in a row. Their last lost was
January 6, versus a very exceptional Duke team at Cameron Stadium. They beat
Siena, which is a basketball team we couldn't beat. They dominated Yale, and
Yale took us to a six- or seven-point game at our place in Maples. So we know,
for us, we need to be ready to play as well as we played all year to be
successful.  
  
Q. You played, I think, it's your sixth game in about the last two weeks and
here in Southern California, kind of mixed success - that heart break against
UCLA, won two games in the PAC-10 tournament, do you feel comfortable being
down here or would you rather be some place else in light of some of the
endings you've had in some of the games down here?  
COACH JOHNSON: I feel comfortable playing this time of year, no question. I
feel comfortable being here or anywhere else. Anywhere they want to send us.
As long as it's the NCAA tournament, we're comfortable. Six games that my kids
would much rather be playing than practicing, trust me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you want to address the size difference between your
team and Cornell. Obviously, the Ivy League, they have one seven-footer, you
have the Lopez twins. What's the difference or the challenge for you guys.  
COACH JOHNSON: The challenge is going be for us to be able to defend their
shooters. I mean, they have five or six kids that can shoot the ball from
deep. We're going to have to guard the three-point line. I don't think our
size is an advantage. We had two seven-footers and we've had a size advantage
all year long. At this nature of the game, I think the advantage, if you have
any, is who going to play, and play like they played all year long and be
relaxed in this environment and be able to play. That's the advantage, the
kids or team that's able to just relax and enjoy being here and play like they
played all year long.  
  
Q. What types of things before the season did you tell Brook you wanted him
to develop and improve upon and how did he do that, whatever those things
might have been?  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't know if I can say those things on the air (laughing).
For the most part, just wanted him to improve his practice habits, improve his
rebounding, improve his defense.  
Brook is very, very gifted offensively. And that's one of the areas as a coach
that you have to be smart enough know not to mess with. But, you know, Brook,
Robin, all our post players, I think the reason they're having so much success
is because of our perimeter play. As valuable as Brook Lopez is to our
basketball team, Mitch Johnson has done an exceptional job of be doing one of
the lost arts in basketball, that's being able to feed the post and manage the
team without scoring.  
You know, so Brook, Robin, Todd, Lawrence, without the play making ability of
Mitch, without the play making ability of Fred Washington, Anthony Goods, and
guys like that, I don't think we'd be here right now.  
  
Q. Why do you think that has been a lost art, being able to pass the ball
into the post, and what's the toughest thing about that?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I think because so much emphasis on what you see on TV is
the guy who scores, the guy who dunks, there's not a lot of paying attention
to the fundamental essence of what the game's about, passing and catching the
ball and being able to understand angles, being able offensively and
defensively. I mean it's the fundamental issues that sometimes we lose sight
of.  
And, yes, there's something to be said about a kid who can shoot a deep three
or a kid who can jump over the top of somebody and dunk. But, you know, when
you can pass the ball in the post, you can catch it with two hands, you can
set a good screen, all those plays are just as valuable as scoring the points.  
  
Q. Obviously we can see that the Lopez twins, their game is a little bit
different, their hair has gone in different directions. What are the
differences in their personalities both on and off the court?  
COACH JOHNSON: Robin is probably the more emotional one, and Brook is probably
the one that's more quiet. Although, you know, you put a microphone in front
of him on a good day, he'll talk to you, too. But the I think the safe thing
to say is Brook's a little quiet and more reserve, whereas Robin's probably a
little more emotional.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wonder what you said about getting into a comfortable
pattern of play, getting comfortable in this setting, and if it makes any
difference if you are a slow-down team or a team that wants to pace the game,
as opposed to speed it up, in terms of getting into a comfortable feel?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, you have to do what you have done all year long to get
you here. And it's been my experiences in basketball at all levels that when
you get to all championship-caliber play, the game starts to be a half-court
game.  
So I think we're prepared to play a half-court game. We're prepared to play
fast. Probably not because that's not what we've done all year long. So we're
going to defend, we're going rebound. We're going to try to limit a team's
transition baskets. We're going to try to get the shooters. We have to take
care of the ball and somewhere along the line, efficiency on offense is going
be important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Seeing none, we'll thank you, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you.

ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. This is for Ryan. Just wondered if you talked to your dad at all about
his experiences in the tournament, and obviously he had a lot of success, went
all the way, and how maybe that might benefit you at all in this experience?  
RYAN WITTMAN: You know, I've talked to him a little bit, but I think this is
kind of something you have to experience for yourself. There's only so much
you can really say about being in the tournament and stuff. He just told me to
go out and have fun and enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. This question is for Louis. Considering the difficult nature of the
academics at both universities here, Stanford and in Cornell, do you feel like
that helps you understand your opponent maybe a little better knowing they're
going through similar things that you guys are going through?  
LOUIS DALE: I just think -- I don't really think that helps very much. We're
going to play a basketball game, so, you know we're going to look at that,
focus in on what they do, how we're going to try to beat them. So I think, you
know, that's pretty much, you know, what we're focusing on.  
  
Q. Jason, it's been a long, long way for you. You're a senior now. You have
battled through injuries and now you are finally here. The team has finally
made it in 20 years. How are you feeling and can you describe this
experience?  
JASON HARTFORD: It's pretty hard to describe. I mean, you can't really put it
into words. I didn't even know I was going to have a chance this year to play.
But now that I have, being a part of this team, it's just unreal.  
  
Q. It's a question for both Ryan and Louis. Last year when Adam got hurt,
you two both had to carry much more of the burden of the scoring and leading.
In what ways do you think that that is paying dividends during this season?  
RYAN WITTMAN: I think it gave us some experience last year, definitely. You
know, going into the year, I think we were really going in planning on relying
on Adam, then seeing him go down in the first game, it was tough for us. But
it obviously hurt us as a team. But in terms of getting a lot more playing
time, I think it gave us more time to adapt to the college game being as young
as we were and everything.  
LOUIS DALE: You know, when Adam went down, I think my role on the team kind of
changed. I felt more like, you know, I had to carry some of his slack as far
as scoring. And, you know, it helped my confidence a lot. And, you know, it
definitely, you know, we played a lot more minutes in the game, I did. And so,
you know, that helped with the experience as well. So I think that kind of
transitioned over to this year, and so, you know, becomes more confident
player and just, you know, being a better college basketball player.  
  
Q. Adam, I guess how much of a concern has perhaps fallen into the trap of
just being happy to be here, and what has the team done and talked about this
week in terms of avoiding that trap and trying to win?  
ADAM GORE: I think that's something you have to worry about coming in here. A
lot of teams, maybe at all levels, like you said, are kind of just happy to be
in this situation. But I think Coach has done a good job of explaining to us
that, you know, we're good team. We think we have a chance to win a game out
here.  
You know, practices have been pretty intense. We've been working really hard
trying to see what we can do to better our chances against Stanford. So I
think the team has the right focus right now of thinking we're a good enough
team to go in there and win a game.  
As of right now, I don't think we've fallen into that trap. So we'll see come
tomorrow, I guess.  
  
Q. This is for Adam. Where do you think this team would be right now without
Jeff Foote, and particularly, both the season and also this match-up in
particular?  
ADAM GORE: I don't think we'd be sitting here talking to you, honestly. I
think adding Jeff, as just one more, you know, inside presence really changed
this team around. I think he came in kind of right at the beginning of our
transition phase, you know, kind of in a rough point in our season. That's
when you got to start playing.  
And the way he helped us out in the Ivy League season, creating really hard
match-ups for some of the other teams, I think really maybe pushed us over the
edge to get that Ivy League championship.  
So I think he is one of the main reasons why we're sitting here talking to you
guys today.  
  
Q. What about this game?  
ADAM GORE: Obviously, Stanford has two seven-footers. We only have one. But,
you know, it helps I guess, you know, with that match-up a little bit. I mean,
he's going to have a hard job, as well as Jason Hartford and Alex Tyler, but
he kind of helps. You know, that size advantage they have on a lot of teams,
he helps it a little bit, not a whole lot.  
But as far as being able to match up with these two a little bit better, he is
a really big part of that.  
  
Q. This is for Jason. Jason, what are your thoughts are going up against the
Lopezes?  
JASON HARTFORD: We've been watching a lot of film on them and we noticed we
have a couple strategies. But they're two big kids, you know, a lot bigger
than what we're used to in the Ivy League. It's just going be a challenge. I
think our biggest challenge, actually, is just to keep them off the glass. We
have to box out, create a big umbrella, and just battle with them nonstop the
whole game.  
  
Q. Louis, just wondered, what do you hope to do with your degree in policy
analysis and management?  
LOUIS DALE: Hopefully, you know, I can -- I want to go into investment
banking, you know, look at that. Policy analysis and management is sort of
like a business major with, like, a little side of policy, I guess. So that's
what I'm looking to do.  
  
Q. Adam, some people have called this sort of the battle of the nerds,
because obviously, these are two high-quality academic institutions. What's
your take on that?  
ADAM GORE: I've heard that a little bit, I guess, a lot of reporters asking
that question. But I don't think -- I'm sure if you asked Stanford the same
thing, we're not really focused on how hard Stanford's classes are or how well
they're doing. I think it's more we're focusing on the athletic side of it.  
Obviously, they're very good team. It just so happens to be they're a pretty
good institution as well. So we're not really focused on that part of the
match-up.  
  
Q. Louis, with Conor Mullen, your teammate playing with Mitch Johnson in
high school, have you been prying him for any strategy?  
LOUIS DALE: Yeah, Conor, you know, he's told me little things that Mitch might
do and what moves he might like to do. And, you know, maybe that will help
throughout in the game. So, you know, we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, seeing none, we'll dismiss
the student-athletes. Good luck tomorrow.  
Now we'll have Coach Steve Donahue. All right. We'll open this up with Coach
Steve Donahue with a statement from Coach, then open up the floor to
questions.  
STEVE DONAHUE: Obviously, we're honored to be here. This is an exciting time
for ourselves and our league. And it just has been a pleasure coaching these
guys. And we're excited about playing a team like Stanford, and obviously
playing in the NCAA tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Coach, did you guys have a little adventure coming over here on the bus
today?  
STEVE DONAHUE: About the what?  
  
Q. You guys were running a little late today. Was there some glitch with the
bus?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I don't want to point fingers, but a guy named Jeff Hall [] was
a little late getting to the bus. The guy's suppose to be running this trip
for us. I apologize.  
There was no real adventure. The NCAA has been unbelievable. We were actually
concerned getting out of Ithaca. We don't have a real close airport that can
usually handle bigger jets, so we were able to charter right out of Ithaca
into -- cold weather and get to warm weather, direct flight. It's been a
pleasure. And I'm pleased that the NCAA does things so nicely for us.  
  
Q. Coach, with you being the assistant head coach at Penn while they were
winning the Ivy League championships, can you reflect and tell us the feels
that you have now of actually being at the head of an Ivy League championship
winning team?  
STEVE DONAHUE: Well, it's obviously been a while since a non-Penn or Princeton
team has been here. So when I was at Penn, you know, I never took -- never
even thought about what it would feel like to bring another team here. But now
that we have, it's been a long time for me personally. It's been eight years
since I remember what this felt like.  
Over the last couple weeks, just to see the excitement in our campus, and from
our President down to the student body, as you well know, it's been so
gratifying to see all that excitement on our campus at this time of year. And
for us being here and just been a great ride. Obviously, we want it to
continue.  
  
Q. What were the reasons as you look back on it, why Penn and Princeton had
such a hammerlock on this thing? And what were the couple of key things to
breaking it as far as your program was concerned?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I think that's a great question, Mark. People ask me that quite
often, why can one league be dominated by two teams like in other leagues in
the country. As I said, I was there for ten years, and I didn't realize until
I went somewhere else, it's pretty simple. There's no quick fixes in our
league. We don't have scholarships. So you really got to recruit kids that fit
the mold of the Ivy League. And that type of kid -- and you're not going be
able to do that pretty quickly.  
As those two teams dominate, they continue that trend of taking all the kids
that are thinking about academics. And it just snowballs. And what I think has
happened over the last eight years since I left, there's been way more
aggressive recruiting, commitment to basketball at the other six schools. You
notice it in every aspect.  
And now I think you'll see great parity in our league. I have great respect
for the other teams.  
For us to go 14-0, we never have imagined we'd be able to do that. One,
because of our youth, and two, because I know the balance in this league. I
know it's strong and it's going to continue.  
  
Q. Steve, what do you tell your kids so that they don't get caught up in the
we're just happy to be here routine that some schools who rarely appear do?  
STEVE DONAHUE: You know, this group has really amazed me in their levelness of
their approach. Almost to -- I was upset at it, because of the lack of
enthusiasm and energy sometimes these kids show. But we went to Syracuse, and
I thought we played not to win, and that was disappointing. But I didn't feel
a tentativeness. I just felt they didn't understand what a great opportunity
it was to play the team. Ten days later, we turn around and play at Duke. Once
again, I looked in the locker room and I didn't sense an excitement or
nervousness.  
Then they go out and play and execute and do all those things that you need to
and that was a game that went up and down. And we had every chance to win the
game. It's just not a group that's, you know, amazingly as young as we are,
they're not overwhelmed by this situation. If we lose, I feel confident that
we're going to lose because Stanford's a better basketball team and not that
we're overwhelmed with this stage.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you say the teams health is right now considering the
long flight. Would you say they're just running on emotion now or do you feel
like everybody's fully rested and back to normal?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I think we're in great shape. We had -- obviously, we hadn't
played in about 12 days. Everybody's healthy. I think the energy level's
great. Typically, this time of year, teams that played three or four games
over the last weekend, we didn't. I think we're in great shape for that.  
I think that's an advantage. I know that the layoff -- you can say those
things, but this time of year, I love that our guys are fresh, really do.
Especially the way we got to play. To play a team that's as physical as
Stanford we're going to need our legs. We're going to need to be able to shoot
the ball from far late in the game. I think all of that is an advantage for
us.  
  
Q. What was Ryan Wittman like in high school? What was the recruiting
process like and who did you have to compete with to get him?  
STEVE DONAHUE: A lot of this stuff happens, luck, Mark. Ryan was probably a
little less developed than most guys at that age. So as a Junior, he's a
little frail, a little less tall than he is now. And then the key part of it
is in recruitment he had an injury, his deep thigh bruise in July going into
his senior year. So he just wasn't moving like a Division I player. So I think
guys just moved on. We were fortunate enough that my assistant Izzie met --
saw a lot of him in his junior year, saw him playing healthy, talked to his
dad and just saying how he was a late bloomer, that he's going to grow and all
those things. And by the time he walked on our campus, he was already more
developed than I could imagine physically and basketball-wise.  
And he's obviously a terrific all-around player who works extremely hard at
his game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, with that, thank you, coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
STEVE DONAHUE: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. Larry, can you talk about UCLA's front court, what sorts of problems they
present, what you have seen from them on film.  
LARRY COX: Yeah, they're all big, fast, something we usually don't see in our
conference. But, we're going to be up for the task tomorrow.  
  
Q. Stanford, I'm just wondering from your perspective, you kind of had to
know going in you were going to get a tough draw. Does it really matter to you
who specifically you ended up drawing for this game?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, it really didn't matter, because out of a lot of top
teams like North Carolina, Memphis, they're all tough. But when we found out
who we were playing, I talked to one of my teammates and laughed a little bit
saying, "We're going to Disneyland."  
But we didn't come out here to go to Disneyland. We came out here to play a
game. And we just want to be the best 16 seed in the tournament.  
  
Q. It's a question for all of you guys. The problem for the 16's, none of
them have ever won. Why could you guys be the first?  
THE MODERATOR: Carl, why don't you take that first.  
CARL LUCAS: Well, I think if we come out and play the kind of game that we've
been playing the last ten games and play together, play as hard as we can, we
can probably give ourselves a chance. Because, you know, we're the number 16
seed, and they're number 1. That's all we can do, is come out and play hard
and give all the effort that we have. I have faith in that.  
LARRY COX: I have trust in my teammates and the coaching staff. They prepared
us good enough to come play hard. We've been doing that all year. We're not
going to change anything. We're going to go play our game like we've been
doing all year.  
STANFORD SPEECH: I just want to say, do you guys remember Appalachian State?
How many of you guys picked them to beat Michigan? They say college
basketball, the parity level is going up and we just want to go out and give
ourselves a chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Stanford, what happened against Washington State?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, you know, it was a little bit, you know, we kind of
tried to go with the game, coach gave us a game plan, and we tried to follow
it. You know, we didn't make shots and, you know, that's what happens when you
play a top team. They were bigger. We didn't have any size. There's a lot of
things you can see happened, but we just didn't play as well as we should
have.  
  
Q. Are you confident this outcome could be a little different than that, and
why will this be different than what happened up there?  
STANFORD SPEECH: We're not the same team at the end of the season. We didn't
have Larry and we're playing better now. So, of course I think we should have
a better chance than we did then.  
  
Q. This is for Stanford. You guys will on a national stage tomorrow. A lot
of people might not know much about Mississippi Valley State. What will you
hope they learn after tomorrow's game, win or lose?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, you know, I just want them, after the game, to know
that Mississippi Valley State is a group of guys who are going to play hard,
play together, and, you know, just, you know, a defensive-minded team, you
know, love playing basketball, all the good things you want to know about a
team.  
I want the fans that came out to see that we think we can win, you know. We're
not looking at this game -- we know the odds and we're going to go out and
give it the best shot we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Gentlemen, thank you for coming up.  
Coach Green.  
COACH GREEN: Obviously we're excited to be in the NCAA tournament. I'm very
proud of our guys. I think they worked very hard to earn it and have an
opportunity to come out and compete. I heard you ask questions about which
number one seed, and obviously in this part of the country if you got a chance
to play a team like UCLA with all the tradition, it's something that our kids
will be able to remember for a long, long time.  
And obviously we need to be thinking about playing basketball and try not to
be in awe of playing against them. And that's not an easy thing to do, but
that would have to be our goal in order to have a chance to play against them.  
  
Q. I know you have a friendship with Tim Floyd that goes back, and I know he
said he gave you a call. Just wondered, has he given you any little background
on playing UCLA, any help that way?  
COACH GREEN: No. No.  
You know, I think -- he called and just congratulated me after we played our
tournament. And, obviously, he's busy worrying about himself. So, you know, he
did call after we played on Saturday in the tournament and congratulated us on
making the tournament.  
  
Q. You guys are on a nice little winning streak right now. What's maybe been
there that was absent before in terms of the play way you're playing?  
COACH GREEN: I think we had a lot of new players coming into the mix. After
our first semester, we added Larry Cox back who had been out with an injury
during the first part of our season. And Chris Watson is a player that became
eligible at semester. And I think if you combine that with playing a lot of
players that had not been in the program, I think it just took some time for
them to come together as a group. I think we were competitive.  
I think we lost five of our six games within the league by four points or
less. We started off 0 and 2 and was somewhat up and down emotionally. Played
well in some games, then not as well as we needed to in some games.  
And I think one of the things that really helped this group was playing an in-
state rivalry on their home court against Elkhorn and getting beat on a last-
second shot in overtime from three-quarter lengths of the court really did
something for us.  
And we were able to win four out of six on the road to finish up our
conference season, and go into the conference tournament and play three teams
that we've played the last three games of our season at their place. And to be
able to do that and then win those games again in the conference tournament, I
think was something very good for our players.  
But I think overall it was just a determination, became a lot stronger after
that shot at Elkhorn. Not that we weren't making progress throughout the
season, but I think that really elevated us to a new level of intensity. And I
think we just decided whatever it would take, no matter whether it looked good
or didn't look good, that we just needed to try to find a way to win games.  
  
Q. Coach, quick question. One of the things that Coach Howland brought up
was the fact they were able to get video of you fairly quickly. What video
have you watch on UCLA and what do you think of the Bruins?  
COACH GREEN: Well, we watched a game against Washington. We watched some film,
different games. They played against Memphis, which is in our area, games that
we could pick up. And they're very good. They're very tough. I mean, they're
players that play for UCLA. That's the number one seed. And, you know, they're
quick.  
Obviously, Collison [] is very tough up front, and Love inside. Their size and
strength and their determination on the defensive end is something that will
be very tough for us to match up against.  
But we have to try to do the fundamental things of team basketball in order to
have a chance to play against them. And that's basically pass and catch, and
if we have layups, be able to make layups. If you get free throws, make your
free throws, make sure we understand the shot selection, try to get back and
not give them easy shots, things of that nature.  
  
Q. Coach, your players mentioned it, and I think everyone around this game
has, the fact that 16 seeds are 0-92 in this match-up with a number one?  
COACH GREEN: That's encouraging isn't it (laughing).  
  
Q. How do you approach that subject with your players?  
COACH GREEN: Well, one of the things that, again, we go back to the first
people that we have to compete against is ourselves, and make sure that we're
determined to go and do the best that we can. Hopefully, people will be able
to recognize us as a team regardless. Of the difference in the levels of the
two conferences or two teams, that we try to go out and do the things that it
takes to play basketball.  
But we've got to try to be the best number 16 seed that's ever played in the
tournament. You know, and even if we do that, even if each one of our players
played the best game that they've ever played in their life, and we played the
best game that we played all season long, the odds are still against us. But
at least at that point, we'll be able to see where we are within the game if
we could have those things happen.  
But that's the type of effort that it takes, and that's the type of motivation
I want our guys to have. If, for some reason, it doesn't happen that way, then
I don't want them to consider themselves as losers, because they earned this
opportunity. Not in the game that we're going to play, but the things we were
able to do down the stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, in the overall scheme of things, what does it mean to Mississippi
Valley basketball program to make the tournament and also play UCLA tomorrow
night?  
COACH GREEN: Well, I think obviously it means quite a deal to our university
which is a fine university. You know, most people know us as the school that
Jerry Rice attended. But at the same time, I think it gives us something as a
university, as a community, as alumni and fans, to be very proud of. That
we're a small school, our budgets are not nearly the same, but at the same
time, here we are in a situation that we're represented, like a lot of other
people will be represented in this tournament.  
And, you know, from this day on, there's going to be -- how many teams play,
64? After that first round there will only be 32. So those teams are going to
get the publicity until you're out.  
So that's something that we can't pay for at Mississippi Valley. And I think
it gives our players a lot of pride in what we try to do.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you get the team to, I guess, kind of recover and respond
after the Washington State loss?  
COACH GREEN: You know, we try to keep those games in perspective. Obviously,
that was a tough situation for us. Again, we're playing with two different
players that we didn't have at that time. It was very, very early in our non-
conference. I thought they played very well. Their size was a huge factor in
us not being able to score the ball around the basket and we didn't shoot it
well from the perimeter.  
But when you play as many guarantee games, as we call them in the coaching
profession, as we have to play, you have to put all of those games behind you
once you play them. We go into those games trying to learn, trying to get
better, trying to have an opportunity for our guys to play against some of the
best players around the country.  
So our goals in those games - obviously, we want to win the game. Don't have
no mistake about that - is that we're playing, we prepare to try to win. But
we try to be realistic. And that's something that's -- there's a fine line
between being realistic and believing that you can win. But we believe that if
we do certain things, that we'll have an opportunity.  
Now, physically, or from the standpoint of God-given ability, sometimes we
can't get those things done. And so we were able to put that behind us and
move on to the next game and find some things that we did positive in that
game. And obviously, we realize that that can happen to us. So we're a little
bit more guarded against that.  
  
Q. By any chance have you heard from Jerry Rice since this all came about?  
COACH GREEN: I have not personally heard from him. But, you know, we've been
fairly busy. I think he possibly may have made contact with someone at the
university. But not myself personally.  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH GREEN: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Trent, have you looked over game tapes? Could you break down this match-
up for us and kind of what you guys need to do?  
TRENT PLAISTED: Um, obviously I'm not a coach, so I don't really -- I get to
say what I think, but they'll tell you probably something different. They're a
really, really good team. From top to bottom, they're' very talented. Their
inside guys are big and physical. They're relentless on the offensive glass
and their guards are capable of really getting going and lighting it up from
outside as well.  
So we got our hands full. So we got to come up, and we have a good game plan
ready, and hopefully, we'll be able to get a win.  
  
Q. Sam, how do you guys feel about the seeding? Are you guys okay where you
are? Do you just feel like you just play who you get? Or do you worry about
things like where you are seeded?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, you know, of course we're happy to be in the tournament,
regardless. And I think you hope for the best. And, you know, of course we're
hoping for a little better seed, but, you know, we're happy. We know that all
the teams in this thing are great teams, and so you're going to play a good
team regardless of your seed.  
And so, you know, Texas A&M is a great team and we're happy about it and we
know it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Sort of following up on that, if you look ahead, and I know everybody
does look ahead, you can't say that you don't, you would possibly face a
Number 1 seed. And when you think about your seeding and what a possible
second-round match-up is, do you get disappointed a little bit obviously what
would be a tall task?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, yeah, just, you know, if we happen to get there and play
UCLA, that's an unbelievable team and program, and we played them last year,
so we're not unfamiliar with teams like that. And so you're right, it would be
a great team in the second round, and if they would win. But that's -- you
know, they're all good and you're going to have to play a good team sooner or
later, that's the seed.  
  
Q. For Sam. UCLA obviously has a lot of great basketball tradition. What's
it like being in a place where you're trying to build that tradition, and sort
of from the ground level?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, you know, since Coach Rose has been here, this is his third
year, and, you know, the program's just, as far as our seasons, have taken a
step up every year, and we're hoping to just build on what we've done the last
two years, and hopefully make some waves in the tournament and get some wins.  
And so, you know, it's a big deal. And we're happy to play teams like that.
UCLA and Texas A&M, they're great schools and programs. And so we welcome that
and we're ready for any challenge.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to take this, BYU's been to the tournament a lot, four
other times, this being the fifth in eight years, but hasn't gotten out of the
first round. How would you guys maybe explain that?  
TRENT PLAISTED: This is only my second tournament, so I don't try to explain
what happened in the previous tournaments and stuff like that. But that
stuff's all in the past, and we're looking forward to this year. And this is
-- you know, we're the same seed as we were last year and we're in a good
situation to hopefully come out and play well and get a win.  
Obviously, we want to advance in this tournament, every team does, but all we
can do is focus on our effort and come out and play our best game and play
hard and that's all we can control.  
THE MODERATOR: Lee do you have any thoughts on that?  
LEE CUMMARD: No. What he said was great. (Laughing).  
  
Q. Lee, what experiences from last year's tournament trip do you take with
you this year that you think will help you in this performance?  
LEE CUMMARD: I think last year, I mean, going away from the game, I felt like
I didn't play my best game and didn't contribute as much as I could. And what
I can take away from that is not, you know, play so you don't have to have
that feeling again and contribute as much as you can.  
As far as the team, I thought we played collectively pretty well as far as
effort. And we got to do the same thing again this year. And hopefully we can
make more plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what a physical style you expect from Texas A &M
inside tomorrow. They seem to be one of those teams that's very physical.   
TRENT PLAISTED: Yeah, um, Texas A&M just like all schools kind of have those
two big post guys they play at a time. You know, they're on the offensive
glass and guarding the post, I mean it's hard to describe. Like this year,
we've played teams like Michigan State and Louisville. These are teams that
are all physical, similar to Texas A&M. So it's going to be a challenge
keeping them off the glass and doing things like that.  
But, you know, as hard as it will be to match up with them, I think we present
our own match-up problems as well.  
  
Q. For Lee. I'm sure you guys know about Josh Carter, Dominique Kirk got hot
last week in the Big 12 tournament. Can you just talk about what you have
heard or what you have seen and what you guys know about Texas A &M's back
court?   
LEE CUMMARD: All we heard is they're great shooters and they can shoot in
bunches. Also heard Carter led the NCAA or the nation in three-point shooting
last year. And so we're going to have to go after the shots and also just keep
our man in the front of us and not let them get to the middle so it creates
more open shots.  
But great players from what I've seen and really good shooters.  
THE MODERATOR: Trent, you said that you think you guys present some match-up
problems as well for them. Do you want to expand on that a little bit.  
TRENT PLAISTED: No. I'm good where I'm at right now. (Laughing).  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have any other questions?  
  
Q. Trent, wanted to ask you, how strongly did you consider Texas A &M coming
out of Clark High School?   
TRENT PLAISTED: Coming out of high school, to be honest, not so much, just
because I had other interests. BYU obviously was high on my list due to the
fact that I'm a Mormon kid and stuff like that. But, you know, A & M's built
such a great program since I left high school. When I came out of high school,
I was getting recruited by the former coach before Billy Gillespie even came
there. Since Billy Gillespie got there and what has continued on since then is
totally different from when they recruited me.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Lee, could you guys learn anything from the last game that you played and
maybe apply it towards this first-round game?  
LEE CUMMARD: Yeah, we got to show up in the second half. But watching the film
that the coaches showed us, it looked like we just -- we rolled over and kind
of just took it. We didn't play our game in the second half. Energy wasn't
there. We got to play for 40 minutes if we're going to be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Good luck tomorrow, gentlemen.  
We'll open up with Coach Rose's statement. Go ahead, Coach.  
COACH ROSE: First of all, we're really excited to be in the tournament. And we
-- and I'm very proud of our team and how we have responded over the course of
the year. We've been extremely consistent, being able to win the Mountain West
Conference regular season championship is a big accomplishment for our team,
and we're looking forward to a very talented Texas A&M team. And know our
players will be ready and it will be real competitive game.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up to questions.  
  
Q. Dave, as a player at Houston looking back, did you appreciate how hard it
is to win NCAA tournament games compared to being a coach now?  
COACH ROSE: Well, the first -- my first experience, we got beat in the first
round by Villanova in Charlotte, and I just remember as a player how much I
wanted to have the opportunity to get back in the tournament and play again.
And the following year, I had knee surgery and red-shirted. Then the next year
ended up being my senior year, we had that opportunity, got back in the
tournament, made a nice run, made it to the championship game. And I do
remember the time between our first loss in the tournament and the opportunity
to play again, about how I just wanted another opportunity to see how we would
do.  
  
Q. Dave, does Texas A &M remind you of anyone that you have played this year
so far? Do they match up the same way?   
COACH ROSE: Well I told our team the other night as we were going through some
scouting reports and personnel issues, it reminds me of TCU in our league of
how they play. I think that they're a lot more physical at the guard line,
have more depth at the guard line and in the post, they're bigger, stronger
players. But they play kind of the same way. They really rely on offensive
rebounds to score. They set a lot of ball screens, a lot of their guards allow
their guards to penetrate and make plays. Then it's great rebounding team. And
those are things that we'll have to try and prepare for.  
  
Q. How do you feel about seedings, or are you a guy that doesn't worry about
seedings, you just go play who you play and you're not too much worried? And
my follow-up question to that is, when you were at Houston and Number 6 beat
you guys for the championship. So where do you fall on seeding?  
COACH ROSE: Well, the thing is, I believe that, you know, seeding is very -- I
mean, it's a very real part of the NCAA tournament, but match-ups also become
a real key. And there are some teams that are seeded, you know, maybe a lot
higher that you might match-up a little better against or worse or whatever
the situation is.  
But once the bracket's announced and you have been assigned who you are going
to play, it's time to go to work and, you know, deal with the challenge that
you have. And so that's exactly how we felt at about 4:45 on Sunday afternoon.
We got a big challenge, we're playing a good team, and we're really excited to
be in the tournament and let's get ready.  
  
Q. Dave, could you describe your vision on how far reaching a win at this
tournament could be for your program?  
COACH ROSE: Well, right now, we're in the process of preparing to win a game,
and that process seems very, very familiar and normal for us because we've
been doing this for three or four months now. And that's really about as far
as I can think. We're preparing for this game. We've got a challenge. We've
got a game plan that we're trying to get our players more familiar with as we
approach the game tomorrow.  
And we'll spend time between now and then trying to help them get in a
situation where they can execute that game plan, and then look forward to the
tip.  
Then once the game starts, you've got your challenge, then we'll see what
happens afterwards.  
  
Q. Follow up on that, though, how important is being successful in the
tournament in terms of a program's national reputation or establishing a
national reputation? Where do you think tournament success rates in that?  
COACH ROSE: Well, I think that, you know, in today's era of college basketball
that, you know, media, fans, everyone starts -- they start talking about
teams' resumes in November for the national tournament. And so now that you
are here, you want to seize that opportunity and do the best you can. And
that's what we'll expect our players to do, is to give their very best effort.
And, you know, our goal is to advance in this tournament, see how far we can
go, and see what we can do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the Aggies' inside game, just kind of what
match-up problems they give you?  
COACH ROSE: Well, you know, they've got five really good post players, you
know. And DeAndre is really, really long and Jones's got a lot of experience,
is extremely physical, and Davis can really -- has got really good footwork
and is good around the basket. And I don't know how to say it, Number 41
(Chinemelu Elonu) is a real athletic type player. So their post presence on
the floor at all times will be an issue with our team.  
The biggest key for us, I think, is to try to keep them away from the basket
as much as we can, not only on the offensive end, but after the ball's shot to
try to keep them away and just limit them to one opportunity. It's a very good
offensive rebounding team. It's a team that really tracks down loose balls
very well. Very physical and athletic. So those are issues that we'll have to
deal with.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, seeing none, thank you,
Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Ramel Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16431)

### [Joe Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16439)

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. This is for Joe. You know, it is seems like this March so much attention
is going to some of the freshmen out there who are making a big splash. Can
you talk about being an upper-classmen and maybe what you've learned over the
time of being in the game that can help you at this time of year?  
JOE CRAWFORD: You know, just experience. You know, I think a lot of freshmen
don't realize, you know, how important it is at this time to just play your
hardest. A lot of things ain't going to go your way. You know in March, you
just have to play your toughest.  
  
Q. Do you ever feel like the old guys get overlooked sometimes because
everyone's wondering about the one-and-done types?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, well, they're great players, you know, and they're
having tremendous years. So I think, you know, they deserve some of the
recognition they're getting.  
  
Q. Ramel, could you just talk a little bit about the whole atmosphere. You
guys are down here in California. Just talk about how special this tournament
is to you.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, it's very special to us, and I think this time making the
tournament is even more special because of, you know, where we came from in
the beginning of the year. We weren't playing really good and everybody had
us, you know -- just counted us out. To see us go through so much improvement
to make the tournament is just really special.  
  
Q. For both you guys. Could both of you all talk a little bit about how
coach influenced you all's turnaround, and what was it like with him here in
this first season and just talk about the big picture of working with Billy.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think, you know, in the beginning, it was pretty tough
because there was a lot of things that we weren't use to it, was just so tough
for us, you know, as far as just conditioning and just, you know, preparation
for practice and those things, just things we weren't use to. It took sometime
for us to, you know, kind of understand and just learn the things that coach
really wanted from us.  
You know, it's been if not probably the funnest year, you know, of my college
career, and, you know, just to see us improve each and every day.  
JOE CRAWFORD: I think the biggest difference for me was a change, as well. You
know, just going through a certain thing for three years and to have a new
philosophy, you know, to totally adapt to, was the biggest challenge for me.  
  
Q. It seems strange to think of Kentucky as an underdog. Given your history.
Do you guys think of yourselves as underdogs in this tournament?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think we do, just from the perspective of, you know,
just the media and, you know, how people just count us out and don't think we
can win and things like that. But I think that's the best place to be in, you
know, when no one believes in you and you just have to in yourself and just
come once together as a team. Think those are the best positions to be in.  
JOE CRAWFORD: Yeah, I think, you know, we're looked at as the underdog this
year. But I think, you know, it's working to our advantage. I think it allows
for some of the Younger players to have some pressure, you know, off of them
and be able to perform.  
  
Q. Guys, for both of you, do you all remember watching the '03 game with
Marquette for a chance to go to the final four? Do you remember that game at
all?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't remember it.  
JOE CRAWFORD: I kind of remember it. Dwyane Wade kind of put on a show. That
was just kind of the story.  
  
Q. Question for Ramel, who I believe is also from that city. Earlier in this
season, Patrick Patterson said that you're calm and cool and not screaming and
yelling as much any more. Is that true and what brought about the change?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't know if that's totally true. I just think, you know,
just having a coach like Coach G, and a very great coaching staff, they just
kind of help me and Joe both learn how to lead and just learn the right way
and the things to say at the right times and those kind of things that we
didn't understand in the past.  
  
Q. Ramel, this is for you. Joe, kind of talked about it earlier, can you
just talk about how much you think your experience especially in the
tournament can help you guys and what lessons you learned from your guys
previous experiences in the tournament?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think the main thing that you learn is, you know, when
it's -- because the game is about runs. In the NCAA tournament, everybody can
be a little tense because if you lose, it's all over. So I think you just have
to learn and be poised.  
Teams are going have runs, you just have to learn how to pick and choose and
to make your moves.  
  
Q. Ramel, forgive me if this has already been asked because I kind of just
walked in here but earlier in the season you guys lost some games that
probably you guys didn't think you should have. Did you envision at that time
or did you doubt that you might actually make it to this?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think for, you know, representing the University of
Kentucky, you never doubt that you are going to be in the tournament. But I
think I just think knowing that our coach, he just has so much belief in us,
you know, it was hard for us to doubt ourselves.  
So, you know, he just continued to tell us, hey, around SEC time, we're going
to pick things up and be right where we want to be. Surely enough, he was
right. We just kept improving each and every day.  
And here we are.  
  
Q. For both guys, what would you say the lowest point was this year?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, I can't pick a specific time. I think probably the
beginning of the year when, you know, we weren't winning the games that we
thought we should have won, it was probably the lowest point, I think.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I think, I mean, we lost to Gardner-Webb, you're like, this is
ridiculous, things can't get any worse at Kentucky. But then when you lose --  
JOE CRAWFORD: To San Diego.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: -- to San Diego, it can get worse. You're just like, oh, God,
like, just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. I think those are
probably the low points.  
  
Q. For Ramel again. Speaking of things getting worse, what was it like last
weekend in all that mess?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: It was chaotic. I mean, first we were reading, you know, just
ready and focus to come out and play against Georgia that Friday night. And
then as the tornado and the game gets cancelled and then, you know, just -- we
just kind of lost the opportunity for having a bye, because it gives Georgia
another day. Then we play the next day early in the morning. It's small gym.
And I don't know it was just -- it was really just chaotic.  
THE MODERATOR: Joe, you have any thoughts on that?  
JOE CRAWFORD: Like Ramel said, we lost our opportunity, the advantage of
having a bye. Then all of the mental preparation it takes to get prepared for
a game, you got to do the same thing over again for the same team. It's kind
of draining, I think. That was tough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, student athletes. Good luck tomorrow.  
We'll start this off with a statement from Coach Gillespie, then we'll open it
up to questions.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Really excited to be out here in California, and I look
forward to playing against a very, very worthy and deserving opponent in
Marquette. A very, very difficult match-up for us. But we're excited about
what we've been able to accomplish over the last couple of months. And we're
looking forward to continuing to play and continuing our season.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Simple question for you. Has your dream job been all you thought it would
be?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It's been fantastic. Every job I've ever had was my dream
job. And when I was coaching at Ellisson High School in Texas that was my
dream job at the time. People say things about dream jobs or whatever, some
aren't true, some are. The dream job I have right now is at Kentucky, and I've
-- it's been -- I knew it would be great and it's been better than I thought
it could ever be.  
  
Q. Is that because of just the challenges that come with it, the challenges
of the season, the expectations of the fans, just all of it?  
BILLY GILLISPIE: Everything. There's so much passion there it's unbelievable.  
The passion of fans, and it's from seven-year-old youngsters to 89-year-old
people that are getting up in years or whatever, and no matter what age, no
matter what gender or whatever, everyone has a sincere passion for it. It's
not three or four months out of the season. It's 365 days a year for some that
would be too much. For me, it's a perfect situation because that's the way I
am as well. And the resources, the support that you get, I mean, there's a
reason that they've won more games in college basketball than anyone else and
won more tournament titles than anyone else other than UCLA. So they have
unbelievable support. They do whatever it takes for you to have the best
chance to win.  
That's why they've been able to attract the absolute best players year after
year after year for so many years. And hopefully we'll continue to do that.
And you get the as good or better exposure as anyone in the country and that
where recruits want to come and play. So there's just so many things that are
going into your favor.  
  
Q. The win over Tennessee seemed to launch this run to the end of the
season. At the time, did you sense that that could happen, or did you -- I
mean, because you guys had come out of a bad patch at that point. Was that
kind of a turning point for your team?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Really we hadn't been in a bad patch. The game before that,
we lost at Florida in overtime. The game before that, we played without Jodie
Meeks and Derrick Jasper and lost by five at a very, very underrated
Mississippi State team. The game before that, we beat previously undefeated
Number 13 or 14 Vanderbilt team on our home court. So I don't know what kind
of bad patch that is.  
But we had been playing very well going into that. We didn't play very well in
November and December, if that's what you were referring to. But once we got
in the conference, we played very well with the exception of one game.  
We had -- counting the conference tournament, we had 17 games, and 16 of them
were decided in the last minute. I think that's something that really bodes
well for you for your post-season opportunities and post-season chances. We've
had so many great players. I mean, great plays made by Ramel Bradley and Joe
Crawford, clutch seniors. And that's what we've tried to do. We try to really
get good at defense and rebounding. Try to limit our turnovers and those kind
of things, and let those guys impose their will the last five minutes of the
game and they've been solid as a rock every single time.  
So as far as launching anything, I think that if you have the correct
philosophy, you don't look for something to happen, I think that you have to
have great consistency with your workouts, with your attitudes, with your
resiliency, and all those kind of things. And I think that if you continue
those things over time, then you're going to be happy with the results over
time.  
I don't think that you hope, hey, we're going have a big day today, but next
time, it's not going to be very good. I think when you have great practices,
when you have great attitudes, when you have great intangibles that this team
obviously has possessed, then you have a chance to get on a roll and win 12
out of 14 games in the Southeastern Conference, one of the best conferences in
the country.  
  
Q. Coach Gillispie, you guys are coming from Kentucky all the way to
California. Cornell is coming from New York all the way to California. How is
your team dealing with the travels and what type of schedule are you guys
operating on and what are you doing to reduce the affects of such travel?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I didn't hear one of those.  
THE MODERATOR: What are you doing to the affects of jet lag, travel lag coming
from the east.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I'm not in all that kind of stuff. I'm old school on a lot of
things. And Marquette's coming from a long way. Cornell's coming from a long
way. Stanford's coming from a short distance. But we're -- we came out here to
play basketball. They'll tip it up tomorrow and we'll play the best that we
possibly can. None of those kind of things -- I probably should be more in
tune with them.  
Other than drinking a lot of water, and I think water is a miracle drug. And
we make them drink a lot of water. But there's -- so different than when we
would if we were travelling a short distance. We'll be ready to play. It won't
have anything to do with whether it's good result or bad result tomorrow, it
won't have anything to do with where we were sent to. We're very, very
grateful to have the opportunity to be in the NCAA tournament, as all 65 teams
should be.  
  
Q. After watching those 29 tapes or those 29 videos on Marquette, anything
surprise you, anything stick out besides what you already knew before you
watched the tapes?  
MODERATOR: I tell you what, what I just mentioned a little bit, but not about
them. But what really -- as a coach, what I really respect is how they played
good. I haven't watched all 29 games, but I've watched most of them. But what
really amazes me is their consistency with their effort, and they really
played well together. They pass the basketball really well. But their effort
is consistent. And, I mean, I really do appreciate that kind of thing. They've
won most of their games this year. The ones they haven't won, they've been
right there and had a chance to win them.  
But it's all about they play hard every single time, and as a coach that's
what I appreciate the most.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how different things are for you right now than a year
ago when you took Texas A & M to the tournament?   
COACH GILLISPIE: As far as different, I don't think there's any difference. I
think a coach comes here and you perform your responsibility. You have your
team with you and you're ready to play basketball, and, hopefully, if you get
a chance to advance, that's what every coach's dream is right now, to continue
to advance, then you'll try to get ready to play the next game.  
But as far as -- I don't see any different as far as from one school to
another.  
  
Q. Coach, you nearly hired Dave Rose as one of your assistants at A &M a few
years ago. Now you have been at the same site as head coach. Curious if you've
followed his path at all?   
COACH GILLISPIE: Dave Rose was on my staff?  
  
Q. You were looking at hiring him.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I didn't think he was on my staff, but I have some memory
lapses every once in a while. Tell me your question again.  
  
Q. I was curious if you just followed his path at BYU. You have been at the
same site two years in a row. I was curious if you followed that at all?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Ive' always had a great respect for David. He is a fantastic
human being number one. And he is a great basketball coach. He's done a great
job over there. I haven't had the opportunity to study their team much. I did
see them playing against Louisville earlier in the season when we were
preparing to play against Louisville. I haven't studied him lately. There's no
question he is one of the better coaches in the country.  
It's always good to see Dave because he always has a smile on his face and has
a great attitude and you are happy about the success he continues to have. But
it doesn't surprise you. And I wish he would have come on our staff. I
couldn't talk him into it.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't keep up with your team day-to-day, what's the
status of Meeks?  
COACH GILLISPIE: You are the only one that doesn't keep up with our team on a
daily basis. But that was suppose to be funny. Obviously it wasn't.
(Laughing).  
  
Q. I got it.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I know you did. Some of the others I was worried about. I
don't know. I mean, he told me last week he wanted to try to play and he's
been trying to play. I would say he is very, very doubtful. But we haven't
done anything today. He's moving around better than he has been in a long
time. Does that mean he's going to be able to play? He's been a long ways away
from being able to play. So I would doubt he's going to be able to do
anything.  
  
Q. The second question is, earlier in the season Patrick Patterson said that
Ramel Bradley had changed, he wasn't yelling and screaming as much as he used
to. What changed with him and were you responsible for bringing something else
out of him that he had not shown before?  
COACH GILLISPIE: As far as changing Ramel, I don't know. I like it when Ramel
yells and screams. Maybe Patrick did or didn't. I've not been around a more --
I like to recruit spirit. And, you know, that's one of the things think that
we mess up on too many times is not recruiting spirit. Because basketball
seasons are long. They're basically 365 days a year these days, and I like
guys that have spirit.  
Ramel Bradley has more spirit than anyone I've ever been around.  
I can't remember one day when he came to workout or a game or any time that he
ever came by the office or -- no matter what his task was at hand in that
particular day, him not having a smile on his face or him not coming to
workout and going twice as hard as you would think he possibly could because
we had a late night last night or whatever.  
And he's been amazing in that respect. That's no disrespect to any others.
We've coached a lot of guys with great spirit. But his spirit is something
that's going to carry him so far in life, it's crazy. And as far as us
changing, I think maybe the change that we've had to make with Ramel is, he's
always been a really good player. I think we probably put more responsibility
on him than he ever has had placed upon him. And that's because he was a
senior and that's because of the injury situation that we had. He's had to do
more. He was one of the top five or six defensive players in our league. He
was all-defensive team in the Southeastern Conference. He's been as clutch a
player as I've been around and just has great spirit. Offensively he has to do
everything for us. Defensively he's done everything for us. So it was him
continuing to evolve as a player and having a fantastic senior season. But
he's got spirit, and I don't think he should ever try to change that.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you talked to Buzz Williams at all since Sunday, and
what your relationship is with him?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Buzz is a great person. And we talk quite a -- we talk quite
often. Buzz probably knew that I didn't have time to talk to him these days,
and I knew that Buzz probably didn't have time to talk to me because I would
assume he's doing the scouting report on our team. And he knows -- I know that
he's going to help their team prepare as much as possible. However many hours
there were since the selection was announced, he's going to be working. He
probably feels the same way about me.  
So Buzz is a great person. And he's a great coach. And I know that they must
be happy to have him on the staff.  
  
Q. What made him such a good recruiter for you when you were at A & M? He's
brought in a number of guys at Marquette the short time he's been there.   
COACH GILLISPIE: He is a tenacious guy. He obviously enjoys it. He is very,
very well organized. He's -- his tenacity is probably unmatched. He just goes
after it. Everyone likes him. If they don't start out liking him, he forces
them to like him. And that's a great quality to be able to have. And he just
goes after it hard. And he's not only a good recruiter he is a very, very good
basketball coach. And he's a -- he does whatever it takes to help your team
win, whether it's academics or whether it's taking care of stuff in the office
or whatever. He is not just a recruiter he is a total basketball coach and a
guy that gives you the best chance to win over a long haul. I know that. So
it's -- he's something else.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the irony of being in the same
location as your former club. Have you kept in contact with them at all, and I
guess your assessment of their season as they prepare for BYU and Texas A & M
of course?   
COACH GILLISPIE: I am totally immersed in our team. And I know that they're
probably excited to be in the tournament. I can't speak for them. There's a
lot of friends that I have back in those places. I think if you are a
relationship person like I am, I think that's why you coach. I think that, you
know, I'm happy for them to be in the tournament. As far as the details and
specifics, I don't know much about their team. I've watched them play just a
couple times on TV. TV. I know both those teams BYU and Texas A&M will be a
very fun match-up I would think.  
I hope nothing but the best for them and have great relationships with a lot
of folks there including a lot of players. But you can't speak with the
players because you would be breaking NCAA rules. So unfortunately that's a
rule I wish we could get changed.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to wrap it up there. Thank you very much, coach.
Good luck.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Dominic, you guys were in this tournament, of course, last year. What's
the difference between this team right now and your attitude going in compared
to how you guys were last we're?  
DOMINIC JAMES: You know, we got the experience now. You know, this is our
third straight year for guys like me, Ousmane, Wesley, and Jerel. And
obviously, you know, when Lazar Hayward plays, I feel like he understands
entering this tournament, how important it is for him just to be poised and
being the leader. Last year he was a freshman. And for any freshmen playing in
the NCAA tournament, feel like you are probably a little bit nervous, and it's
first-time experience for you.  
But I feel like the experience and the maturity of this team, you know, coming
in this year, is going to play a major factor in how well we play tomorrow
again Kentucky.  
  
Q. Dominic, can you talk, Ramel said earlier how he views Kentucky as the
underdog. Do you have the same view or how you are your views that?  
DOMINIC JAMES: We're not getting caught up in the seedings or who is the
underdog or anything like that. We respect the fact that we know that they had
to fight to get into the tournament. You know, if that's their motivation
coming into this game, well, you know, that's on them.  
But we got the motivation that we haven't had a quality win in March. We
haven't won a tournament game since I've been here. That's our motivation. I
mean, each team has to have some type of edge coming into any game for added
motivation. If that's their war cry, then we got ours, as well.  
  
Q. Wesley, for you, it's your third year in this tournament. And you guys
were just talking about how Lazar's done. But for you, it seems to be, you
know, something a little more where you're the guy that they look to to get
hot early. Do you feel that way in this offense?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I never real thought about it like that. I mean, with this,
the offense, anybody can get off at any point and time. Just the way we play,
we push the ball, we throw it ahead, everybody touches it. If I get going
early, then I think that opens it up a lot for these three guys. Because now
the focus is more -- now they have to focus on everybody. I mean, I'm not out
there searching for my shot. I'm just taking what's given to me, and then
hopefully that's enough.  
  
Q. Question for Dominic. Some people say they remind them of Pitt. When you
look at them on film, is that the way they strike you?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Kentucky?  
  
Q. Yes.  
DOMINIC JAMES: Man, I wouldn't say that. Obviously, you know, they got strong
guard play. Pitt had strong guard play. They do got a presence down low, as
well.  
But, I mean, I feel like that's the best thing about the Big East, because you
get so many different styles. They may be similar -- may be similar in some
ways, but I really wouldn't put them in comparison with Pitt, me, myself
personally.  
  
Q. How good are their guards?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Good. Very good. We've been watching a lot of film. Ramel
Bradley his ability to get into the paint and his ability to shoot the ball. I
feel like his game compliments Crawford along with Jasper. They play well
together and give each other open shots. Obviously, that's the reason they've
been so successful in getting to the tournament.  
  
Q. Wesley, the first half of your Big East season, and the second half, it
seems like they were very different seasons. For those of us who didn't see
you play as much, what changed for you guys the second half of the year, and
how were you able to come on so strong?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Just being aggressive, I mean, a whole 'nother mentality,
just attacking, you know, putting defense in the forefront of my mind, rather
than offense. I mean, our team is predicated on getting stops, you know,
turning you over. Because defense is our best offense.  
So I think when I come out with a defensive rebounding, mentality, I mean,
that instinctively just makes me more aggressive. Then that carries over to
the offense.  
  
Q. Was the effort a question defensively, or what was the problem?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Effort's never a question with anybody on this team. It's
more of a, you know, just locking in and knowing what it takes to get it done,
and that's defense.  
  
Q. Lazar, this is your second year. You said you guys talked about how
different is. What have these guys next to you, and also Coach Crean, how have
they approached you as the season's gone on getting into the Big East
tournament and now the NCAA tournament?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: We pretty much have the same approach. You know, coming in to
important games. You know, it's really not a hard thing to get me going for
games like this. And I think the good thing about, you know, us being here
again and trying to get our first win together is, just like Dominic said,
we're a mature team, and we're so eager to win. You know, this team is just --
it's a whole bunch of winners on this team. And that's a really good thing to
have when you are going into a game like this. And you know that everyone's
going to give it their best shot. So it's great thing to have.  
THE MODERATOR: Ousmane, as the lone senior up here, would you like to comment
on that.  
OUSMANE BARRO: Like this guy says, we've been here for three years straight,
and we haven't had a win yet. So as a team, we're just trying to give our best
shot, and, you know, make sure that we get a win. But we got a great opponent
in front of us, which is Kentucky. So it's going to be a good challenge for
us.  
  
Q. Wesley, do you have any memories of that 2003 Marquette/Kentucky game?
Just wondering if you watched it having grown up in that era?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think we all watched it. We all remember it. Yeah, I mean,
it was a good game. You know, just being a basketball fan at that point, you
know, it was just exciting to watch, especially with it being Marquette.  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else up here watch that game, have any memories of it?  
DOMINIC JAMES: That's probably the first time I really heard of Marquette. I
feel like that's the first time Marquette became a household name to the
entire country. I know it's great to follow in the footsteps of guys like
Dwyane Wade and Travis Diener and Steve Novak. I feel like those are names we
all know and reasons why we all came to Marquette.  
  
Q. I just wanted to follow up. Did that game have a lot to do with your
coming to Marquette?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Just like I said, for myself, I know it did. You know, I feel
like it just goes to show that you trying to rebuild a program, and, I mean,
you go back to the history of Marquette, you know, the '77 team and Al McGuire
and trying to rebuild a program and be a part of that. I know that's one of
the reasons why I came here, along with these guys that were recruiting when I
was coming in. And, you know, just to be a part of that and trying to get back
to that stage is something I want to be a part of.  
  
Q. So you were a high school, what, junior or senior when that game was
being played?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Sophomore, going into junior year.  
  
Q. At what school?  
DOMINIC JAMES: I'm from Richmond, Indiana.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions. Seeing none, we'll thank the student-
athletes for coming up here.  
THE MODERATOR: All right we're joined by Marquette head coach Tom Crean. We'll
open it up with a statement from the coach then open it up to questions.  
COACH CREAN: We're honored to be here. It's our first trip to Anaheim. It's
our first trip to the Honda Center. But it's our third straight trip as a unit
to the NCAA tournament and we're excited about that.  
You know, we've got a great tradition at Marquette, and we know that we're
playing a team, absolutely one of the best in all of college basketball. And
this is the first time since 1980 that a Marquette team has gone to the NCAA
tournament three years in a row. So that's something that we're proud of
inside of our program, which means absolutely nothing tomorrow.  
We know we're going to have a great battle with Kentucky. They are game tough.
They know how to win at home. They know how to win on the road. They know how
to win on a neutral court because they have great physical and mental
toughness. They play with the passion that Billy Gillispie coaches with, and
they play with the intelligence that he coaches with. They're a very, very
smart, cerebral basketball team. The more you watch them on film, they know
how to play early on the clock. They know how to play deep on the clock.
Offensively, obviously their defense has gotten better as the entire year has
gone on. They can put great pressure on the ball. They have outstanding help.
There's really not a lot of weaknesses.  
The one thing that's been such a tribute to the way they have played this
year, and the way Billy has coached them, is ever since -- you know, from the
films we watched from when Patrick Patterson went down with the injury,
they've kind of reinvented themselves a little bit with the perimeter play in
the sense, the perimeter guys had been great all year long - Crawford,
Bradley, Jasper, have been outstanding, but they even opened up the floor that
much more. I think that's a real tribute to how good they are and what they're
capable of. And they found a way to win a lot of different ways this year.  
  
Q. Tom, I mean, you guys play a very intense defense. They run the clock all
the way down. I mean, is that a concern to you for, you know, maybe these guys
getting tired at all early on or anything like that?  
COACH CREAN: No. I think we've just got to stay mentally sharp. And we've got
to build intensity as the clock goes down. Because, again, they can score
quick. They can get out on the break and make plays. They're not a deliberate
team. They just -- they know what they want to do. And inside of that, you
know, there's not a lot of situations that they have not encountered this year
that they're not or that they haven't been successful with.  
So, no. We've just got to stay disciplined. We've got to stay in an attack
mode, and we've got to stay really alert and sharp as the game goes on, and
our depth has got to be able to do the same thing when we go to the bench.  
  
Q. Tom, can you just tell me, when you talk about Kentucky having to
reinvent itself, from just a coaching perspective, how hard is that to do
three games from the end of your regular season?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think it helps when you have the perimeter players
they've had. But when you watched their earlier films, Patrick Patterson was
such a big part of what they did with getting the ball into the post. And they
still seemed to have run the same things out of their two-game offense, it's
just -- the floor's opened up that much more. And I think that's -- you know,
that's what great coaches do, like Billy is. You just figure out ways to win.  
But as solid as their offense has been, is disciplined, and as attacking as it
has been, they've won because they defend at a high level. I mean, you can see
that. There have really been no changes there. I mean, they really defend.
They guard the drive. They guard the dribble. They guard the pick-and-roll
outstanding. Their help defense is very good. Their four and five men do a
really good job of protecting each other and helping each other and covering
for each other in situations.  
So as their season has gone along, the defense has continued to strive and
improve. Then, obviously, when they had the change with Patterson, their
offense just -- you know, it was able to spread it out a little bit more.  
  
Q. Earlier your players were talking about how improved Lazar has been. How
important do you think that will be this time in the tournament compared to
last year when he was a freshman?  
COACH CREAN: I think every game he's gone through this season has been big for
him, when he's been successful, and even when he's not been successful,
because it's experience. He played a lot for us last year, but there was not
nearly the responsibilities that he has this year. And he's been a guy that's
improved since the time he got to Marquette.  
I think having played in an NCAA tournament game of the year is good, but I
think the big games, you know, we've played so many big games, as you know, in
the Big East. He just came off three last week in the Big East tournament. I
think obviously, Kentucky is game tough, and I'd like to think that we are as
well because of all the battles that we've been through. And Lazar's been a
big part of all that.  
  
Q. Talk about the Big East, I mean, a few years ago with restructuring the
Big East. Everybody talked about how difficult, there would be years when NCAA
level teams didn't get to the tournament. Eight teams, about right, this year?
Obviously Syracuse was close.  
COACH CREAN: Syracuse, when we played them, there's no question we felt they
were an NCAA team coming out of the game. Eventually, that's going to happen
in our league. There are going to be nine or ten teams who are going to get in
because you won't be able to say no. There's too much quality. For there to be
eight teams says a lot, not only about the depth of the league, but of the
quality of the league. And also, you know, looking at what South Florida did
with taking Connecticut to the wire, beating Syracuse, Rutgers wins, they took
Notre Dame to the wire, but they beat Villanova and Pittsburgh when they were
ranked. You can go down the line. That's what makes it such a great league, as
the SEC, as well.  
We're proud because in the new Big East, in the first three years, there's
been three teams win ten or more winning the conference. Georgetown,
Pittsburgh, and Marquette. So we feel like we've had a chance to go through
some battles and earn some victories, and hopefully that will help prepare us
as we play a great team tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you talk about being in the tournament three years in a row, in
reality, basically every game you played in the conference is an NCAA-type
game?  
COACH CREAN: The intensity level sure is. I know there have been many times
this year we said, okay, that felt like a final-32 game, or that felt like a
Sweet 16 game. And you try to get that in your players' minds, that that's the
intensity level those games are all about, knowing that any game you play, if
you are playing with intensity, you are playing with passion, you are playing
with energy, and you're executing under pressure, that's what you have to be
able to do in the NCAA tournament. I think that's a big reason that Kentucky
had the year they had, because they seemed, when you watch them on film, to
really understand those values of how you win. And Kentucky did not beat
themselves.  
I think that's one of the greatest tributes to the process of change that went
on at Kentucky this year, with a new coach is, they got better. They really
were able to win and put teams away because they knew what to do. You got to
go through that change.  
I mean, we didn't spend any time looking at November tapes or December tapes.
You know, it's totally different team, totally different. I think it's their
toughness physically and mentally, along with that experience of going through
a tough league.  
  
Q. These two teams have a pretty good history in the NCAA tournament.
Obviously, you're aware of that because you are a part of that history. Are
the players even aware of that?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think they are, because they had a chance to see the
game. You know, that helped with recruiting. But the only people that were
around, our security director Leonard Hardison, our doctor Darin Maccoux, and
our priest, Father Kelly. But Father Kelly has been around since basketball
was invented, so he's seen a lot of games, Al McGuire, the whole thing. But
that was a special day when we beat Kentucky. It was an incredible game. And
we knew what kind of team we were dealing with. We had great confidence that
day.  
So I think any time, you know, Marquette and Kentucky, I'm sure Kevin O'Neal
would say the same thing, he played Kentucky when Rick Pitino was there in the
NCAA tournament. Every time there's been a Marquette/Kentucky game, it's had a
special feel because we know how good they are and we know what their
tradition is all about.  
  
Q. Were there any kids on your roster who you were recruiting them that ,
that game, came up or they said -- Dominic was telling us that kind of put you
on his radar screen?  
COACH CREAN: I'm sure it did. It was still -- the seniors would have been
people that would have been juniors in high school when we played that game
that we were recruiting for the following year. Obviously, when you beat a
team like Kentucky, I mean, I think they had a 26-game winning streak. When
they had been behind, it was all of eleven seconds that year. So, you know,
when you win a game like that, you are beating a great team. Especially on the
stage it was on and the way Dwyane Wade played that day and the way Robert
Jackson played. I'm sure it helped.  
Any time you are in the national spotlight, it's going to help in recruiting,
there's no doubt, and there was no bigger spotlight for us than that point.  
  
Q. Obviously, getting to the semis in the Big East was big for you. How much
does that translate now to the NCAA tournament, where these guys haven't had a
chance to win yet?  
COACH CREAN: We'll see tomorrow. I think the most important thing is that the
more big games you play, the more, you know, pressure packed games you play,
the more confidence you build inside of those games, the more it helps you as
you go down the line. And I think that's the only thing we're focused on. You
know, we're not focused on last year. We're not focus on two weeks ago. Last
week a little bit, because we played three games in three days and there's
things to take from those games. There's things we did very well. There's
thing didn't do as well. Those are the things we've tried to build on.  
So it's not as much as getting ready for the NCAA tournament as it is getting
ready to play a really big game and make sure that we understand the process
we have to undertake to get ready for that.  
  
Q. Tom, I just wondered about pace of the game and how Kentucky's been
trying to tempo games. As you guys, as I understand it, like to run, how
important is pace?  
COACH CREAN: I think when you get to this time of year and you're in the NCAA
tournament, you've obviously won enough games, and they're never the same. You
know you can win them in a fast pace. You can win them in a slow pace. You
have to be able to do your best to get to your tempo, but you have to be able
to play at the tempo the game is being played at.  
I think Kentucky has been able to do that. I think we have been able to do
that. And I think most teams that would be in this time of year have done
that. And every once in a while, you are going to have a team that gets into
the conference tournament and wins and again, they're a great story, and
that's fantastic. But for the most part, this tournament is about teams that
have done it over the course of this year, and there's a lot of different ways
to do it. And we've got to be able to play whatever way the game dictates
itself tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach Stevens
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STEVENS: It was a great college basketball game between two pretty darn
good teams. And we came out on the short end, but due to no, certainly both
teams played valiantly and played with terrific effort. And I think it was
just a game of inches on a lot of occasions.  
We didn't get a couple bounces that we probably needed to go our way to finish
it off. But I have great respect for the way that Tennessee plays, I think
they play extremely hard. I think they put you in touch positions and they get
a chance to move on.  
But certainly I am proud as I could be of our guys effort. I told them in the
locker room that it's more than a game when you have five teammates like these
seniors have been. And that's what we talked about.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For A.J., you maybe have not had a lot of time to reflect, but even in
defeat do you think you've, Butler's made it pretty clear that you're one of
the top teens in the country, this team was ranked number one just about three
weeks ago and you took them into overtime.  
A.J. GRAVES: Well, yeah, I would hope so. That's something that we're trying
to do here is trying to create, add to what tradition that has been
established over the years. This isn't the only time Butler's been to the
tournament, they have been here before and won some games.  
To get paired up with Tennessee in the second round, to play a very
challenging team and to put them into overtime, that's tough to do. And a lot
of teams didn't get to do that.  
  
Q. Mike, Tennessee obviously has really good shot blockers, athletic guys
inside that can jump. Did those guys get you thinking, have you second
guessing your shot when you drove to the basket?  
MIKE GREEN: Sure, it happened a couple of times. The other times it was just
me and the rim and I failed to finish. Those shots that I've been making all
year long and for one reason or another they didn't go. All of them didn't go
today.  
  
Q. There were a lot of point characteristic numbers, 18 of 28 from the free
throw line, guys missed a couple of easy ones. How much of that was
Tennessee's size and athleticism and how much of it was you guys just had one
of those games?  
MIKE GREEN: I think you got to give credit to both. Tennessee has some
athletic guys that contested a lot of shots and at the same time sometimes it
just don't work your way. And I think it was both today.  
  
Q. A.J. in that last minute of overtime it looked like you had a pretty good
path to the basket and then did it seem like Smith just came out of nowhere to
block that? Because it looked like that was going to be a tying field goal.  
A.J. GRAVES: Yeah, I thought I had a clear way, we ran a high on ball and
hesitated and I thought there was an opening and I took it. And I did see
someone out of the corner of my eye and that's why I tried to, I didn't go all
the way to the rim, I tried to, I lofted it in the air to see what would
happen. And he got it. So that just happens.  
  
Q. All you guys, what are some of the things that you guys have shared with
each other as seniors, in the few minutes after the game, after a very
emotional game?  
DREW STREICHER: I would say the consensus was just thankfulness. How much fun
we have had going to work every day with each other. Just going to battle with
each other. How we have all come together. We have got three transfers and
they came from all different backgrounds and just how we were able to come
together and really just be like a family. And how much fun we had and playing
off each other, it's just been quite a ride.  
MIKE GREEN: Drew pretty much summed it all up. We just gave out hugs and a
bunch of thanks and pretty much talked about the season in short.  
  
Q. A.J., most of the game if you guys are aggressive with the ball, drove to
the hoop, you could maybe get a free throw. The last two minutes if you were
aggressive going to the hoop, you got fouled the official said you got to put
the ball in the basket, they weren't going to let you go to the free throw
line.  
A.J. GRAVES: I think that's the nature of the NCAA tournament. You got to go,
if you're going to go to the basket you need to put it in there. You can't
expect calls. And I don't think we were expecting calls. We were just out
there just trying to play. And that was kind of our strategy towards the end
was to try and go to the hoop and if we got fouled, we got fouled. If we
didn't, we were going to try and get the layup. And we had shooters spot up on
the perimeter and Tennessee decided to stay tight a few times and that's why
we kept driving it in there. But those just didn't go down and like Mike said,
sometimes that happens and sometimes that's because of the other team as well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you guys have been always been very humble, very
respectful and really don't make very many statements about what you think you
might do. But can you say now, can you, it seemed like there was that sort of
a you know stated belief that you all had that you really, you thought you
could go to the Final Four and win a national championship. Is that, did you
have that feeling deep down that you could do that?  
MIKE GREEN: Definitely. Why wouldn't we? We played our hearts out. We play our
style of basketball and it's been very effective.  
We came up short a couple times. Four times out of a possible 34 times. So
there's no reason for us not to think that we're good enough to play against
any team in this tournament. And we dropped one.  
DREW STREICHER: I think that we can play with anybody. I think we showed that
all year. That's definitely our ultimate goal. We're all pretty disappointed
we didn't reach that. That's been our ultimate goal for the whole season. So
we had the mindset that we could do that and obviously we're disappointed.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. You guys can head back to your locker room. Thank you,
guys. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Bruce Pearl said that he thought it was both unfair and an unfortunate
thing that two 30 win teams were facing each other in the second round. What
were your feelings along those lines?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, last week we just decided this is what's been
given to us and we got to go out and play and compete. And we just heard the
question about, did these guys believe that they could play with anybody or
beat anybody in the country and the answer was yes. So we said whatever the
bracket may be, we're going to go compete.  
And it just so happened that Tennessee was our second round opponent. I think
Tennessee is an obviously, if they were ranked number one in the country in
the RPI and number one in the country three weeks ago, that I think they're a
Final Four caliber team. So I was proud of the way our guys competed and I
don't really have any thoughts on the draw per se.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Tennessee did differently against Pete Campbell
as opposed to what South Alabama did in the first round?  
COACH STEVENS: I think that I was in here towards the end of Bruce's press
conference and obviously they were switching ball screens to avoid rotating,
so to avoid losing him more often. And I thought Mike did a great job on more
than one occasion of just breaking the guy down off the top, a little action
where we isolate Pete in the corner and Mike's got a decision to either take
it to the rim or kick it out. And Mike made the right decision a lot tonight.  
That was without a ball screen too. So that was how Pete got some of his looks
and then obviously you take some things away when you switch and as you get to
playing the best teams in the country, they do a formidable job of being able
to contain your guards, even with their bigs. It's very few, very select few
that can do that. And Tennessee is one of them.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how important it would be to maintain your
poise throughout the game. When you fell behind 13-2 how did you guys sort of
hold it together?  
COACH STEVENS: We talked about it last year it was 22-9 at Madison Square
Garden. You know, they are a tremendous team of runs. And you just have to
weather some of that and then you have to just keep playing the game. This is
a long, a long game. And I'll tell you this about this team, we haven't been
out of a game in a long time. In fact, I don't know, I would have to think
back to last year, maybe one was double figures. But this team's had a shot to
win it at the end almost all the time. And all four times this year. You know,
you think about what this group's accomplished in two years, it's absolutely
incredible. And I'm proud to just be a small part of it.  
  
Q. It seemed in the first half that possible you weren't taking shots deep
in the clock. It seemed like you were shooting earlier than we had seen you at
least Friday anyway. And making a comeback do you think fatigue played a
factor in the free throws at the end?  
COACH STEVENS: I think we were -- I'm not sure, but I think we were perfect
from the line in the last six or eight attempts. I'm not sure about that. I
think we were 8-14 at half time and then 10-14 in the second half. So I don't
know that it played a factor in that, but it probably, I'm sure it played a
small factor in the game as a whole and that's the way Tennessee plays and
they do a great job forcing tempo and it makes it difficult.  
  
Q. You mentioned how Mike went to the goal so frequently and trying to draw
the defense and so forth. Was he perhaps late in the game and during the
overtime perhaps trying to take too much of the game upon his own shoulders
and not passing off to people as he was going to the goal?  
COACH STEVENS: You know, you take what the game gives you. And they're not
going to leave our shooters. Obviously Coach Pearl is familiar with our system
and as Pete hits a couple in the first half they become even more consumed
with him. And you got to get it in there and make plays. Mike did a great job
of doing that. He missed a couple that he usually makes, but that's the way
the game goes sometimes.  
  
Q. Did you see the replay? I know you're upset when on A.J.'s shot that was
blocked --  
COACH STEVENS: I was upset but I didn't see the replay.  
  
Q. You didn't see it?  
COACH STEVENS: No, I didn't see the replay.  
  
Q. You said you felt Tennessee was a Final Four caliber team. Did you feel
like your team was a Final Four caliber team too?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, I've never really gotten into -- I feel like we
can play with anybody on any given night. I think the group last year proved
that when they got beat by the national champion. I just think Tennessee, like
a bunch of other teams, has a great shot to make it there. There's a lot of
parity in college basketball and we're not really focused on -- and we have
said this before, we haven't been focused on the end result all year. We have
just been focused on the next game and, you know, we thought we could compete
with Tennessee and I'm so proud of our effort. You think about the fact that
we went to overtime with probably the number one or number five or whatever
they are, one of the top eight teams in the country, easily top three or four
teams in the country easily. And we shot 36 percent.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
BIRMINGHAM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BIRMINGHAM)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Jerry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18429)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take an opening statement from Coach Pitino
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH PITINO: We played a good game against Boise and tonight we played a
great game. Both at offense and defense, we had two turnovers at half time. We
really didn't turn it over at all in the second half until the final few
minutes of play and everybody on the team did something really well.  
I'm real proud of our guys, real proud to be in the Sweet 16 and we're excited
to be going to Charlotte.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jerry David Padgett talk a lot about scouting reports? First, how well
did the coaches do with the scouting report, concerning the turn around and B,
how well did the players do executing it?  
JERRY SMITH: The coaches did a great job. They prepared us well and we really
focused in on everything. Coach said the main thing would be concentration.
With a great team like Oklahoma, and we tried to pay attention to every facet
that they would do.  
  
Q. The celebration at half-time was obviously a lot more intense than at the
end of the game. What kind of confidence did y'all take into half time? Did
you feel like it was pretty much over at that point?  
JERRY SMITH: Well, with a great team like Oklahoma, you can never feel like
the game is over. They're such a powerful team. They can come back in a heart
beat and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to stay after them.  
  
Q. Can either of you talk about -- you guys played a lot of players, looked
pretty deep, you have to play a team out there, Tennessee, that's also pretty
deep. Can you talk about your depth matching up with others around the
country?  
TERRANCE FARLEY: We don't really try to worry about how deep they are. We try
to concentrate on what we need to do to finish the game off. We know they're a
good team, more like a great team. But I'm sure we can compete with them. We
got a great matchup at each position.  
JERRY SMITH: Tennessee is a great team. We know that. But we're just very
excited about the Oklahoma win and going to the Sweet 16 in Charlotte.  
  
Q. Jerry, coming in to the tournament, there was a lot of talk about how you
guys had lost two games in a row, I know those were to two pretty good teams.
Did something click in the time before this tournament? It looks like you guys
might be playing your best basketball?  
JERRY SMITH: I definitely think we're playing our best basketball right now.
Like you said, we lost to two great teams. And they were playing, they just
out-played us, I guess, those two games. But we're clicking right now, we're
really focusing in and we are here to win.  
  
Q. Could the players talk about what it's like when you're on a run like you
had in the first half and it's 23-2 and you're getting steals, and getting
dunks, and just the momentum that that brings to the bench and to the players
out on the floor.  
TERRANCE FARLEY: Not only does it bring momentum to the players on the floor,
but it gives us great confidence off the bench too. Like take example for
myself, I came in to the game really pumped because we made this huge run and
I was really proud of my guys about that and there was no other feeling like
it, to tell you the truth.  
JERRY SMITH: Just got the momentum going, and everything's feeling great.
Don't want to let it die down.  
  
Q. You were a freshman the last time ya'll went to the Sweet 16, how
different is it for you this time around?  
TERRANCE FARLEY: Oh, as a freshman it wasn't really, we were close as a team,
but this year being the older one of the group and we're a lot more closer,
it's a lot more special. Hopefully we'll just make a run. And I wish us the
best, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. If y'all would like to head back to the
locker room, that would be fine. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Follow-up, just as with the players, that run the 23-2 run was really
pivotal and I mean is that what you were looking for to maybe use your
pressure to try to turn them over and take control of the game early?  
COACH PITINO: It starts with good shot selection. That's the key. Because you
can't press unless you shoot a high percentage shot. We obviously don't press
on misses. So it's important that you take, it starts with the execution
offensively, but offensively and defensively we did a beautiful job tonight.  
I really can't find a weakness in the way the guys played tonight. They did a
tremendous job. They didn't turn it over, they went inside out, made high
percentage shots, made the extra pass, and then turned around and played
fabulous defense both man and zone and pressed very effectively.  
  
Q. You said you played good against Boise State, great today, do you think
this is the best game you've played all season long?  
COACH PITINO: No, I really don't. I think we played really well tonight. I
think we played great but we played early in the year you all know how good
UNLV was, we played really well, beat them by 18. At Pittsburgh, Marquette --
we played a really tough schedule. Now I think that you can say this is the
best because it means the most. It means a trip to the Sweet 16. So without
question this is the most meaningful game that we have played.  
  
Q. You've been through this tournament many times, is there a sense that
this team is peaking at the right time or a sense that they're head hitting on
all cylinders right now?  
COACH PITINO: I thought we were peaking last year. And we just, it's just like
the question that was just asked about the last two games of the season. I
thought we played great in both games. To play Georgetown on Senior Night for
the conference title, playing to the mat and to the wire, on the road. Played
a great 40 minutes against Pittsburgh, played a very poor five minutes in
overtime. We played two great games. That's why I didn't understand the
question about the two losses.  
If you have two blow-out games against home week competition what does that
matter. If you study the game of basketball and see you're playing really well
it's not going to affect a team negatively. And that's what I told the guys
after the losses, you played terrific basketball. We played a terrific game
against Texas A & M last year, only difference with us is we give credit to
our competitors when they beat us. And that's exactly what happened. We just
gave credit to Pittsburgh and Georgetown and got on with ourselves. But we
were peaking last year at the right time and we're playing good basketball
right now.  
  
Q. Free throw shooting aside for Terrance Farley, what was it like to see
him give you some big minutes in the first half and just to perform like that
in a big game?  
COACH PITINO: We got a lot of confidence in Terrance. He's really improved his
low post game, and I'm not afraid to use him in crucial situations. So,
outside, you're right on his free throws, and especially the one that I
thought it was really unfair of the police because it's -- you see how many
police we have here. They opened up the arena doors just as he was getting
ready to shoot and forced it wide right and if they would have kept that place
shut he would have at least hit the rim. But the wind came up, everybody was
trying to let people out, but that was really disturbing on their part. He
told me he was okay after the miss though, he was okay about it. I said, "I
know you're okay, hit the rim."  
  
Q. Will you talk about your defense against Oklahoma, I don't know if they
have seen that too often, up and down the court, in fact, there's too many
games these days that go 50 to 48 and you played up tempo. Why we don't see
more of what you do.  
COACH PITINO: That was probably asked of me 25 years ago. And the answer is,
it's very difficult to do because the players have to really sacrifice at all
positions and it's not easy to do. It takes very focused players. Tennessee
plays that way, we play that way, Memphis plays that way and a lot of teams in
the country play that way. It takes dedicated basketball players to give that
much energy at every level of the court.  
So it's a credit to the players who work so hard to play that style.  
Even my first few years at Kentucky we had -- we didn't have the best pressing
teams, we had guys that I could beat in a foot race. But they still gave
everything they could as a team that lost to Duke, with the exception of Shawn
Woods and Jamal Mashburn. That was a gifted team, but they pressed their tails
off and gave everything they had.  
So, I'm real proud of the way our guys gave their energy, it's exciting to see
you feed on it, you get easy shots and the good thing about this pressing team
this year is that we don't give up a whole lot with our press. We press with
really good intelligence. We run and jump a lot rather than run and trap. So
you're not getting caught leaving the basket naked and 2s on 1s and 3s on 2s.  
  
Q. Obviously, it was necessary to win the game. But with Scott's shot at
half-time, was that neat for you to watch?  
COACH PITINO: It was. We put him in to get a corner shot. He made a lucky
prayer there. But it is fun because Will's a very good shooter, that was a
lucky shot but he worked real hard all season and even a young man like
Preston Knowles gives us a big lift for the amount of minutes that he plays
and but, yes, that was -- it like it was going to be our night when that shot
went in. It looked like everything was going well for us. It was one of those
nights.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay thank you, coach.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Ramar Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18427)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. Take an opening statement from
Coach Pearl and then go to questions.  
COACH PEARL: We're very pleased to have survived and advance. We're about to
head to a place we have been before and we've not been able to go past and
that is to get to the Elite 8.  
Once again, what more can you say about Butler and the way those kids played,
how they honor the game with the way they play and I thought Graves and Green
were both terrific.  
I think we did a good job on Howard in the inside and that was a big factor
for him. Our inside guys did a terrific job. And to be able to win the battle
of the boards and be the more physical club, which we should be coming out of
the SEC, I thought that was very, very significant for us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now, please.  
  
Q. Tyler, could you talk about that block? Did you think that you caught it
on its way up?  
TYLER SMITH: They gave it to me, so I was happy they gave it to me. I don't
know if I caught it on the way up or down. But I was just happy to get to the
ball.  
  
Q. What makes Butler so difficult and unique to play?  
WAYNE CHISM: They got two guards that can play. And then they got a shooter
that can shoot the ball. And they do a lot of screening. And we already went
against that in the first round. And they kept screening the whole game and
getting open looks and penetration. But we sat back and played a good defense
in the first half and we played a good defense in the second half, but we had
a couple of fouls and then they went to the line, but we still made it hard
for them to get off a 3-point shot.  
We contested most of them and half of them went in, but we still played good
defense at the end.  
  
Q. Ramar, talk about the break-away where you scored 26 seconds to go, was
that something that just developed?  
RAMAR SMITH: No, Chris got the ball and I just tried to run the wing. He got
it to me and my main focus with to get the ball up on the rim and score.  
  
Q. Tyler and Wayne, could you talk about the attention you paid number 34,
Pete Campbell in the second half, because I can't even remember him getting
and hitting a three in that half.  
TYLER SMITH: We saw him shooting the ball with the lights out two days ago.
And our main focus was to make sure to run him off the deep line. Because he's
a great shooter and sometimes he will run the three and the four, but coach
got us defensively where we were switching everything and also the guards
helped us out on that a lot.  
WAYNE CHISM: We came, when he played the four, we even ran a couple of
different guys at him and I went on him a couple times, Tyler went on him a
couple times, we had everybody rotating on him, don't matter who it was. Just
staying in his passing lane in the second half. I think he hit like one, I
believe, but other than that, he was missing because he was taking contested
jump shots.  
In the first half, he was coming off drive, draw, dish and he was hitting
them. But we came in the second half and contested all his jumpers and then
after that he couldn't touch the ball any more.  
  
Q. I know you ran in to some foul trouble and had to sit a long time, could
you talk about coming in to overtime and how comfortable were you running the
offense again, despite all the recent struggles back there?  
RAMAR SMITH: It felt good just to -- the team stepped up for me. I came in and
backed my teammates up. I tried to make play, defensive plays and on the
offensive end and I came out there and played my heart out for my teammates.  
  
Q. For Wayne, again, foul trouble in the first half, you only got in nine
minutes, I think in the second half. Can you just talk about your mindset? It
looked like you were really demanding the ball in there.  
WAYNE CHISM: That's what we needed and coach gave me the calls, but in the
first half with the two quick fouls, the same thing happened to me two days
ago. But I kept my head. Like coach said, you got to keep it in the
tournament, if you don't, you'll lose all your focus.  
I kept my focus in the first half, and in the second half, I came out and
played good and hit inside shots so coach started going inside because their
big man was in foul trouble, but even though, he was still in the game and we
still went inside. I hit a couple of shots then and we had a bunch of inside
shots and inside rebounds, that's why we won the boards.  
  
Q. Did you guys get the sense that Mike Green was maybe getting a little bit
tired or that he was trying to draw contact so hard that maybe he was taking
the focus off his, off the shot?  
TYLER SMITH: Our main focus was to make him make tough twos. He was getting to
the rack a lot, but he really wasn't trying to pull up, he was trying to
commit fouls. So we were just trying to make him make tough twos and keep our
hands straight up.  
THE MODERATOR: No more final questions for the student-athletes? You can go
back to the locker room, guys. Thank you. We'll now take questions for the
Coach Pearl.  
  
Q. You saw plenty of Butler during your days in the Horizon League, as I
asked those guys, what makes them so unique and difficult to play?  
COACH PEARL: It seems like they have got five seniors every year. Their system
is built to beat the best teams in their schedule.  
With their ball screening and their flare screening and the fact that they
will put four or five guys on the floor that can shoot the three ball.  
With Howard on the inside, it's made them a more balanced team. Now, when he
got in foul trouble and we did a good job guarding in the post, they lost that
element, they lost that dimension and that's why they -- part of the reason
why they shot 36 percent. They played great defense. They're fifth in the
nation in scoring defense, because they have five guys helping one another.
They actually defended like we defended tonight. A lot of switching, and just
very physical. They're a very physical team.  
Todd Lickliter's teams were very physical. And that's been a terrific carry-
over to Brad's teams.  
  
Q. It was obvious their strategy may have been in the last ten minutes to
drive to the basket, either score or draw a foul. What were you telling your
team to counteract that?  
COACH PEARL: I want to give you one more: The Horizon League, Detroit,
Chicago, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, there are tough kids in that league. And
that league has always had tough, physical, hard-nosed players.  
It's almost like Big-10 basketball but even tougher. I'm sorry, I apologize,
what was the question?  
  
Q. They were driving to the basket the last ten minutes and trying to draw
fouls. What were you telling your team to counteract that?  
COACH PEARL: Like Tyler said, we were trying to show our hands and trying not
to draw fouls and they did a good job of jumping in and drawing contact. We
tried to make them make tough twos, and the fact that they only made three
threes in the second half and overtime combined was key. That's the first game
Butler's lost when they have made eight are more threes this season. They
normally make more.  
I think fatigue was a factor at the foul line at some point for them because
the way -- I thought the way we guarded, I thought Tennessee really played a
great defense tonight and we did what we needed to do on the boards.  
Coach Summitt called me this morning and she reminded me about the physical
players in the tournament. And she said, because she saw the game early
against American and she said just, "Tell those guys to rebound the
basketball." I thought the way we started the game was extremely important. We
sent a message right off the bat that we were going to represent the SEC, and
I thought we showed a tremendous determination to advance.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the point guard play and then also winning
without Chris or JaJuan and really getting it going from the perimeter.  
COACH PEARL: I thought J.P. Prince played well. I thought he did a lot of good
things whether it be offensive rebounds or taking charges or making plays. Our
execution down the stretch was challenged because he's not, I mean how about
never being in that situation and finding yourself in that situation for the
first time as a point guard in the NCAA tournament.  
I thought he handled it well. I told the team, I said, "J.P. and I did not
close out regulation well." We didn't. I didn't play call well, and no fault
of his, he's never been in that situation. So I said, "Bail me out." That's
what I told him. I said bail me out. And I went with Ramar just because I knew
we were going to be in a close game-out situation and even though we hadn't
been getting great plays from Ramar, he's been in that situation before and he
obviously delivered.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday it's a bad time to mess with the point guard
position, how do you use these five or six days to get that back up to
speed?  
COACH PEARL: The deal is this: I just thought that the point guard play we
were getting wasn't going to win a national championship. So, if we make the
decision and it doesn't pay off and I'm sitting here in front of you and
explaining why I made that choice and we lost the game, I could go to bed
going, it's okay. I don't think this is going to help us advance. Watching
tonight gives us a better chance to win Thursday.  
It's not a panacea, but we got five guys out there with J.P. in that position.
I was able to do some different things offensively. I was able to do some
things that Butler hadn't seen. And that was fun. Actually, it was fun.  
  
Q. You juggled your point guard position, Lofton doesn't score in double
figures in either game, and you still are going to the Sweet 16. It looked
like you guys didn't play your best, but you got out of here with two wins. Is
that how you look at it?  
COACH PEARL: Boy, I thought we played pretty well today. I really do. Butler,
they have held 13 out of the last 14 opponents to 55 points or less, or
something like that.  
We scored 76 points. I thought we played awfully well. Turned it over a little
bit too much. We had some unforced rushing, but I thought we made a lot of
progress today.  
And yeah, we're thrilled to survive and advance, that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. You don't think great guard play's necessary to advance? You're going to
see if you can prove to do it without a true point guard?  
COACH PEARL: Well, you know, let's see, J.P. was four for five, he had seven
rebounds and five assists. He did have six turnovers. Okay. So that's nine and
seven. Ramar had eight and three. So we got 17 points and ten rebounds and he
had an assist, six assists, I thought we got pretty good point guard play.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask Brad Stevens the same question, about you did you feel
it was unfair or unfortunate that you have two 30 win teams facing each other
in the second round the earliest that's ever happened?  
COACH PEARL: Yes. A little unfair. And a little unfortunate for whoever's
going to lose this game. This is usually a Regional Final number. Butler was
ranked 10 or 11 in the country all season long. But you know what, Brad will
tell you, listen, you you're going to play great teams to advance. He'll tell
you that.  
This is the best Butler team that I have seen and how many times was Butler in
the 5-12 game? And they were seven. I mean you know it's interesting. And see
why we talk about it is, we as coaches try and schedule and figure it out so
that we can put our teams in the best position to advance. That's what we do.
So it's really not about, nobody's complaining, we're trying to learn, we're
trying to figure it out. I'm sure Butler's trying to figure, what do we got to
do, they were 30-3 or whatever they were, you know.  
  
Q. When Pete Campbell hit that unguarded three right at the end of the first
half, did that give you a teaching point for half time?  
COACH PEARL: We had him, we had that identified. We had that taught. That
would have been a breakdown.  
But Wayne I think made an excellent point. That when you switch like we were
switching, it's not always going to be the same guy on 34. And so there were
times that if one guy misses, doesn't stay in his passing lane once and one
another guy misses once next thing you know he's got three of them. So that
was a breakdown. He was a no-leave guy, he never should have been able to
catch that, been in that passing lane. We were to let somebody drive the ball
to the basket and make a two versus leaving that passing lane, and yet we left
it.  
  
Q. You said that you told them that it was your fault and J.P.'s at the end
of regulation, to pick you up in OT, how did he do it? Just poise?  
COACH PEARL: You know what, sometimes you tell them that, because they're
looking, it he they didn't want to be in overtime. And they're looking for
somebody to blame. So go ahead and blame me. And let them band together. And
if they love me, they will bail me out. And Ramar has been -- I love Ramar.
I'm on him pretty hard. And his teammates have got confidence in him to go
make plays. And you know, I thought, defensively, I mean, we did okay. And we
held them again they shot, they didn't shoot a good percentage in overtime, we
did. So it's just away to get them to band together.  
  
Q. Now you get to go to Charlotte next week and another level. Playing a
tough game at this level, could it be now that you won it, an advantage,
because you got one of these under your belts, they always talk about you have
to struggle to get to that next level.  
COACH PEARL: We struggled plenty. We struggled last year against Virginia, to
advance to San Antonio in that game. So there's no question I think that
winning these games does give a team confidence. The one thing about this
basketball team, I coached a lot of teams, this has been my most resilient
team. They do find ways to win and I think it's because this is a close team,
there's terrific chemistry, we have too many weapons, and they count on one
another. And you take the play of Ramar Smith and J.P. Prince at the point
guard and that says it all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [David Godbold](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16982)

### [Taylor Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18176)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Oklahoma news conference. We'll take
an opening statement by Coach Capel and then take questions for the student-
athletes.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, congrats to Louisville, they were very, very good
today. They were very good on Friday as well.  
They're playing at an extremely high level and they shot it well today. They
defended really well, which they have been doing all year.  
So first of all, I want to congratulate them. It's disappointing today, I was
really proud of our team for our season. This won't diminish the body of work
that we have done all year. And it's been a group that's been great to coach.
We fought through all kind of different types of adversity, and these guys
just kept giving you the honest effort every day. And these two guys beside me
are a big part of that. David being a four year guy, and really going through
a lot during his time here. But to stick it through and to get this program to
be a big part of getting this program back to somewhat of a level of where it
was when he first got here I think speaks volumes about him and Longar.  
Taylor being his third year, I thought that he helped us have a really good
season this year.  
So we're proud of that, this hurts, it's disappointing, but like I said,
that's not going to diminish everything that we have done this year and all
that we have accomplished.  
So I'm sure after a few days and we'll get this taste out of our mouth as we
get this taste out of our mouth, we'll be able to reflect back even more on
the season that we had and I hope these guys are as proud as I am of what we
have accomplished this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Guys, if you will address the defensive pressure that they put on you,
because I know you played some teams that played good defense, but that was
pretty intense, wasn't it, what they did defensively.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, they stayed really active, they didn't back off at all.
And I congratulate them on that. They even when we broke it a couple times to
get a score, they kept with it and I know their coach was really pleased with
that. They just kept a lot of energy and they did a good job today.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: They did an excellent job pressuring us, especially in the
back court. When a team does that, it makes it a little bit harder to get into
your offense and it slows you down, so by the time you cross half court, you
hardly got seven, eight seconds, knocked off the shot clock.  
So they did an excellent job defending us that way and we just got to be able
to handle it better.  
  
Q. Taylor, I know you're coming off a tough loss right now, but I was
wondering if you could talk about David and what he's meant to this team,
especially these last two days, the way that he played and just throughout his
senior year for you guys?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: Yeah, David and Longar both are really the only two guys on
this team that experienced a win in the NCAA tournament, as far as players go.  
The way he played yesterday, and just different moments throughout the season,
when he stepped up and hit a big shot or had a big game, it speaks volumes.
He's, David's kind of, he's a leader, undoubtedly, but he leads more by
example I think than anything. And the example that he kind of laid the
foundation for guys like Cade and Tony, guards that their first year here,
they kind of have a role model or an example to look up to and kind of model
their work ethic or their game after.  
  
Q. David, what will you take for your OU career and how this program has
grown under you and under your new head coach Jeff Capel here?  
DAVID GODBOLD: I'm really proud of just this season how we bounced back from a
very, I say just not good season the previous one, and I know Coach Capel's
going to bring in guys and the guys he still has here, hopefully they see what
happened this season and hopefully take another step further than what we got.
We kind of got the bumps and bruises this year and kind of set the foundation
for hopefully putting Oklahoma back to where it used to be before I got here
and before any of those guys used to watch OU basketball.  
I'm just really proud of my career here and I'm sad it had to go, but it had
to go sometime, either I would have won the last game or I would have lost the
last game. So I have no regrets about the season and, no, I just look forward
to having Taylor and Austin stepping up next year, along with Omar being those
seniors and I hope they have a good season.  
  
Q. David, you hit three three's in the span of a little more than two
minutes. Shortly after that's there was a TV time out. It seemed like it was
really hard for you to get another open look it seemed like they were trying
to lock you down after that happened.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, they, I heard Coach Pitino calling out, "Shooter,
shooter", every time I caught it and the guys responded by getting out to me,
but once they did that, I had no hesitation about throwing it inside to the
big guys. I know they can hold their own with anybody in the country and
unfortunately it just got a little out of hand and they made a big run and we
couldn't really respond to that. But I give all the credit to Louisville, they
played a really good game. They had a great leader ship out there, they played
as a team, and they came out with a victory today.  
  
Q. Taylor, I wonder what kind of advice you're going to give your brother as
he thinks about his options.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: One thing we agreed on was not to talk about it until the
season was over and obviously we're to that point now. You know, I'm kind of
split just because as a brother you want what's best for him. As a teammate, I
would want what's best for this team.  
Ultimately, the brother comes out more than the teammate. We're going to talk
about it as a family. He's been, he'll talk about it with my parents, Coach
Capel, some of the people that are really close. I really can't tell you
anything about what I think he's going to do or whatever, but I want him to do
what's best for him. As we get closer to figuring out what that is, we'll see
what happens. But as of right now, I'm behind his decision as long as I think
it's what's best for him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. Head back to your locker room, if you would
like. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, it seemed like it was whether it was their zone that pressure, it
was tough for Blake just to even get shots of the he only took six shots for
game three in each half?  
COACH CAPEL: Yeah, it was tough. Blake sometimes has a hard time against
zones. Because he doesn't really shoot the ball outside of the paint or around
the block area.  
Their zone really pressured our guards. One of the things we didn't get, we
didn't get any penetration against it for awhile there in the first half. All
we did was just settle for 3's. It was almost like the 3's that we hit early
were a little bit of fools gold.  
And I thought we settled sometimes when we had opportunities to drive and we
also had opportunities to flash. We didn't do that.  
But as much as you go over stuff in practice, you watch tape, a short amount
of time to prepare, when you get out there and that pressure hits you, and
that speed and that athleticism and the length that Louisville constantly
throws at you, it becomes more difficult to do what you know you're supposed
to do. Sometimes it becomes a little bit more difficult to think because
you're trying to figure out how to get, you know, how to get out of this
pressure that you're in. And give them credit, they keep the pressure up, they
have the bodies and athleticism and the length. Those guys are in really good
shape and they can keep it up.  
  
Q. We asked coach Pitino about his style and of playing all over the court
and the pressuring and then playing up and down. And he attributed being able
to do that to having players who could do that. As you get better players,
will your style of ball change any? Will it be more to what this style that
Louisville had?  
COACH CAPEL: We went to play a style that's going to win. First of all. I
think we did that this year.  
As we continue to build our program and add through recruiting, and then
hopefully our guys get better. That's a big thing. When you look at
Louisville, when you can bring a guy like Earl Clark off the bench, Earl
Clark's a pro. When you can bring a guy like that off the bench, that speaks
for the talent that you have in your program. Caracter was a Top-5, Top-10
player coming out of high school. He was a guy that played 11 minutes tonight.  
So they had big bodies, long, athletic bodies so they can do that. Hopefully
as we continue to build and add we will be able to do those things more. You
have to coach what you have and I think our staff and our players did a great
job of that this year of playing a style that was conducive for us winning
this year.  
As we continue to add -- you know, every team is different. If you watch Coach
Pitino's teams when he was at Kentucky, I don't think they ever played zone.
They just pressured you throughout man, things like that. They're primarily a
zone defensive team now. They get back in man after misses. They didn't miss a
lot tonight, so they were in zone a lot.  
But that's what they are. So he's changed as his personnel has changed. And
they do different types of pressure now. It's a zone press, back to a zone,
off of free throw throws or dead balls they will go to a man press, back into
a man at times, or they may fall back in zone.  
  
Q. You only had 16 turnovers I say only people probably think you had more.
But was this a game where that pressure those numbers don't really tell
because it looked like they just disrupted you so much you didn't even really
run your offense at times or you just barely got it over half court.  
COACH CAPEL: Bad shots are in my mind turnovers too. They don't show up, but
bad shots or hurried shots or rushed shots those are turnovers. When you look
at opportunities, the few that we had, in transition, where we don't convert,
they may show up as a missed field goal attempt, but when you don't convert
them in my mind those are turnovers as well.  
So I don't think the 16 probably tells the story. We were just rushed and
hurried all night. And we talked about since we found out we were playing
Louisville, we talked about our guys having poise. And really having poise.
And being confident and playing strong.  
Unfortunately, we didn't do that today. And like I say, you give all the
credit to Louisville, because they made us play at their pace. And we couldn't
keep up.  
  
Q. What did you learn from this year's second season about this team and
what's the next step for your Oklahoma program?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, first of all I learned that these guys are kids of great
character. And we over came a lot this year from injuries, to losing guys,
before the season getting rid of guys, during the season losing a guy. Guys
missing games because of injuries, missing practices because of injuries. But
yet this team always found a way to respond. We were counted out and kind of
left for dead whether it was at the Stephen F. Austin, after Colorado, after
Nebraska, this team responded and so I think they showed a lot as young men
growing and becoming men, because you can do that and learn that lesson and in
college, especially through there you through athletics, I think that bodes
well for them for the rest of their lives.  
With me, I think this is a really big step for us. To get to the NCAA
tournament, to get to the second round of the NCAA tournament, obviously today
is really disappointing, but like I said, earlier, when you look back on our
body of work and what we have done all year, I'm really proud of our guys. I'm
really excited about our future. I think we have a good class coming in. With
the four young men that we have signed. I think we have some guys coming back
that are good players. And we'll figure out what Blake wants to do. And I'm
like Taylor, whatever he wants to do is fine with me. It's his decision. His
family's decision. I'll help them as much as they want me to. But I'm excited
about the future of our program and where we go from here.  
  
Q. I know you talked about it locally, but you're up here on the big stage
so I'll ask, is there any chance you listen to South Carolina and any chance
you won't be at Oklahoma next year?  
COACH CAPEL: You know what? I don't think so. We just lost by 30. So I don't
really want to entertain questions about anything except for our program and I
just talked about our future, so obviously I'm planning on being here
hopefully for a long time.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH CAPEL: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
BIRMINGHAM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BIRMINGHAM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Terry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18414)

### [Terrence Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17013)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the bench play the last few games, Earl coming
off the bench now it seems like you guys have really got a huge lift from your
bench the last few games.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Yeah, we kind of gotten people, anybody can start,
anybody's capable of starting. So that just shows you, Earl started a lot this
year, so he's really a starter, everybody is pretty much a starter. It's just
we don't fall into the who starts and who don't start type of attitude.
Everybody just comes out and play. And that's indicative of our bench every
night.  
  
Q. For both of you start with you Jerry your impressions of Oklahoma, if you
have been able to see anything on them yet and do they compare to anybody in
your league?  
JERRY SMITH: Well, Oklahoma's a very big team, they compare like a lot of
teams, they're very physical. They got great inside play, big guards, and he
they shoot it well as well. So they're a lot like our team. A lot like our
teams in the Big East.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I would agree with Jerry this will be kind of the battle of
our bigs and their bigs, with Blake and Longar, but we can't make it as just
David Padgett and Earl Clark versus them two, we got to make it a team game.
But we seen them play against West Virginia when they went to two over times
and they had a good showing in that game and we seen their game yesterday, we
watched film. So this will be a very fast paced game, a lot, a real physical
game, a Big East type game. So it should be fun.  
  
Q. Talk about what last night may have done for you guys, some talked about
inconsistent shooting, this and that, coming off two losses, I would think
that would have been a big confidence booster for both of you.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Yeah, whenever you get back on track and other times, but
now you get back on track of winning, it boosts your confidence, I don't know
what we shot from the 3-point line or what we shot for the game, but I felt
that we shot the ball well and if we're going to play here for two games, I
feel this is a good gym to shoot well in. I think that it kind of showed that
nobody had jitters. I thought some people would be nervous and scared, but a
lot of people didn't, everybody came out to play. So hopefully that can carry
on throughout the tournament.  
JERRY SMITH: I agree with what he said. Nobody came out with a lot of jitters
last night, kind of just flowed into the things. Offense was flowing, we were
getting stops defensively and I think that was key.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, guys. We'll have an opening statement
from Coach Pitino and then take questions.  
COACH PITINO: We're excited, obviously, to advance. We know we have a tough
ball game against a very physical team. A team that can do damage in so many
ways with so many different players. So we're excited about moving on to the
next round and hopefully our players will be up for the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Give us your assessment then of this Oklahoma team the challenges that
they put to your ball club.  
COACH PITINO: They have got a terrific low post presence. They have got good
senior leadership. They're very good at the defensive end. You really don't --
you understand that there are certain people you have to stop because they
shoot a high percentage, but other players crop up and have big nights as they
did last night and certainly we know definitely we have our work cut out for
us.  
  
Q. How much does experience coaching-wise mean in a scenario such as this as
opposed to say Jeff Capel's experience as a player in scenarios like this
would you think?  
COACH PITINO: I don't think either one's a factor. I think players win games.
And I know that Jeff is not only a capable basketball player, but that's not
going to help his coaching ability right now. And his lack of tournament
experience is not going to hurt him. He's a terrific, terrific young coach
that his players are going to dictate when he wins or loses and he's going to
do all the right things to get them ready.  
  
Q. You mentioned young coaches last night, there seem to be a lot of them,
do they have any advantages or disadvantages do you feel?  
COACH PITINO: In what regard?  
  
Q. Well just you have 30 years of experience, Brad Stevens has one. Those
sort of things.  
COACH PITINO: Well Brad's one of the guys that I was alluding to last night as
one of the premier young coaches in our game. There's no advantage or
disadvantage. Really it's the makeup of your basketball team. I think you
learn obviously, when you're in the business a long time you learn what not to
do. You don't necessarily know any more than any young coach. You just learn
what not to do in certain situations. And that's just time and experience. As
time goes along you learn what not to do, what paths not to take, and you sort
of learn to take two steps back in certain situations so you can take ten
forward. And that's all experience does for you. It's learning what not to do.  
But these young coaches really have a good concept of what to do offensively
and defensively and they're on top of their game.  
  
Q. Then it seems like the low post, traditional low post offense is sort of
a dying thing. You've got one of the few traditional low post players left in
the tournament. Wonder if you would agree with that that it's a rare thing?  
COACH PITINO: Well not in the Big East. In the Big East the low post game is a
big presence. You get it with at Pittsburgh, at Georgetown, with Padgett and
Caracter with us. So in the Big East it's a lot different. Nova doesn't have
a, or West Virginia, a traditional low post offense, but in the Big East,
you'll find that a strongly post presence is there.  
I think it varies from conference to conference. I think big men go to the
pros a lot quicker. Connecticut had a strongly post presence with Adrian. So
in the Big East we seem to have a dominance on five men and low post play. But
I understand where you're coming from and I think you need both. I don't care
if you're undersized, I think if you're just, if you're just perimeter and you
don't work inside to out, you can't shoot a high percentage. On a given night
you can, but the nights that you're off and you need to go inside, you don't
have it. So I think you need both.  
  
Q. How important as a motivational tool is a loss in the tournament the guys
talk about that loss to Texas A & M last year it's something that drove them
all summer that they don't want to have that feeling again.   
COACH PITINO: I think all those, the motivational aspect is great because look
at how hard they worked. And that's great. But when it comes to game night,
it's not going to, again, it goes back to offense and defensive execution.
Everybody is -- one of the questions the other night was about Boise State, if
we felt that they would be more motivated because they hadn't been here and I
said absolutely not. We could lose to them, but they're not going to play with
any more hunger than we will.  
It's the same thing with the Oklahoma game, two teams are going to want it
badly, the motivation comes from the hard work and perspiration you put in the
off months to try and get better, personally, as well as team-wise. But come
game night it's going to boil down to execution at the offense and defensive
ends.  
  
Q. Not expecting you to reveal how you plan to play against Blake Griffin,
talk about the importance of putting pressure on him since he's a young guy
and maybe just him specifically.  
COACH PITINO: Well, you're right, I'm not going to talk about it because it
makes no sense for me to talk about it. Because I would lie to you and I don't
believe in lying to the press. I would tell you the truth.  
  
Q. Talk about the --  
COACH PITINO: I think he's tremendous, but Longar Longar is also a big problem
in the low post. He's a big offensive threat as well. So you got a double-
edged sword there, it's not just one player. One player obviously shoots 57
percent from the field he's one of the premier freshmen in the nation and
takes great shots.  
  
Q. Who have you played who reminds you of teams you play in the Big East or
non-conference that anybody that you've even before?  
COACH PITINO: They have got a little bit like Pittsburgh. Play a little bit
like them. They're very physical. Very good inside presence. Very good
defensively.  
  
Q. When you go up against a guy you've never coached against or a team that
you haven't seen, what does David Godbold's 25 points present in your
defensive scheme when normally he isn't the scoring guy. Is it a confusing
fact, is it more confusing or is it you have to do more tape work or do you
just rely on your own players capabilities?  
COACH PITINO: You never know who is going to step up in a basketball game. I
remember clear as day in 1987 playing Georgetown and the MVP of the game was
our 7th man, Darrell Wright. He stepped up and had a great night.  
So it really doesn't, you don't know, it is your defensive scheme of what
you're trying to stop. And what you're trying to do to each player on the
basketball team. Obviously last night we were trying to stop the 3-point shot.
We were trying to keep them out of the middle of the floor. We were trying to
create turnovers. And make sure that they didn't have their legs when they did
get the 3-point shot. So every opponent brings a different set of
circumstances that you have to stop.  
  
Q. Big East now with the West Virginia beating Duke, 8-1 so far in the
tournament, did you think it would be that strong and, two, did you see the
shot that Rodgers hit for Western Kentucky and what was your reaction to
that?  
COACH PITINO: I thought it was a very difficult shot. He had three guys
hanging on him. Great victory for Western Kentucky. It's tough when you have
that lead and you lose that lead and then you come away with a loss, that's a
bitter pill to swallow. So they came away with a victory and not only a much
needed victory, but one that they truly deserved because they played terrific
basketball and Drake had a great see some.  
The Big East, I call it the Big Beast, because that's what it is, and the good
news is the Big East was a very strong league this year as we anticipated. The
bad news is they will get stronger next year because every team has just about
every player back. So it's a very competitive league comprised of tough kids
and very talented teams that as we all know just from watching earlier in the
year, I happened to watch it, I don't know why that night, but West Virginia
had a heck of a basketball with Oklahoma in a double overtime loss in the
State of West Virginia.  
So it's, West Virginia is a heck of a basketball team and all these teams that
are left are really good basketball teams. Connecticut was the lone team that
ran into a great night by San Diego in terms of shooting the ball.  
  
Q. (Question about injuries.)  
COACH PITINO: That happens in games, that's not a reason to lose the game,
you're going to have an injury in a given game, but Big East teams are all
strong enough to overcome that.  
  
Q. Can you remember when you were a young coach like Jeff Capel, 33, that
experience factor you talked about, earlier that you thought after a game, you
went against a coach that was maybe in his 50s and his experience was an
advantage for him?  
COACH PITINO: I really mean this: It's not a factor in the game. It really
isn't. It's not a factor. It's just, I mean, if you watch Butler play, you
realize the age of their coach is not a factor. Last night how much did Jim
Calhoun's age determine whether they win or lose? It's the players on the
court. It's the same everywhere. I mean, somebody's age is not a factor in
this whole equation or how many years of experience he has. Sometimes it's in
the way you travel and the way you prepare, you've been through it so many
times, but come game night the players are going to dictate whether you win or
lose, not the coaches.  
  
Q. Does the fact that y'all have played at several different styles this
year alleviate maybe some of the concern over playing two teams with different
contrasting sometimes such as Boise State and Oklahoma with the short-term
turn around?  
COACH PITINO: I think we're ready for any style, but I think so is Oklahoma.
Oklahoma plays in a very strong conference where they see every style as well.
So I don't think it's an advantage for us or an advantage for them. I think
when you play in conferences like we play in, you see every style. We, ours is
just a little bit bigger than everybody elses.  
But it's, they're from a very tough conference, two teams, two conferences
that happen to be very strong this year. You all know the way that works, it's
cyclical from year to year. This year the SEC may be a little down and next
year it could be some other conference a little down. It changes year to year.  
  
Q. Earlier among the same lines of talking about coaches facing each other,
Jeff Capel said if it was you and him one-on-one he likes his chances. Do you
think you could take him outside and drive past him and beat him in a one on
one game?  
COACH PITINO: Not any more.  
(Laughter.) He's right on that one. He's got me.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Last few games you've brought Earl Clark off the bench, what went into
that decision making and how has that improved your bench play with him?  
COACH PITINO: I just go with the guys who I think are the most focused from a
scouting report at the beginning of the game. It's not about talent, it's
about the guys who we can really rely on making sure that they do the right
things at the beginning of the game so that you get off to a good start. And
that's why I start McGee, I start two juniors and two seniors, it's not based
on talent.  
  
Q. When you came into Kentucky and into the SEC a few years ago you talked
about the conference needing to go deep into the tournament to really
establish a reputation. I'm curious now if, how important you think conference
reputation still is nationally and even for seedings and tournament bids like
that?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's a, again, it's almost like recruiting, you know, in
high school. One year New York city is awesome, next year Chicago, next year
L.A. and it changes just like conferences. It's a, the conference is, right
now in the Big East, is very strong. We knew we were rebuilding the year
before and now we know we're very good this year and we know we're going to be
awesome next year. Because when you look at it, every team has about just
about every player back.  
So it's all cyclical. But everything is so close, I mean you see West Virginia
beat Duke today, but Belmont almost beat them and they're a two seed. So it's
all very, very close and it's which style wins out. That's the key. Is which
style is going to win.  
In certain instances teams that overplay, go against a back door team, like
West Virginia, advantage West Virginia on that given night if Duke is not
shooting well. So it's all styles on a given night.  
You look at it, it's no different than Wisconsin and Kansas State, the
different styles, styles sometimes in our game against Boise State last night
we thought our press could bother them and from a style standpoint it did.  
  
Q. I guess what I'm really curious about conference reputations which again
I go back you remember how fragile the SEC was in terms of their seeding, they
were overlooked as a conference. Are conference reputations still tournament
to tournament or are they static, are they established better now?  
COACH PITINO: I think those days are over with. Back when I was in the SEC
everybody talked about outside of Kentucky that it was Kentucky and the rest
of the league depending upon what year it was it could be Arkansas or Florida
and it could be, but Kentucky was always the standard bearer for the league.  
That's not the case any more. Everybody is just, as it is with the ACC or the
Big East, with us in the Big East, Georgetown's won it two years in a row,
which is extremely difficult in that conference to do that.  
But Georgetown realizes that West Virginia, Pittsburgh, or any of the teams
that they're going to face could beat them on a given night. So it's, I think
it's just year to year. And I think that the SEC will be strong once again,
but it's just, it will be another year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Tennessee student-athletes. Take
questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler, what would you say, what aspect of your game would you say has
improved the most just over the course of this year?  
TYLER SMITH: I'm just trying to find my teammates. Coach just told me to make
plays. I can't really say what's my strength. I guess get to the basket. I'm
just trying to get my teammates open shots.  
  
Q. This question is for Chris, both Tennessee and Butler, if you look at the
situation are coming in with maybe a chip on your shoulder, I know you guys
felt like you deserved a number one seed and I know Butler thought they should
deserve higher than a 7 seed. That being said, can you touch on just how
competitive it's going to be tomorrow, two teams really trying to prove
something?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Yeah, it's going to be a grind-out game. A physical game. I can
see that. Both teams are playing with a chip on our shoulder and we're out to
prove something. So it should be a great game.  
  
Q. Talk about this, Tyler, you weren't there last year but Chris and JaJuan
were, talk about playing Butler last year and what you got to do this year to
be more successful than what you were last year.  
CHRIS LOFTON: I think last year we overlooked Butler. Being from the Horizon
League and then we found out that it doesn't matter in college basketball,
that all teams are great. Butler's a great team and they showed that last year
and they showed it this year.  
So, we just know that we got our hands full and we have to play a great
basketball game and control the boards and play great defense.  
JAJUAN SMITH: And, as a team, we just felt like we didn't come ready to play
last year against Butler. We were well-prepared from our coaches, we just
didn't perform up to our ability, and now we know what we got to do with them
and we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. For Tyler, how does your role change when J.P.'s at the point versus
Ramar?  
TYLER SMITH: I'm still the four-man. Regardless. J.P. makes plays just like I
do, it's just another playmaker out there on the court looking for an open
man. So I don't think it changes it much. J.P.'s just finds the man like I do.  
  
Q. Coach Pearl talked about how Ramar Smith and Jordan Howell are they very
different at the point guard position? What are some of the differences
between J.P. at the point and Ramar at the point?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Their games are all different from each other. But when they're
at the point they know what they got to do and we can read either one. We know
how to play with our three and we have just been working on that all season
long getting prepared, and I think coach is going to put the better point
guard on the floor for our opponent. They can't matchup with them so he's
going to put the best one out there on the floor.  
  
Q. Chris, you mentioned playing Butler last year, when you hear them
referred to as a Mid Major, having played them and seen what they can do --
does that sort of go off in your head when you hear that?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Yes. These mid majors are really taking over. Mid Majors are the
future, I think. They're great basketball teams and they have players that get
overlooked, but just having the ability, and they play to their best of their
ability. I think that's what Butler is. They got great players, great solid
role players, and just they can do a lot of things.  
  
Q. Chris, do you remember how Butler defended you last year and what player
was on you and if you expect them to be on you tomorrow, as well?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Not really. I remember I got in foul trouble and didn't play
most of the first half. We got beat, so that's the only thing I remember.  
  
Q. Chris, how is your hamstring?  
CHRIS LOFTON: It's fine. What happened to it?  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You said yesterday that it was a little sore before the game.  
CHRIS LOFTON: Oh, yeah, that was nothing. No, that wasn't a big deal. That was
just -- I pulled it during warm-ups a little bit. It wasn't that big a deal.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For any of the players, what has Coach Pearl told you about Butler?
Obviously, you've seen them up close, you played them last season, but I guess
-- what did he emphasize in his preparation speaking to you guys?  
JAJUAN SMITH: He just told us we're going to have our hands full from the
beginning to the end. And we got to come ready to play our best ball game and
it's going to take a special performance from each and everyone of us.  
CHRIS LOFTON: Just to be ready to play for 40 minutes, because they're going
to make runs, we're going to make runs and the game's not going to be a blow-
out. We just know that we have to play for 40 minutes and our best basketball.  
  
Q. Tyler, is your role with the Tennessee team pretty much the same as it
was last year or how different is it?  
TYLER SMITH: Last year, I was kind of like a go-to guy if our main man wasn't
on. So, this year we got so many weapons that I really just let the game come
to me and don't take as many shots as I did last year or have the ball in my
hands as much.  
  
Q. JaJuan, they shot 15 of 33, yesterday, what do you guys going to have to
stop that?  
JAJUAN SMITH: We're going to have to communicate with each other and ball
pressure and try to make them put the ball on the ground. Because that's their
specialty. They like to shoot the three-ball like we do so we got to man-up
and rebound and limit them to one chance.  
  
Q. Chris, did you see any of the Butler's game last yesterday? They had
Streicher really shut down South Alabama's top guard, top scorer, did you see
what he was doing well?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Not really. I saw the highlights of the game. I really didn't
watch it. We didn't have it on in our hotel, but we know that Butler's a great
defensive team and we know that we have to do a lot of things to score.  
  
Q. For Chris and JaJuan, Butler has two great guards and in Graves and
Green, they play off of each other pretty well. Can you guys talk about that,
what you guys have been able to do for Tennessee this year and your
communication on the court that lead to victories?  
CHRIS LOFTON: The guard play's real important during the tournament time. They
have the ball in their hands, and the guards, they try to make plays and on
the defensive end and offensive end, the guards are key to the game.  
JAJUAN SMITH: We've seen them in the past, they're two great players and we
know what they're capable of doing. But we also want to be in that category,
too. So, it's another chance for me and Chris to step up and make a name for
ourselves, also.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll have an opening statement from
Coach Pearl and then take questions.  
COACH PEARL: I have the distinction or pleasure or I've had the opportunity to
play against this system, I think on ten occasions. And it is as challenging a
system of basketball to cover. I think what Butler does on both sides,
offensive and defensive, Lee is as good as there is. The Phoenix Suns get a
lot of credit for the things they do in the NBA as far as their offense is
concerned and their ball screen stuff and it's well deserved.  
I think at the college level, Butler's been doing this for a long time. And
they do it as well, spreading and ball screening and terrific intelligent
plays. And the thing they don't get enough credit for is their defense. They
help one another tremendously, they build a wall, make it very, very difficult
to penetrate and they don't beat themselves up by fouling.  
So, it's a team with great history, tradition, the Hinkle Fieldhouse, one of
the great places to coach and play, and so it's an honor to be playing them at
this time. Not often, I don't know when in the last -- in the history of this
tournament you have a two teams with 30 wins in the second round. So you got
two terrific basketball teams.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for Coach Pearl.  
  
Q. You mentioned the two 30 game winners, actually, it's never happened in
the history of this tournament. Should this be labeled like the Snub Bowl
because I think both teams ended up with seeds that were kind of startled
them.  
COACH PEARL: Yeah, but you got to see, you got to beat great teams on the road
to the Final Four at some point. Butler was ranked 10 in the country. That
would put them in the first three lines, I would think. And for them to fall
all the way to seven was something that I'm sure that they were a little
surprised at or disappointed in.  
For us, I thought we were, based on what we had done and the body of work, I
thought we were a one seed. I can tell you the committee does try and pick the
best four teams to be at the one line and I don't know that we are. If I was
in that room, and you said coach, who are the top four teams in the country, I
would not put Tennessee there.  
For a number of different reasons, if you want to talk about whether Butler or
Tennessee deserve to be as far, as what I think the math is all about and the
body of work and that, we both did everything we possibly could to put
ourselves in better positions to see another 30-win team in the second round.  
  
Q. 15 of 30 from 3-point range yesterday. Butler, how tough of a matchup is
that for you defensively?  
COACH PEARL: They're a nightmare to match up with. Now, Butler's 22-0 when
they hit 8 or more threes. And they made nine in the first half yesterday.
Campbell had 8.  
It's a wonderful offense. When you get -- whatever offense you run, when you
put four guys out there that can shoot it, it just makes the defense so
challenged. And it does spread you out.  
So we're going to obviously have to do everything we can to try to take that
three ball away. We have defended Butler well in the past. They're better this
year than any Butler team I've played. And again, they do a great job
defensively. They're fifth in the nation in scoring defense. And they have
held 14 opponents down below 55 points. And last year they held us to 42 or 46
or something like that. 44. Okay.  
  
Q. Kind of a two part question, one, Butler often is referred to as a Mid
Major, you wonder what goes through your mind when you hear a team that's had
the success they had described that way; and then secondly, given the way
seniors are sort of a dying breed in the game, when a team like that can put
five of them out on the floor at the same time what kind of advantage does
that give them?  
COACH PEARL: They got five seniors, they got guys in grad school, they have
doctors on there. It's just an amazing collection of experience.  
I love the Mid Major tag. I was proud of the Mid Major tag when I was a Mid
Major. Because it separated you a little bit from the if you want to call them
high majors or the BCS conferences and that didn't mean we couldn't play with
them, and certainly I think the way Butler's built their system, it's built to
beat the most talented teams based on what they do, in fact, I would say that
what they do works against more traditional size, than it does even in their
own league sometimes, where they see smaller players that are able to matchup
with what they do better.  
So for me, I think it's great that Butler's carrying the banner for the Mid
Majors or that Western Kentucky or Siena or all those teams that Davidson, you
know, I mean I wouldn't be at Tennessee if I didn't take Milwaukee to the
Sweet 16 as a Mid Major the last, I guess that was the last time a 12 seed has
advanced to the Sweet 16. There's a chance that one could go this year. So I
think we all root for the Mid Majors. And all root for the underdogs at this
time of the year. I always do. Not tomorrow, not tomorrow, but I tend to
always root for the underdog.  
  
Q. A lot of young coaches early 30's, two here at this site, you were a
young coach at one time probably, do they have an advantage in the extra
energy, do they have a disadvantage because of the lack of experience?  
COACH PEARL: The only advantage they have over me is they might be smarter
than I am or they might be better coaches, they maybe were better players.
Those young guys don't have any more energy than I do. I promise you.  
  
Q. Talk about how their style might give a high major with a bit more size
more problems, but what exactly do you mean?  
COACH PEARL: Because of their ball screens and their flare screens and they're
exit action, they take advantage of bigs that aren't as mobile. And it's just
a very, very difficult, it puts a lot of pressure on your big people to have
to get out there and guard that ball screen action. Like American did to us
yesterday, when they ball screened us and we hedged, we weren't in a very good
position to rebound. And then of course American did a great job going to the
boards themselves.  
  
Q. Would the with the game that Chris had yesterday it was definitely off
his normal game and with the guard that you're going up against tomorrow, what
do you say to him, how do you shake him out of that?  
COACH PEARL: The best way for me to shake him out of it is to say nothing to
him. Because he, Chris pays very close attention to what you say and if you
make too much of it, it can distract him or bother him.  
I sent Chris a message today in our walk through by some things that we want
to try to do to get him open. And I don't have to say it, really don't need to
say anything else other than we'll call on him again, because he's delivered
for us all season long.  
The only -- I'll take credit for some of that in the sense that I put Chris on
Carr a great deal. Chris has become an improved defender. And there are times
when I believe that Chris Lofton and JaJuan Smith are our two best on the ball
defenders. And as a result of doing that, I probably wore him out and he was
not able to offensively be able to do what he normally does because of all the
effort he had to exert. And so that's a great question, because you're right,
now I'm challenged tomorrow by Green and Graves who are certainly going to be
as challenging as Carr, you know, what to do about that. So let's just say
it's a good challenge.  
  
Q. Tyler Smith was talking about how he play as different role for you guys
than he did with Iowa. You have so much, he has so much talent around him here
he just let's the game come to him. But sometimes would you prefer that he
takes charge more and tries to trust maybe force isn't the right word, but
take charge and do more?  
COACH PEARL: Yeah, like for example the last possession of the first half
Tyler came off a down screen and he had an open look, but it wasn't a great
look. And even though the clock was running down and it was probably going to
be a last shot, maybe a rebound situation, could have been an offensive
rebound, he turned it down and handed one off to JaJuan who got a bad shot.
And so there was an example of Tyler being unselfish, but at the same time
maybe not aggressive enough for his own stuff.  
When you lead your team in field goal percentage and you lead your team in
assists, it becomes a challenge for you because we rely on him to get guys the
ball. And at the same time we have tried to put the ball in his hands in
certain situations to go win us basketball games. And he has.  
I just think he's a great teammate. He is a great teammate. And he doesn't put
himself in position to fail very often. If he doesn't have a good look, he's
going to get somebody else the ball. Part of the evolution of Tyler Smith this
year was him doing just setting his teammates up completely in the early
portion of the season and then finding ways himself to score. I will tell you
this: That as the tournament goes on and here we are, you know, in a situation
where we're playing against a terrific team, your best players have got to
step up and make plays. Because everybody is challenged. Everybody's
challenged. So Tyler is going to have to probably do even more against Butler
than he did against American.  
  
Q. You tried J.P. Prince at point guard yesterday, how do you feel that
worked out? Do you think he'll play a lot more there tomorrow?  
COACH PEARL: I'm planning on playing J.P. at point. 40 minutes for Ramar and
Jordan, that's just too many minutes. They have not played well enough at the
position to warrant the minutes. And I tried Jordan in the first half with
J.P. and I tried Ramar in the second half with J.P., and it's an interesting
time of the year to be doing it, I did it in the Kentucky game as well, it
didn't get as much notice, but I did play J.P. at point guard in the Kentucky
game. I went back to Jordan at the Florida game and Jordan delivered and made
some big shots. But Jordan's 4-40 in his last 40 threes and they're good look,
Jordan is getting great looks. But you got to make them. Not just take them.
So we're going to -- my job is also to get the best players on the floor. And
while J.P. he only had one assist and three turnovers, he made some plays
defensively, he took some charges, he actually had a couple of other balls
that could have counted as assists, but somebody may have put the ball down on
the floor. So getting my best players on the floor is really why J.P.'s
playing some at the point. And I'm hoping that it was the right decision.  
  
Q. From having studied Butler, what do you anticipate they do, will do
defensively against Chris and who do you think would guard him?  
COACH PEARL: Butler has got a great team defensive philosophy and Graves will
probably take Chris, but he'll have a lot of help. Because they have got great
help principles.  
We have seen them before, Green tends to matchup with point guards and Graves
tends to matchup with shooting guards. And that's how I think they will go.  
They will jump out on Chris and make him put the ball on the floor and then
have a lot of help in there behind the ball pressure. Any kind of ball screen
they will probably switch it or hedge it and recover. But Chris won't come off
a hand off or a ball screen without a hand in his face.  
The difference is Butler just won't extend much beyond the 3-point line.
They're going to build a wall one step beyond the 3-point line and make it
difficult for you to penetrate.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay thank you, coach.  
COACH PEARL: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Blake, looking back at your season it seems like it's been a series of
ups and downs, you've won five of your last eight. Talk about your season,
some of the challenges, I guess and the fact that you're here in the second
round of the tournament?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's an honor to be here considering what we have been
through kind of as a team. With injuries and players being ineligible.  
It kind of shows you what kind of team we have been, and I think we have done
a good job of staying and fighting and not giving up. Even though we had some
rough patches where we lost three or four games. I just think we have done a
great job of staying together overall, as a team, and bouncing back from big
losses or games that we shouldn't have lost trying to put a run together.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, can you just tell me, talk to me about playing
alongside each other. It seems like you two really work well together. How are
you guys able to do that?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's just kind of been a process over the season and
all summer, kind of getting used to each other and I give a lot of credit to
Longar for kind of taking me in and showing me some things that normally
players wouldn't pick up on as fast. So he has kind of shown me the ropes a
little bit. And, I think, at the same time, we both tried to help each other
out a lot, as much as we can.  
It makes it easy because he's a good passer, so when he gets double teamed he
can normally find me or any of the other guards, so I think that we both kind
of take a little bit of pressure off each other.  
LONGAR LONGAR: Same thing he just said. Just playing along each other, it
makes both our games easier. The double teams, you got two bigs that can pass
out, work with our guards outside whenever we get doubled, we kick it outside
or we pass it to each other down low. Rebounding, just trying to attract
attention, and obviously, if he gets the ball, he gets doubled or if I get the
ball, I get doubled and it frees him up or it frees me up.  
  
Q. Blake starting with you, can you guys give an evaluation thought on
Louisville Cardinals as an opponent?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: They're definitely a tough team, they get after you and play
great defense. They have some big bodies and they also have some talented
guards. So, we're going to have our hands full. But I think if we just do a
good job of staying together and playing as a team and controlling the tempo a
little bit and handling their pressure I think we should be all right.  
LONGAR LONGAR: We just got to handle their pressure. They press the whole
game, they're real big inside, they have some really good post players, and
even their bench, they're deep, they have six guys and they can go real deep
in their bench. So we're going to have to concentrate on staying out of foul
trouble, play our defensive principles and just contain them.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Like they both said, they're a really good team, they bring a
lot of defensive pressure and they're not afraid to push it on offense at any
given moment. So, we got to come out and be aggressive and try to get them to
play at our tempo. They like to play fast and we want to pound them inside so
we're going to just try to execute our game plan as best as possible.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, you talked about handling a double team, do you guys
feel like you've gotten better at that as the season has gone along? Because,
yesterday, I think, Blake you hit Dave on a cut off a double team. Do you
think you've got more comfortable passing out of double teams?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I definitely do. We both, I think, have come a long ways since
the beginning of the year. I know I have. Just because I really wasn't used to
handling a lot bigger guys coming at me at the same time. And our guards have
done a good job of getting into open spaces and making it easy to find people
and Longar's also done a good job of making himself a presence in the back
side for me to be able to find him easily.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, can you comment specifically on David Padgett what
you've seen from him on film and what kind of problems he presents; their
offense kind of runs through him.  
LONGAR LONGAR: I watched him play. He's a really good player. Really big, he
can pass, he can really pass the ball. I think he's the guy that makes them
go, he runs their offense real well, their guards are real athletic, so
they're always cutting in and going to the glass, too. So, we just got to do a
good job on him, he can score down low, rebound, and he runs the floor. We are
just going to have to do a good job of containing him.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, the way that the Big-12 Conference has performed, I
know the Big East is doing well, too, but getting out of conference, getting
out of where everybody knows what you do, have you been able to draw a little
bit of confidence from seeing the other teams have success and from the
success you had last night?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yes, it's always good when we're not facing another Big-12
team, to see them competing and do well. It kind of shows the Big-12
conference is one of those power conferences and right now they're having a
good showing and just us as the Oklahoma basketball team, we want to just kind
of prove that we're a good team, too. We're from the Big-12 and we want
everybody to kind of look at us as we're a good team in the Big-12 and to try
to get some exposure for us, too.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I've been pleased with how well everybody in our conference has
done. Obviously K State beating a higher seed and I think it just kind of
shows how like David said, how tough our conference is. But at the same time
we're also trying to prove a point like he said that we feel like we belong
here and we feel like we can compete here.  
  
Q. Longar and Blake, it would appear and I think even Doctor Schnebel said
you guys are as healthy as you have been all season and do you agree; and
Longar how much of a difference does that make in your game; and Blake talk
about your health status too?  
LONGAR LONGAR: A big difference. Three weeks ago if you asked me I was still
going through it, but right now I'm getting healthier. Just the healing
process has been great. Just doing treatment, making sure that I'm just taking
care of my body, it requires a lot of just focusing on just getting treatment,
basically just to get better; and my trainer has been doing a great job just
doing that; and I'm getting healthier every day.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Definitely, I say the same thing. Just kind of day by day we're
starting to get healthier and healthier. And that definitely helps out being
able to take a beating down low and then being able to come back the next day
and practice hard or play hard again. So, I definitely think that we're
starting to get closer to a hundred percent. The closer we get to that, the
better off we'll be.  
  
Q. Kind of to follow-up on that, when we heard about those injuries they
sounded very serious, yet you guys came back so fast. How were you able to do
that? Do you have some sort of magic healing potion over there?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I don't know about the potion, but we have a good training
staff, A.B. and -- Alex Brown, our trainer and Doctor Schnebel, our team
doctor both do a really good job of getting us whatever we need and making
sure we're getting treatment and concentrating on getting us back as fast as
possible, but at the same time, making sure we're safe to play.  
So, you kind of have to give credit to them for staying on us so much and for
getting us in the right place at the right time.  
LONGAR LONGAR: They do a great job. As soon as I got hurt they were just
getting me in, three treatments a day, making sure that I'm taking the right
supplements, just to keep my body right. I drank a lot of fluids, making sure
that everything is good. But the most important thing, like I said, is just
being able to get to rehab, more than once, you know, three times a day. And
Alex Brown, he's done a great job with both of us.  
  
Q. David, this is for you, yesterday Phil Martelli admitted that he had to
defend OU to beat them. He would have to concentrate on Blake and the inside
game and maybe another shooter, leaving you pretty much open and you countered
with 25 points. If you were Rick Pitino, looking at that, how would you defend
Oklahoma and do you think you have added to Louisville's defensive woes, so to
speak?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just looking at our team, I know the strength of our team is
always been the big guys inside. So, just as another head coach, I would say
you're still going to have to stop the big guys inside. They're obviously
going to be a presence. Hopefully, they'll still demand a double. And if that
does happen and I do get left open again or any guard, hopefully the guards
are just ready to step up and make shots. I just got lucky the other day just
being wide open and the post men did a great job passing it out. But maybe
we'll see something different where they're playing one on one where they have
a big man.  
  
Q. You would invite that again though, wouldn't you?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, I would invite it, but I know it's not going to happen
again, so I'm not worried about it.  
  
Q. All three, can you explain how, at times, this team was really, really
good and at times it's really, really bad?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just a lack of focus coming out from the jump is when we're
really bad. Not playing as a team, not being mentally and physically tough.
That kind of makes us not play bad but as you can see, in our previous game,
everybody came out aggressive, a lot of energy, everybody stayed together and
no matter how many runs St. Joseph's put together, we stayed together and
nobody went off to the side and thought about themselves.  
So if we just play as a team, and play with a lot of energy, we'll have a good
run, hopefully.  
LONGAR LONGAR: I believe it's just whenever we start getting away from our
game plan and start to do stuff that we're not capable of doing, just trying
to take guys one on one and not play together as a team -- that's when we
really do not perform. We are more effective when we play as a team. And if we
do that, we're tough to beat.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's definitely like David said, a lack of focus. We
come out and we're all focused on one task, and playing together as a team,
and defending, getting down and really defending hard and not giving up
basically any easy baskets, I think we're a lot better team and that obviously
shows at times in games when we make big runs. It all starts with our defense,
too. So, I think that's something that we definitely need to concentrate on
and that's what makes us a better team.  
  
Q. David, you guys, as a six seed wise, you were a favorite in the last game
and now you're an underdog in this one. Your thoughts about playing the
underdog role, is there an advantage in this tournament we see what happened
in Tampa suddenly underdogs are winning everywhere, is that something which
gives you confidence and the whole seeding issue at this point, your thoughts
on that.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Well, just looking at the last game, from what we seen and what
we heard, we were the underdogs in that game also. So we used that as a
motivation and now we're the 6 going against a 3 and once again we're the
underdog again, so we're going to try to use that to our advantage. But we
know that they're a great team, they're not going to over look anybody, no
matter if they were the six or if we were the three, they're going to come in
aggressive and I know their coach is going to have them ready to play so we
just have to be the same way and we just have to want it more.  
  
Q. Blake, can you just talk a little bit about the success you Beasley,
Love, other freshmen have had to, are you guys as amazed by it as us older
people are or is it just the way you are playing?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think that coming in, I knew that guys like Michael Beasley
and Kevin Love and O.J. and Derrick, I've been around them and I watched them
play, I played against them, I played with them, so I kind of knew what they
could do and I figured they would do pretty well, but I really didn't know how
well overall our freshmen class would do. And it has surprised me a little bit
with how many guys have stepped up and played big roles on their teams and
done so well and had so much success this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll have coach up here to make an
opening statement and then take questions.  
COACH CAPEL: We're excited to still be playing. We get to move on, play
against a very talented Louisville team who was tremendous last night in every
facet of the game, offensively, defensively, making threes, we're excited
about the challenge. Once again, we'll just like we were yesterday, no one
will expect us to win, won't predict us to win, but we'll show up and we'll
play and we'll see what happens. So we're excited to be here, excited to be
one of 32 left, and we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Start right here with questions.  
  
Q. Talk about specifically challenges of stopping this Louisville Cardinal
team. What impresses you most about them?  
COACH CAPEL: They made shots from the 3-point line at a high rate yesterday.
That's something that they haven't done all year long consistently. They are
very capable shooters, but that's something that especially as they headed
into the Big East tournament that they struggled with a little bit. If they're
making shots like that then that makes them even tougher to beat from beyond
the arc, one of the things they do, they do such a good job of harassing you
and pressuring you and creating scoring opportunities from their defense.
We're really going to have to value the basketball, be strong, make good
passes, and we want to look to attack their pressure, we'll attack it in a
smart manner. And we can't take bad shots. We have to understand the tempo of
the game and understand what's going on in the game to figure out what kind of
shots we get, if and when we break their pressure.  
  
Q. Can you talk Louisville's bench play. The last few games they have been
bringing Earl Clark off the bench it seems like, just talk about their bench,
I think they go like nine deep?  
COACH CAPEL: Well it happens when you have pros to come off the bench. Earl
Clark is a pro. Sosa is a kid that started for them a lot. They're extremely
talented all across the board. And they have a good number of big bodies, big
athletic bodies they can throw at you and with the style in which they play,
constant pressure, mixing up their presses, I think that it's probably good
for their team to play as many guys.  
But they're good, they're good all across the board, starters, I think that
some of those guys got some really valuable time with Padgett being out early
and some of those other guys, I think Palacios was out early, so some of those
guys got some valuable minutes, which has helped them.  
  
Q. Do we over simplify things when we say if your guards play well and your
team plays well?  
COACH CAPEL: No. It's usually that's the way it's been for us. When we get
good guard play, we usually play well.  
Yesterday was a really good example of that. I thought our guards played
really well, we were able to make shots which towards the end of the game that
opened up where I think because of the threes that David had made, where they
stopped doubling off of him, they allowed us to get one and one in the post.
And we feel like when we have that, with Blake and Longar, we like those guys
chances to score.  
  
Q. I wonder if your youth is an advantage in any way being a coach and
interacting with the kids?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't know. You have to ask them. I don't know what they will
say. But I am who I am. That's one of the things I learned very quickly when I
was named head coach at VCU at 27. And probably one of the best pieces of
advice I got, it came from my dad, and probably a day later in a conversation
with my college coach, and it was don't try to be anyone else but you. And
that's what I try to do. I'm 33, I like a lot of the same things our guys
like, my players like.  
Does it help? I don't know. I don't think it hurts. Because I do think there
is a line. There's a line where we draw, where I draw with them where they
have to understand that I am their coach. But I do want to be a friend to
them, I do want to be someone that they feel confident and comfortable coming
and talking to me, talking to me about anything, whether it's coming to my
office, I don't have an office hours, they don't have to set appointments,
they can just come in and see me. And we sit down and we talk about whatever,
really. Whatever's going on in their life. And if it's something about
basketball or they just want to talk about anything, so, sure, I think it
helps.  
  
Q. You only had nine turnovers yesterday as a team, and how much better have
Blake, Longar, because they have been doubled a lot this year, have gotten
getting rid of the ball out of doubles and not turning it over to your
shooters?  
COACH CAPEL: I think they have done a very good job, like you mentioned with
how much they have been doubled all year long. Especially Blake. I think
that's helped him get better. He's gained experience really probably from the
first game, especially since we went to New York, and we played Memphis and
Webb, from then on I think Blake's been doubled just about every game we have
played. And in some form. Whether it's post to post, coming from a guard or
whatever. So I think that's helped. But I think that we have done a pretty
good job in and knock on wood, I hope I don't jinx this, but I think we have
done pretty good job of valuing the ball all year long. Hopefully that
continues tomorrow.  
  
Q. Some of us got a chance to drop over to the Civil Rights Institute in
Birmingham this morning and could you address briefly what the Civil Rights
Era might have meant to your discipline of college basketball?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it means a lot. There's a program that ESPN has been
showing, Black Magic, that's phenomenal. I get emotional as I was watching it.
And you just see the things that people had to go through, people of color had
to go through. It's a shame that people had to go through that, but people
look at athletes as heroes. I look at those people as the real heroes. I look
at people like my grandfather, who organized citizens in North Carolina and
did different things like that, just so people could have basic freedom. I
think now people take that for granted. I know some young people probably take
that for granted and don't really understand, because they never had to go
through anything like those people had to go through.  
I didn't have to go through it as much. Because some of the things that my
grandparents and great grandparents and people went through and my parents
even so to speak went through.  
So it means a lot. It means a lot. And like I said, those are the real heroes.
And when I look at the opportunity that I have to be ahead coach, I know when
I was named the head coach at VCU there was a lot made about that, being 27, I
had quote unquote I had not paid my dues. That's what I heard. And I would
constantly say, you know, Ben Joe paid my dues, Coach McGlendon, Big House
Gaines, those guys, because of what they had to go through and endure to allow
myself or Tubby Smith or Paul Hewitt, guys like us to have an opportunity to
be head coaches at major programs. And you look at Coach Chaney, Coach John
Thompson. Those guys like that -- Nolan Richardson, those guys that paved the
way and had success and allowed opportunities for guys like myself to be on
this stage.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the journey this year for your team, it looks like
just looking on paper; it's been a kind of an up-and-down situation with
injuries and other things?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it has been, but our guys have continued to fight and
persevere, I've really enjoyed coaching this basketball team. I think we have
grown so much since the beginning of the year, last year was difficult for all
of us. But last year's team was really like coaching a team full of freshmen
because we really didn't have any experience with a new coach coming in, these
guys are learning so many different things. Our returning guys, I think, got
better over the summer, and I think experience last year helped them out but
then I think we got an influx of energy from our new guys.  
Obviously, we have a special talent, I think, in Blake, but then Cade Davis;
just the energy that he brings, Tony, Omar Leary, one of the things I think
that had helped us with earlier in the year was we were able to have really
good competitive practices as we started going through injuries, I think that
maybe that had something to do with our play being inconsistent because we
were very inconsistent in what we could do in practice. Some days we would
have eight guys, some days we would have ten. Some days we had a manager
practicing with us trying to do some five on five stuff.  
As we have gotten here, especially this week, in preparing for this
tournament, we have been pretty healthy, probably been as healthy as we have
been and so we were able to have good practices, which I think led to us
playing well yesterday. Hopefully that leaves us playing well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about David Padgett and how their offense kind of runs
through him and how you planned on defending him?  
COACH CAPEL: Well he's a really skilled player. I think he's probably a
really, I think he's a very under rated passer. And his feel for the game
allows Coach Pitino and their staff and their team to run stuff through him.
And it's not just on the block. They pull him away from the basket and dribble
hand off or have him screen. He does such a great job of knowing when to cut,
when to slip screens, knowing when to hit guys for back door passes, he just
has a great feel for the game of basketball. And that's something that's
really rare in today's game. Not many kids now have feel any more. And he's
able to do that. We have to do a good job on him. But you saw Louisville last
night, they're a really good team, even if he's not able, he picked up two
quick fouls and their offense still kept running. They have so many talented
guys, you can just go on and on about the talent that they have amassed on
their roster. Those guys play really hard. I think that they're selfless, and
they're good, they're really good.  
  
Q. On the flip side of that question that you got there, can you see how
some might think it's a big challenge for you going against a 55-year-old
coach who has taken three colleges to the Final Four?  
COACH CAPEL: No, I coached against Coach Knight.  
(Laughter.)  
I mean, if it were just like me and Coach Pitino one-on-one, I'd love my
chances there.  
(Laughter.)  
If we were on the court playing; but no, it's not. It's not about that. It's
Louisville against Oklahoma. I coached against some Legends. You look at Coach
Knight, you look at a guy at Virginia University, when I was at VCU, Dave
Robbins, who was probably the best coach I ever coached against, and how many
national titles he's won on the Division II level.  
So, no, I'm not intimidated, I respect the heck out of the man and respect
what he's done, every where he's been, but I'm excited about our team being
able to play Louisville.  
  
Q. You win a first round NCAA tournament game, and in your second year I'm
just curious, from your perspective, where you feel like this program is now?
It's had so much success in the past. You look at 20 years ago when these two
teams played in Birmingham and it was the number one seed then; is this
program what you thought it was coming in or have there been some pitfalls
that you have had to kind of overcome?  
COACH CAPEL: We have had to overcome a lot. But it's nothing that's been
unexpected. Any time you take over any new program, the majority would say
about 90 percent of the time you don't hear many coaches saying, "Oh, that's
easy. This is easy. This is easier than I expected."  
Usually it's some kind of challenge and obviously we faced some with some NCAA
stuff, some restrictions on recruiting, some different things like that. But
the thing that I've always told our guys is that you can't make excuses, you
have to figure out a way to make things happen. I have a poster that my wife
got me for Christmas of Jackie Robinson. And I got it framed under it, you
know, no excuses, make it happen. And it says don't complain, find a way,
that's actually what it says.  
And I was watching the story a special on Jackie Robinson when he first went
to the Brooklyn Dodgers, about how he couldn't complain. It was in his
contract that he couldn't complain. And you look at the pioneer that he was
for all black athletes. There's no reason to ever complain. You have to find a
way. That's life. You are going to go through pitfalls, highs and lows in life
and life is not going to slow down.  
You have to figure out a way and we found a way to win some basketball games
this year through all the adversity we've faced. Whether it's injuries,
whatever came our way, we found a way to get here and to be here and to be one
of 32 teams or I guess 31 left, Duke just lost, so be one of 32 teams left
playing. So we're excited about that and look forward to it.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about Blake. Can you kind of comment on how he's
so big, so athletic, the matchup problems he presents for other teams.  
COACH CAPEL: That's why teams double him. Usually, you don't double a guy that
you don't think can hurt you. And so he is a guy that can hurt you, teams have
to have a game plan for him. Usually that means doubling. We're interested to
see if Louisville will do that tomorrow.  
Like I said, in watching the tape on them, that's not something that I've seen
them do a lot. They play a lot of zone, which kind of negates that a little
bit. But in transition defense they have usually gotten back to man-to-man.
And so he is a guy, because of his strength, his size, his athleticism, he's
gotten more comfortable as the year's gone along with playing with his back to
the basket. That's something that was a challenge for him when he first got to
school when we first started playing because he's getting doubled now in
college, you can imagine how it was in Oklahoma high school basketball. He was
getting quadrupled, I guess. Even in AAU when he played. He really has -- it's
very frustrating for him, but the thing I've tried to tell him is look, man,
hopefully for the rest of your life you may not get single coverage. That
means you're pretty doggone good. And it's something you have to adapt to and
find a way. Now when you run the floor in transition they can't do you believe
you there. They can't do you believe you on the offensive rebound. So you have
to figure out different ways to have an impact and he's done that for us this
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH CAPEL: All right. Thanks.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get a started with questions for the student-athletes at
this time.  
  
Q. For any of the players. The consequences of the way the seeding went ends
up putting two 30-game winners together in the first round for the first time
in tournament history. Do you have any feeling of having the two teams being
so good to meet this early in the tournament or are you indifferent to that or
are all the players way past that by now?  
A.J. GRAVES: I think there's a bunch of other good teams playing as well in
the first and second rounds, so I don't think this is just a coincidence that
two teams have 30 wins. I think that there's a bunch of other teams that have
success that don't have 30 wins. So it's going to be a challenge tomorrow for
both teams to come out and try and get a win.  
MIKE GREEN: I'm over it. I'm over it.  
JULIAN BETKO: I think we left the feelings about the seedings in Indiana. And
all we care about now is which team is going to get to 31 wins.  
  
Q. A.J., I wonder when people call you guys a Mid Major, how do you feel
about that, and then secondly, the difference of having so many seniors on
this team has made for you guys.  
A.J. GRAVES: That's what we are is a Mid Major. That's just the label that
we're stuck with. And it's something that we don't -- I don't think we're --
we're indifferent to it, it's just something that we are. And it's something
that we have got to deal with. I think sometimes we embrace it. It's a part of
the culture that we have decided to play basketball in. And as far as having
five seniors on this team, I think that's what's led to some of our success to
playing tough games on the road. And to be able to have won our conference
scheduling and our tournament, there's a bunch of other guys on this team that
have led to our success as well. We got a good underclassmen group roster and
hopefully we can put it all together like we have and hopefully show up on
Sunday.  
  
Q. Talk about the fact that with the success Butler's had, you still feel
like bigger teams look at you as a Mid Major, do you think even when ya'll put
regular season games and people sort of maybe now respect Butler now maybe
than when y'all first got there?  
A.J. GRAVES: I think that no matter what teams are going to look at Mid Majors
as Mid Majors or look at teams as high majors or just from the conference that
they're in. But that doesn't mean that they're not going to respect you. I
mean, any team that wins 30 games or any team that makes the tournament for
that matter, I think you're going to get the respect that you need and we have
great respect for Tennessee, they're a very good team, and they're going to
come out ready to play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Guys, continuing on this same theme, you go to tournaments and play the
so called BCS conference schools and this year you beat every one of them you
played. And you get in the Horizon League you lose a game or two here or
there. What's the league play like for you guys like after you've been out
playing in the great Alaska Shoot-out or preseason NIT and then you go into
league play, what's that like?  
JULIAN BETKO: I think that Horizon League is one of the most under rated
conferences. There's a lot of teams with a lot of good athletes, great
players, and good coaches. So especially going on the road after the success
we had is very challenging and a lot of teams that we play get their biggest
crowds and players are into it. So in order to win on the road in the Horizon
League we have to be tough and play together as a team for 40 minutes. And I
think that we have been pretty successful with that this year carrying a
target from last year's success and now, yeah, we did slip up twice, but we
learned from it and it made us a better team.  
A.J. GRAVES: I think a lot of people try to draw comparisons like that and we
don't get, we're not fortunate enough to play those teams twice or three
times. We only get one shot. Whereas, when we're in our own conference we get
to play those teams two or three times and so there's a lot more familiarity
with that going along. So that's about the only thing I can draw from that.  
  
Q. Mike, Tennessee likes to apply a lot of pressure on its opponents, double
teaming and try to force turnovers, what do you remember about the way the
Vols attacked you guys last season?  
MIKE GREEN: The same way they played against all their other opponents. I
don't remember much from our game specifically, but I have seen them since
then and they like to pressure you and get after you. And they pride their
self on forcing turnovers. And we got to do a good job of handling the
basketball.  
  
Q. You played for an older coach and now a younger coach, I wonder if there
are any differences, if maybe you respond to him a little differently or a
little better because he's closer to your age, those sorts of things?  
MIKE GREEN: Not at all. I guess when you're looking at a game 9:30 to 10 p.m.
around that time you can send him a text message and he'll be up watching that
same game. So that's probably like the biggest difference, he stays up a
little later and wakes up a little earlier.  
  
Q. Chris and JaJuan were asked this in their part of their press conference,
you guys, you A.J. and Mike and Chris and JaJuan are the two highest scoring
career-wise back courts in the NCAA tournament this year. Talk about going
against them with that in mind.  
MIKE GREEN: It's pretty similar to the last game. They had two good guards
too. And we try not to get caught up in back court versus back court. As you
can see, we got other guys that can play this game and have been playing this
game all year long. But you can take nothing away from them two guy, they're
great players.  
  
Q. Other than being able to text message your coach late at night, what did
Coach Stevens do different or did he do anything different to sort of put his
mark on this team this year?  
MIKE GREEN: I guess you get your mark when you're named head coach. It is your
team from there on. And I mean we pretty much just, most of the same things we
still do, but the thing about this coaching staff is not only Coach Stevens,
you can call up any of these guys around that time and talk to them. And they
let you know when they see something going, not going so well or when it is
going well, the feedback is a lot more than it was last year. Maybe because we
got five seniors and we got our input too, but we get a lot of feedback from
these guys.  
  
Q. How much differently now that you've seen film does Tennessee look with
Dane Bradshaw there at the four last year and now with Tyler Smith at the
four?  
JULIAN BETKO: As long as I remember Bradshaw was a very tough player. He was
the heart and soul of that team and he was the one of the guys that was the
leader on that team. And Tyler Smith provides a lot of attack in the paint and
provides athleticism. So it's a different type of player, but I think that
they're both very important for their team and they both were very good
players and are good leaders.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, guys. We'll now take start with an
opening statement for Coach Stevens and then take questions.  
COACH STEVENS: I think any time that you're in the NCAA tournament and you're
back either practicing or playing on Saturday, that's a good thing. So we're
excited to have another opportunity. We're looking forward to competing
tomorrow and recognize it's a heck of a challenge in front of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stevens?  
  
Q. Talk about the experience the seniors that your team brings into the game
tomorrow against Tennessee and how might that play to your advantage?  
COACH STEVENS: When you talk about experience, I think that term and the word
that comes to mind that's very important tomorrow is poise. You have to play
with a high sense of urgency, you have to play with great toughness and you
have to combine that with poise. And I don't think that's a thing that is easy
to do and I think that's where we'll have to lean on our experience to be
successful. They really, really try to force you to be poised, if that's a
word, and our guys, you know, have done a great job so far this year, so it
will be an interesting challenge for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Everybody survived the first round and we're well into the tournament by
now, but we have never had two 30-game winners have to match up this early in
the tournament. Do you have any feeling now of the way the committee set this
up, that you would have two teams arranged in the top-10 playing in the second
round, it seems like kind of a disconnect.  
COACH STEVENS: It is what it is. And again, we're not getting in to seeding or
the number next to our name and at the end of the tournament there's going to
be one team left standing. And the other 64 will have, they will have regrets
and they won't, they will no longer have a chance. -- if you want to achieve
the ultimate goal, then you have to play teams no matter when you play them
and we're excited to get a chance to play in the tournament.  
We have said that all along and certainly no matter when you play Tennessee,
whether it's in the first round or the last round, you got an unbelievable
challenge in front of you.  
  
Q. Tyler Smith, Tennessee's power forward leads his team in assists and is a
capable scorer as well, can you talk a little about the unusual challenge he
presents for the defense?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, it's funny, he has an unbelievable challenge for
our defense, first, and foremost. But it's not an unusual thing to us from the
standpoint of we play a lot of fours that are somewhat either undersized or
very, very skilled at our level.  
So, we get a chance to play against -- I don't think we played against anybody
as good as Tyler Smith at that spot, and I think he's a heck of a player and I
think they have really benefited from him this year?  
But as far as guys running through their offense at the four and guys that
make plays at the four, that is a unique aspect of basketball at the non-BCS
level that we're fairly familiar with.  
  
Q. I wondered if you could talk about the continuity of coaches that have
come through Butler and how important do you think that is to maintain what
you have been able to do?  
COACH STEVENS: Well, I think it's been very important to maintaining. I think
that one of the things that I have tried to do is tweak as necessary, be my
own person, but by no means change what's going on.  
One of the reasons we have had success is because we have guys that have
really bought into the system as a whole, that believe in what we do on both
ends of the floor and that play for the name on the front of their jerseys and
by no means would I have been smart to change that. So that's what I tried to
do as much, bring as much continuity as possible and I think that's what Coach
Matta tried to do and he did a great job. Coach Lickliter tried to do, he did
a great job. And I'm just trying to do the best job I can today.  
  
Q. Follow-up on that, was it a relief for you then knowing Butler's
reputation to get to the tournament and do what you've been able to do here?
Did you feel pressure to continue on when you take a job like this?  
COACH STEVENS: I know this is going to for David and people that have been
around me every day, there is some external pressure, but I focused on today
and the task at hand and our players have focused on that and we have talked
about that since October 12, if we were concerned about external things, about
things we can't control, I don't think we would be in the position we are. Our
guys have done a great job of doing their job and making sure that that was
their only intent and their only focus. And I have tried to maintain that same
even keeled approach on a day-to-day basis and in that way I've been able to
enjoy the journey and not worry about what the future and what the big picture
may hold, because as I've been told before, the big picture doesn't reveal
itself until it's all said and done. So we'll let whatever happens, happen.  
  
Q. Thad Matta and Todd Lickliter are obviously good friends besides being
coaching colleagues of yours, have you been in touch with them at all during
the NCAA tournament and has that had offered you any saying advice for how to
take on the Vols since he played them this year?  
COACH STEVENS: We ever been in touch with those guys, those guys have always
been great to us and encouraging and they're both Butler grads so, you know,
certainly they're rooting for Butler and they ever been great.  
Certainly you're always looking for any advice you can get, especially when
you're playing a team that's as talented and as well coached as Tennessee. So
sure, we certainly have had -- we have certainly talked.  
  
Q. Bruce Pearl's kind of shaking up his point guard position a little bit,
I'm just wondering about the different challenges that presents when they have
different types of point guards and also what you've seen from J.P. Prince who
is kind of the newest addition to that position.  
COACH STEVENS: I think that that's a really good question, because they all
bring different strengths to the table. They all play different ways.  
And Tennessee's a great team with all of them on the floor, despite the fact
they're different players. And as far as Prince goes, obviously Prince is a
tremendous athlete a guy that brings a lot of energy, a guy that makes place
in transition, can make plays on a second chances, can make plays off the
drive. And he certainly is a guy that we have a great deal of respect for.  
  
Q. Certainly it's two different teams from last year, but what do you draw
from playing this team last year to take into preparation?  
COACH STEVENS: You're right, it's two different teams. It's a very different
basketball game. We're both six months or five months into our season right
now. Last year we were one month into our season. So that was a pretty unique
situation.  
You look at it and you try to draw what you can, but recognize that this is a
totally different game tomorrow than last November.  
  
Q. We were asking players before and they said the biggest difference with
you as a head coach is they can text message you at 10:30 at night and they
knew you would text back. But they also said they got more feedback this year
from you than maybe before, maybe because they're seniors. Talk about that
relationship with five seniors that kind of know what they're doing and that
have come through this.  
COACH STEVENS: I've always had a really good relationship with those guys,
even throughout the recruiting process. And they have been a great group to be
around and it's interesting going from assistant coach to head coach and I've
had a bunch of people ask, well have you changed the way you interact with
them, and I didn't think that was really the right approach with those guys. I
have known them, they know me, they know that I'm going to do the best I can
to put them in position to have success.  
I know that they care, I know that they're respectful, I know that they're
good people who want to do well for Butler. And so our relationship's stayed
the same. We have had a lot of fun together and that's part of the reason we
focused day-to-day, because I've really enjoyed just being around this group
and they have laid it on the line every night for 33 games and even the three
games we weren't successful they put it all out there and they have been a
special group of guys.  
  
Q. Matt Howard was such an impact guy for you, I wonder, was he a five star,
a bluer chip recruit than y'all are used to or not?  
COACH STEVENS: Matt had offers from many BCS -- had many BCS opportunities.
Whether that makes him -- I don't know. All our guys are five stars in our
eyes. They may not be five stars to other people, but the way that we look at
them and what we're trying to build as far as team and put skill sets together
and those type of things, rankings don't really come into play, but just like
every other one of our guys, Matt was an important person to us in the
recruiting process and he chose Butler for the right reasons. He wanted to get
a great education, he wanted to play basketball at a high level and he wanted
to be around great teammates.  
  
Q. Couple things, I hope nobody got injured doing cart wheels, or is that
cart wheels only after some victories?  
COACH STEVENS: No cart wheels. No cart wheels of the those are for unique
times.  
  
Q. The other question is, any special plans for anything for Easter services
for any of the guys or it's just kind of a unusual situation to be playing on
Easter?  
COACH STEVENS: It is unusual and we have actually got that worked out. So
we'll give them their options and I know my wife's working on an Easter he go
hunt for the little kids, so we'll make sure that those, the little ones who
are with us are taken care of and know that the Easter bunch knee comes to
Birmingham.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.  
COACH STEVENS: Thanks.

### [Tyler Tiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18333)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and start with an opening statement from Coach
Graham and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH GRAHAM: I thought the big key was the start of the game. We talk about
getting off to a good start and I thought they set the tone at the beginning
of the game versus us setting the tone. And from that point on we scrambled to
catch up. I thought we cut it to 18 to 15 at one point and probably the thing
that hurt us the most obviously the pressure kept us out of some of our
offense, but I thought the thing where they did the best job is they hit the
threes and we didn't.  
Them shooting the threes against the zone and I thought it extended their lead
on us and that was the thing that hasn't been the strong suit for them all
year but tonight it definitely was. And it was, it's been our strong suit and
tonight it wasn't.  
So I thought that was the key to the game this evening.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler, what was, was it an up lifting moment when you saw David Padgett
going to the bench with his second foul early on in the first half?  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: I didn't really look at it that way because they got so many
good players coming off the bench anyways. We know all their players coming
off the bench can score and defend, so it wasn't like, yes, we have a chance
now, it's we just got to go and keep playing our game and you think that's
what we tried to do.  
  
Q. If you guys can talk about just how difficult it was to get into your
offense seems like they extended you because of their pressure.  
MATT NELSON: Going to the game that was a big focus, handling their pressure.
We were working on it all week in practice and I think we did a decent job
handling the pressure or the pressure for the most part. But, yeah, it's tough
when you got big long athletic guys just flying everywhere, playing hard, and
it's tough to get into your sets, but I think we did a decent job for a lot of
the game. It's just they were just feeling it from the 3-point line tonight.
At that I think we had a good game plan tonight really. We executed it well
too. It's just we didn't expect them to shoot 50 percent from the 3-point
line.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: To go along with what Matt said, yeah, we for the most part I
think we did a good job of handling the pressure. We had a few key turnovers,
but the game plan I think the thing that hurt us the most was the 3-point shot
is and the pressure didn't bother us I don't think as much as people think it
did.  
  
Q. You two are two of the four seniors, you just played, I know it's very
fresh, finished playing your final game for Boise State. Can you talk about
going out this way, but still the effort that you continued to give throughout
the contest tonight.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: It's a tough way to go out losing, but hey, we made it this
far. It's been a wild ride and unbelievable experience and can't say enough
about the four seniors on our team and how we just battled this whole year
just to prove people wrong. And it's just been an awesome experience and I
couldn't ask for anything more for a senior year.  
MATT NELSON: He said it pretty much perfectly. These guys, the four seniors
and our whole team, it's, we have been so tight and stuck together through
thick and thin all year. It's been crazy, a crazy season. A lot of ups, a few
down, but overall we did a lot of great things this year and it's tough to go
out on a loss, but we can't look at that we have to think about the good
things and we had a lot of them this year and there's nothing better to go out
with these guys.  
I made like best friends really, these guys are like my best friends pretty
much, so there's been no better way to go out than with them.  
  
Q. Either one of you guy, how tough of a matchup is Earl Clark number five
for Louisville because he's 6'10 " and he can dribble like that?   
TYLER TIEDEMAN: He's a professional prospect. You can tell by just looking at
him. When he moves to the three spot it's a tough matchup, especially for me,
because he's so long, so big and he hit a few big threes today that we weren't
expecting for him to hit. And he gets the rim so easy, he deflects passes,
gets steals, and just moves real well for how big he is. And he's going to be
a great player.  
  
Q. If you guys could just talk about settling in, it was 10-1, then you cut
it to 18-15. At that point how confident were you against these guys?  
MATT NELSON: We're pretty confident team. We don't ever think we're going to
lose or think we can't compete with anyone. I think there was a few jitters at
the start of the game just because we were overly excited and once we settled
in we played pretty tough. I think the score didn't look that way like the
game was that close and, but I mean we battled and I think we played a good
game.  
They just had a great game. They're a tough team to beat when they're shooting
the three like they did. Because they have so many great players, they have a
great inside game, obviously, and that's what we focused on. And they just
stepped out and hit the three and nothing we could really he do about it. But
I thought we had a good game and battled hard all game and that's all you can
really ask for.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they did that kind of took the team out of the
3-point feel that you usually have, especially coming back in the second half
you've been able to hit those and pull yourself back into the game.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: They're, definitely, the pressure they put on you, they extend
your offense and really like get you out of your sets, trying to just pressure
the ball and it's tough to get our main focus is to penetrate and pitch out
and try to find a three. And it's tough to penetrate when you're getting so
much pressure and it was just shots weren't falling tonight and some nights
that happens. You got to live and die by the three.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. You guys are welcome to head back to
your locker room. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Was it any kind of focus to go after David Padgett early on in the
game?  
COACH GRAHAM: No, but we're -- the inside game is a big part of ours. Nellie's
really hard to guard in there because he's quick and strong and he has very
good post moves. And we told him to attack him when you get it. It wasn't,
we're just going to come here and go to you every time, because that's not how
we play. But when we get it we want our big guys to go to the basket like they
have done all year.  
And Nellie is a tough matchup for everybody. And I was obviously glad when he
got two fouls and was out. But I looked at the stats here and one of our keys
was if we could control the paint well. We controlled the paint pretty well
from the scoring standpoint and rebounding standpoint or neutralized the
paint. But the 3-point line just killed us tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about their 3-points, was the key was it the strategy to sit
in the zone and hope they just didn't go or could you not guard them man-to-
man what was that all about?  
COACH GRAHAM: We wanted to pack it in a little bit, take away the paint, and
the 3-point game is not their strong suit. Except tonight.  
You got to kind of pick your poison a little bit. And we were going to try to
control the paint and make them have to shoot it to beat us. And they did.  
Normally I'm hoping those 3-point stats were switched the other way around.
But they weren't. They shot the ball very well and did a good job against our
zone and Palacios stepped outside and hit a couple against the zone. When the
four man is stepping out shooting it, it makes it very hard to guard. And
they're, you know, they're a very good team. They can hurt you a lot of
different ways, with size, with speed, and when they're shooting the ball, if
they shoot the ball that well, the rest of the tournament, they will be able
to make a deep run into this thing.  
  
Q. You just had four seniors walk off that floor for the final time in blue
and orange. Can you talk about the way they finished up?  
COACH GRAHAM: One of the things we said in the locker room was to make sure
that they take a look at the picture of what they accomplished. Winningest
team in the history of the school, most school wins, first team to ever win
WAC titles, won two of them, their all league accomplishments. And that
because you get so, I don't want to say hung up, but the game is right now in
the present and that's what they think about. But those four guys did way more
than anybody ever expected them to do or dream of them to do. Matt Bauscher,
nobody ever expected a young man from Idaho and from Boise ever to play and do
all the things he's done. Tyler was trying to say this, they probably created
their best friends for the rest of their lives. And that part's probably just
as important as a good thing too.  
So they will be four, I guess I should say eight big shoes to fill and I know
they're going to miss it, and I know I'm definitely going to miss them and but
we'll just have to manage.  
  
Q. How do you account for somebody like Earl Clark, a 6'10 " guy who can
move like he can?   
COACH GRAHAM: Usually we handle him by the draft, that and let him get picked
up and get out of here. He's a good player. He's even better in person than he
is on tape. I didn't think he was quite that good a player. But he, because a
lot of scouts have talked about him and so forth, and he just creates so many
problems. I don't think there's one thing he does super outstanding, he just
does everything pretty good. And that's more dangerous. He can handle it at
that size and get to the basket, he can rebound, he gets his hands on a lot of
balls, he's just a very talented young man that's got an awfully bright
future.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH GRAHAM: Thank you.

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Ahmad Nivins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18326)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
Coach Martelli and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, we offer our congratulations to Oklahoma, wish them well
going forward. And the beauty of the tournament is the young guy getting 25
points, comes in averaging eight, those things kind of happen.  
Technically, it got away from us in the last 8:07 of the first half. We had 13
possessions, six turnovers, one for five from the field and one for four from
the foul line and then you're working your way back uphill.  
We kind of felt sorry for ourselves at half time. I didn't think we came out
with the proper frame of mind in the second half and they made us pay. And
then we spent the rest of the game trying to get a game feel to it. Put a
little game pressure on them.  
Unfortunately, for all the excitement that goes into being in the tournament,
this is the reality. 32 teams go home and we're one of those teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. For either of you guys, of all the Oklahoma guys to kind of go off did
you expect it would be David Godbold?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well, the way we prepared, we prepared for like to guard
everybody. And it was unexpected, but we were also prepared for it. And it
just kind of got out of hand.  
  
Q. For both of you, can you talk about the difference of running into a
front line like Oklahoma has where you don't really run into something like
that in the Atlantic 10, with that size and strength down on the blocks and
they seemed to really kind of take advantage of having that size like you guys
talked about leading up to today.  
AHMAD NIVINS: Oklahoma has a really talented front court. And the fact that
they have been, they have seen every kind of double team and every kind of
trap in the post helped them a lot in this game. But we just wanted to attack
them and try to keep them off balance. But they it seemed as if they were more
relaxed and we just had to fight uphill for the rest of the game and we didn't
come home with a win.  
ROB FERGUSON: Well, we played against many different types of front courts,
but that was obviously the biggest and the strongest that we played against.
And it was a challenge. I think for the most part that we stepped up to it.
But like Ahmad said, we, at the end, we lost the game.  
  
Q. Rob, can you talk about your offensive performance tonight, you came out
hot right from the start and led through the day. Were you just feeling good
or what was that a product of?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well that was just the fact that I just didn't want to go home
today. The way we practiced the past couple of days, I felt like that we
couldn't lose and like my confidence was high and I just felt like my whole
team had my back. And that's it.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, what happened, what were they doing at the end of
the first half to kind of clamp down on you guys defensively?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well I don't feel like it was they were clamping down on us,
towards the end we kind of gave the game away. Like we had unforced turnovers,
dropping passes, throwing the ball away, and like that was kind of -- that was
for the most part that was on us.  
AHMAD NIVINS: I think we kind of dug a hole for ourselves offensively. And
just plays that we normally can execute, we didn't execute. I think that was a
huge momentum swing. Especially at the end of the half. And I think that's why
it got as ugly as it did.  
  
Q. Guys, at points in the second half did they start to seem like the hole
was too deep, the 19 point deficit in the second half, I mean storming back
you got to within four, but did it just get too large there in the second
half?  
ROB FERGUSON: I don't think so, because we have been in holes before and we
fought our way back into it and we won games like that. And we also lost
games. But we never once felt like we were out of it. We just kept fighting
and fighting, because that's what we do.  
  
Q. For both guys, there's a stretch there, especially Ahmad, you had a, you
were doing pretty well on defense without drawing fouls, you got unlucky in a
couple of minutes and had a couple guys foul out at the end. What impact did
that have on your continuity just trying to make this comeback?  
AHMAD NIVINS: Well you're going to have troubles like that. Especially in a
tournament like this. You are going to, you're not going to get some calls,
things aren't going to go your way, shots aren't going to fall. But it's just
a matter of staying together and keeping fighting. And we had it, but we let
it out of our grasp and now we're on the losing end.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you guys, you can head back to your locker room, if
you would like. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. In that last eight minutes of the first half, how much of it was their
defense or do you feel your team may have lost its poise for awhile?  
COACH MARTELLI: I think we played faster than would normally be a positive
situation for us. I just think we started to go just a tad faster. And we're
not a team that should play fast, we should play quick.  
I think there was a little bit of a cushion that we gave them a mental
cushion, in that we had it and were comfortable the way the game was being
played and then when they really turned it up a notch, I don't think that we
turned up our thought process as high as it should have been.  
  
Q. Kind of like I asked the players, of all the guys on the on your scouting
or whatever, where is Godbold on the list and how surprised were you when he
kind of went off like that?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well the guy that we had as the wild card to be honest with
you was Crocker. If you study their numbers, and their wins, their third
scorer has always been Crocker. We studied it enough to know that it was
Crocker, we actually started the game with our post double team being off of
Godbold. We didn't know that Godbold would start until 20 minutes before the
game.  
I wouldn't change it. I would not change it. And in the second half, when he
got going a little bit, I think that to be honest with you, again, we were
feeling sorry for ourselves at the offensive end of the floor, and not really
executing defensively.  
We obviously changed our post defense trap after he made a couple of shots,
even in the first half. But he's not, I'm not saying that he's sixth, but he
might have been fourth, but certainly Crocker was the guy that we had labeled
as the wild card.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you thought they felt sorry for themself at half time
in the locker room?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, no, no. I think that going into half time there was a
point where you feel sorry for yourself because the ball's not going in. Now
we're in there down 12 and the response offensively was okay, but we gave up
15 points in the first five minutes. And got ourselves down 19. And it was the
same thing. It was just that little bit of woe is me because my ball's not
going in, and not really covering everybody defensively, conference each other
defensively the way that we have to to be successful.  
  
Q. Do you think Pat struggled because of Godbold's physical play?  
COACH MARTELLI: Sure. If you look at and I go back to our St. Louis game and I
said to our team, the blueprint was out there now. That, bump us off, take us
out of comfortable rotations of the ball, and you could get us to freeze and
hold the ball. And I certainly thought that that happened. And I think that
with Pat offensively it is a confidence even with all the success that he had,
he was 1-7 on twos. And he's the biggest wing in the game. So it's unfortunate
that he had a wonderful, wonderful year, he just didn't have a great game
today.  
  
Q. Godbold was in here talking about, as a senior he didn't want to go home.
Rob said almost word for word the same thing. He also had a great game
offensively, talk about what Rob has meant to the program and what he's done
this year.  
COACH MARTELLI: Rob Ferguson is a very interesting guy. Because he has those
kind of gifts. And he's somewhat reluctant to put those gifts out there. I
think sometimes when you play this game and you strive to play it at a high
level you have to be willing to fail. And Rob Ferguson for three years
probably wasn't willing to fail. He wanted to be safe. And he didn't want to
let anybody down.  
This year he was asked to come outside of himself to play a different role
defensively, which he did. And by the way, I thought Ahmad and Rob Ferguson
did a fine job on Longar and Blake. They had 26 points, but that's not the
problem. But Rob Ferguson was asked to be more vocal, when he's not vocal. And
it sounds odd, but you kind of fill up with pride when you see him with tears
in his eyes, because it meant that much to him. And you hope that that message
is passed on to the younger players.  
Because it's really hard. You're taking off that uniform for the last time,
but I do think that his performance tonight. And all year long, Rob Ferguson
emptied himself, he came outside of himself, and then he emptied himself and
that's all you can ask a young guy to do, really.  
  
Q. Would you say this was one of your more unpredictable teams?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, I don't think so. I know, like I know what my team is and
I've known all year what my team was. So I didn't really find it to be
unpredictable. The one thing they did is they came every day, no matter what
happened the game before, they always came every day. They wanted to be
coached.  
So I didn't see it as being unpredictable, I think that for a team that had
success we were 15-5 at one point, we had some great wins. There was a self
confidence issue all year long. And I think that by staying calm with them as
much as I could, I didn't want to add, I never added to that uncertainty that
they had.  
But certainly you could see it on their faces and their body language the
second half against Temple, tonight in that run from the end of the first half
to the beginning of the second half. And it was a confidence and a self
confidence, because it was not like the coaches were down or it was a harsh
atmosphere, it was just plain and simple not confident enough about the next
play and always wondering and probably in a lot of ways worrying.  
  
Q. To kind of build on that, you said many times during the year that the
team just wasn't quite getting that level of play that you thought they were
capable of. Is that now going to be something that is going to kind of bother
you that they didn't hit that level and then sustain it and kind of fell
short?  
COACH MARTELLI: More the sustain than anything else. Look, plain and simple,
that team, my team, had a great year. We got one of six non-BCS bids, we were
in, we were out, we were in, we were out. They had to deal with all that
energy, that whether I talked about it or didn't, they were on the Internet,
you know, that was a great year. That was a great year. To be one of the 65
teams selected for this tournament, really is a terrific year.  
What I will study is why was it not sustained. Was it lack of depth, was it
lack of foot speed. You know, do you need to get better guard play, do you
need to be stronger, do you need to play more zone. So all of those kind of
things enter into it. But more sustained than any sleep less nights over why
was it, why did we fluctuate.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH MARTELLI: Thank you very much.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by Coach Pearl and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH PEARL: Just congratulations to American University. They represented
themselves and the patriot league extremely well.  
They made shots, particularly Carr was just spectacular. They played with
great energy. Particularly on the offensive boards where we knew they really
run to the boards and they bothered us early. With their offensive rebounding.  
But, I thought we were able to turn them over. And I think our press was
particularly effective and without pressure defense, we would have been in
perhaps more of a similar situation to what Duke was in last night. Going up
against a great team, very well-coached, very-well spaced, but it was nine
assists and 22 turnovers, I think, I think that was probably a big difference,
as well as these three guys sitting to my left.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. JaJuan, why did the offense appear to be so out of sync most of the
game?  
JAJUAN SMITH: There was a great defensive team out there. We just weren't
playing our ball, we were a little sloppy with you but we turned it on in the
second half and made plays.  
  
Q. Tyler and Wayne, guys, talk about that sequence there at the end. I
thought it was a big one when Tyler came up with the block and then down at
the other end Wayne the 3-point to put you guys back up about 10. Maybe both
of you could talk about that.  
TYLER SMITH: We were trying to make a play and force our team. Our last outing
we got kind of frustrated because of the bigs and as far as rebounding, but we
were trying to come in and show that we were trying to make a defensive effort
and Wayne came down and made a big shot for us.  
WAYNE CHISM: Well, we wanted to run anyway, but Tyler came in with a good
block so you transitioned off, and it was pretty good, so once Tyler cut to
the basket, they left a trail wide open and I let one go and it went in.  
  
Q. Defense, guys, has not been real good the last few games, much better
today. Is that something that you really concentrated on?  
TYLER SMITH: Of course. They had two great players that we were trying to slow
down as far as Carr and Mercer. And we put one of our best defenders and Carr
and had JaJuan on the other guard.  
  
Q. For Wayne, can you just talk about hitting those threes and just the
difference in your confidence now versus maybe a year ago playing in the
tournament as a freshman?  
WAYNE CHISM: When I came in as a freshman I think I played pretty good as a
freshman. When I entered the tournament -- I mean I did good things in the
tournament as a freshman. But coming into this tournament I had two fouls in
the first half and two points. So I had to come out in the second half and
play better. And coach came out with a quick play for me and I hit that one
and then it came down to another one and I kept going on and Tyler went for a
lay up and missed, so I picked my team up on offense big time because I
changed on defense in the first half.  
  
Q. I'm sure you all were well prepared by your coach for this team, but did
you really believe how good they could be and did you have to make up a little
bit during the game early in the game?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Coach prepared us for a close game. He's been telling us all
week long how close this game was going to be. We were well prepared, been
getting up early in the morning for this early game. So we were real focused
for this.  
TYLER SMITH: Having a player like Carr, as far as you got -- another Chris out
there so we had to watch him shoot and he could get a shot any time and one
player can beat you if he gets that shot. But they were a great team and they
came out with a lot of effort. But coach had us as far as defense, ready to
play them.  
THE MODERATOR: No further questions for the student-athletes we'll let you
guys get back to the locker room and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Could you, as the second-half progressed, could you see American's
confidence building? Could you see them believing more as the game wore on?  
COACH PEARL: I thought they came in confident. I thought they came in knowing
that they could play with us.  
I actually felt like our confidence was building as the second half -- as the
second half wore on.  
I thought American came here to win the game and knew that they, if they
played well, I think watching Belmont last night had to be encouraging for
them. We were in a 2-15 game against Winthrop and Chris Lofton had to make a
shot to win. This is the NCAA tournament. And no matter how we try and prepare
you guys to understand that this is what it is, you get -- you just think that
we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way.
And we shot 49 percent from two, we were the more patient team with only 45
shots. As opposed to American's 58 shots. Now part of that was they did a good
job on the offensive boards but we made 1 percent of our free throws, those
are really good offensive statistics that good teams have to do.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Brian and Ramar sitting out the first half and also
rebounding and their advantage on the boards.  
COACH PEARL: We're trying to get better point guard play and so J.P. Prince
played a lot of point guard tonight.  
When Jordan Howell, I thought, struggled some in the first half I just I went
with Ramar. And then Brian had no points and five fouls in his last game. And
just wasn't pleased with his performance, against Arkansas, and so went with
Ryan Childress in the first half. And then at half time some of it worked and
some of it didn't.  
  
Q. It looked like you guarded your team guarded a lot harder in the last 15
minutes than they did the first 25 minutes. That's what it looked like?  
COACH PEARL: Yeah. Well, American shot 31 percent in the first half, they lead
their league in field goal percentage at about 44. And they only made two
3-points in the first half, both by Carr.  
I think maybe in the last ten minutes or so American got a little tired. They
may have fatigued. And so I don't know that we played any more effectively
lately, but they had just, you know, being pressed and guarding the way we
guard, we didn't sit back, there wasn't any zone, Carr plays 40 minutes and
Mercer plays 39. I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we
played a lot more guys than they did.  
  
Q. They out rebounded you by 39-27. They get 18 offensive rebounds, a lot of
the balls were bouncing their way, but how disturbing is that?  
COACH PEARL: They had great energy on the offensive boards. And they do that
all year long. They have got a pretty good idea -- couple things: They got a
pretty good idea when Carr's going to shoot the ball. And because you have to
have your bigs out there hedging him and doubling him some, when shots are
taking place your inside guys aren't inside their guys.  
So, it's really not a checkout situation, it's a race to the boards. In the
next game, watch Butler. And watch Butler's ball screen, and spread out. And
watch Butler's guys run to the boards and there's no one there to check them
out. Because you're out there doubling Garrison, doubling Mercer, doubling
Graves or Green, and that's what can happen with spread and good ball screen
offense. And that's why they're a very, very effective offensive rebounding
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH PEARL: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from the coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH JONES: Well, we're disappointed with the outcome, but I certainly
couldn't be any more proud of the team, of a group of young men than I am of
our guys.  
As they have all year long, they battled. It wasn't pretty, but we scraped and
I think we pushed Tennessee pretty hard, therefore, the most part of the game.
Tennessee proved why they're such an outstanding team, that was over on the
side there and I heard a couple of Bruce's comments, and I think he's right, I
think ultimately they wore us down. And so certainly they're a great
basketball team, it was a great challenge for our team. I thought our guys
stepped up to the challenge, but unfortunately, we weren't quite up to it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Garrison, take us down about six minutes left and you make another
comeback, you're down by one. You're a 15 seed, you're going against a number
two seed. What's the feeling, what's the mood, what's it like for you guys at
that point?  
GARRISON CARR: Well, at that moment, when we were making our run, I really
felt like the crowd was behind us, because when we made a basket, to cut the
lead, it really exploded in the gym.  
At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big
play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a three down, I think it
was, and took the lead. And while we were making our run, just played like the
number two seed and like a number one team in the nation and they made their
runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead.  
  
Q. Coach Jones and any players that would like to address this, defending
Chris Lofton today, what was your game plan and how did it execute as the game
played out?  
GARRISON CARR: Well, we were obviously no help off Chris Lofton, because he's
an excellent player and he deserves all the accolades that he gets. And all
week we were simply continuing to use no help off him, we went through all the
play that they have for him to get his shots. And basically, all we were just
practicing getting through screens, anticipating when the screens would come
and my teammates did a great job of helping me when he was off, when he came
open on screens and hedging out, but for the most part it wasn't just an
individual effort, it was a team effort to stop him.  
DERRICK MERCER: Just like Garrison said, we tried to focus more on Lofton and
we were using no help, if he set a back screen we were telling our bigs to get
through the back screen and stay with him and because we know he's dangerous
and he also can take it to the basket. So we put our attention on Lofton and
we worked hard, we did breakdown drills, dribble handoffs, coming off screens
and just trying to defend the best we can.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard Coach Jones just now talking about last night's
game Duke and Belmont. Did you watch the game and did you take anything out of
it? Obviously, you're here to win anyway, though.  
BRIAN GILMORE: Sure, we watched it. We watched, got to see a little bit of the
end of it when we got back from dinner last night. And that just reinforced
our belief that a 15 seed beating a 2 seed is definitely possible. Coach
mentioned it going into our meeting last night, just reinforced the fact that
he believed in us as a team to come out here and play against Tennessee today
and if we did the things that we knew we were capable of doing and controlled
what we could control, that we would give ourselves an opportunity to be right
there with them just as Belmont was.  
GARRISON CARR: We watched the game and basically just reinforced what can
happen when the ball's thrown in the air. Because the seedings are just
numbers next to a name. But when the ball is thrown in the air, those go away
and you still have to play and Belmont put it all on the line, which they were
supposed to do, but Duke was able to pull away with the win. And it was just
another example of many in the past of 15s playing 2s tough.  
  
Q. Did you guys did you lose your legs there in the last five minutes? Was
it a pretty grueling way to go?  
GARRISON CARR: Towards the end of the game I did get a little bit tired. But
when it's crunch time and adrenaline kicks in you forget about that, and
you're just out there playing basketball. Because the atmosphere out there and
how close the game was, I didn't have time to think about being tired and I
was just out there playing.  
  
Q. Did you guys get the sense that you were close to breaking Tennessee's
sort of if you would have gotten through frequently getting the ball back that
they would have panicked. Did you ever feel like you ever got sort of close to
that breaking point with them?  
BRIAN GILMORE: I think we did. We knew that even if we did get up, get a lead
that they were leading in the second half that Tennessee was a great team and
they would be able to sustain any efforts that we made to attempt to continue
to get a lead. But we had our opportunities, we missed a couple layups, missed
some open shots and Tennessee's a great team and they capitalized on the other
end and hit a few threes in transition and broke us down off the dribble a
couple times. But we had our chances and we just didn't capitalize on them.  
  
Q. Garrison, did Tennessee defend you the way most people do? Anything
different or unique that you saw today? Or was it just pretty much the same
way most teams defend you?  
GARRISON CARR: For the most part I would say it was just basically like
everybody else. My teammates and coach did a great job of giving me
opportunities to get open and shoot the ball. So it really wasn't Tennessee
doing anything different, it was the team helping me get shots and the coaches
drawing up great plays and that basically opened everything up for myself and
the team.  
  
Q. Garrison, you talk about making them play the whole 35 seconds of the
clock, you guys made them play defense, and stay with you and then you would
break them down a little bit.  
GARRISON CARR: That's just basically how American plays basketball. If we have
a good shot early in the shot clock we're obviously going to take it, but for
the most part we're going to come down and run the offense we practice every
day and get the best shot we can possible get. And whether that comes with 10
seconds on the shot clock or 35, we're going to seize the opportunity when
it's there.  
  
Q. Brian, can you talk a little bit about the offensive boards. You guys
really controlled the offensive boards a lot and coach definitely mentioned
you guys really were just going at it in the first half and they really
couldn't do anything about it. Could you talk about that?  
BRIAN GILMORE: Sure. I think coach mentioned before that we know when Garrison
is going to get open shots. And especially knowing our offense we know with
when Garrison is going to it get a shot off, so it creates an opportunity for
us to get to the offensive boards and that's something that I know a couple of
the guys on the team have really tried to do all year, Jordan and Cornelio and
Travis and myself is really get us some offensive boards and get us some more
possessions and if we don't have an opportunity to shoot, get it back out and
make the defense work for 35 more seconds. I think it happened a couple times
today where it was a scramble situation and we were able to get the ball to
Garrison and he got a little bit more different looks.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student-athletes and take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Can you just reflect on the last couple weeks and what this has meant to
the program and the university.  
COACH JONES: I think it's been a great time. As I reflect back it's not just
the last couple weeks though. I think that's when maybe folks started noticing
and maybe some of the, we started reaping some of the rewards of the fruits of
the players' labor. But as I told them in the locker room after the game, I'm
disappointed that we lost the game, but I'm more disappointed that the journey
for this particular team is ending.  
They have been a joy to coach. They have worked so hard. And to see them as
well as American University and the entire university community kind of get
the our moment in the sun, is, really it's been a great time and a special
time.  
  
Q. I was asking your guys about your game plan on Lofton going in and you
got to feel pretty good looking at his box score and he's 1-7?  
COACH JONES: The fact that he only got seven shots up is pretty remarkable. I
thought that Garrison did a good job of chasing him, but as he also mentioned,
any of the down screens, we wanted to show very strongly on the screens, guard
him with a man and a half, any ball screen or dribble hand off we wanted to
show very, very, be very aggressive. Similar to the way Tennessee played
Garrison. And try to take the ball out of his hands. We played him differently
in those situations than we played any of their other players.  
You saw the draw back, the down side of that, there were two or three times
where -- and they utilize him very, very well -- but where he set back screens
and Garrison was under instructions, he was supposed to call the screen out,
but under no circumstances was he supposed to help. And their first two
baskets of the game I think Cornelio got back screened by Lofton and they
ended up with layups.  
So we had to tighten that up, do a little bit better job of recognizing those
situations, but that really was a byproduct of the fact that we just did not
want to give Lofton any opening. And in preparing for Lofton, but preparing
for Tennessee, obviously we talked to a lot of people, we watched a ton of
film, and the thing that we kept hearing over and over from people that know
them really, really well, is that they tease you with the three. And as well
as they shoot the three and people remember those and maybe the biggest
baskets of the game were the two threes that Chris hit, but they kill you five
feet and in. And we kind of felt like coming in that we weren't going to be
able to guard both, just from a physical standpoint.  
So we wanted to take Lofton out as best we could and then try to guard the
rest of them and keep them from getting layups and dunks.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH JONES: Thank you.

BIRMINGHAM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BIRMINGHAM)

  

## March 21, 2008

  

### [Derrick Caracter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18397)

### [Earl Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18396)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement by coach Pitino
and then go to ask questions for our student-athletes.  
COACH PITINO: Well, this is the second-best shooting team in the country. When
you see a team shoot 51 percent and 44 from the three you think automatically
the perimeter. Well, when you see statistics like that, you got to have a
great inside attack, which they do.  
But, I think our guys did a tremendous job tonight of really understanding
what we had to take away on the perimeter. Boise State, or any basketball team
that shoots it like Boise State, you can come away a loser if you don't handle
the basketball well and take care of defending the 3-point line. We talked
about -- we were going to get a lot of threes tonight. We knew that. We knew
they would try to take away our interior. But we did a good job of making the
extra pass, taking good threes, but doing all that and creating the good
motion, and is not of any value unless you stop it, and we did a very good job
of stopping a tremendous 3-point shooting team.  
And these two guys, DC gave us a big lift with David in foul trouble. And
Earl's been playing tremendous basketball of late and I was shocked he didn't
have an offensive rebound. He's going to run home, but outside of that he
played really well. It's a long trip, too.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys coming off the bench, how do you feel about that?  
EARL CLARK: Coming off the bench I just want to be aggressive, just play hard
and just try to focus on the scouting report. That's it.  
DERRICK CARACTER: Coming off the bench, I just wanted to give a lift to my
team and stay positive and help my teammates cheer them on. When I get in, I
want to play as hard as possible, and do whatever I can do for my teammates
and my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. You guys, if you would like you can head back to the
locker room.  
COACH PITINO: Great job, guys.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
COACH PITINO: You are going to be just as kind to me, right? Let me go because
it's late and we got to scout.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take one question for Coach Pitino. No, just kidding.
We'll go ahead and open it up for coach.  
  
Q. Just talk about your 3-point shooting, you were so worried about Boise
State doing that, and then you guys came out and did really what they needed
to do.  
COACH PITINO: We talked -- I told the guys that we're going to make a lot of
threes tonight because they're going to take away our interior. And, I said,
we got to create a lot of movement, which we did do. We need to make the extra
pass, work inside to out. And we did a good job of doing that. So we knew the
three was a going to be there, but stopping the three is very difficult,
especially when you press as much as we press.  
You got to be very alert. Not only are you giving everything you can in the
back court, then you got to turn around and guard their screens, inside to out
action. And we did a tremendous job of concentrating on that.  
  
Q. It looked like early on with the up tempo you guys maybe played a little
out of control at times, seemed like you got in and settled down. Could you
talk about what you told them to maybe settle them down?  
COACH PITINO: Just the only one I think T Will made his first few shots, and
he thought he was King James. He just needed to settle down a little bit and
he did. But they weren't out of control. I think when you shoot the percentage
we shot tonight, I wouldn't use that term, but I know exactly what you mean.
Of course, I think we were rushing things and not running our offense.  
  
Q. A little off topic, but I wonder what your thoughts are on Butler and if
they belong in this conversation with the schools that are here?  
COACH PITINO: Let me say this, I have a different philosophy than people on
TV. See, I don't think St. Joseph's is a Mid Major. I don't think Butler's a
Mid Major. I don't think Gonzaga, obviously, is a Mid Major. I don't Xavier is
a Mid Major. These are all great tradition programs. If you look at Xavier
going back four coaches Matta, Gillen or whoever, Skip Prosser, they always
win at the major level. Gonzaga, major level. St. Joe's goes back to Ramsey.  
So I think it's insulting to call these teams Mid Majors, because there's a
standard of excellence every year by Butler. And whether they play up tempo,
or slow, whether they change coaches, there's a standard of excellence. Butler
is a major powerhouse in the game of college basketball. And I get insulted
myself and I'm not even working at those schools when they call it a Mid
Major. Because, how many coaches do you have to go through? How many systems
do you have to implement before you say they're major.  
Now, a school like San Diego, is starting to develop their standard of
excellence. So, it takes some time to develop that label. So, I think that we
do a great injustice. I don't care what league they're in, to call St. Joe's
with that unbelievable tradition or Xavier or Gonzaga and quite frankly, I
know we played Butler a few years ago and they beat us in the NCAA. I would
never insult them that way. Because they're major, major. Big time college
basketball program.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your depth, I know you go plenty deep,
but they shot 80 percent tonight, your bench did.  
COACH PITINO: Well, the most important thing is how you score. It's off good
ball movement, off good player movement, and that's really, really important.
I was really impressed with the way the guys pressed tonight. I don't think we
gave them an easy possession. I think they had to earn everything. We played
that hard tonight because of our respect level for Boise State.  
When you win on the road in triple overtime, you beat BYU and you shoot 51 and
44, our respect level for that team was off the charts. We were ready to play
from the opening tip tonight, which everybody should be ready to play, it's
the NCAA.  
  
Q. Padgett picked up two pretty quickly, I don't think you played DC that
long of a stretch, I think 17 minutes, and talk about his performance and your
confidence in him to be able to go the stretch in that first half?  
COACH PITINO: DC does a lot of good things out there. And David's -- I could
gamble and try to pick up three, but I don't know the outcome of any game,
obviously. And in order for to us win a close basketball game we have to have
David on the floor down the stretch.  
So, I try not to let him get his third, it was very early on. But David's got
to learn, both of his fouls were bad fouls. His fourth foul was a bad foul.
He's got to learn to let it go. If he doesn't block it in his plane he has to
let it go. DC did a great job and we have a tremendous backup after him and we
don't necessarily start the most talented guys, it really is, we try to really
drill into our players' head, it's not important starting.  
I think that Sosa and Earl, DC, can start, but we don't really pay attention
to it. And it's good for those guys because they have a tough time following
scouting reports, so it's really good for them to focus in and pay attention
when they're on the bench, where Palacios and Padgett and McGee are all very
good at that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about -- just not only stopping the 3-point game -- you
were able to do that without having Reggie Larry and their other big guy do
much damage on the interior. Could you talk about not only stepping out on the
three shooters but rotating inside and cutting that off as well?  
COACH PITINO: We did a good job and they're tough in the interior. They have
got good moves and they have to score against bigger people when you watch
them on film, but I think we had a good thing. We had a lot of time to prepare
for them. And that really helped us. Because our guys -- we got their
attention.  
I just happened to watch that triple overtime game and I was really impressed
with them, still impressed. They had a heck of a year. They can really play.
And all these teams like Boise State who can shoot it and they keep their
players together for four years and they develop it and Greg's done a great
job with that program. A great job.  
There's so many terrific coaches like Greg and I'm just so impressed with
every time I turn the TV I say, boy he can really coach his tail off. And
they're just starting out. So many great coaches in this game, we're very
lucky to have them.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from Coach Capel,
and then go to questions for our student-athletes.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, I'm really proud of our team. I thought we got off
to good start in the first half and especially the way we closed the half to
have a 12 point lead at half time. We came out and really got after it and we
were able to extend the lead.  
We knew St. Joseph's was going to make a run. They're a very good basketball
team. The program has a lot of pride and they're well-coached and they have
good players. And they made a run, but our guys never panicked, we stepped up
and made plays and all three of these guys stepped up to my left and made huge
plays for us, whether it was David all night, offensively and defensively, the
job he did on Calathes. Blake playing really, really well out of the double
team, making some key baskets down the stretch.  
Austin running our team, I'm just really proud of our guys, and glad we have
another opportunity to work together.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. David, before you talk about your offensive explosion, talk about how you
defended Calathes.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just wanted to come out and get in the shooting pocket as Coach
Cline would say, he's a really good 3-point shooter, and that was kind of the
first key. They told me to limit his threes, and secondly, watch out for the
drives and the post man did a great job showing and trapping, and also the
other guards came and rotated and helped out a lot.  
So, it was just pretty much a team effort. Couldn't do anything by myself.
Just the whole team helped out, and we did a great job on him.  
  
Q. David, you dropped out of the starting lineup I think after February 9th.
And you were, I think, eight-out-of-ten games coming off the bench. Can you
talk about being a senior and getting to start again in this tournament and
what that was like being a reserve?  
DAVID GODBOLD: It's really exciting to just be able to start and in the
NCAA's. Coming out of the bench, I knew coach wanted me to just bring some
leadership, some energy off the bench, and I had no problem doing that. And
that's -- I just took pride in doing that. And today, I just wanted to come
out with a lot of a lot of energy. I knew the other four guys who always bring
energy. So, I wanted to make sure I played up to their level, and I think I
did a good job today.  
  
Q. Austin and Blake, since you haven't been asked, when they made a run,
they were very, very aggressive. You guys had to respond. Would you talk about
the keys to responding and keeping your composure?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think, definitely, just talking and using a lot of help on
defense; they do a good job getting into the lane and finding shooters on the
outside, but I think that definitely, just switching off a man and staying
together and talking a lot. That definitely helped with stopping their run.  
THE MODERATOR: Get closer to the mic.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: You want me to say it again? When they got in the lane and
penetrated; they do a good job of finding the open guys and attacking the rim.
So, I think our biggest thing was just to talk and switch and stay together
and not just run around and try to defend everyone, but go about it in a team
way. But just stay together and talk was our biggest two things, probably.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: We knew they were going to make a run. We just didn't know
when it was going to happen. They made their run, we kept our composure, coach
was in the huddle and told us we're fine, we're okay, just keep your head,
keep fighting, and that's what we kept doing.  
  
Q. I was wondering, Blake or David, if you could address this, it was 20-20
when Austin went out of the game with two fouls, and then you guys went on a
run, and it seemed like your offense wasn't flowing without him in the game.
What was it that picked things up for you in that period after A.J. went to
the bench?  
DAVID GODBOLD: We just kind of got a lift from Omar checking into the game. He
made sure to put us in good spots to kind of execute better on offense. And
that's what we did. We just knocked down shots, got it to the right people,
and they were coming out aggressive at us, and they were feeling good about
the game so we just had to stay aggressive and just keep executing. And that's
what we did on our own.  
  
Q. David, could you talk about your night offensively, you averaged single
digits usually, and then the other two guys if you could talk about his night
after he's done.  
DAVID GODBOLD: I think it just goes back to the how I've been practicing and
the coaches, they stayed on me the last four days of just going hard, and
shooting drills, and making sure that I jumped high, and made sure I kept
following through on my shot. And that's what I did today. Blake and Longar --
they always get double-teamed. They have to get respect down there so I have
to be able to knock down the shot when they kick it out and that's what I did
a good job of doing today.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: The coaches -- when we have been doing shooting, guard
shooting, they have been telling Dave, hold his follow-through up every time
he shoots, and trust that it's going to go in. And I think he's been working
hard on that. When I see Dave open, out there, I have faith in Dave, and I
know that he can knock down the open shot.  
So, I'm going to try to get him a shot as much as I can. Being a senior, Dave
knows that it could have been his last game, and I think that he came out and
played his heart out. He didn't want it to be his last game.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I definitely think, like David said, these last four practices
he's been playing really well. Yesterday, he brought a lot of energy to our
team and really helped us yesterday through practice. And also, him being a
senior, and he's been here before, and he knows what it's like, so he kind of
brought some experience with us. And he just stayed ready and hit big shots
for us today.  
  
Q. Two questions: One, David, the second half looked like Calathes got
really aggressive offensively in trying to drive. It looked like you were able
to ride him a little bit. He was not strong enough to kind of get by you. And
two, you said, this is for any of you, you said you had a really good practice
yesterday, how much -- did that give you confidence going in to today's game,
especially the shooting, you shot 57 percent.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just when we look at Calathes on tape, we see that he likes to
drive, but if guys got in physical with him, he kind of struggled at that. And
so the -- I just kind of tried to stay on him, and the big guys did a great
job stepping over, and letting him come to them instead of stepping up and
letting him get an easy pass to their big man.  
So, I tried to stay physical with him, and I'm glad that I got a chance to
kind of push him out, and I was fortunate that he kind of missed some open
shots. He didn't get a good rhythm going.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: Practice yesterday -- I think we had a lot of energy. I think
the guys were really excited about being down here.  
The freshmen, their first time being down here, they were excited, ecstatic,
they were ready to play. And then the guys that have already had experience;
me, Taylor, Dave and Longar. We, kind of my freshman year, we kind of had a
bad experience down here. So, we didn't want that to happen again. So, we had
that coming in our heads coming into practice, and we carried that over to the
game.  
  
Q. For David, considering the way you played defensively and offensively,
where does this rank, as far as career performances, and have you thought
about the magnitude of this stage and all that?  
DAVID GODBOLD: I don't know about career, but I say it's a pretty good game. I
think I did one of the best jobs defensively, I think. I really prided myself
today on trying to stop their best player. So, I really look at that first.  
Offense comes and goes. I know there's four other guys that can step up any
other day, so it was just my day today, and I'm fortunate that it happened
today, but I'm always going to try to come out a hundred percent on defense.
That's what I'm looking to do whoever we play next round. I want to try to
stop their best player. And that's what I look to do.  
  
Q. I know you guys have won before, but you're 1 of 32 teams that are going
to be playing after today. Can you just talk about what this win feels like
for you today, but Blake as a young guy and David as a senior?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: It's definitely a great thing. Obviously, no one wants to go
home in this tournament. And to move on, and when a lot of people were saying
that we weren't supposed to win, and St. Joseph's was supposed to upset us. It
just kind of gave us some fire and to win it, you know, it feels kind of even
better. But you got to put it behind us and get ready for our next game.  
DAVID GODBOLD: It feels really good. I experienced one victory my freshman
year, and I know how good it feels. But then also sophomore year I had a very
bad experience. So, I just got to look forward to Sunday, and hopefully come
out with the same fire, because whoever we play Sunday is going to come out
very aggressive. They're going to not want to go home, and hopefully our team
doesn't want to go home either. Because it's real boring when you go home
after you lose. So, you got to come out with the same fire and aggression that
we had today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. We will excuse you guys back to the locker
room. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said earlier this week, this team had to shoot well, score well. Talk
about that shooting performance today.  
COACH CAPEL: We made shots, our offense looks a lot better when we make shots.
I thought we did a good job of sharing the basketball and making shots. I feel
bad for Blake and Longar, but more so Blake because he never gets to play
against single coverage, he gets doubled so much. But I think his experience
of having to deal with that basically all year long has really helped him. And
for him to have four assists, and one turnover, I think that opened up a lot
of things for our guys; same thing with Longar. He's another guy that's been
doubled at times this year.  
Obviously, David stepped up and had a huge game for us. Austin was very steady
for us. I thought Omar came in and really did a good job for us in running our
team and getting us into stuff.  
It's as good as Longar has looked in a while. Just how active he was, and
playing different spots on the floor, and he was guarding Ferguson at times in
the perimeter. So, we feel good about this, we're not satisfied, we have
another good team coming in here on Sunday. Whichever one of these guys wins,
we'll get prepared for them and be ready.  
  
Q. Could you, for those of us who don't follow you regularly, could you talk
a little bit about David's situation, why you started him, why you benched him
earlier?  
COACH CAPEL: I didn't bench him. David is really a sixth starter for us.
Really, what I wanted was, we had no experience coming off the bench for us.
When you bench a guy it's because a guy's not playing well or a guy's done
something to get in trouble. We just switched our lineup to get experience to
come off the bench.  
Really when David has come in the game; even when he was coming off the bench
for us; he played as many minutes or more minutes than anyone. Usually, when
he came in he never really came back out.  
So, for us, we just wanted some experience. We just had only freshmen. We're
have new guys coming off the bench for us and so that's why we did that.  
As we got ready for the NCAA tournament, one of the things I looked at with
our team; we really have no one that has any experience in this tournament
besides David, Austin Johnson, Taylor. Griffin and Longar were on teams that
were in this tournament, but they didn't really play. Longar didn't really
play his first two years, and so I don't know if he logged any minutes in the
NCAA tournament. Maybe that freshman year against Niagara. But I think that
Taylor and Austin; when they were freshmen, when they played in the NCAA
tournament, I think it was five minutes, two minutes, I think each of those
guys got that. And so we really didn't have any experience. David's the only
guy that's played extensive minutes, and he had a good game his sophomore year
Oklahoma's last time in the NCAA tournament.  
He was probably the only guy, just looking at the box score. So, we wanted to
switch it up and have some experience in our starting lineup for the NCAA
tournaments. The NCAA tournament experience, and he played a tremendous game.
This game and our game against West Virginia this year are the two best games
I've seen him play since I've been here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the specifics of the shooting that David was talking
about and if it was you that worked with him and if somebody had told you that
you were going to have a player with the numbers that he had after the ball
game, and you didn't know who it was, would you have thought it would have
been, who would have come to mind first?  
COACH CAPEL: As far as him shooting, we always talk to David about shooting
the basketball, about holding your follow-through, about going harder, going
game speed, that's really the term that we use with him.  
And we have been really emphasizing it more with all of our guys this week.
Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well in Kansas City last weekend. So I
don't really think we had to tell our guys a lot, to be completely honest with
you. These guys understand the magnitude of this tournament and obviously the
excitement our freshmen and sophomore are never played in this tournament. And
so they were excited about that. Our older guys have. So David just came out
and made shots. That's the bottom line. He made shots. I don't know if it's
anything specific. Maybe he's giving us too much credit. He stepped up and
made shots today.  
Obviously a first guy, if you talk about a game, like the second part of your
question, the first guy always is Blake. To have a game like that. The second
guy would probably be Crocker, because that's the kind of game he's had for us
several times this year. Especially making threes like that.  
But David stepped up and did a good job for us and we're glad someone did and
I thought a lot of guys did, played really well for us, and that's the reason
why we were able to get this victory. Won by like a touchdown too, right?  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You made a statement yesterday about being unsure about your leadership,
is your opinion changed after watching what David did tonight?  
COACH CAPEL: Well it's changed for today. But one day doesn't make a leader.
David was terrific today. Longar was great today. And I think what those guys
have done and at least it looks like to me just being around our team for the
past few days, is that those guys have shared their experience. Especially
David. That's one of the things I talked to him about and talked to our older
guys is sharing your experience, both good and bad experiences that you have
had playing in this tournament. Our younger guys need that. And he stepped up
and played a great game.  
  
Q. You look at what the Big-12's done, five of six wins, do you think the
conference is better than some people have given credit for?  
COACH CAPEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. It's a really, really good league. And
it's been a very good league all year long.  
I don't think it gets enough respect nationally. We have other teams that are
very capable. You look at Nebraska, they're as good as some of these teams in
this tournament.  
Obviously we're really happy to be 5 of 6 in the league and we want to keep
going and we're rooting for all of the guys in our league right now and
hopefully we can keep advancing, all of us can.  
  
Q. With your defensive performance or the performance as a whole did you see
anything in yesterday or today that would lead you to believe that you're
going to have this kind of performance?  
COACH CAPEL: I would tell you what, I think our defense can be better. They
shot 49 percent from the field. I don't know how good, I mean it was good, but
I still think it can be better. And I don't want to discredit our guys, but I
don't want our guys to be satisfied and I'm not satisfied. I thought we did a
good job of contesting shots. We lost Ferguson too much and he made us pay
just about every time.  
And I thought they hit some tough shots that Govens banked in a couple of
shots and I know he didn't call bank on either one of them.  
But when you're in the midst of a run like that, those are the things that
happen. But I think we can be better defensively, I think we will be better
defensively on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Brad Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18309)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach Steve and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STEVENS: We're tied or it's really close, 22-22, I believe. Midway
through the first half. And we were getting out rebounded, 6-3 on the
offensive glass and we ended up getting nine of the next ten on our glass.  
And we made a few shots in succession and that kind of opened the game and
then I thought that our guys had tremendous poise after they scored the first
two baskets of the second half where we turned it over and they laid it in and
it's not an ideal situation, you don't want guys that are that talented to get
going, but our guys really showed the poise and grit that they have showed all
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Again we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A.J., Mike missed the last ten minutes of the half because of foul
trouble and it looked like you were just totally comfortable running the point
from then on. Can you kind of describe what that second half the first half
was like?  
A.J. GRAVES: Yeah, it was kind of a unique situation when Mike went out. That
changes some of the things we do. But I had to step up and run the point and
we brought in some other people. Pete came in off the bench and made some
great shots and that's just how things went.  
  
Q. Pete, it looked like South Alabama really never did anything special
against you defensively and just played you straight up. Kept getting open
shots and knocking them down. How do teams in your league normally play you?
Do they do special defenses against your shooting?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Well, it's harder when you play a team twice in a season to run
some of the sets and actions that you run throughout the whole year. And coach
said going into post season play for me to be ready to run a few things that
we haven't run for awhile, because that's the beauty of scouting. You can take
away so some of the stuff that a team's trying to do. So, it's not necessarily
anything that special that we tried to come into this game and do, it was just
be ready, run the offense, if you have your opportunities, look for them, if
not, keep moving it around and just get the best shot we can. But that's the
best way I can answer that one.  
  
Q. For Pete, looks like when you were getting hot in that first half, no
matter where you were on the floor, how far behind the arc you were, you
looked like you were in such rhythm that it looked like you were going to make
everything. How often is that kind of a feeling happen to you in college
basketball?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Also, again, I think we were doing an excellent job in the
first half of running our offense and A.J. a few times just was like, you
know, you think I said, "Good pass" one time and he was just like, I'm going
to keep looking for you, because you've been open a few times.  
So, then I think we got a few more and I kept saying the same thing, he just
kept telling me to get open. So, we were just trying to run our offense and
look for the best shot, and fortunately, some of them went down.  
  
Q. Maybe for either one of you guys, you guys are very sensitive to all
kinds of things about arenas. Are the rims extra friendly here in Birmingham
or what is that about?  
A.J. GRAVES: I don't think Pete's shots hit the rim actually so I don't know
about the rim on his part. But this is just -- we schedule stuff like this. We
went up to Alaska and played on neutral courts, we played in Conseco,
Indianapolis on neutral courts. So I think this is just some experience that's
came along with us. But you still got to go out there and play. There's going
to be tough teams that come out and want to challenge you and you just got to
try and do your best.  
THE MODERATOR: Pete, did you have any shots hit the rim? Were they extra
friendly to you?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Maybe a few. I don't know.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. A.J., from your experience this last year against Tennessee, having beaten
them, does that give you some confidence and some familiarity going into the
second round game?  
A.J. GRAVES: It may give you some familiarity just because of some of the
overlying things they do, but they're a different team and we're a different
team as well, too. So, I think this is going to be a different game than it
was last time. I'm not sure you can draw too much comparisons from them.
They're going to have to scout us well and then we're going to have to scout
them well. So, I think it's going to be a tough matchup on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll get you guys back to the locker room. Thank
you. We will now take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about specifically why you put Streicher on Demetric
Bennett? Because of the size advantage or what?  
COACH STEVENS: Drew has either guarded the opposing team's best statistical
player or guarded somebody that we thought could really give us problems in
every game we played.  
In the conference tournament he held a first team all-league guard in the
first game well below his average and then he held a -- and then he made a
first team all-league forward work for everything he could get in the second
game against Cleveland State.  
Drew could easily be sitting up here. I thought what he did today was
unbelievable how he kept Bennett off balance and Bennett's one heck of a
player, and I think it shows you how much respect that we have for him that we
would put our four on him and give up the chance to give up some offensive
rebounds early and be mismatched underneath the post, but Drew was fantastic
today like he's been for 33 games in five years.  
  
Q. How meaningful is it to you to be like the third youngest coach ever to
win 30 and there's not too many Mid Majors that have even won 30 games.  
COACH STEVENS: It's more meaningful to me that Butler has won 30 games and we
have been trying to build, and build off of a program that was already
established for the past eight years. And it's fun too, it's been fun to be a
part of it, but it's more fun because of the people you're doing it with. And
it doesn't mean a whole lot to me from a personal standpoint, but it means a
lot to me from a team ego standpoint.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the stretch where A.J. had to play the point?  
COACH STEVENS: I thought he did a great job. I heard a lot of people say that
A.J.'s a catch and shoot guy, A.J. was a heck of a point guard for us for his
first two years at Butler.  
And then when Mike came, I think they compliment each other so well that Mike
ends up handling the ball a little bit more. But A.J.'s very capable and then
I thought Shawn came in and was fantastic the entire game. And when our
rebounding efforts turned around, it was Shawn up there flying around the rim
keeping balls a live and really played with great energy and I thought that
really set a tone for the rest of the half.  
He played well off of A.J. and what I thought was so good about the way A.J.
played was, Pete said it, in our offense he was looking for him, he was also
looking for him in transition he really got the ball up the floor and made a
couple of plays where you could tell he was going to lay it in or look for
Pete and he did a great job.  
  
Q. How much do you know about Tennessee at this point and what's your
general impression of them?  
COACH STEVENS: I know it more as a fan than a coach. And I'll work hard in the
next 24 hours to learn more about them. Obviously, I've got a feel for their
system, because Coach Pearl was in our league at the University of Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, and we played Tennessee last year.  
I have the utmost respect for him, I think the team is fabulous. If they're a
2 seed, there are four pretty good teams out there that are 1 seeds and we'll
have to be at our very best on Sunday to compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you.

### [Ron Arrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18307)

### [Demetric Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18306)

### [Daon Merritt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18304)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll start with an opening statement from coach and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH ARROW: We knew that they were a very experienced team that worked very
hard to get the next guy an open shot. And tonight was no exception.  
It's not that I didn't think -- I got to go back, but a lot of those shots,
3-point shots that they made we were right on them. But 18 assists speaks for
itself.  
They do a very good job of finding the open man and when you have five seniors
that have worked together and got to the tournament, and as many victories and
as many tough teams that they have been able to play in getting to where they
are today, after playing them, that they can shoot the ball like that, they're
going to go a long way in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, talk about Butler's defense and how that made it so
difficult for you getting into your offense.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: Well, I think they played good defense and they played hard
the whole game. Even when they got up they never let up. They played good.
They're just a good team.  
DAON MERRITT: Like he said, they're a good ball club. They play well together.
They have -- I'm sure they have a set of rules and things they go by, and it
works and it really, really does. Early, I think, we came out -- we played
good, we got what we wanted and they made adjustments. And we didn't.  
  
Q. Talk about the guy that was guarding you, that 6'7 ", Streicher, I guess.
He seemed to be long and you just didn't have any room to get your shots off,
basically.   
DEMETRIC BENNETT: He played good defense. Every time I tried to go around it
there was somebody there helping and he just played good. His size and
everything was -- I don't think it was that effective, I just couldn't make
any shots and they just played good team defense and he played good defense,
too.  
  
Q. Daon, or Demetric, why was it so hard to stop Campbell today?  
DAON MERRITT: I think he got on a roll and when a player gets on a roll like
that, he's just feeling it, I mean that's what anybody -- it's pretty much
hard to stop. He's a talented player, he made shots when it mattered.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think they did a good job of finding him in transition.
The clock went down, the drive and kick, they're a good team, and they always
made the extra pass when somebody made a mistake or when somebody left them
open, he just made it. He got his confidence going early. He made all his
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, you guys can head back to the locker room if you like,
and we'll go ahead and take questions for Coach Arrow at this point.  
  
Q. Talk about the stretch there in the end of the first half that it was
22-22 and then they just, as Coach Stevens was saying, he thinks they got nine
of the next ten rebounds and just stretched it out there. What sort of changed
for them?  
COACH ARROW: We started missing some shots, they started making some shots, we
missed free throws, and I thought that we got down a little bit, and they kept
coming right at us.  
Whenever, and again, I got to go back and look, but I don't think that our
defense on the 3-point line is indicative of what it shows here. I thought
that we were on some of their shooters a lot of the times, and they just
buried them, I mean buried them and buried them and buried them. And when that
happens a lot of times you're not making free throws, the free throw
situation, I mean, I think we shot 14 more free throws than them and made one
more than them.  
Then compound that, we just got down, we didn't fight back, I thought the
second half we came back and made a little run, I think cut it to 12, 13
points and I thought we were going to get going and credit them, they came
back and hit two big threes back-to-back and got on another roll. And we just
didn't answer.  
They are a very -- and I've said this, to be a 7 seed, I think that they're a
little bit better than that. But, when you run up against a team, and there
will be some other ones in this tournament, whenever you run up to somebody
that's going to hit threes like that, they're going to upset some people. And
I'm not saying that this was an upset, I'm just saying, by far, that when they
go against Tennessee, if they can hit like that, they have got a great shot at
beating Tennessee. Just like Tennessee, if they're hitting their threes, they
have got a great shot of winning this whole thing. But the bottom line is
those threes can either break you or make you.  
  
Q. You touched on this a little bit already, but how frustrating is it
defensively when you play good defense and then a guy buries one from 24, 25
feet and a lot of those shots were from that kind of distance?  
COACH ARROW: Yeah, we had four guys at different times on him. We had bigger
guys, smaller guys, and he just got into a groove. In today's game, you get a
couple guys, you get a guy that hits a couple and he gets into that groove. I
don't care if he's two feet from the hole or 30 feet from the hole, he starts
feeling it and you're in trouble.  
And he definitely -- they definitely shoot 50 percent from the three, I'm
going to be anxious to go back and see the game, and see exactly how many of
them were tightly guarded with a hand right in their face.  
You know, it's a shame, because the one elimination game -- and they played
very good, I'm not taking anything away from them, I mean if they shoot like
that, they're going to win a lot more games. And they play pressure defense,
they work very good together. But it's just a shame, because I know what this
team, our team did this year and to end it like this is just, I feel bad for
the two seniors, because we're definitely a better team than this. But they
had something to do with it.  
  
Q. I know you said that this may be the best one of the best passing teams
you've seen in quite a few years, were you surprised at all as well as they
moved the ball when they got on the interior?  
COACH ARROW: No. I made the statement, I've seen them play three different
games and scouting them, I saw a couple times during the year and they might
be the best passing team I've seen in more than a couple years. They really,
really know where each other are. They get in there and they jump up and they
can hit the post, they can hit the wings, they just have a good feel for one
another. And we did the same thing, we just didn't bury the shots. We missed
gosh, we had to miss, we led the Sun Belt in assists and we had, what? Eight
tonight. We averaged almost 16. So it's one of those deals, the tournament is
a one shot and you're out, and we'll go on back and accept and wish them the
best of luck unless they play Western Kentucky.  
  
Q. You said they got one chance to see you, are you concerned that people
watching this game would say hey, the Sun Belt shouldn't have had two teams
anyway?  
COACH ARROW: Let me just say this: There is no doubt in my mind after this
game before the game, during the game, we deserved to be in this tournament.  
I know some things have been said about our team. I don't think that once the
committee gets the 65 teams in it that anything should be said. You shouldn't
knock any teams that make it to this tournament.  
The committee goes by a criteria. If you're going to knock something, knock
the criteria, change the criteria for getting into the tournament. We did --
everything that we did during this game is not going to spoil the year for us.
We were 4-1 against teams in this tournament, we were 3-2 against Top-50
teams, I think we were 5-3 against top 100 teams.  
San Diego won the WCC or whatever conference they're in, we beat them 22 or 24
points earlier in the year. We beat Western Kentucky twice. The criteria that
is set forth right now, we did what that criteria calls for. And I'm glad that
the committee went by the criteria.  
If people don't like the criteria and all they want is the BCS teams in it,
then write that into the criteria. And let other teams go have a tournament,
let the BCS teams have a tournament, and let the two winners play for the
national championship. But the way the criteria is now, there's no doubt in my
mind, we deserved to be in it. I'm just sorry that -- there will be a lot of
them probably say, well, we said so. But that doesn't bother me.  
  
Q. The fact that a lot of people were upset that the none -- that the
conferences like yours and Butler got a lot of times that that was the matchup
as opposed to the BCS conferences getting matched against the so called Mid
Major, do you look at that as a conspiracy out there?  
COACH ARROW: I don't think it's a conspiracy, but I think a lot of those
people that are talking on TV, where did they play ball at? Duke, North
Carolina. They're used to the big boys getting into the tournament. And, but
they did come back and say one thing, I think the biggest thing was Arizona
State not getting into the tournament. Well then they came back the next day
and said, well, they should have been in before Arizona, because they beat
Arizona twice. You know, you can go on and on and on. You put 120 teams into
the tournament, 121, 122 is going to be upset.  
So the bottom line is, whatever they put the criteria to be, then go by the
criteria and then don't say anything about the teams that get in. That's what
the committee is there for and know the criteria and go by it. And we
definitely met the criteria this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH ARROW: Thank you.
