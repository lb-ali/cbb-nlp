# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Kurt Budke, Danielle Green and Andrea
Reilly. Coach?  
COACH BUDKE: I want to congratulate Texas A&M and Coach Blair on a fantastic
season and a Big 12 Championship. They've got a very good team. That's the
defending champions back, a lot of players that have started from freshman and
played to this point, a lot of experience. I thought at key times their
experienced players came through for them and they had four people in double
figures and sometimes that's tough to handle. We had three in double figures
and couldn't find that next scorer tonight. But give Texas A&M credit, they
put you in rush shots, a panic mode offensively when you shouldn't be and
that's why they're the champions, the Big 12 champions, and they'll do well.  
Like I told my girls in the locker room right now, this season is not over.
You got beat. You took a team that's a Final Four candidate down to the wire,
and if they're a Final Four candidate who knows how far we can go? We're going
to leave here with our heads high and proud of what we accomplished and we're
going to move to the next level. Everybody is looking forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Andrea, at the end of the game, the first 3-point shot you put up went
in; the second one didn't. Talk about that.  
ANDREA RILEY: I thought it was going in. It was tough defense, things weren't
go our way. It was tough against their defense.  
  
Q. Andrea, expand on that. Talk about just almost taking over the game
single-handedly in the last five minutes. Was there something in you that said
"I'm going to do it"?   
ANDREA RILEY: My coaches were talking to me and telling me not to get so
emotional in the game and keep my head up and play like I know how to play.
Because she said forget about you being all that you are right now and just
think about playing like you are playing in the backyard.  
  
Q. Danielle, you guys lost this game, but by the way you played do you feel
like you gained something as well going forward?  
DANIELLE GREEN: Yes. Coach told us we have to learn from it and make better
decisions at the end, box out, the basics are why we lost those six games in
the first place, so just have to go back to the drawing board.  
  
Q. Danielle, was this a fun game to play in? A lot of OSU fans that haven't
seen you play before you came out and you guys had some home court advantage,
was it fun to play?  
DANIELLE GREEN: Championship game, it was a blast. First Big 12 Championship,
just didn't get the "W."  
But it was fun, glad the fans came out to support us and hopefully we can get
one next year for y'all.  
  
Q. (No microphone.) Talk about how she was a factor tonight.  
DANIELLE GREEN: She hit three's, and you had to keep track of her, and she
just never quit on the floor.  
  
Q. Andrea, talk about the job that Taylor did on Starks tonight.  
ANDREA RILEY: Taylor, we were talking in the locker room and she told me she
wants to keep her in check because the last couple of games she said she
wasn't delivering her full physical defense like she usually does, like we do
in practice so she wanted to stick well on her and I think she did a great
job.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you tell me your thoughts on Andrea's last two there's, the
one that went in and the one that she went out-of-bounds?  
DANIELLE GREEN: I was happy when she hit the first one, the second one I
thought was good but it got stuck. Things just don't work out, but try to hit
'em!  
  
Q. Final Four candidate? Talk about the games that may be coming up.  
ANDREA RILEY: I think we have to take this game like a learning experience. We
were not as comfortable as they were being in the championship game because
they were the Big 12 champs last year, and they're on their pay-back tour, so
they wanted to get a Big 12 Championship or a tournament championship. We
played our hearts out; they played their hearts out, they just came out on
top.  
  
Q. What about your confidence going forward. You guys got to feel like you
can play with anybody, right?  
ANDREA RILEY: Yeah, we feel like we can play with anybody in the country. We
don't overlook anybody, we don't ever -- we are never overconfident. We just
know how to take it into consideration and say, okay, it's just like another
team playing in the backyard.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. You ladies both signed to come to a school that had not won a game in
conference the season before. Talk about all the improvements that you've seen
and the fact that you've not only seen this program grow so much but grow in
one of the toughest conferences in women's basketball and what you think the
biggest factor in getting Oklahoma State basketball turned around the way you
have.  
DANIELLE GREEN: Starts with the people, you know? These people are winners,
you know? In the summertime we said we were going to work out and that's what
the people on our campus and our fans started to believe in and it's hard
work. The coaches had great plays, great sets, great minds, and you recruit
good people -- you've got some good folks! (Chuckles.)  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach; it's your turn.  
  
Q. Coach, tell me about the plays at the end, Andrea drove one time to tie
it, missed, they got a 3 on the other end and then a couple of turnovers for
each team, talk about the crucial plays at the end.  
COACH BUDKE: That's why they're the champs, we're not. They made the right
plays at the end, we made a few mistakes. We didn't plan on giving Gant a
layup there at the end, and the girls made a mistake. We told them they were
going to go deep and one was going to fly and, you know, they're kids, they
get caught up and give their best effort, they're going to make mistakes. I
think that was the difference in the game tonight, was the veterans versus the
ones coming on and they just made some crucial plays at the end.  
You know Andrea's 3 she made, people are going to think that was a crazy shot.
Go back to our season and we allow her to make those plays at the end of the
game because she is a big-time player and big-time players do make plays. The
second one obviously was going to be a tough make, too, but you got to allow
your best people to have a chance right there and I was really proud of how
she finished the game. She didn't play very well up until about 6 minutes to
go in the game. We kept looking at each other as coaches on the sideline
saying, we're only down 4, we're only down 6. We didn't play very well tonight
but giving them credit for putting us in that position. We had to keep trying
to figure out a way to get across to our girls that we were in this thing and
we could win it. So I was proud of the come-back to take the lead at one
point.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about your three young ladies, 57-59 points among Green,
Riley and Smith.  
COACH BUDKE: That's why we came up short because it was only three. They have
four legitimate scorers on that team. They have three people -- well all four
of those people shoot jump shots, three of the four can come off high screens
and shoot 3's and you don't see that very much in women's basketball coming
off high screens and shooting jumpers and 3's. That's why this team is so
dangerous, they might be one of the best jump-shooting teams I've seen in the
country. Starks to me is one of the best 2 guards in this nation. I was proud
of our three, I thought they delivered but we need one more to win a
championship.  
  
Q. What do you feel about the ball movement in the half-court offense?  
COACH BUDKE: I didn't like it, and we kept talking about it, but that's what
they do to you. They're one of the better half-court defenses that you'll
face, and they make you pick up your dribble too quick. They make you -- when
you cut to the a spot that's supposed to be open it's covered. We didn't do
well on our second and third options tonight, but give them credit.  
There's not a lot of teams in the nation that play that aggressive man-to-man
that we're going to face in the nation so when we do hopefully we learned from
it and we'll do well against it. This Big 12, you see every style in this
league. I just can't -- still, I can't get away from us -- we played in the
championship of the Big 12 and I'm very, very proud of my kids to get to this
point. But we're not done yet.  
  
Q. Coach, defensively you did shut down Starks and Gant for the most part,
but Franklin goes off -- did you try to take away the first two options?  
COACH BUDKE: Yes. We did. I mean, I thought we were successful in taking those
two away. That was one of the keys on the board was to take those two away.
They're still going to get numbers because they're great players, but that's
why they're the champions and we're not. They have two other options. Mo, that
kid is a pro. She's going to play in WNBA for a long time if she stays
healthy, now that she is healthy. We were going to hold them in the 50s, we
thought, if we were going to win, and we were close.  
  
Q. Kurt, talk about Andrea scoring 10 straight points. Did you feel like you
guys were going to come back and get the win?  
COACH BUDKE: We thought -- we called a couple sets for her in a row and we
said if we're going to win this thing we've got to get her going. And she hit
a couple in a row, and all it takes it a little bit to get her on fire and
that was our chance. I thought Danielle and Shaunte were doing their part but
we needed Andrea in the 20s somewhere if we were going to win this game.  
Give her credit, she wasn't playing that well at that point and she could have
quit or pouted, but she found a way to lead her team back and gave them a
chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Kurt, last year you go to watch the selection show and you don't know if
you're in or out, this year it will be different. Talk about that.  
COACH BUDKE: After we get by tonight, it's going to be exciting. We're going
to suffer tonight a little bit for sure, but we'll go home tomorrow, and
Monday night I think we're going to have a get-together and watch it together
and, you know, it's going to be interesting where they seed this team.  
I think whenever they send us, whoever we have to play we have a chance to win
a couple games in a row. If we're lucky enough to come back to Oklahoma City,
so be it. We feel like we can win two in a row wherever we play.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that question, Coach. Last year was a new experience
now guys in the NCAA tournament. How much more comfortable will your girls be
on that stage?  
COACH BUDKE: I hope you'll see the same step that we took this year in the Big
12. Last year we didn't know what to expect, this year we got to the
championship. I hope it's going to be the same at the NCAA tournament. Like I
said before, they're 19 and 20 year olds, now that we've experienced it. They
all felt we should have upset Bowling Green last year.  
This year they'll come out ready to win instead of trying to see where we fit
in this thing. Last year we might have felt like, "Are we good enough to be
here?" This year it's not a question. We feel like we're good enough to be
there.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about their ability to get offensive rebounds
and the second-chance points?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, when you're rushing at shooters like you have to rush at
shooters and you have to help off-screens against shooters, that's going to
open things up. There are going to be long rebounds and they are one of the
better offensive rebounding teams in our conference, I don't think there is
any question about that, they've always been that way.  
Because they're such great shooters, it gets you spread out and that opens it
up a little more for the offensive boards. We've got hurt against bigger, more
physical teams this year but we've been able to match it at the other end and
tonight we only had 7 offensive rebounds at the other end and that's probably
the difference in the ballgame.  
  
Q. On that last 3 by Andrea, did you want a 3 all the way?  
COACH BUDKE: We just trust or best player to make the best play. We did want a
3, we wanted an on-ball screen coming off. She has a pull-back move where
she'll act like she's making the drive and going to the hole and pulls back
and she had just made one, and it's like when we beat Texas A&M earlier in the
year people asked did we call that shot and, no, we didn't, we trusted our
best player and that's what we did tonight, too.  
  
Q. How far can you guys go in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BUDKE: I honestly don't know that. I know that coming out of this league
that we played in, I think we're going to have eight in the NCAA tournament,
probably should have 9 but I think it will be 8 realistically and if you can
fight through that and get to a championship game in the Big 12 then I think
we can play with a lot of people in this country.  
You still have to make shots, we have to hit on our keys that we talk about
having three or four people in double figures, we have to do that to have a
chance to advance in this tournament, but like we said a minute ago, the girls
believe they can advance and I think that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Andrea can try that 100 more times and it won't happen again, probably,
so when it gets stuck, what are you thinking? Did your heart stop? The whole
gym went silent.  
COACH BUDKE: It did, didn't it? I think I went silent, too. It's just -- as
that got stuck you felt like your season was over. Not season over but
tournament over. You know, again, I'll go back to what I said earlier, I'm
going to trust my best player to make a shot there and she hit an unbelievable
one right before.  
  
Q. Can you put in perspective how far this program has come? Two years ago
to now in the championship?  
COACH BUDKE: I don't know if I can. We have goals at the beginning of the year
of trying to win, taking baby steps in this conference, the toughest in
America, and to get where we got this year, I think it's going to have to sink
in at some point in time. We truly don't look back and we don't look forward.
We lock in one day at a time. Like I said earlier, we recruit winners and kids
that expect to win. So these kids that sat right here tonight expected to be
in this championship game and that's where we want our whole team to be for
years to come right now. Except kids to expect to win and play for Big 12
championships. There will be a day we look back on it and say, "Wow, that was
amazing", but it's not today.  
  
Q. Comment, if you would, about the crowd, seemed like the people turned out
for you tonight.  
COACH BUDKE: Wasn't that something? I think that's the next step we take as a
program, putting more bodies in seats and late in the year we were getting
5,000, 6,000, we won the Big 12 challenge this year with a sell-out against
OU. I was proud of the orange in the stands tonight. There were people in the
stands that maybe haven't seen us play much this year, but I think if we can
get Gallagher with 5 or 6,000 in it each game it will be a tough place to
play. I love to look up there at all those orange shirts.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on your win. These guys got to get out
of here by 10:30.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Morenike Atunrase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13854)

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [A'Quonesia Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13857)

### [Takia Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16383)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH BLAIR: They don't want to go home early because they're on per diem and
they want to get all three meals on Sunday and try for Monday, too. You just
saw a heck of a basketball game. They did when it was going to take for them
to win by playing us a lot of different zones they ran some effective zones.
And the first half we had every shot that we wanted and we could have blue it
open but how many times is Starks going to go 1 for 7 and Danielle 3 for 11
and you're going to be up by 9 at half.  
It was a tribute to our other kids who stepped up, made some big-time shots in
that ballgame. Isn't it funny when you start looking at our conference, Kansas
State goes from worst to first. The two bottom programs in our conference to
now having the top two programs. At least for today. This is what parity is
all about and this is what hard work, coaching and good recruiting will do for
you. I would like to commend both staffs of Oklahoma State and Texas A&M for
getting Coach Kurt Budke and I up to this platform.  
We have good assistants, both of us have good players and good backing at home
by administration and fans but there was a great basketball game and the most
important thing, the nation was watching, because we were the last game in
town that was going on. And I'm just happy to be a part of something of this
magnitude and I would really like to thank Kansas City for putting on a first
class show, because we were treated great, the Big 12 did a great job of
running the tournament. That's what we're known for, the little things that
make you proud to be a Big 12 coach in the conference. This is why this is a
destination league. You don't see coaches from this league going anywhere
else. You see them move to this league because of how well we're treated and
the competition in this league.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student athletes.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: We are veterans. Our chemistry is great, especially on
defense. We've been in big games before, and we love to play together.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I would reiterate, we have a lot of chemistry. We have
learned how to play together over the years and I think it's something a ball
club has to learn. Just to add one more thing, like A'Quo said, we have been
in big games before. Riley is hard to guard, and sometimes she is unguardable,
and you need about three people to guard her sometimes, but, you know, those
cases, if somebody messes up, somebody is there to pick 'em up.  
  
Q. Down there at the end, it was you and A'Quo there. Talk about what was
going through your mind as you guys answered every one they had.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: As for me, I've struggled thinking about or hesitating with
my shot, and that's one thing that I focused on more, not hesitating on my
shot. And when it's there, take it. Coach gave me the green light, so I took
it when I was open.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Coaches told me to take the open shots when they were
there, and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Riley hit that big 3-pointer, and she threw up the next one that got
stuck in the rim. Did y'all think it was going in? And once it got stuck, what
went through your mind?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I knew the first one was going in, and I thought the second
was going in. I don't know if at that time we had the last possession and
Coach Schaefer said, "It's okay. Stay calm." And once again, that's where our
experience came in.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Riley has hit a couple of those. She hit one to win the
game for them, and I wouldn't have been surprised if the second one went in,
and just knowing that we had the jump ball possession, we knew that it was in
our hands now.  
  
Q. A'Quo, you had the assignment of having to guard Andrea tonight more of
the time than not. What's the number one thing you tried to do to keep her
from scoring?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: It's hard to keep her from scoring. It's a team effort,
all-out team effort. I just tried to keep her in front of me, and she goes
past me, my team has my back. So it's an all-out effort to guard Andrea. She
is a great point guard.  
  
Q. You guys, put this in perspective, what it means. Was there a point you
thought -- you knew you were going to do this?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: For me I knew we were going to do it before we came into
the game. That's the mentality we came into the game with. That's the way we
prepare for every game; we go in and do our X's and O's, and if we execute and
play defense like we do day in and day out, then we know we'll be okay.  
  
Q. When the season started with the struggles, the conference season and the
Nebraska game where you had the turnovers, did you ever really imagine that
you could be here as conference champions?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: In Nebraska, after that loss, we went into the locker
room and talked among each other. The coaches didn't come in, and we were
basically talking and saying what we needed to do to get back on top. What we
did last year to win the Big 12 Championship, so we got back into the gym and
worked on the fundamentals, back to defense and back to offense and that's
what got us here.  
  
Q. Takia, can you talk about the play where she forced the ball, and was
that something you felt like you could take advantage of?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I thought it was going out. I was nervous for that pass,
and I thought it was going out-of-bounds; it was a great pass and she finished
it.  
TAKIA STARKS: Danielle is a go-getter. When Mo passed the ball, I knew it was
going in. As far as Riley, I watch her, and players tend to back off of her. I
said I was not going to back off, and it was a bait move. And I tipped it out-
of-bounds, and I took a risk, and we got the ball on that one.  
  
Q. A'Quo, do you think that you guys after this hard-earned victory, do you
deserve a No. 2 seed?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Yes, sir. Coming into this we had great momentum, winning
our last four conference games over two top-10 teams. I believe that speaks a
lot for our team, and coming into the tournament, seeing how -- what a power
house the Big 12 is. I think we deserve a 2 seed, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Mo, expanding on that, I think you guys have won 13 of your last 14
games. Are y'all comfortable with the fact that you'll be labeled as one of
the hottest teams in America?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think we can handle it. Being Big 12 champions last year
you saw how that went, and we opened up with a 1-4 start, but after that we
had a team meeting -- the first 5 starters and myself, and the coaches, we sat
down and talked and went over, you know, what was it that was missed and go we
went back to the hardwood and we got to it. It helped.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Just to add to that, we're the most humble team in
America, and we stick to our defense and that's how we win games.  
  
Q. What is there this year that wasn't there last year last year?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Oklahoma State played a zone, practically the whole game,
and we didn't play that well against zones.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: T.K. has always been a great shooter, and last year I
struggled with my 3-point shots, and it's been great to expand the zone by
hitting those. And they usually play with a wide match-up zone, and tonight
they stretched out, and even if it's not at the 3-point line, you have to step
back and shoot the 3. And that's how I think I helped my team.  
  
Q. Getting past the second round, though, what's different about this team
now? Where do y'all want to go?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think just experience. That's the difference. That will
carry us over the hump this time. We've been there in the past and we saw --
and I think for myself playing it's been different -- playing different -- she
was saying toughness -- yes, Coach Schaefer stresses how tough we have to be
coming into the game. He stresses how tough we have to be physically and
mentally, and I think we did that tonight, it worked.  
  
Q. Morenike, is this going to be an anxious couple of days for you guys
finding out where you will be going?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I don't know all the sites. I don't want to say anxious;
we'll be excited to go wherever we go and play. Our fans will follow us
wherever we go; they always have.  
  
Q. A'Quo, can you talk about when Buchanan came off the bench? We haven't
seen a lot of her in quality minutes. Can you talk about her performance?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: She did a great job coming off the bench. And before the
game the coach said the game would be won by a bench player. And earlier this
year Damitria was doing a great job of pushing us and making us better, and
she did a great job on defense and getting offensive boards and putting them
back up. We thank Damitria for her great play tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for the Coach.  
COACH BLAIR: Rebounding was the key in the ballgame. By them playing zone, we
got 19 offensive boards and finished plus 10. They're one of the best
rebounding teams in our conference right there. I thought that was huge. The
other thing that was huge was our bench. 20-2. We felt like that was the was
going to be the key to the ballgame.  
We felt like our eight was going to be able to produce better than their five
or who they had coming in as far as points. Damitria Buchanan and Micheaux
might be the unsung heroes coming into this game, but we had fouls and all of
the sudden Buchanan came in, 6 points, 9 boards. We haven't seen that since
December.  
And Coach Schaefer works with those post players every day, and sometimes it's
hard for those kids to have the confidence, knowing that you're playing with
all Big 12 performers, knowing that he does a great job of teaching them the
game and believing in them and getting them to believe in themselves when the
time comes.  
Micheaux cleared people out and made great offensive boards for us and she
kept us in. The 3-point play by Gant, I'm not sure when it was, but it was
late in the half and we finally got it inside against the zone, and she hit
that one.  
Then when she hit sideline play, 2-point ballgame. We ran a streak play for
Gant and she got that easy layup right there. Two huge plays, and then Riley
came back and nailed that 3 in front of Kurt Budke, and A'Quo hit the four key
free-throws down the stretch.  
I thought it was a tremendous job. This was not our normal type of defense
that we normally play all over the Court. Coach Schaefer is going to explain
the strategy of what we wanted to do tonight, but it was the 6th straight team
that was held under 60. I'm going to let Coach Schaefer explain what we were
trying to do.  
COACH SCHAEFER: They can get 80 on most nights when they want to, and they got
80 in this tournament. I think when you play Oklahoma State I think you've got
to worry about points in the paint; you've got to worry about dribble
penetration and rebounding. Our kids, those of you that followed us, we have
unbelievable warriors.  
They are tougher than any kids I've ever coached. Physically and mentally
they're as tough as any kids -- I'll take them and we'll play anybody anywhere
right now, because they have got it hooked up. I think you can see that if you
followed them any in the last month. They are really zeroed in on what they're
trying to do, especially defensively. So I think tonight going back, you know,
I'm sure everybody was wondering what we were doing, but you've got to take
away the dribble penetration.  
They had 30 points in the paint of 59, and that was from experience. At our
place we got out, pressured, played like we liked to, they had 37 at half.
Same thing in Stillwater. Each time the adjustment was to play like we played
for 40 tonight. It's not rocket science; we don't need to be stubborn. Let's
make the adjustment the day before and go into the ballgame thinking this is
what we're going to do, and the first half it worked.  
They scored 24, which is the most they've scored in a half against that style,
so we played well. They shot 60% the second half but they only took 20 shots.
Again, I think our kids did a fairly good job, even in the second half.
Shaunte Smith made a couple of huge fade-away step-backs, but you've got to
keep Riley in front of you, and you have to make her make that shot that she
made in front of Kurt Budke.  
You can't let her get by you. I thought our kids -- you guys have to remember
Takia is the one that was guarding her at our place with 6 seconds left, so
she had extra focus tonight. When I moved her over there on her and moved
A'Quo off, that gave -- we put a kid over there that was highly motivated, if
you follow me.  
She did a tremendous job on that kid. She really made her take some hard
shots, and the kid can make hard shots, as y'all have watched during the
course of her career. Those three things are what we wanted to do tonight. I
thought our kids were awesome, and they are as hard-nosed as any kids I've
ever coached. They're great kids, good, Christian kids. It's a lot of fun
being around them right now. They're deserving of what's happening to them and
it's truly a blessing what's happening to them, and they'll tell you that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for both coaches now.  
  
Q. A little bit about your seniors down the stretch. You said A'Quo hit
those four free-throws, it was a senior hitting a pass, a senior hitting shots
when Oklahoma State had the run. Talk about them.  
COACH BLAIR: I think we did not panic every time they made a run. When Riley
went on a 10-0 run herself down there, we were very much in the ballgame, and
we did not have to use time-outs to stop a run. We can stop a run by an
experienced team out there, and when you have A'Quonesia, look at her line.  
They were going to make A'Quo beat them, and that's what happened tonight.
Morenike, what a scorer she is, clutch shots. Reado came in. We didn't use her
so much for one reason: We had to have four shooters on the court, and that's
when you put Morenike and D.G. in there, because she can do the same thing
Reado can down at the 4. We're going to need Reado again, so don't worry about
her, but the seniors make good decisions and we trust them.  
  
Q. Gary, talk about the maturity of the program. A few years ago your two
leading scorers were 9 of 29, you might lose a game to TCU or someone, but now
you talk about Franklin and Atunrase stepping up. Does that speak about the
maturity in the program?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it does. Oklahoma State did not stop us in the first
half. They stopped us in the second half with their defense. The first half we
had every shot that we wanted. Maybe that's what happened, Starks wasn't used
to being that wide open. It just happened. But all of the sudden Gant was not
making the right reads and was having troubleshooting over Byford or whoever
was coming out of the high post.  
Sometimes it's more fun when you can walk into the press room and say, "Look
what our 5s did!" Instead of always T.K. and Gant. Our kids are unselfish and
they'll share the spotlight. You're right, we might have lost it, but we're
not afraid to go on our other options. That's the key to good basketball
teams. You need balance, and we do have balance.  
  
Q. I know that you had a bad patch at the start of Big 12 play. What was
causing that? What would you say that you could tell us about what caused the
turn-around to where you are today?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes we get into the press room and we're always trying to
find out what we didn't do right. Let's say when we lost to Nebraska and
Kansas State, I would like to tell you what they did right. They just flat
beat us.  
Coaches get up here, and we're always talking, we done this -- sometimes give
credit to the your opponent. Then we lost two games on 3-point shots that we
dominated. The game against Oklahoma State and you don't score for the last
30, and you're supposed to lose.  
And at Baylor, we played their butts off in front of a ton of people, and
another 3-pointer. One that we were playing good, and our opponents were
playing good, and we went back and said, "Hey, we've got to do something about
this or we're going to be in the WNIT or something like that."  
We didn't want it to happen. We were not that bad, our opponents were that
good in Jan. We put a run on in February, and now in March, that I will always
remember. Too many teams cave in when things are not going your way. This
coaching staff didn't. We went back more to the fundamentals of practice. We
did a good job and stayed with the few defensive drills and started doing them
better and better every day.  
As a result, when your defense gets better, isn't it funny how all of the
sudden your offense sort of picks up because it's the same kids playing both
ends?  
  
Q. (No microphone.) Considering the runs you guys have been on, are there
any limitations going into the tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: Every press release I get they put the thing in -- this is our
record against Texas in the last 58 years. I don't want to talk about that.
All of the sudden all our press releases talk about what we haven't done. I
want to talk about what we are doing, okay?  
History is good, but kids today don't want to know about what happened 5, 10,
15 years ago. We need to start from our era. Let's talk about what we're doing
under this regime, and I would like that. I'm sorry, your question again?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: We've had no fear. What have we lost, what, seven ballgames this
year? I would rather go back and play all of them, because we were in every
single game except the United States Olympic team that handed us our lunch,
and that was humble pie, baby! We thought we were ready to move our game up to
that next level, and maybe that told us a little bit what was happening in
nonconference play, that we were not as committed as we thought.  
People were patting us on the back too much and it took me and my good friend
here to do a little butt-kicking to get us back on the same page and I think
that's what happened to our team.  
  
Q. Coach, five years, where does tonight's win rank?  
COACH BLAIR: We followed the game plan, we executed our zone offense a whole
lot better than we did last year against G.W. and Iowa State. We're executing,
we had a lot of good looks, but this is it, cutting down the nets! It's more
special doing it in the tournament than doing it last year in the regular
season. That was special! All of America was watching! We're the last game in
town, just about, with all the major conferences.  
  
Q. Coach, last year you haven't played that well in the Big 12 tourney.
Heading into the NCAA's, how is that different this year?  
COACH BLAIR: I've got a better team. I have a coaching staff -- we can tell
you what they're going to do offensively and defensively. We know everything
about our team, and we can make the adjustments. We can see a mistake
happening before our team can actually go through it. I can see it on offense,
and he can see it on defense.  
And a lot of times we verbal coach, probably more so than any other coaching
staff in America, but it works for us. We might be the odd couple. He's odd
and I'm not, okay? (Chuckles.) But we're -- we work together, and it works.
Okay? It works.  
For all you A.D.'s out there, this is the best damn coach in America that has
not had a chance to coach a major, major program, and you've got about five
jobs open right now. I don't want to lose him, but, yes, I want to lose him,
because I would feel proud to see him take over a job and move it to the same
level that we've moved Arkansas and Texas A&M to. It's time for A.D.'s to
start hiring the most qualified person, okay? And this man needs a chance.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, best of luck and congratulations.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Oklahoma State coach, we'll let you make a
couple of opening comments.  
COACH BUDKE: We're very excited, obviously, as a program that's billed to be
playing in the championship game of the greatest conference of America right
now, the toughest conference of America.  
And we felt all year that we've been very consistent all year, if you look at
our scores compared to everybody else in the league. There were teams above us
that got blown out of some games and we were in every single game this year.
And we felt that consistency was because these kids have a lot of heart, a lot
of courage, they play defense, they do the little things that we have to do to
win.  
We've gotten better balance as we've gone along the way. Early on, it was
petty much Andrea and Danielle, but now Shaunte Smith is as important as
anybody on this team. And Taylor and M.C., all of them stepped up.  
I think the difference between us now and us in January is that we go out
every night and have three or four people in double figures. We know we're
playing a great team in Texas A&M, and probably the most talented team in the
league, but we're excited about it.  
  
Q. Andrea, you guys have had classic match-ups with them the last two years.
Is this what we should expect again?  
ANDREA RILEY: Yes. This game is going to be a battle, because every time --
seems like when we see them, maroon and white, it's like, oh, we got a battle
tonight. They're a great team and they're going to come out physical and we've
got to match their intensity.  
DANIELLE GREEN: It seems like we match up well against them every time. We
have some athletic players and it's going to be a fun game to watch,
competitive.  
SHAUNTE SMITH: I agree. Every time it goes down to the wire, and I think it's
a perfect match-up for us on Saturday.  
  
Q. Shaunte, as you sit on this stage, tomorrow playing for a major
championship, how far away does 6-22 seem today?  
SHAUNTE SMITH: It seems far but I mean, you know, we've worked hard as a team,
and I've worked hard as an individual and we've come a long way. Me and Taylor
have come a long way, and to be this far is a blessing and it's awesome.  
I couldn't do it without my teammates being here for me and Taylor and I'm
excited for the University and the team and the coaches.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the things that have happened getting into the NCAA,
getting into the top four seeds, getting into the tournament finals.  
DANIELLE GREEN: It's a big step.  
SHAUNTE SMITH: It's incredible. I couldn't have imagined going to the Big 12
championship. I'm excited and taking it all in and one day at a time and I'm
excited and blessed to be here.  
  
Q. Andrea, you guys are playing for a Big 12 championship. Do you feel like
there is more out there, maybe a seed and a chance to get to Oklahoma City
that you're playing for tomorrow night?  
ANDREA RILEY: I think we're proving that we are one of the top teams in the
country and we're not going to stop. We're not satisfied. We're going to go
out and play like we happen how to play as a team and try and get a Big 12
championship. And if that doesn't happen, then we'll try and go for an NCAA
championship.  
  
Q. Danielle, do you think you're playing for an added incentive other than
this championship?  
DANIELLE GREEN: Yes. We want to get to Oklahoma City but we just want to go
out and win the game. And we will take one step at a time and worry about that
after this game.  
  
Q. Shaunte, how tough was that the first year in the league and how
frustrating was it in practice, or did he keep it light-hearted?  
SHAUNTE SMITH: Honestly, it was tough, but I never stopped working and I knew
-- I'm confident now and I knew if we kept working, that eventually we could
get this far. You've just got to keep up, working hard all season, and
eventually I knew that I was going to be on a winning team. And that's why I
came here to be part of a winning team and help them build to what we are
today.  
  
Q. You guys called a team meeting about three weeks or a month ago. Tell us
what the mood was like then and how that compares to this weekend.  
SHAUNTE SMITH: I think the team meeting was a big step for us. As a team, I
think all of the team stepped up, the bench and the starting five. And I
believe at the team meeting, it was senior night, wasn't it?  
And we had that game against Baylor and OU and it's carried us to five wins in
a row and into the Big 12 championship. So Coach Budke had a good meeting, a
heart-to-heart and our team has heart and it shows on the floor.  
  
Q. Andrea, this is Texas A &M's payback tour. They've started out slow and
come on, but for you, the biggest is going to be on A'Quo Franklin, a battle
of the epic point guards, talk about that.   
ANDREA RILEY: Me and A'Quo, it seems like we've been playing against each
other forever, even though it's only been two years. Me and her want to lead
our teams. We're hard, competitive workers and we want to lead our teams to
victory. And it will be fun leading our teams out there.  
  
Q. Andrea, can you tell us what do you think the keys are tomorrow for you
to have success?  
ANDREA RILEY: The key is to play together and go out and play like we never
played before. Play hard, keep the intensity, hound them and just play with so
much heart.  
  
Q. Andrea, I think you said before that you chose OSU because you wanted to
build something, you know? What do you think of what has been built, what is
left out there for you all to get?  
ANDREA RILEY: I think they're amazing at what's happening right now because
it's just two years, and now we're playing for a Big 12 championship and we're
ranked in the top 20 in the country.  
I don't think people expected us to be where we are today, and that's why
we're so motivated and we play with intensity and heart and we believe we can
do it. Without anybody who believes in each other, we wouldn't be this
successful.  
  
Q. Players, talk about how important today is having it off, as far as being
able to get rested for tomorrow.  
DANIELLE GREEN: I think it's very important to settle our minds down and relax
and get ready for tomorrow. Our bodies are a little tired; this is a great day
to get ready, get our intensity back up, and it feels good to watch the guys.  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, the day off is great. Today we're going to get out there
and practice, because Coach always says it starts on the practice floor. We go
out and start sluggish, we don't want to do that. We want to go out and play a
hard 40 minutes to get to victory.  
  
Q. Andrea and Danielle, things got heated last night with Texas. You know
when you play Texas A &M it's the same thing, they're in your face defense.
How important is it to keep your composure and not lose your cool when you're
playing against them?   
ANDREA RILEY: I think we've gotten used to their pressure and know how to
handle it now. We have to keep our heads in the game and execute our offense
without letting their defense get to us. If we just play hard and just focus
on what we have to do, then we'll be fine.  
DANIELLE GREEN: Composed, and it's important for us not to get emotional in
the game and keep our heads, like she said. The coaches calming us down helps,
and that's about all.  
You face this pressure all year, they're not the only ones that pressure.
They're a great team, but Texas, everybody pressures and we're used to it and
we're ready to play.  
  
Q. Danielle, what made you want to come here from junior college, knowing
that they had struggled in the past, what sold you on the program?  
DANIELLE GREEN: Truthfully, the coaches. I didn't know the teammates, but I
knew two other junior college players that came here, and I just knew that --
I knew they weren't about losing and 0-16, you know, that was irrelevant
because they were just starting out.  
And I knew that they had faith in us and that's the bottom line. I knew it was
going to be a battle. Big 12 is the best conference in the nation, that that
is a lot of motivation, but coaches, you look in their eyes and you knew they
were ready.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we'll let you go.  
Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BUDKE: The batteries are charging as we speak. That's right.  
  
Q. Coach, just put it point blank, is there any hotter team right now in
college basketball than the one you're going to face in Texas A &M?   
COACH BUDKE: I think they're a legitimate Final Four team. I think they've got
what I see, at least, three pros on the team. They're the most talented six in
our conference.  
They're playing great basketball, they play great defense, they've got a hall
of fame coach, and we've got our work cut out for us. But saying all that
again, I don't think you'll find two teams in America that have played each
other closer over the last two years than us and A&M. I think it's a perfect
championship game, and you know what? We're going to show up.  
  
Q. Can you really overstate how much has happened to your program since
0-16?  
COACH BUDKE: That 0-16 year I've got to admit was pretty tough. It was tough
especially on my coaching staff because everybody I had on my staff were
winners. That's the biggest thing we wanted to do is go out and recruit
winners.  
I can't give my coaches enough credit for going out and finding players that
wanted to come and play for a team that finished dead last. But we want to
take baby steps every year. It's hard to take big leaps in the Big 12, but
it's almost like we have.  
You've got a team that's got a legitimate star and a bunch of kids that have
their nights that don't care about who gets the points that has probably the
best chemistry I've ever had in all my years of coaching, and they've been a
joy to work with. We're obviously very proud of their effort.  
We talk about it all the time, it's not just about us as individuals or us as
a team, we don't want to let down our fans, we don't want to let down our
alumni. And we're still trying to gain fans and support, and I think they
appreciate how these girls play, whether they win or lose, because they see
every night that we put it all out there on the floor.  
There will be a day I reflect back about this night, but it's not now. We have
places to go and we have goals and maybe 10 years from now, when I retire, I
will think about this more.  
  
Q. Coach, what happened between the two games, the one in Stillwater and the
one in College Station?  
COACH BUDKE: The biggest thing, we were 17-30 from the free-throw line, and we
had an opportunity to win that ballgame at home. It was very similar, the
girls said it, you've -- you can't let Texas A&M's pressure wear you out, and
you can't get soft and lazy because of their pressure and just throw passes
that you shouldn't be making.  
You've got to concentrate every possession against A&M, because they play
defense for every possession. So I really don't look for a high-scoring game.
I look for the same kind of battles that we've had for the last two years, and
you've got to do the little things to beat a team like A&M, and that starts
with free-throws that we missed in the second game.  
  
Q. At this point, how much do you think about a higher seed, the Ford
Center, those kinds of things that might be dangling out there.  
COACH BUDKE: Like Danielle said, we can't control the meetings that are going
on out there, but I think we've earned the Ford Center, and you have to win
two games to get back there and get a chance, but if we get to the Ford Center
-- get back there after winning two games, after winning two games in the NCAA
tournament, you'll see orange in that Ford Center like you've never seen.  
Three weeks ago, I wasn't sure we deserved it. I think we deserve it now. If
we go out and win a championship tomorrow night, I think we can increase our
seed another notch, too.  
  
Q. So you feel like maybe both y'all are playing for a higher seed, whether
it's a 2, 3, what have you, do you feel the winner gets that one more spot?  
COACH BUDKE: I really do, I really do. Like I said, I think A&M is a 3 seed
playing for a 2, and I think we're a 4 playing for a 3. A&M, again, one of the
hottest teams in the country, legitimate threat to get to the Final Four. He
should feel very good about how his team is playing right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you keep referring to the Texas A &M as a legitimate Final Four
team; are you guys a legitimate Final Four team?   
COACH BUDKE: We don't put a ceiling on this team and I know there are a lot of
people out there that don't think we are, but we honestly don't even look
ahead.  
I didn't know what time practice was today because we don't look past what's
at hand. This team can get hot and when our team has four people in double
figures, maybe five, we feel like we can play with a lot of people in this
nation.  
  
Q. How important is it to have your post players on their game tomorrow
night?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, I think -- it's obviously vital every night that we get
good production out of the post. I thought we had huge production from Megan
Byford last night. I thought she kind of came in and saved the day when Marina
got those two early fouls and I thought Richardson came in and held her own
off the bench.  
The post play against Texas A&M is important, but you better guard the guards
because if you leave it open for a second they're putting it in. You make a
mistake, they're scoring. That may be the best jump-shooting guard in America.  
She is so clutch, every time Iowa State made a run, it seemed like it was
Starks that would pop up and make a shot. They've got at least -- I'm going to
say they have four legitimate scoring threats out there at all times and very
tough team to guard. The post is important because we need to rebound and
defend the block, but we better find a way to stop those guards.  
  
Q. You think a 2 might be a little out of reach for you guys, even if you do
win?  
COACH BUDKE: Yes. If they wanted to give it to me, we'll take it, but I think
so. I've watched this for a lot of years, and I think if we can win this, I
truly think we could be a 3. And if we win, I think A&M is still a 3, but we
lose, I think it's a 4, no worse than a 5.  
  
Q. Replays last night showed Andrea popped a player in the head going for a
loose ball. It looked like extracurricular activity going on there. Has the
Big 12 said anything to you?  
COACH BUDKE: I have not seen it. I know it was a physical game last night, a
lot of pushing and shoving and a lot of emotion running, and we talk to our
kids about keeping their heads for 40 minutes. You don't have the right to
push somebody or hit somebody, and we'll look at it and we'll look at it with
Andrea, also. And Oklahoma State plays by the rules and whatever the
commissioner decides, we'll live with.  
  
Q. Let's talk bids in terms of the conference. Do you think it's a nine bid
year? Does Kansas -- do they need to be in that field?  
COACH BUDKE: I think Kansas is definitely one of the top 64 teams in this
nation. I think it will be tough to get nine, I think there is no question
there will be eight teams in the field.  
  
Q. It's kind of like "let the boys play," you and Gary have gone into the
two worst programs, do you see similarities in what you and Gary have done in
the south? Do you see similarities in what you have done and the way you've
done it? Can you talk about that?   
COACH BUDKE: We both came out of system that we want to pressure, we want to
run, we want to make the game exciting to watch. We don't have the athletes to
do what he is doing. He's doing exactly what he wants to do and there might be
a day we get to that point, but the one thing I've learned is you don't have
to have a team of stars to win.  
If you've got a team of kids that get along, have good chemistry, that
understands the roles, I think you can still be successful in the Big 12.
Believe me, there are a lot of teams in this league that are a lot more
talented than we are.  
  
Q. I know you wanted to bring this program along at the right pace. If there
is a knock on you guys out there, it's your nonconference schedule. Is it now
that you've gotten to this point, is that something that you think maybe
you'll upgrade? And is that why you don't think you're a 2?  
COACH BUDKE: I think that's probably part of the reason, but, again, we're
trying to build a program. And the day that I really feel like we can go out,
and maybe that day is coming.  
We're opening the year at Duke next year, is that good enough? I think that's
a decent start right there. (Chuckles.) But, again, it's the baby steps. Let's
get the nonconference a little bit better.  
You don't have to have a crazy nonconference schedule when your conference is
crazy. This conference, top to bottom, there is nothing close to it. You've
got to be careful. I've seen teams that don't have the best talent in the
world go out and build a great nonconference team, and they don't build
confidence at all.  
If you come into the Big 12, you're in trouble without confidence. That first
win we had at Kansas, you can look back at that as if you lose that, we might
not be sitting here tonight because things can change real quick.  
Came home with Oklahoma, you lose at Kansas, lose to Oklahoma, maybe you're
0-2 and everything changes. I think we're smart about our schedule and we're
going to continue to be smart.  
  
Q. If the Big 12 does issue a reprimand, how will you deal with it?  
COACH BUDKE: Like I said earlier, Lin, we play by the rules. We'll do whatever
the Big 12 wants us to do and learn from it and try not to make the same
mistake again.  
We show our players on film when they make mistakes on the floor, especially
on the emotional part of it. If they get too excited, if they react too much
to a call, if they talk to an official, we talk to them all the time about
that, but these are 19 and 20 year old kids that are playing a pretty intense
game and not being paid a million dollars a year for it. They're going to make
mistakes, and hopefully you don't make the same mistake twice.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas A&M University Coach Blair.  
Opening statements?  
COACH BLAIR: I'm speechless! (Chuckles.) I'm speechless, and I'm hungry and my
brother wants to go to the boats!  
The media that's here, I've been following all of y'all for a long time, like
y'all have been following us, and I appreciate all of you here, because you're
doing a great job of covering Big 12 women's basketball in the national scene.
And I really believe we're growing in stature on the national scene with these
Monday night games, but where is the Big 12? Hasn't been one, has there?  
You had OU and Georgia on a Sunday. So we can't keep promoting the same six or
seven schools, okay? But I appreciate what you're doing. What Beth and Debbie
are doing on their radio show is excellent.  
If y'all haven't listened to it, our fans of all 12 of our schools need to
listen to that show, they can pull it up on the computer. It's like an
encyclopedia of what's happening in women's basketball, and we do not have
enough national news to keep everybody informed. And hopefully the committees
that choose which 64 teams go into the tournament start listening to Beth and
Debbie and start reading some of y'all's stuff out there.  
I would like to thank the media for giving us the coverage. That is the
shortest opening statement I've had since last night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. A'Quonesia, talk about the battles you've had with Oklahoma State the
last two years and how fierce it's going to be tomorrow.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: It's going to be very fierce. Last year I believe we won
by a grand total of four points between the two -- both games combined, and
this year they came to our home, and Riley hit a great 3-point shot with four
or five seconds left on the clock.  
And we went down to Stillwater, it was a great battle, great competition, and
we tried to dissect the zone and we came up with a win.  
  
Q. A'Quo, Morenike, Coach Budke said you guys were a legitimate Final Four
team and fighting for No. 2 if you win this game. Talk about being in the
conference championship and really having something to play for besides the
conference championship.  
COACH BLAIR: This is the first time Texas A&M has been in the conference
championship game, and it means a lot to us. And playing Oklahoma State, which
is a great team, is going to be a good game tomorrow. We're just glad to be in
the championship game.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I would like to thank Coach Budke for the nice
compliment. We have to take one thing at a time. This is a great place to be,
and we haven't been here in my four years, and this is a great building
experience for us, gives us great momentum going into the further selection
committee that picks the 64 teams and however they seed us. We look for a No.
2 seed.  
  
Q. Y'all have been around the last few years when Baylor got all the
headlines, OU got all the attention. How personally satisfying is it for you
that now it's Texas A &M's turn to enjoy this and have a chance to be on top
of this thing?   
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: To me it's satisfying, but that shows how strong the Big 12
is.  
They can be in their first game, Oklahoma will be here in their first game, it
shows how strong the Big 12 is and what kind of talent the Big 12 has.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: It makes it -- not easier, but it makes it hard, because
you have to play each other twice, and it makes it difficult for us not to
beat each other out.  
  
Q. Mo, you had the injury problems earlier in the year. How tough was that
for you and when did you finally feel like you could go 100% and go all out?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I don't think I can pinpoint one game that I felt exactly
100%, because I don't think any athlete can say they we're 100%.  
My injuries have been hard for me because I've said this before, I've never
been injured, I've never been faced with any bone, muscle, any kind of
problems, and I've had the opportunity to be blessed and be injury-free, but
it's given me a great way to build my game and that's just been great to help
my team out any way that I could.  
  
Q. You guys had such a rough start to the Big 12 season. Was there any time
you guys were worried about pulling it together? Did you feel like the
chemistry would come together as the season went on?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I believe after the Nebraska game, after we lost on the
road, the Coach came into the locker room and the team got together and talked
about it and we were like, y'all, we've got to turn this around. We've got to
do what we did last year when we won the Big 12, and after that we went into
the gym and worked on the fundamentals, defense, offense, guard moves, post
moves.  
  
Q. Morenike, did you ever think that in your career after coming back from
an injury you would come off the bench and be the force you have been late in
the year? What do you think about that role?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I knew it because, first of all, I sat out and hoped that I
wouldn't have to have surgery. And once I decided that I wanted to, by that
time it was late in the season, and I knew I would be behind, but I knew I had
a lot of competition in front of me.  
Coach said, you know, you're going to have to fight for a starting position
again. And he told me that, and I could accept that because I knew we had
players that could step up and do the same thing that I did, so I've never had
a problem with the role that I'm playing. I'm just glad we're winning. If
we're winning, everyone is happy.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I think we are a better ball club and just the years of
experience has helped us. We're smarter, if we just -- you know, the last-
second plays, it's not so much the physicalness of the game, it's more mental
and how quick on our toes we are.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Also I believe that winning the last conference game gave
us momentum into the tournament.  
  
Q. Mo, with everybody you've been here, how much have you matured and grown
up?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I would like to think I have matured mentally a lot and
everything that I've gone through has made me a better person and a better
player.  
  
Q. Ladies, what's going to be the key tomorrow night? What's going to have
to happen for Texas A &M to win the game?   
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I would say our defense. That's what we live and die for
every game. We just know once we create pressure on the ball our offense will
naturally flow. Andrea Riley, great point guard, she is going to get her
points, and we have to make sure that everybody else doesn't go off --
basically our defense, we have to block out, score on easy opportunities.  
  
Q. Even though you guys have only played each other for two years, you and
Andrea, can you talk about the premiere point guards in the Big 12 going in
the championship head-to-head?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: It's great competition, and she was, like, "I love
playing against you because of the competition we have against each other,"
and it's like that with all the point guards in the league. Especially with me
and Tisdale, even though our playing against each other has been going on
since AAU; it's great competition between us.  
THE MODERATOR: Further questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: Riley was in the hundreds somewhere, so you've got the four best
point guards that have developed into great players and great leaders and they
have been rewarded by All-Big 12 performers. The All-Americans are still
waiting their turn to come in, but those four point guards in this league are
very, very special, and they should be given credit, and it just so happens
that the four teams are all our top four teams in the league right now.  
You wanted to know what the difference was? We played different styles better
this year than what we did last year, playing the GWs and the Iowa States, and
early on even when we lost to Wake Forest, we had to play different styles.  
We became a smarter basketball team, knowing how to adjust to a box-and-1,
triangle-and-2, denial man, jump defenses. We were not smart enough last year
to be able to do it on a consistent basis. I think that was -- A&M and
Oklahoma State, my first year I was 2-14 and was happy to be 2-14. Kurt was
0-16. Okay? I think that says a lot for these two programs, what we've done.  
I think both Kurt and I are good friends, and we're proud of that. What we've
done is we've turned the two doormats of the Big 12 -- it's not a worst-to-
first, like K State. They were at the bottom last year because of the injury
only; they're definitely not the 12th worst team last year, because Gibson was
out.  
We're proud of that. Then all of the sudden we're playing for the Big 12
championship. Both teams base in attendance has increased. No, it's not up
there in the top six either one of us right now, but it's hard to catch the
top six because of the tradition of what they've been doing over the years and
we're both trying to get there. I think that's one of the biggest stories is
the two programs and the direction that we're going.  
And both of us -- I might not be as good as Kurt -- Final Four teams? He said
that? Gosh, almighty, I guess I'm going to play Tiger in the Master's, too,
but I'd rather play Budke on the golf course, even up. But he always wants
strokes. He negotiates there.  
  
Q. Talk about Mo. Did you ever think that she would come off the bench and
be the valuable 6th man that she has been, especially after being a two-and-a-
half year starter and overcoming the injuries?  
COACH BLAIR: You become sometimes smarter sitting on the bench, or over on
that bicycle pedaling and seeing the game evolve and she's never had to do
that before because she's been on the floor all the way from high school to
college.  
All of the sudden it was easier for her to make that transition because her
best friend took her position, Danielle Gant. Okay? So they were able to
accept that and talk about it with no problem at all because -- I told Gant
even before Morenike had surgery, she was going to move into the starting
lineup, because she's been coming off her 2, and I wanted to change our style
of attack earlier in the ballgame, instead of doing what we did in the past.  
But Gant was going to go in that starting lineup for someone no matter if
Morenike was back or not. Morenike is a proud individual. She came from one of
the best high school programs in the country that you've never heard of,
Shreveport Southwood that's won 10 out of the last 12 state championships,
Alana Beard was there and won 3 of them, Morenike won 2.  
Now the guy is still wining and he doesn't have Division 1 players on there.
He teaches the game of fundamentals and teaches kids how to share, so it was
an easy transition for us. Morenike is going to be a next level player, and a
lot of those WNBA scouts left after the first two days, so they dent get a
chance to see Morenike, so hopefully they've got that tape on her to see that
ballgame of what she did against Texas, or whatever she played to get the 24
points, which she was better in that game than she was last night.  
Morenike has so many options. As a coach what you want for your players to be
able to make it in life with or without basketball. She will be able to make
it. She can go into modeling, she can go into health-related fields,
tremendous communicator. I don't think she could go into coaching; she is not
tough enough, okay? She's too pretty and she's too nice, but -- she couldn't
come into my profession, but she could go into a lot of other professions,
because she has compassion.  
The other thing that really got her off of that bicycle was Tyra White.
Because Tyra White, before she got hurt, was lighting it up in practice, and
Morenike was over there pedaling, seeing her career go down the tubes and she
was saying, "If I want to be able to compete and help my team this year, I
need to have that surgery," and finally she did, a little over two months too
late.  
But then it just so happened Tyra White blew her knew the first four minutes
of the ballgame while Mo was in rehab after the surgery.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: I like the Green/Gant match-up more, because Green is more
offensive minded and Shaunte is more defensive minded and a great rebounder.
Reado guarding Smith and Danielle Green going against Gant will be the two
best match-ups. They can flip it up, switch it up or switch on our screens,
and we can see the same thing, but I think those will be the two key match-ups
in the game, not Riley and A'Quo; they're both going to do their thing, okay,
not Starks and Hardeman, because Hardeman is going to jump in her face and
play total denial just like everybody else; not Cordero and Micheaux.  
It will be decided at the 3-4 position, and I think it's going to be a great
match-up, which of those four players can stay out of foul trouble and help
their team out on the boards and defense and scoring.  
  
Q. Morenike has in the last couple of games -- the Baylor game and the game
last night, she has stepped up. How much is that being a senior and taking
over?  
COACH BLAIR: Mo coming off the bench is like having Gant come off the bench in
the last two years. I've had a lot of luxury, and hopefully I'll have the same
thing next year with a couple of kids coming in. To play our system and style
you have to have a 6th or a 7th man.  
Sometimes it's better to not start your best five, to be able to bring in a
kid that can give you that instant fire power. Jerry Stackhouse of the
Mavricks, he was playing good -- he's playing with Flip right now -- don't put
that down.  
That's a key; can you accept that role, because there are so many kids and
parents and AAU coaches and high school coaches that cannot accept that role
for their kid. I've got kids that will accept that role, and that's why
they're at A&M.  
  
Q. How about her reason to play?  
COACH BLAIR: It's getting better, because she has struggled in January, and we
could see it in February in practice, but it didn't translate into the games.
All of the sudden with about three games to go in conference, light switch
went on, and instead of her dribbling at her side and not going anywhere, all
of the sudden she looked like a deer going across the -- going through the
fields.  
She used to bounce that ball to her side and she would take three dribbles to
get to him. Okay? And the ball would be there, and she would be so hesitant. I
said "Mo, flow!" And we would go over it and over it and over it. And that's
the only thing she needs to work on to be the next-level player is her ball
handling, and it sure has gotten better in the last couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Gary, what do you think is at stake seedwise?  
COACH BLAIR: Correct me, I'm being dumb here, I was writing this down,
Michelle will have the answers here. Connecticut, Tennessee, LSU, Rutgers, is
that who you got in the first?  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: North Carolina.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: Okay, I forgot -- that was the other one I was looking for: North
Carolina, Connecticut, Tennessee and LSU. That would be mine, and I would go
down Rutgers, Maryland, Stanford and whoever wins the game tomorrow, okay?  
Whoever wins the game tomorrow. Because you've got to look at it -- it would
be a 2-1 split no matter who wins. Even though our RPI is better and all that
stuff, they're not going to give me a 2 if I lose.  
Whoever wins the game I think is playing for a 2, which would be better for
the league. If I got a 2 and I lose tomorrow, I'd feel a little bad, because
we hadn't earned it. I'll take it, but at the same time, I think that's what
we're playing for. And I think Kurt and I would be very open before the
tournament started, you're look at three other teams that were playing for
that 2 that were not Oklahoma State and A&M.  
It was Kansas State and Baylor and Oklahoma and -- even possible if they would
have run the table like they have before. But the Big 12 should be rewarded
for its body of work over the year. If you had the No. 1 RPI, then whoever
wins this, unless it would have been Missouri or Texas or somebody like that
who came up from the bottom, should be rewarded that No. 2 seed.  
Now what's going to happen with the 3, 4, 5s, where everybody else is going to
go -- the team that has improved itself the most here has probably been Texas,
and Iowa State right behind there. Oklahoma is probably going to drop to a 5,
Baylor will hold at a 4 and K State -- I hope they're not penalized because of
the injury- - and is it an ACL?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: Okay. And hopefully they won't be penalized because they're our
conference champion, and they shouldn't be penalized because they played in
one of the greatest ballgames that's ever been played in Big 12 conference
history. They happened to be on the losing end of a ball going around the rim
two or three times. That was tough!  
  
Q. As you sit here today, we're talking about No. 2 seeds and tournament
championships, and you guys were the reigning Big 12 champs. In the past two
years do you look back at the win at OU as y'all's big break-through moment?  
COACH BLAIR: That was the biggest road win I've ever had, anytime, anywhere,
me personally and also for our program. We did it in front of 12,500, came
from behind -- it was a tremendous feeling; we earned it and we deserved it.  
The win at Texas this year late in the season was pretty doggone good, and
Oklahoma State, second game was pretty good. It's just been a year of -- maybe
we were not ready at the first of the year for the so-called eliteness that is
coming our way right now. We didn't work hard enough during the summer.  
We didn't work hard enough during the preseason. We were sitting and getting
our pats on the back, but -- and in this game of basketball or any other sport
you better work 12 months a year and keep that attitude about you. We did not
do it on a consistent basis. That's my fault as a head coach.  
Too many times our kids were complaining about we were too hard on them in
October, getting ready, and I think that carried on. As a result by us finally
getting them to understand what work hard is all about, it's coming so much
easier now, practices -- we can go just as hard, and kids say, "Hey, that's
nothing, let's go a little longer, 20 minutes longer."  
But earlier in the year we were fighting ourselves as much as how hard we
wanted to work to be at the top. We didn't know how to spell those names,
North Carolina, Connecticut, Tennessee, LSU, Rutgers, Maryland and Stanford,
and here we were told at the first of the year by the media and the coaches
that we were one of those, along with Baylor and Oklahoma. But Baylor and
Oklahoma have lived in that eliteness a little longer than we have, and we
were not ready, but I think we are now.  
  
Q. Did you have any doubts when you had that rough beginning in the
conference season? Did you have any doubts that you guys would be able to get
it back together? And if you could give us an update with Tyra White, being a
Kansas City kid, an update on the her progress and how much you think she can
impact your team next year.  
COACH BLAIR: You wanted to know when we were 1-4 -- we were 1-4, we got beat
fair and square at home by K State. We got beat by a 3-point shot on the road
against Baylor, which we were leading by 2. That hurt, but we knew we played
well. We went up to Colorado, which might have been the turning point in our
season because we were down 10 with 9 to go, and I put Colson in the ballgame
just to try something, and all of the sudden it worked.  
Then we lost at Nebraska fair and square. They played well. Then we went home
and led the whole way against Oklahoma State and didn't score the last 6:30 in
the ballgame, and it wasn't Riley's 3-point shot; it was us and our inability
to score in the last 6:30. And they were not scoring every possession.  
Our season turned around when we went into the locker room and we looked at
ourselves and we had no one to blame but ourselves. And that was the most
important thing that our kids could come together on, and they realized it was
going to be humble pie. We gotta get it together quick.  
The WNIT is an option, but has there ever been a conference champion having to
go from being a conference champion going to the WNIT? Don't worry, I'm the
only team that's gone from the Final Four to winning the WNIT the next year,
and that was at Arkansas last year, but I had an injury that year.  
That's the main thing, Michelle, we did not point fingers, we looked at it --
and I said, "I'm not going to change lineups, or drills, we're going to go
back to fundamentals in both our warm-up drills and defensive drills and all
we're going to do is play hard."  
Because we can slide right back under that radar that we were under, that
radar last year when we were beating OU and Baylor and all that, and we
handled that very well. Now we're back up on the top. I think we answered a
little bit of that when we were able to beat Iowa State yesterday. We can
handle success that last year we were not ready for.  
As you know, we did not play well in the Big 12 tournament here last year, the
year before that, or in the NCAA either year. But I think we've grown up a
lot, and I think we're a little bit more mature. Hopefully I'm a better coach,
and our kids are a year older and hungrier. They would like to see what those
names of those teams are there and what they're all about, because we get to
see them every Monday night on TV.  
All of the sudden it's not like -- in the NBA -- in the NBA we're going to see
all the great West Division teams play. You're not going to get to see
Milwaukee play somebody or somebody like that; you're going to see the best of
the best. So if you see it every Monday night, you're going to say, "What is
it going to take for you to get to that level, maturitywise and then out there
on the court?"  
Tyra White? She was a homesick kid early in the year, but she's gotten over
that. You always get over homesickness if you're playing and playing a lot of
minutes. But she's had to learn how to handle the academics. She is doing very
well with the tutors that go on the road with us and everything like that. The
kids are taking her under their wings, and Sydney Colson and Maryann Baker are
two roommates, and they refuse to let a kid get homesick, because they're two
Texas kids, they're the life of the party every time, and they have great
personalities.  
She is going to be an impact player for us, period. She is a 6-foot T.K.
Starks, and that's exactly what she is. She can just shoot the ball. She's
going through her strength and conditioning, I let her get in the a 3-point
shooting contest at the end, and her team, which is my second team, beat our
first team in the 3-point shooting contest. She's just enjoying life, 18 years
old, trying to find her way through, but she will be an impact player for us,
either at the 2 or the 3 position.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we appreciate your comments. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, congratulations to Texas A&M. They may be one of
the best teams in the country right now. They'll do a great job in the NCAA
tournament.  
On behalf of our team and everyone associated with Iowa State, I want to thank
the people from Kansas City for a great event. It was an honor to be a part of
it and I think our players and fans made this more special than it would have
been otherwise.  
We thank everyone in the Big 12 office and hopefully like we've done in the
past, Iowa State did some positive things for the tournament.  
  
Q. The first 6 or 7 minutes when they went up, that was the difference. What
made it so tough to go against them in the first few minutes and what did you
do to get back in the game?  
ALISON LACEY: The trap is good, we had trouble getting it up. The defense
wasn't there. Once again, they're a good team, nerves as well, and they came
out strong and we were ready to bounce back and they came out again ready to
go.  
  
Q. Alison, can you talk about whether the team was feeling fatigued? You
guys get tired playing three games in three days, especially in overtime
yesterday?  
ALISON LACEY: I don't think you can put it on fatigue. We would have been
practicing anyway, and I think everyone would rather play than practice. I
don't think you can -- you're in the semifinals, for what you're playing for,
you can't blame it on fatigue, you forget about it and you keep playing
through it.  
  
Q. Amanda, what got your team back into the end of the first half and the
second half?  
AMANDA NISLEIT: We were struggling with defense, and we paid more attention to
detail. We got a couple of big shots and we were able to hit some open looks.  
  
Q. Alison, when you cut it to 41-36, how were you feeling at that time? Did
you feel like you had the momentum at that point?  
ALISON LACEY: You feel good, you hit shots. The crowd is into it, it's so loud
in there, you know, I'm sure A&M is feeling pressured and we've got to thank
the fans for supporting us. It was just like Hilton, and they helped us get
back into the game. Thank you to the fans again.  
  
Q. Alison, when you play a team as physical and strong as Texas A &M, how do
you attack that? What's your philosophy?   
ALISON LACEY: They're physical, they're bigger, they're stronger, you can't
step back from that. Attack pressure with pressure, I think, so you're -- I
think the biggest thing with us, we did a good job of rebounding, a lot better
than last time we played them. And our posts boxed out, so we can't stand down
just because they're more physical than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, talk about the technical, have you ever gotten one
that early in your career and look at the big picture of what happens to you
guys beyond this tournament?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think I've gotten one earlier in a home game against
Missouri, I think. I'm not positive. As far as going on, we'll find out like a
lot of other teams on Monday night if we're still playing.  
I think our team is worthy of consideration and we've done a lot of good
things, won a lot of games and played a great schedule, best league in the
country. I think this tournament shows the capability of our team. So we would
love to play again and love to coach our team again and love to have another
opportunity to play and represent Iowa State and the Big 12 in the NCAA
tournament.  
That's why you do what you do, so we'll sit on pins and needles Monday night
and hopefully St. Patrick's Day will bring us a little luck!  
  
Q. Bill, talk about the physical nature of Texas A &M, and early on it
didn't look like the kids were ready for that; it didn't respond as well as
you hoped.   
COACH FENNELLY: They're a great defensive team. Obviously you can't simulate
that in practice. We didn't do much today in practice. You know, it's nothing
that we weren't prepared for, it's hard to go against it.  
You know, I thought Joce did a good job of trying to break down pressure and
get the ball to people. You have to make a few more free-throws when you get
the chance and a couple more open 3's and get consecutive plays.  
We would get it to 5 and they would come down and make a 3 on us. You have to
have consecutive plays when you're playing good teams and to the kids' credit,
we're down 17 and it looks like they're going to blow us out of the building,
and we make it a game again and I'm proud of them for that. They're a great
defensive team. I think they've done this to a lot of people and it's hard to
score on them, very hard.  
  
Q. You kind of touched upon what I was going to ask, but is it that defense
that really makes 'em so tough? Are you surprised that they had as much
offense early on that kind of got 'em there, too?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think they're a team that relies on pressure defense and
taking you out of stuff, and they're very good at it. Offensively, A'Quonesia
made shots, and Starks is a first-team all-conference player, so it's not like
you're surprised by it, but offensively they were much more efficient. When we
made a defensive mistake, they made a shot.  
And that's part of the reason we got down and got flustered, and that feeds
their defense even more. When they get balanced scoring like they had tonight,
and defend like they do, they're tough to beat. I think that's why they've won
11 out of 12 games. And there might not be a team in the country playing as
well as they are right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys didn't get the ultimate goal of winning the whole thing,
but how proud of your kids are you, the way they've played in the last three
days?  
COACH FENNELLY: I'm not smart enough to put it in words how proud I am of
them. Not just for what happened this week, but I think this tournament
crystallized for people, what they've done and what they've been through to
get to this position.  
When you look at the things that have happened and the excuses that could have
been made by our players, never happened. And now we're in a position where we
played three great games against three great teams. But a lot of other people
got to see it -- people in Ames have seen it all year, but a lot of other
people got to see it today. We're proud of them and pleased that they showed
the courage that they have all year in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously A &M is going to try to take Ezell out of the game,
given what she's done the past couple of games. Were you happy with the looks
she was able to get?   
COACH FENNELLY: She went 2 for 9 and there was a couple of them that -- I
would say probably 6 of them I thought she had good looks at it, couple times
they rushed her and got up into her.  
For the most part, I would say a lot of them -- we would tell them to shoot
them again, I guess, would be the best way to answer that question. You know,
that's the thing that we do and it got us into this game, making those shots.
Didn't make enough of them tonight, but Heather was 2 for 9 tonight but
certainly without her, we wouldn't be sitting here talking to you.  
So I'm proud of her that she kept shooting them, that's the thing I'm the most
proud of, she didn't recoil and give the ball to someone else. She wanted that
responsibility and that says a lot about her and how much she cares about her
teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Carla Cortijo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16967)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Brittainey Raven](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18078)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Goestenkors and her two players. And
your thoughts about tonight's game, Coach?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Well, I give congratulations to Oklahoma State. I thought
they played an excellent game. Particularly in the first half. They did what
they needed to do to win. They dominated us on the boards, and they had really
a complete team effort. So congratulations go out to them.  
As far as my team, just a little frustrated once again; didn't start off the
game the way we would like to. Quick shots on offense, and defensively our
transition was not good; they got some quick early buckets. Then again, we
came back in the second half, so I'm proud of our effort in the second half.
However, I would like for us to put 40 minutes together.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. Carla, can you talk about the last minute and that last shot. Is that
what you were looking for?  
CARLA CORTIJO: Right. It was five seconds left and we were down by 3, so that
was the only shot -- we had to take it and nobody else was open, so I just
took that shot. I was pretty confident, but, I mean, I didn't make it.  
  
Q. The charging call, how did you see that?  
CARLA CORTIJO: I leave that to the refs. I mean, there is nothing I can do
about that, you know. But, I mean, I thought that wasn't a charge. The refs
made the call; there is nothing else you can do.  
  
Q. Brittainey, after what you guys did yesterday, why do you think you guys
didn't come out with a good start like Coach said?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I think it has to do with maybe our focus. I mean, we were
amped up, ready to play, but when we got out there, we got rattled by taking a
few quick shots and Oklahoma State did well in transition and they rattled us
and once again we got into a slump and yesterday we were fortunate enough to
come back and get the win but today we couldn't. Get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Best of luck. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Gail, so much was made about Andrea and all the things she does for good
reason, but when you look at them as a team who are the players that you
target in on? Did they do what your scouting report said they would do?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: They certainly did. And like I said earlier, I think the
difference between them the first time we played and the second time and now,
they're a different team.  
The last two times we played, other players are now stepping forward for them,
and I feel like they're playing their role perfectly. We know what Green does,
she goes left, and she did that all night long. We know Smith is an
outstanding rebounder. She had 17 last time on us and 16 tonight. We know
their strengths, and they're a tough team to stop when they're all playing
their rolls very, very well. This is not just about one person anymore.  
  
Q. You have to feel like your team, even though maybe you have not had
complete games, is way better than a 7-9 team. You guys are as good as any
team in the NCAA now. Do you feel like you can make a mark in the upcoming
tournament?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I definitely think we can. It's going to be about match-
ups. There will be teams that we'll match-up well against, and take advantage
of our athleticism and others we won't match-up with, but I think we've built
confidence up over the last couple of weeks and we can go against anybody.  
  
Q. In this run that you've had, even though you wanted to put a couple of
games together, still there is something different about this team that's
allowed it to get to this point. What is that?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think we're learning to play with a lot of confidence and
show some character. I think when we step on the floor, we expect to win and
that's always been my attitude. I.  
Don't care who we're playing or where we're playing, I expect to win, and I
think our team has begun to have that type of mentality as well. We're
becoming a tougher team, a mentally and physically tougher team than we were a
couple of months ago when we couldn't win on the road. The little things where
you've got to be tougher to win, and I think we've grown a lot in that
respect.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough is this loss for you and what do you guys have to get
fixed for the NCAA?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It's a really difficult loss. I told the team after the
game, if we had played our best basketball, I would be patting them on the
back win or loose. But when we watch the videotape, they're going to see that
there are so many little things that we did not do and we could have done and
we would still be playing in the tournament. When you know you could win, that
makes it much more difficult.  
  
Q. You talk about toughness. Could you talk specifically about Carla?
Because I know that's something you needed more of her, and it seems like in
the last couple weeks she has turned into more of a leader for you.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: She really has, and I think the A&M game, that was our
lowest point as an individual for her and as a group. And she stepped forward
for us, and I let her make more calls now and I put more trust in her. I think
she responded.  
In the game yesterday, I felt like she would not let us lose. And in the first
half she tried as much as she could to keep us in the game. So that kind of
passion and desire, I think, is contagious and she's come a long way. So I'm
hoping some of the other players will respond as well.  
  
Q. Gail, can you talk about Earne fouling out and how that changed the
complex of the game?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I told Earne, we pick up silly fouls early in the game, and
she has done it on several occasions now. And she is one of our warriors and
she has done some great things on the boards for us, and she is one of our
smartest players, and we have to have her out on the floor.  
She is going to pick up fouls because she is an undersized post. She can't
afford to pick up unnecessary fouls.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Danielle Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16925)

### [Andrea Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16924)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game, and if you'll make a
few quick comments.  
COACH BUDKE: Well, Andrea wanted me to say she had 6 rebounds, so I'll get
that out of the way. You know, again, people keep doubting these girls, people
keep doubting the talent on this team and how far we can go.  
We beat a very good team tonight. I think Texas is one of the hottest teams in
the country, and they're well coached. Like we said, no one is going to want
to face them in the NCAA tournament when they see their name on the bracket
because they're a tough team to play and they don't go away.  
They're talented, and I'm so proud because there was a time where we could
have folded tonight and we didn't. We found a way to get it done, and that's
kinda what we've been doing all year long. We've had amazing wins this year
because of the courage and the heart of these young ladies. Now we get to play
in the Big 12 championship, so we're very excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. You guys have had some games this year where you built big leads and
you've had teams come back on you, most notably Nebraska. Did you draw on that
experience? Talk about that.  
DANIELLE GREEN: No, we just remembered how it felt when teams came back on us
and we did fold. Texas A&M we had a lot of games like that and Coach kept
saying, "Don't quit. Get this. Stop, we don't look ahead." We would get the
defensive stop and get the next possession. That helped us a lot because it
helped us focus on one thing at a time.  
  
Q. Danielle, I don't know if you've ever made a better play than the assist
to Andrea when you were flat on your back.  
DANIELLE GREEN: That was an amazing play. I thank God she hit it.  
COACH BUDKE: We work on that play.  
DANIELLE GREEN: Yeah, Coach drew it up. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Andrea, so much has been made about the things that you've been able to
do this year. This is the type of game that proves y'all are more than one
player, aren't you?  
ANDREA RILEY: It proves a lot. We've had a couple of games that five and six
people have been in double figures and we've been very successful with that. I
think if we have five or six people or three people in double figures, I think
we will continue to be successful because that means we're playing together.  
  
Q. Danielle, I understand that you were wearing your shorts backwards. Do
you plan on using that in the future?  
DANIELLE GREEN: No, I don't. I didn't realize that until my teammates told me.
No, I didn't.  
COACH BUDKE: She's got no choice, she's going to have to do that. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Talk about Shaunte Smith. She didn't shoot the ball well but took a
couple of charges and hit a couple of big shots!  
ANDREA RILEY: Shaunte Smith. Every time we need a big play, she steps up. If
it's not me or Danielle or Maria, it's her. That's what makes our team so
dangerous, because we have a lot of weapons and we keep the focus and we keep
our intensity and we have so much heart.  
DANIELLE GREEN: Her intensity isn't based on whether she scores or not, it's
just that she's in the game, period. That's what we feed off every night.  
How about that block by Maria Cordero? She don't get enough credit either.
She's our leader, she keeps us fired up, and I'm proud of her.  
  
Q. Would you take us through the final seconds of the game and Cortijo's
shot. Did you expect her to take that? Was that the play that you thought
Texas would run, and how you set up to play in the final seconds?  
ANDREA RILEY: Cortijo is hot right now, and she's the leader. They have a lot
of confidence in her, so we knew she would take the shot. And Maria stayed
with her because she is a guard. And even though Maria is a 6-3 post, she had
the mental toughness to say, "I'm not going to let her beat us."  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, ladies.  
Questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Did you talk to the team about how aware you had to be of Texas coming
back and their ability to come back?  
COACH BUDKE: Oh, yeah. We spent a lot of time talking about that. They're
talented and athletic, and if you can do what they did last night against
Baylor, they can surely do it against us.  
We did talk about it at halftime, and there was a point in time in that game
where you could have folded. You could have really let them make a bigger run
than they did, and we found a way to get it stopped. Very proud; Texas is a
very good team.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense on Lindsey tonight. She had 18 and 10 in
Stillwater and didn't come close to those numbers tonight.  
COACH BUDKE: We just wanted to get her out of her comfort zone. She is one of
the most improved players in the league. Last time we let her get too deep on
us, and that was the game plan, try to get her 2 feet beyond where she was
last time.  
I thought the girls did a good job of making contact and holding it with her
and making her shoot a 10-footer instead of a 6-footer.  
  
Q. If someone told you two years ago that you were going to be playing in
the Big 12 championship game Saturday night, would you have thought they were
crazy?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, I mean, we've -- sure, probably. (Chuckles.) We've never
put a ceiling on this team. We've recruited winners and recruited kids that
people in this league didn't want.  
We have a legitimate star. A lot of people that are role players that accept
the role that it doesn't matter -- just like Danielle said, it doesn't matter
if Shaunte scores 2 points or not, she is going to outwork everybody on the
floor. You look down and she has 16 rebounds.  
We are not the most talented team in the Big 12 or in this country, but we
play together and we have chemistry, and that's huge this time of year.  
  
Q. How big was it for you when Erneisha Williams fouled out for Texas?  
COACH BUDKE: We do a good job of getting people in foul trouble, because the
offense is set so that we attack with. And that was a goal, to try to get
certain people in foul trouble.  
She's a great player and having her on the bench -- last night we got McCray
and Boogaard in foul trouble and that's part of the game plan. Credit the
girls for getting that done.  
  
Q. What did Texas do to make their comeback and what did you do to adjust to
their flurry?  
COACH BUDKE: I think they had more energy than us. They didn't do really
anything different, and we just weren't -- we didn't quite have the hustle in
our step that we needed and the toughness that we needed.  
We were letting Cortijo dribble up and shoot a 3, didn't get back on a made
bucket and gave up the left. Those are things that we're normally good at
covering. We called time out, grabbed the girls' attention.  
You just get them refocused again that there is a long way to go in this game.
This is one of many runs they're going to make, so did you want to play in the
championship game or not, because if you do, you've got to get a little
tougher right now, and they responded.  
  
Q. Talking about the role players; people like Maria and Megan didn't have a
lot of stats, but they clogged the zone and made it hard for Lindsey to get
into the paint. Talk about that.  
COACH BUDKE: I thought Megan was huge tonight with Maria getting those fouls.
I thought she played one of her best games. The girl is a sophomore. She is
going to have big minutes for us before her career is over.  
Alex Richardson came off and held her own in there and got a couple of
rebounds and played good defense, also. We talk about it all the time with our
girls, you never know when your number is going to be called.  
Prepare like you're going to play 40 minutes every night. No one outworks
Megan Byford, so she plays like she is going to play 40 minutes, and she
played like that tonight.  
  
Q. Sometimes little things, Shaunte Smith stands in there and takes a
charge. Talk about that play and how it changed the --  
COACH BUDKE: She's the one that does it. She does the little things like that
that help us win games. You've got to be able to make a play like that.  
We say in timeouts, hey, someone has to step up and make a play if we're going
to win this game. Just like Danielle making the pass to Andrea for the 3 and
hitting that shot; Shaunte taking the charge; Maria with the big block. There
are so many times in a game where it's your time to step up, you need to come
through, and I thought that charge was obviously huge.  
  
Q. Talk about Texas A &M a little bit. You guys have had some classic match-
ups with them the last two years.   
COACH BUDKE: I doubt there are two teams in America that have played each
other tougher or closer in the last two years than A&M. I think they are the
best team in this conference right now.  
They're defending champions. They're playing better than anybody else in the
country, and I think they have a legitimate chance to get to the Final Four. I
love their weapons and their team. We seem to find a way to come out and
battle them, and we'll find a way Saturday.  
  
Q. Alluding to that, you said people have been doubting your team all year.
Why do you not doubt them and go into a championship with them Saturday?  
COACH BUDKE: The first thing is the coaches have to believe in themselves,
their teammates. The coaches have to believe in them and our coaching staff
believes we're going to find a way.  
We're going to show up Saturday and compete for 40 minutes. And besides
Andrea, someone is going to come through. Danielle Green was huge tonight. She
looked like an all Big 12 performer that she probably should have been. So
it's just -- you know, this team's chemistry, coaches and players right now is
at an unbelievable level, and we'll bring it Saturday.  
  
Q. Is there a point that you focus on, or maybe two points in the next 48
hours that you want to make sure you get accomplished with your team, to have
them ready for a Saturday game with this day off?  
COACH BUDKE: Rest. Y'all, just rest. We don't play a lot of people, as you
see. We've got to get some dead legs some rest right here. A&M, their two
games weren't probably as competitive as our two games were, and I think
they're fresh and ready to go, so I think the biggest thing is rest.  
There are no mysteries right now. We know what we're going to do. We know what
they're going to do. We're going to support our boys tomorrow and hopefully
they can get a win, watch tape, have a shoot-around and hopefully come out
Saturday with enough legs to get it done.  
  
Q. You kind of halfway answered it, but with the off day tomorrow and
playing on Saturday, would you rather be playing 3 straight days or do you
like the day off before the championship game?  
COACH BUDKE: We need a day off. Andrea doesn't come out of the game, she gets
beat up and knocked down and body checked; she needs some rest and we all do.
I think it makes for a better championship game when both teams get one day of
rest.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much, congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2008

  

### [Morenike Atunrase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13854)

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Takia Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16383)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Blair from Texas A&M and Takia Starks.
Morenike is behind us.  
Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: We wanted to press for 10 minutes and see where we were, had a
game plan early and we couldn't have gone at that pace for 40 minutes, didn't
matter what the score is because this is a three to four-day tournament. You
hit and miss on the press.  
What you want to do is take Iowa State a little bit out of their offense. They
can get very comfortable when they start running their double screens and
flare screens like they did yesterday against Kansas State. That was one of
the best basketball games I've seen this year, period, men or women.  
Both teams should be given a lot of credit, but there's a lot of different
ways to play the game. A lot of people say, "My gosh, you're too physical,
you're too rough." Folks, you want to go play Tennessee, Connecticut, Rutgers,
welcome to the big leagues! If you want to have a chance to go on to the WNBA,
you better be able to play a little bit physical.  
That's what we have to do. That can win for you. Defense can win for you.
These kids are beautiful shooters, too, and they're able to fit into Iowa
State's offense because they can shoot the ball off screens, too. What
separates these kids and a lot of other kids, we will play defense -- defense
first, offense second and rebounds third. Can you get parents to sit there and
realize there is a right side of the stat sheet, not just the left side that
says "points"?  
How about defections, charges, how about assists, how about all those little
things? This is what we're made of, this is the way I've been playing for many
years. I'm proud of the girls, and I'm proud of the effort, but I'm also proud
of Iowa State for how they came back in the second half and really the last
three minutes of the first half.  
It could have been blown up to 20, but Lacey did a heck of a job running her
ball club. We shutdown Ezell in the first half with a lot of help and a lot of
good switching. But Ezell hit a couple in the second half. Lacey kept them in
the ballgame and give that kid a lot of credit.  
Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take our student athlete questions first.  
  
Q. For both the athletes, when they made their run early on, can y'all talk
about Takia, you stepping up and hitting the 3 and Mo, I think you hit three
straight shots.  
TAKIA STARKS: We made our run, and in this tournament, it's a game of runs.
And in our league, it's a game of runs, and we had ours and they made theirs.
We just had to hold on to our lead as much as we could, and we knew they were
going to hit shots and we had to come afterwards and make shots, too.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: As for my shots, I knew Takia would hit herself. And when
she hits those, she's deadly. She drained them.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the importance of finishing the job Saturday,
regardless of what shows up? How important is it for this team and program to
clinch a tournament championship?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: It's important to us. This is a place we haven't been in my
four years here, so we're excited to be there, but we have to be mentally
prepared. Yesterday we only had one day to prepare, a few hours and we did
good. I think we were focused. I think it's the same way we have to go into
the championship game, whoever we face.  
TAKIA STARKS: It's the same for me; two years in a row we missed the boat.
This year we're here, and just like Mo said, with the amount of time you have
to prepare, we have a day for whoever wins and whoever shows up to play.
They're going to get a good game.  
  
Q. Morenike, I know you had frustration due to injury. Would you say that
your play has been related to health? I know you had problems in your feet and
legs a little bit. Could you comment?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Yes, sir. Every athlete has their ups and downs. And with
me, all of mine came at one time. This is the first time I've had to face
injuries. I have never been injured my entire career, and my coach kept me on
my toes about being focused and doing little things, not just rebounding, but
doing the little things. So I was just -- I did a good job of that.  
  
Q. T.K., they came out with the box, and one that gave you trouble. And what
was different about that tonight? You seemed to get more shots tonight.  
TAKIA STARKS: Tonight, me and Coach had a talk about the great game, and he
was saying they were going to be 1-3 like last time. And this time, I kept
moving and a couple of times I rested, but keep moving and taking whatever
screen and whatever crease in the defense I had, and just try to take my time
and hit the shots when I was open.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
COACH BLAIR: The 1-3 was a diamond, and our 1-3 zone is a chaser for you
football people.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the final championship, the importance of the
program, College Station?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's huge. We're growing as a town, as a program. We'll
be in our new practice facilities next year. There will not be anything like
that in the Big 12, and we've had a long way to go from being a football
school or a soccer school or some of our other sports, but we're growing in
everything.  
That's the commitment from Bill Byrne and the University. He is more valuable
than a lot of us coaches, I'll tell you that right now. Nebraska didn't know
what they had when they had him. He is a special man, has a great vision.  
He gives us the toys to do what we need to do, and we get out and we recruit
and do it mainly with Texas kids and we'll branch out and steal a kid from
Oklahoma or Florida or somewhere else, but there is enough talent in Texas to
stay there.  
I think when you start looking at the teams, they're playing after us. Reilly
is from Texas, and a number of their other kids, Hernandez, it's just a lot of
people in this state that want to play good, high quality women's basketball.
I think it's very special -- I've never been in a championship game except at
Steven F. Austin. Last one was in 1993.  
They didn't invite me; Tennessee, Georgia or Vanderbilt usually had it, so I
never got to that ballgame. It's new territory for me, and I'm excited just as
a kid.  
  
Q. You held Ezell scoreless in the first half. How important was it for her
not to get into a rhythm tonight?  
COACH BLAIR: Huge. What a performance the last two ballgames. The kid is
quality. Coach Schaefer has so much respect for her because she played on the
Jones Cup Team that Athletes in Action sponsored this summer. What a class
young lady, along with six other kids from the Big 12 conference.  
He had so much respect; he kept drilling it and drilling it in their heads,
this is who you have to stop. She wasn't getting open 3's. They probably
didn't give Gant that one block in front of our bench in the first half.  
I don't know if it showed up or not, but she got a lot of it and it was an air
ball, and I think that shows you the commitment to contesting shots. That's
what we did the whole night. We did a lot of switching and we did a great job
on their inbounds plays and I thought that was the key.  
You have to play team defense when Iowa State runs as much stuff as they do. I
thought the other key was, can we stop their time-out plays? Every time there
is a time-out, Coach Naysmith is designing something up. And I said, "Oh, no,
what does he got this time?" Like that last play he ran against Kansas State
and what a guru he is.  
Bill and I will have a good time talking about it in Tampa. We're usually on
one stool and he's on another. Most of y'all know where that is. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Gary, you talked about the first 10 minutes pressing them. How much of
that was more about getting out, rattling their cage early, than it was about,
you know, trying to see how y'all's press was?  
COACH BLAIR: The press doesn't force as many turnovers as you think. But it
creates havoc. The point guard can't be comfortable with the ball. Sometimes
somebody else has to bring it up, and Bill got a technical trying to fire his
team up. That's what he was trying to do there, fire his team up.  
The president is effective, but back in the days at Steven F., I pressed for
40 minutes, not very smart. My kids wore down by the time playoffs showed up,
so what I'm doing is spotting it. We'll even have more guards next year that
can rotate in and press longer and harder.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Morenike? Two fouls on Franklin, two on Gant, and
there is a chance maybe they would come back, but talk about the way Morenike
came off the bench and keyed the end of the first half there.  
COACH BLAIR: We felt like we were going to need Morenike more than one of our
post players, because we thought we were going to see every different form of
zone there was.  
When I can put four shooters in and move D.G. to the 4 spot, there is an extra
shooter. We felt like that's what we were going to have to do. Morenike is
beautiful to watch. She is just like a deer out there sometimes. Running
through, she is so graceful.  
That drive and left-handed layup she made in the first half, that's vintage
Morenike. For some of y'all who didn't get a chance to see her her first two
years, that's what she was all about. And hopefully there is more basketball
for her later, but I don't plan on giving her up for another five, six games,
whatever they say I can still play.  
Morenike is the key because how many all-conference players would accept that
role of coming off the bench? You have to have unselfish kids to be able to
say, "Hey, I might be a first-round draft choice for the WNBA, but I'll come
off the bench and fill the role you need." That's why she has been a captain
since she was a sophomore.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations.  
COACH BLAIR: I appreciate everybody here, Iowa State and the fans. The fans
helped make this thing, and Iowa State fans, you spread the word, I would love
to have you tomorrow. Okay. I would love to have you against one of those
orange teams. Spread the word, stay around. I'm sorry, but we're fixing to go
beat your men right now, okay? (Chuckles.) We're going to try!  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on this afternoon's game. We're now joined
by Missouri.  
COACH STEIN: I give the credit to Texas A&M. Going into this game, I thought
they were the most experienced team in the Big 12. Not only the best defensive
team in our league, but one of the top 5 defensive teams in the country, and
they gave us all the reasons why I thought that.  
You've got to play with a lot of poise, and you've got to have playmakers. And
obviously, I've got two great playmakers next to me, but we've got to get a
lot of help, and I think we're learning how to do that, and we'll continue to
battle, but these two young ladies next to me have given us a lot to work for
and a lot of positives going into next season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. How much did fatigue play in the game?  
COACH STEIN: I think it did play. You don't like to say that, but I felt like
we hit a wall in the first half, you could see it in 'em. Kinda ran out of
juice. That's where obviously your depth has to come in and bring in that
energy. I thought our kids battled; I just didn't feel like we had the legs we
had yesterday.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Jessra, how gassed were you after yesterday? Even so, despite that, last
time when you guys played A &M, you had eight turnovers. Today only two, so
despite that, you played well today.   
JESSRA JOHNSON: Personally, I don't feel like I played to my ability, but I
just came in after yesterday hoping that we could pull out another victory.  
  
Q. Alyssa, could you expand on what Coach talked about, the defense. Can you
talk about how tough it is to get open on them and get good looks?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Everybody knows about their defense, and they were face-
guarding there. And every time I came off of an on-ball screen, there was a
trap there. So they were making it tough for me, and you've got to give it to
them, but I still need to knock shots down.  
  
Q. Both players, can you talk about winning the game like you did yesterday;
does that give you the feeling you could beat anybody? Was that the mindset
afterwards, leading up to this today, that you guys were going to get it done
today? You got that confidence and it was going to carry you for a while?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: After the victory yesterday, our team felt like we were No. 1
in the country, so I would say, yeah, we had confidence coming into this game.
Like Coach Stein said, I think we hit a wall.  
JESSRA JOHNSON: I think we came out feeling like we could play anybody, and
Texas A&M is a great team. They were prepared, and I feel like they came out
and took care of business.  
  
Q. Even with today's result, how can you use your tournament here as kind of
a building block for next season?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: I think the whole experience is good for this team. Winning a
game like that gave the girls a feeling of what it feels like to win and how
great it feels and how high you can fly.  
Then having to come back and play a team the next day like Texas A&M shows you
how good the Big 12 is and how you've got to come in and focus. We did a great
thing yesterday, and I think it was great to be able to produce. We know the
level of play we need for next year and what we need to do to be competitive.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: I think it gives us what we need to know about going into next
year, and we did well. And being undersized, we can beat anybody. We learned,
and I think that's motivation for going into next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, near the end of the first half, you guys switched to a zone. I
couldn't tell if it was a box and one or what it was. If you could talk about
that.  
COACH STEIN: I felt like our legs were a little dead, but I also thought a
zone could be effective. I thought Starks was getting into a rhythm there,
just trying to throw something off.  
We were having trouble with their on-ball screens and defending that, so I
felt like trying to take them out of that to make 'em go into something else,
but we did a decent part of that, but we didn't rebound very well out of it.  
And that's another area we struggled in, and you can't stay in it too long
because Coach Blair is an incredible coach. He's going to look to pick you
apart. We're not a great zone team so we were going to use it to change
momentum, but, again, it came down to we needed to score.  
  
Q. Coach, just your thoughts on the future of this team and the program, how
you feel like it's going to go.  
COACH STEIN: I think we have a great future. I think that -- you know, it was
tough this year because this was probably the toughest year in the Big 12. I
feel really good about this team.  
I think that we've -- we signed four kids early, all of them are bigs. We can
6-5, 6-5, 6-3 and 6 foot, and if you watched us play, we were undersized all
year. And obviously that will help with the depth and I think we're going to
get better from this.  
Just the kids going through what they did this year, all of 'em got a lot of
playing time. We came into this year, Jessra Johnson averaged 10 minutes last
year and Alyssa Hollins was the only other person and everybody else was brand
new to the picture, so we feel good about next season.  
  
Q. Coach, you're down by 7 in the second half, 13, you're never able to cut
it. Can you talk about the first three or four minutes, what you thought the
key was?  
COACH STEIN: I think we were back on our heels, I think that's what they did
to us. They attacked us every single play, Texas A&M looked to take it at us.  
Obviously getting Jessra in foul trouble, she is a key to us, throwing the
ball in on inbounds to an offense. And I think you could see Alyssa and her
play well together, and Texas A&M did a great job of taking that away from us;
our main two options. So you have to have other people step up and we didn't
have it.  
  
Q. This has got to be the toughest conference in America, and yet at the
same time we've seen Kansas State this year go from being one of the worst
teams in the league to winning the conference. Oklahoma State loses every
blessed game all year long and is in the tournament the next year. You've seen
teams go from struggling a lot to being very good quickly. Can the girls you
have do that next year and what needs to happen for you to reach those
goals?  
COACH STEIN: I think absolutely. We have talent on our team. The key for us --
the indication today is our consistency. You've got to learn how to play
consistently hard and well. You just can't play hard, you have to do things
right. And that's where we were inconsistent all year.  
I don't think our kids gave up but they didn't always do things well. We could
run a three-lane break 10 different ways this year. They know how to run it,
but they wouldn't do it and that's the discipline that it takes every single
day. That's something we got better at but had yet to complete.  
  
Q. Talk about the effort this team showed. They lost some games by pretty
significant margins, and I have seen teams go through seasons like this and
just quit and y'all never did.  
COACH STEIN: Well, and I appreciate that. We don't want to quit. That's not
going to happen. We have fighters on our team; they're going to keep working
at it. They understood what we were facing and I think that -- we're proud to
play in the Big 12 and we believe that it makes us better, it makes us tougher
and stronger, and we do believe in what we can do next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bonnie Henrickson has joined us at the table, so we'll
let you tell us your thoughts about tonight's game and take your questions.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Obviously we were horrendous in defensive transition and
made them shoot layups to get such a big lead.  
We got it to 8, and in the locker room we said we have been awful in
transition and it's a 12-point game and tried to cut it to 8, which we did.
Then we didn't have sustained effort after that, and we just really -- I'll
have to go back and look at it.  
There seemed to be confusion, and I'll take the hit for that about how we were
going to guard in transition. The difference in our game today is they walked
it up more, didn't push it much in transition, and we didn't respond and get
back and get underneath Riley. We gave her the lane.  
I kept telling the guard she could roll back to the rim and not hit anybody.
We were on her side, didn't stay underneath her. And when she looked at us,
she could see the rim still, and that's a kid who gets the rim and makes the
play. And because she can shoot the 3's, she's harder to guard. All the kids
that can do both of those are harder to guard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. How demoralizing was it when they were getting so many open layups, that
they either went around a guard or were penetrating?  
LACHELDA JACOBS: It was frustrating. They were getting the layups, and we
tried to take the lead and came back early in the second half and tried to
make a run, but didn't sustain it through the second half.  
  
Q. You cut it to 8, and Danielle, you and Krysten had your fourth foul and
had to go out. What was it like to sit there and watch them put the game out
of reach?  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: It was frustrating picking up the fouls early and coming out
of the game and watching on the sidelines. I've got to be smart about what I'm
doing and try to stay in the game. It was very frustrating sitting on the
bench when we were trying to cut the lead and couldn't sustain that.  
  
Q. Danielle, were you surprised how much more of a transition team they were
in this game than they were when you played them in Lawrence?  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: Not at all. We knew they were going to crash the boards, and
they push the ball in transition every game that they play.  
We just kind of got confused on our match-ups in transition and gave them open
layups, but I wasn't nowhere near where I needed to be.  
  
Q. The fact that you played yesterday, was there any fatigue involved?  
DANIELLE MCCRAY: Not at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, were you concerned about the opportunity to be the spoiler?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We talked about that with the kids, our opportunity to be a
spoiler, but you couldn't loose sight that they wanted revenge, both teams
would be playing with a lot of emotion and energy, and we communicated that to
them, but I realized that.  
It's not why we don't guard in transition and it's not why we let them have
layups. I'm sure that was all over the pregame, and we would be doing the same
thing if the tables were turned.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how -- a lot of the things that led to losses all
year, like you recall foul trouble for Boogaard and McCray, can you talk about
that?  
COACH HENRICKSON: It's hard to look at that and come up with a word better
than "undisciplined." Danielle is undisciplined defensively, and she reaches
and fouls and doesn't play good defensive position.  
They picked on her, and most of her time is spent on the perimeter. She has to
work at not getting caught up in being hooked, and whatever her reason is for
picking up the foul. I think it's a lack of discipline for us to turn it over
on the offensive end.  
I'm sure when you watch it live -- I'm not sure what you saw. I bet it's worse
when you can watch it on film and pause it. We've got to be better decision-
makers in passing lanes, angles, using our dribble to improve the angle and
getting it to the rim. We spent too much time in penetration east and west and
not north and south.  
At one time, I looked at the zone and there were two people in the lane, and
everyone else is on the outside and we don't have a guard that will make the
play down the gut and get to the rim.  
We came out of the locker room, got free-throw jumpers, got high/lows,
executed the game plan and then we got undisciplined and started jacking up
3's. You've got to learn from your success and keep going at it until they
take it away. It's not like they took it away; we didn't flash the gap early.
We need some maturity. We've got to grow up, and that will be important for
us.  
  
Q. You guys had a good nonconference in playing in the WIT away from the Big
12. Can you talk about the importance, if you get that bid?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Absolutely. And with the quality competition we've had, and
most people are going to think I'm crazy, but I think we're a good basketball
team that plays in a great league. We're not a great team, we're a good team
that plays in a great league. Great teams play with maturity and consistency.
We aren't a great team, we are a good team.  
We have to play with confidence, be excited about match-ups, gain confidence
from our nonconference schedule and from the league schedule and build and
grow from there. These kids will be excited, and we'll be excited to play next
week. We'll know certainly a lot more in the next couple of days, but it's
about managing the ups and downs, and being able to bounce back.  
It's disappointing today not only to get beat, but how you get beat. Make 'em
throw over the top and make you look silly shooting layups. That's
disappointing, but we've got to bounce back, move on and get better.  
  
Q. You had a great win, if I remember, over Xavier who won recently in their
conference. Is there a different mindset with players once you get into
conference?  
COACH HENRICKSON: That win was big and I thought would really -- I hoped that
would prove to be a big momentum swing for us, winning on the road against
Xavier. And we figured they would be tough, and then they turn around and beat
Georgia.  
And we came home and played Oklahoma State and we felt that loss at Oklahoma
State at home, the one-possession game. We turn it over late and then we get
it to one and they made their free-throws, give 'em credit, and it took the
wind out of our sails. We're an immature team -- I don't mean by "immature"
they're bad. Emotionally -- I mean, they get real, real high and real, real
low.  
This group has to grow up. It's not a change in mindset. These kids absolutely
believed they could beat Oklahoma State at home. And when it didn't happen, it
was just like the wind was out of our sails. Then we go to Nebraska and then
we go to Baylor, and there is no easy night in this league because you've got
great players, great coaches, tough places to play, unlike any other place in
America. And until you're in this league and coach in this league, you can't
really, really, truly respect and understand it.  
  
Q. I noticed in following you -- I've watched you on TV this year and
followed you from a distance. I noticed you have a number of progressions at
point guard. Can you explain -- you had Catic there and now you seem to have
gone primarily to Jacobs. Can you explain the chronology there?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I felt down the stretch LaChelda was being a better
playmaker. I thought Ivana attacked in nonconference and she just wasn't
aggressive. And in this league, you've got to make some plays and LaChelda has
made some plays. And her decision-making skills are better and shot selection
is better and she plays with more poise at the point than she does at the
wing.  
When she is at the wing, she wants to make a play every single time. But
you've got to be able to get inside on defense and create opportunities in
transition. I thought last night LaChelda was good pushing and running. And
that's where she separated herself and then I made the change.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank and you best of luck.

### [Marlies Gipson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18097)

### [Shalee Lehning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13847)

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, maybe just talk a bit about the game.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, it certainly was a loss to the team, losing to Iowa
State. My hat goes off to them for their great play down the stretch and
making those 3-pointers down the stretch when they needed them. They had those
shots there at the end that made the difference.  
My heart goes out to Kimberly and her family. After the initial shock of
seeing her being carried off the floor, then it's regrouping and huddling and
figuring out where to go from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Shalee, talk a little bit about Kimberly and then Dani coming in, and
your continued play in the NCAA.  
SHALEE LEHNING: Well, our hearts go out to Kimberly. She has been a great
leader and we just hope she is okay. Dani came in and did a great job. I think
she had a great game and will continue playing like that for us.  
  
Q. Marlies, talk about your thoughts and where you go from here.  
MARLIES GIPSON: We've just got to keep getting better, and knowing that we
have an opportunity to play and stay together as a team. Keep competing,
having fun.  
Dani, feel proud of her as a teammate and my best friend. I have all the
confidence in her to step up and hit the shot, and she did very well!  
THE MODERATOR: Any final questions for the student athletes? Ladies, thank
you. Best of luck.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the injury and what went through your mind and how
that affected you guys? Maybe any update you have on her, when you may find
anything out?  
COACH PATTERSON: Her status is we're still waiting to have her evaluated, and
I'm sure we'll get a picture here some time soon after everything winds up
here. Obviously, I feel badly for Kimberly. She's had a tremendous season and
was obviously as thrilled as any of us were about having the opportunity to
compete here in Kansas City in this Big 12 tournament.  
Immediately you're surrounded with emotions for her. She is about to be taken
off the floor and is not going to go off the floor and isn't going to compete
in this tournament if you continue on. I think it was really about that. Once
you go to the sideline it's just about continuing to find a way to compete in
the game.  
I thought our bench, you know, whether it was Zanotti or McCullough or
Wheeler, they gave us good quality minutes, and certainly Dani stepped up in a
big way, hit the big 3's and wanted the ball down the stretch and got herself
to the foul line and put us in position to compete to win it in spite of the
loss of Kimberly.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your emotions, watching Shalee's last shot bounce
around the rim and also how when the ball tips one way it's a different
feeling?  
COACH PATTERSON: If you coach long enough or play long enough you live these
moments, and as that ball was bouncing around the rim, I kept thinking, "Go
in, go in, go in," and it went out. Really I felt an unbelievable emotion of
sadness for this team.  
The fight that I thought they brought to the floor, you hope the play is going
to bounce their way and they're going to have another opportunity, but that's
the nature of games like this and, you know, they had just made a fantastic
play, and we had one of the best players in the country going up the floor
full speed trying to make her own fantastic play and, unfortunately, it just
didn't drop for us.  
I think more than anything in my mind that game came down to just a little bit
of laxness on the defensive end, and it can jump up and get you when a team
has the hot hand. Their hand was so hot. We gave 'em 6 inches, they took it.
Heather was tremendous tonight and, you know, that really, to me -- those
defensive breakdowns were obviously the difference.  
We didn't shoot free-throws well over all tonight. That certainly factors in a
close game, but felt like we were in position to win it with one or two stops.  
  
Q. Deb, what do you say to the team after a game like this to pick 'em up?
How difficult is it now to refocus and think about the NCAA tournament?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think it's not difficult to think about the NCAA tournament
and have great anticipation and excitement and enthusiasm about that. It's
hard when you first walk into the locker room. You have to process the
emotions of the loss, and it will obviously take a little bit of time here in
the arena, but we'll get the bounce back in our step and continue to look
forward to what lies ahead.  
I think anytime you walk into the locker room after an emotional, close-fought
overtime loss with so much on the line, you're not right away thinking about
the next thing, but it is something we did talk about.  
We talked about what we've got ahead of us, and at that point I think you're
just processing emotions, if you're a player, more so than listening to a rah-
rah.  
  
Q. Deb, has there been any team that is more hard to kill than Iowa State,
Stacy Frese, Morgan Taylor, their ability to shoot 3's and how difficult they
are to defend?  
COACH PATTERSON: They put a lot of pressure on you, because even with one or
two great 3-point shooters, if they get hot, it's just enough to keep 'em in
the game. It's just enough to beat you if you're not connecting on all
cylinders, and I don't think we did tonight -- or this afternoon.  
So that's the nature of how Iowa State plays. If one or two people get the hot
hand, again, it can be all the difference. It will get you, and I think
everybody in the league understands that about Iowa State. Down the stretch
when kids are a little bit fatigued and working hard not to foul at times, you
know, you make mistakes, and I think Iowa State plays long enough into
possessions and makes sure the kid that's hot gets that good look. That's
really, I think, tonight, the difference in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck to you in the postseason play.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Heather Ezell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16373)

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Alison Lacey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16959)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Heather Ezell scored eight 3-pointers to break the Big 12
record. Kansas State defense gave up 10 3's on the day, and Marlies Gipson
moves to 7th on the conference career block list. And this will be the fifth
game in tournament history to go to overtime, and the first time a No. 1 seed
was knocked off in the second round. .  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Alison Lacey, Heather Ezell and Coach Bill
Fennelly.  
Your thoughts on the win?  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, my heart goes out to Kimberly Dietz and her
family. I watched that happen on our team, and when she fell -- it takes a lot
of what was one of the best college basketball games I've ever been a part of.  
Certainly proud of our team, excited that we get to keep playing, and excited
that we made some plays that really showed a lot of heart and courage and that
they wanted to keep playing.  
When you were down as many times as we were, especially in the overtime,
obviously Heather -- too bad we don't play all of our games here. And
certainly Alison Lacey, maybe one of the greatest plays we've had at Iowa
State with the play at the end. Great college game, and we're excited to play
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Alison, describe what you saw unfold on that 3-point play you had at the
end.  
ALISON LACEY: I have to be honest, a flashback of the last game came into my
head, and I thought I needed to look at the clock and see how many we were
down. Coach reminded me if we're down by 2, take it to the basket and, I ran
as fast as I could down there. Laid up a layup, didn't know if it went in or
not. I can't even describe it; I'm still in shock!  
  
Q. Alison, could you describe the difference in the emotions from the last
time you played Kansas State to this one? It must be maybe the most dramatic
thing you've ever experienced?  
ALISON LACEY: Completely opposite to last game. It was a team effort; I didn't
do it myself. Heather was playing like an upperclassman. She has a lot of
class. She's leading you, everyone is nervous, and we look to her and she
calms us down a lot, so I think the credit goes to her this game.  
  
Q. Heather, when they went ahead in overtime, Iowa State, someone said, was
running out of gas. How much was the fatigue factor and what brought you guys
back?  
HEATHER EZELL: I don't know how much fatigue was a factor. There were a couple
of times I was running down the court and was tired, and I didn't know if I
could make it, but you've got to put it in the back of your mind and keep
going, and you've got to act like you're not tired, pretty much.  
We were able to come together there at the end; everybody made huge plays.
Jocelyn's rebound at the end of regulation was huge. Alison coming in, that
drive and the layup and the free-throw, everything, it all fell into place for
us.  
  
Q. Both of you, what were your emotions when you watched Shalee's shot go
around the basket nine times?  
HEATHER EZELL: I was sitting on the bench with a perfect view, and my head
dropped because I thought it went back in. And as soon as it fell out, I think
I ran the fastest I've ever ran to the other end to grab her.  
It was one of those things where it's a complete low and then a complete high
because I thought it was going in and it didn't.  
ALISON LACEY: She was coming at me and Denae was behind her. She did a great
job of pressuring her. My heart dropped, and luckily for us it rolled out.  
  
Q. Alison, at the end when Amanda kicked the ball to you and your 3, how
good of a view did you get of Alison's rebound? And were you able to watch the
clock as you repositioned yourself to put the shot up?  
ALISON LACEY: Can you repeat it?  
  
Q. The last play of regulation, when you made the shot and Jocelyn got the
rebound, could you see the clock ticking down? Did you wonder if there was
time to get it back in?  
ALISON LACEY: She did what she was told to do, and, you know, Joce came out of
nowhere, huge rebound. And it was in and I saw the clock, and I didn't know if
she had enough time, but luckily she did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Is that kind of what you expected, with Shalee to be the person to do
that for them? And what was going on in your mind as you saw that unfold?  
COACH FENNELLY: No. When they called a time out and Alison was going to shoot
the free-throw, I looked at all of 'em and said, "you know who is going to
shoot it," and that's the way it should be.  
She wanted the ball, made a great play. We didn't really want to pressure her
that much. I think she goes better to her left, but at least we made her use
up a little time. Everyone in the building knew who was going to shoot it, and
you got to give that kid credit because she wanted to shoot it.  
A lot of kids shy away from that kind of responsibility. It was a great play,
and I was like everyone else. You know, it literally was an amazing end to the
game. And one team obviously -- our kids were jumping up and down, and you
felt bad for their kids, and all of them dropped to their knees. It was the
emotion of post-season basketball. We've had a lot of bad breaks on this team,
and this year maybe we got a lucky one today.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a more rewarding or thrilling comeback than what they
gave you today?  
COACH FENNELLY: Not very many. Obviously we're a team that doesn't create a
lot of turnovers, so we're trying to press people, and we're not very good at
it. And I kept saying, "As long as there is time, keep playing. We're going to
extend the game."  
We made big shots. Heather put up two 3's that weren't open, but you've got to
take 'em, and they missed a couple of free-throws to give us a chance. And
it's a two-point game, and I said, "If it's two, don't stop, take the ball to
the basket and tie the game." Luckily, she got the foul. If it was 3, we have
a play we, run at the end. We made some big plays at a critical time and beat
a very good team.  
  
Q. Dietz has thrown a bunch of different things for 3-point shooting, what
did that change for you guys?  
COACH FENNELLY: They pounded it into the post, set a lot of high-ball screens.
We're not deep in the post. And to be honest, I didn't know if Joce was going
to play today; she has been up sick all night with the flu, so the adjustment
was to their credit.  
They pounded it inside, Lehning taking it out-of-bounds. They hit some big 3's
and it changes the game. There is no question it changes their team a little
by the -- because she is such a good player, and when you loose an all Big 12,
it impacts your team. Gipson and Sweat are good, and Lehning willed their team
to where it was a one-possession game at the end.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about a noon game, and I hope you get to keep
playing noon, and you played today at noon. Are you going to try to set the
time right so the girls think it's noon again?  
COACH FENNELLY: No, we're going to take every hour we can. We're going to have
to pour 'em out there tomorrow. That's okay. The early start is good for our
team. You get up, eat, go play. You don't have to sit around all day and worry
about what's going to happen.  
It's neat to be in that situation to represent our school and represent Iowa
State and play in the semifinals of the best conference tournament in the
country! It will be fun because we're going to play our game and race over to
watch the men.  
I think what Greg and his team did today meant a lot to our players and our
fans. That's the kind of guy he is. They've got a lot of things to think about
besides what's happening with the Iowa State women's basketball team. They
came and watched us play, and he's excited and he's a great friend of mine and
great family, so we'll return the favor tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about, in your opinion, how amazing it is that Ezell
has hit 153-pointers in two ballgames?  
COACH FENNELLY: It is amazing when you think about how she struggled to shoot
the ball. Her stats aren't great. The other thing you're seeing in here is
someone who can seize a moment. She is a winner, she's a competitor. She has
always been someone we've asked to do a lot.  
She has struggled from the field, but it's good to see her do it because it's
helping our team, but she's a kid that most people identify with. If she
doesn't make shots, she doesn't help our team.  
I was disappointed she didn't make the all defensive team in the Big 12,
because of what she does for our team. But to tie the record and break it
today is special, and it's neat to see a kid have that success when she would
be the first to tell you that that shot hasn't gone in game in and game out,
but it has the last two days!  
  
Q. Bill, talk about the shot and dunk it was in.  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, I did. I really did! She had a great look at it; it was
a good shot for her. It went up there really soft, and to be honest with you,
kind of the way our season has gone, I was worried.  
There was a moment that flashed in my mind, "How am I going to talk to the
kids about this one?" It was as close as any shot I've seen. Literally, just
like Heather said, you went from excited that you won, to devastated that you
lost, to excited you won as the ball rolled around. It was an amazing ending
to an amazing game, and we were fortunate the ball fell off.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, see you tomorrow!

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Longhorns from the University of Texas,
Coach, would you like to comment about the win?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Thank goodness for second halves. Just really proud of the
way my team responded. First half I thought we started off well, and then when
Brittainey and Ashley got their two fouls, we kind of lost our composure, and,
you know, Baylor took advantage.  
They played an excellent, excellent first half. They were going on all
cylinders, they were hitting 3's, that he had their transition game going, and
we lost our composure. I told the team at halftime the thing that upset me
most was that we weren't playing with that same passion, desire, hustle,
intensity that I had seen over the last several games. That's what makes us a
very good team. We have to have that.  
We've got to make the hustle plays. We've got to play with passion. We've got
to be able to rely on our defense. So I just felt like the second half was
going to be a tremendous test of our character, to see who we could be. And
we've been in this situation before, at A&M and we came back in that game, and
we ended up losing that game, but we knew we could come back.  
There was a confidence having come back in the past. This time we were able to
come back and close it off. So just very proud of the team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take student athlete questions first.  
  
Q. Were you in a zone tonight, Carla?  
CARLA CORTIJO: I don't know what got into me the second half. Some kind of
fire got into me, but my team did a great job, Brittainey Raven did a great
job on the defensive boards, and I'm just so excited right now.  
  
Q. Carla, can you talk about how you turned up the defensive intensity the
second half?  
CARLA CORTIJO: It was all about the team. The intensity just went up, like,
all of the sudden and Ashley said -- it was just everybody, we were talking,
we were huddling and we were having fun the second half.  
  
Q. Earnesia, could you talk about your defense and rebounding in the second
half?  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: Defense, I was concentrated on Rachel Allison, because she
is a more aggressive player and strong and physical and a good offensive
rebounder and she knows how to get the ball, so I was trying to defend her,
limit her touches and try to keep her off the boards.  
I don't know what got into me, either, whenever the ball missed, I was there,
snatching it down! Very glad that happened!  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you describe the halftime scene? Did she threaten to take
away your meal money?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: No, we just got into a slump and we had no energy in the
first half, and we knew we weren't playing as good as we've been playing the
past couple of games. So we talked to each other, tried to motivate each other
to get each other back up.  
We can play with this team; they're making us look bad. We tried to get stops
and we did and we just -- we built off that. We kept going.  
  
Q. Earnesia, was there a lot of talk at halftime about the defensive
rotation? They got a lot of chippy layups off of the extra passes and y'all
shut that down.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: As a team, we weren't talking on defense. They got some --
a lot of transition points and what they -- how they did score was easy layups
behind our back, and we weren't really talking and nobody knew where the
shooters were. So we turned it up and started talking, looking for the
shooters, cutters, and helping with screens and talking, stuff like that.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about the attitude of this team? You guys have
obviously earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament, but you still look like you're
playing with something to prove.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: We are, because we still have to gain a lot of people's
respect and just -- we're trying to show people that we are good and we can
play with top-ranked teams and we have a lot of confidence right now and a lot
of fight in us to play every game the same way.  
We didn't start off the first half that way, but we got ourselves back
together and got back on the same road we've been on.  
  
Q. Earnesia can you talk about the way the team ended the game, finished the
game; you were on the floor with 10 seconds to play when you had the game in
hand.  
EARNESIA WILLIAMS: We were team oriented, huddled after every free-throw,
trying to keep the focus. We knew the game wasn't over at 55 seconds, 33
seconds; just played till the clock was out.  
People got happy, tried to calm them down. We still got to play the game, but
we were on a roll, everybody was in the zones, hitting shots, E-Bai coming in
playing defense, hitting shots; Ashley, Brit, we were connected, very
connected.  
  
Q. Carla, you came up with steals the second half. Were you all getting in
the passing lanes?  
CARLA CORTIJO: Yeah, we had a lot of pressure on the ball, and on Tisdale, and
she was making 3's the second half and we shut that down. We were pressuring
the ball and getting into the passing lane.  
THE MODERATOR: Carla, were y'all discouraged in the first half with the way
the offense was going? How would you assess your mood?  
CARLA CORTIJO: They had their moments. You know, everybody is going to be
making the run, and that was their moment in the first half for them, but in
the second half we came back and we beat them.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Gail, can you talk about -- I know right now it's right after the game,
but what does it mean for a team that can be down 14, 16 points and turn it
all around into a 15-point win in just 20 minutes?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Like I said, I thought it was going to reveal our
character. We talked about that at halftime. I told 'em, you know, I love
challenges. I didn't want this to be easy.  
So the fact that we're down, to me it's a tremendous opportunity for us to
show other people and ourselves who we are and what we're all about.  
  
Q. Baylor has had their way in the conference, you've beat them twice, swept
them twice; was this a statement on the season, on the conference, having so
much success with them?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: No, not really. For me, it's about -- as a new coach in the
Big 12 learning and growing. Not necessarily making a statement, but trying to
show and build our foundation.  
We talked so much about a foundation of what we would become. I think as the
season has progressed, you're starting to see who we are and who we're going
to be in the future, and that's a team that will never say "die," will never
give up, is going to be mentally and physically tough through tough times. So
this is all about forming our identity and foundation for here and now, but
also, more importantly, for the future as well.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right, Carla, she's come a long way. There is a lot of
pressure on her, the fact that she is our only true point guard, and she has
had her ups and downs and she's stayed positive.  
It's a bonus for us when she's hitting the outside shot, she runs the show.
Tonight she started feeling it. I was so happy for her because she has been
through a lot and through a lot of pressure and stress and strain, and I think
it -- there is no one that's more deserving on this team than to have a night
like she did tonight and really -- I felt like she would not let us lose this
game.  
  
Q. What could a victory like this do for you going into the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It gives us confidence. Our last several victories, I think
we gained confidence through each one, and this is another situation where you
never know in the NCAA Tournament what odds you're going to be facing, but you
have to have confidence that you can come back against any margin. So we have
come back before, but we weren't able to finish it off, so tonight builds on
that confidence for us.  
  
Q. 52 points for the second half. As you're giving your halftime speech, is
that plausible? Was that something in your mind that was doable?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I wasn't talking about points, and certainly didn't
envision 52 points. We really talked about defense, and they were getting so
many transition buckets. They were getting -- our rotations were slow and very
poor, and they were getting layups as well. So we talked about our defense and
pressure, and we needed to start our offense with defense in particular.  
  
Q. The play at the end, when you had it pretty much in hand, and Williams
dives on the floor and flips it ahead, is that what you would like to be a
snapshot of what you want your team --  
COACH GOESTENKORS: That's exactly what I said after the game. That play
epitomized who we were in the second half and who we want to be; putting it
all out there. Didn't matter what the score was, didn't matter what the time
was, and that's the way I felt like Earnesia in particular played in the
second half, but our team in general played as well.  
  
Q. Gail, you didn't talk about winning at halftime, probably, but did you
think at halftime you thought you could win?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We did talk about winning. I said this is going to be the
greatest comeback in the history of the Big 12 tournament. I didn't know it's
not, but I thought it might be, so I sounded like I was telling the truth and
I wanted them to feel like we weren't just going to catch up; we were going to
win the game.  
  
Q. Did y'all make adjustments defensively, or was it a matter of being more
aggressive?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Being more aggressive, stayed with our man-to-man. In the
first half they picked us apart and we went with our man and we were in tune
with one another, more aggressive, more focused.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations, see you tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Taylor Hardeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18118)

### [Andrea Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16924)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about the win tonight, and then we'll take
questions for your student athletes.  
COACH BUDKE: Obviously very proud of the win tonight. I thought, you know,
anytime our team comes out and has five people in double figures, we're
dangerous and tough to beat.  
I thought we had good balance all night long. When Andrea -- she wasn't
struggling, but early on other people got us going tonight. This is kind of
the next step with our program right now; since we've taken over anyway. This
is our first Big 12 win, we're excited about it. We're excited about our next
game.  
We know we're playing a great opponent in Texas, but right now we feel like we
can beat anybody that goes on the floor with us. We're playing with that kind
of confidence.  
THE MODERATOR: Student athlete questions.  
  
Q. Taylor, I just wanted to know what were your thoughts coming into
tonight, knowing that so far it hadn't been such a good week for the high
seeds?  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Excited to be here. We were just ready to get out there and
play and just excited that we got the 3 seed and we worked so hard to get
there.  
  
Q. You guys got here on Monday, right?  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: Yes.  
  
Q. That's a long time to be here. What was it like to have so much time and
how anxious were you to play?  
ANDREA RILEY: It's an anxious feeling that you have. You're like, man, two
more days, three more hours, you know, just hesitant to get out there. And
when you think about the excitement that everybody is playing with and the
intensity and the focus that you're playing with, you want to be a part of
that. And watching the game before us, got you motivated.  
COACH BUDKE: It's tough on you when people play two games and you haven't
played one yet. It's tough on you.  
THE MODERATOR: Hold on. We have no audio right now.  
Okay, we'll go back to the question. Repeat the question, please.  
  
Q. You guys got here on Monday. What was it like to have to wait around so
long? And what time did you get here on Monday?  
COACH BUDKE: We got here at 5:00, and we had a shoot-around for 45 minutes
that night.  
ANDREA RILEY: It was an anxious feeling, you know, going to games and seeing
how people have so much energy and seeing the emotion that was pouring out of
all the players. It made us want to get on the floor.  
  
Q. Andrea, talk about getting this first post-season win and what it
means.  
ANDREA RILEY: It means a lot. We just wanted to focus more and just play with
so much emotion.  
  
Q. Andrea, a lot of high seeds were going down as you guys waited to play.
Both you guys, did you notice that and did it get your attention?  
ANDREA RILEY: It really got our attention, but it didn't really bring us down,
because we knew that we are the Cowgirls and we are OSU, and we don't have to
worry about any other team. It's about us, you know?  
We just have to focus on us instead of everyone else. It was hard seeing top
seeds going down like that. It was like they worked so hard, and for it to go
down like that, it was bad.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: You know, just -- it's crazy, anything can happen in these
tournaments, I know. Like Andrea said, we know who we are and what we need to
do and that pumped us up to get us ready for our game.  
  
Q. Taylor, just about when you guys took over this game, what do you think
kicked in there? It seemed like in the second half you guys put it in another
gear.  
TAYLOR HARDEMAN: You know, our defense deserves credit, and we needed to get
stops and that defense led to our offense. We were doing what we knew how to
do and we knew what we had to do and what our weapons were, and we just had to
use them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Coach, a few questions for you.  
  
Q. Sometimes players can be oblivious to --  
THE MODERATOR: We lost the audio again. Hold on. Modern miracles.  
COACH BUDKE: It's easier to wait with you when you win. But we do have a game
tomorrow, so --  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get you out of here by 2:00! (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Coach, No. 1 and 2 went down, Oklahoma lost yesterday. I just wonder what
your thoughts are as a coach coming into this game. Were you worried about
that, having seen those upsets?  
COACH BUDKE: Not really. KU grabbed our attention last year by beating us in
the first round. So we didn't talk about other teams going down. We remember
how they eliminated us last year, and that was our sole motivation, was to
make sure that didn't happen again.  
  
Q. You guys knocked down another so-called barrier, winning a postseason
game. Talk about the importance of that and getting past that.  
COACH BUDKE: I think it's real exciting for our program. We have, in three
years, knocked down so many barriers. And we've talked about when we got here,
never winning a road game, never winning a south game, never winning a north
road game, chopping them down. And this was the next thing we needed to get
to.  
We finished last year with two straight losses in two straight tournaments,
and we didn't want that to happen again. I'm just very proud. We talked about
it before the game. We're proud of the year we had, and we're not done yet.  
We don't want to be satisfied, because any time you're satisfied, you take a
step backwards, and I don't think you saw a satisfied team tonight. I think
you saw a hungry team that wanted to advance.  
  
Q. Coach, early in the second half, they cut the lead to 8 and then Boogaard
picked up her fourth foul and you guys went on a run. Talk about that run and
what it did for you guys.  
COACH BUDKE: It was important to get the foul on her. She is a great player,
and she's going to be a great player in this league. She was changing the game
for them to get back in the game. We weren't moving well.  
We got off to a slow start, and it's so hard to put 40 perfect minutes
together. There are going to be times when those kinds of things happen, but
it's how you recover out of it. We started shifting defenses a little bit and
moving, and we created offense with our defense and I think that changed the
game.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on playing Texas tomorrow night and taking another
step in this tournament, a team that you split with twice and has a lot of
momentum after their win this afternoon.  
COACH BUDKE: I don't think there is any question they have a lot of momentum.
They're one of the most talented teams in the Big 12. It's taken them a while
to adjust to a new coaching staff, but they're adjusting well.  
And I think they're a serious threat in this tournament and also the NCAA
tournament. They're going to be somewhere in the NCAA tournament that you're
not going to want to look up on that board and see you're playing them in the
first round. I think it is a great team, a great coach and should be a great
atmosphere tomorrow night and a lot of fun.  
  
Q. How much momentum can a team carry from one game to the next with Texas
closing out, having a huge second half. Is that something that concerns you
that they'll be carrying into the game tomorrow?  
COACH BUDKE: I think and I hope we have the same momentum, though. What they
did in the second half was unbelievable, but it's a new night and a new system
that they're going to be facing, and it's not going to be the same exact
thing.  
We're all going to have to start over and come out excited, but I promise you,
both teams will be excited tomorrow night and hopefully we carry that same
motivation and that same excitement into the game that we brought tonight.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [La Toya Micheaux](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18106)

### [Takia Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16383)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M University. Coach Blair, can you make
a short opening statement so we have an opportunity for questions?  
COACH BLAIR: One of the first keys on the board that I put, I said, "Harvard,"
and any of you know what I'm talking about, Harvard, 1998, we were out at
Stanford and No. 1 got beat by a No. 16, just like No. 12 beat No. 5 last
night.  
And I made sure our team was not going to underestimate a very good Missouri
team. We were fired up, we were totally planned for them. We had to do an
extra shoot-around last night, and go over the Missouri sets, but I liked the
focus of my basketball team.  
We had good balance, Micheaux down there was solid as a rock, taking what the
defense was going to give her. They were spending so much time guarding Starks
and Gant that it was leaving her wide open. I think she showed a lot of people
she can score as well as Gant.  
Starks is just a gamer on her end. She had some tough shots. The easier shots
she missed; she hit all the tough shots, and she's going to be special for
somebody in a couple of years. This league is loaded with great guards and I'm
happy for the win. I thought we played very well.  
We had some lapses on defense in the second half, even though we held them to
39 points, but Coach Schaefer over there wants pressure, okay? And for us to
win and keep winning, you have to have pressure on defense on every
possession. You can screw up offense every now and then by missing a shot, but
there is no excuse for defense not talking and not being there. He had 'em
ready to play tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Student athlete questions, please.  
  
Q. La Toya Micheaux, was this a good match-up for you or can you talk about
what got you going offensively?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: First off, I want to give thanks for my teammates because it
starts with them. Defense is what I am known for, and like coach said, we had
to focus. And my first shot I hesitated, I was like, "okay, I'm going to shoot
the ball," and it was just a flow. I let the game come to me.  
It wasn't trying to do something extraordinary; they were double teaming me
down low. Gant would shoot the ball, the ball went inside, but I want to give
back to my coaching staff and my teammates because we're a team and you can't
do it without each other.  
  
Q. How much did you light up when you saw the Missouri score, Takia?  
TAKIA STARKS: I can't say that, it was a great game. It went down to the wire.
I think OU played lax, and Missouri, that team, you've got nothing to lose.
They put their hearts on the line, and they're a great team, credit Alyssa
Hollins and her team, they're a great group of kids.  
  
Q. Regardless of who came out today, OU or Missouri, can you talk about the
defense?  
  
TAKIA STARKS: Like Coach said, we have been playing well all season, and we're
confident in our defense. And our defense has been dictating our game since
February, and we came out tonight, no matter who we were going to play, OU or
Missouri, on the defensive end. Making things happen was the key.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you talk about the start of the second half, it was only a
7-point game at halftime and you came out the second half with a double digit
lead gained right away. What was the difference?  
  
TAKIA STARKS: Coach said the first 5 minutes of the game, either you can run
out now or we can make it tough on ourselves. That brought us together and we
came out there -- the wings were getting the ball and the post was getting the
ball. And we say if they can't catch it, they can't score.  
I think our wings stepped up first and took out -- didn't let them make plays,
and it just carried over for the whole second half.  
  
Q. Did you guys change your game plan, how you play personally, knowing how
tired Johnson and Jones were after last night, working against Paris all
night?  
TAKIA STARKS: Deny is deny; rebounding is rebounding, and it doesn't change.
No matter who you play, you have to have that mentality.  
You might want to go into zone here and there, but our man-to-man is the same
as the zone, you deny and you have to go out and help side defense and that's
why we're -- that's how we are right now. It started in February, and we just
keep going and keep going and it won't change.  
  
Q. La Toya, is this special playing here in Kansas City? I suppose you've
heard stories from Larry. What have you heard about this place?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: I haven't spoken to him yet, and we used to live in Overland
Park, and she told me he stayed here a year and a half before he got traded,
and that was all that I know. I have pictures of him with the Kansas City
Kings, but I don't know anymore, but hopefully I'll be here again and I can
tell you. I'll ask him.  
  
Q. You lit it up the last two games here. Talk about the match-up with Iowa
State.  
  
TAKIA STARKS: We matched up against them earlier this year, and we came out
the victor, and we executed our game plan. And it's tournament time and they
played great today. She is a nice player, has a step-back 3-point shot, and I
would like to do that some day as good as her.  
And she has range, so if you're pressing, she can drive past you. And if
you're laying off, she can shoot it deep. Credit her teammates, they get her
the ball where she wants it and they were able to score.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Question for coach?  
  
Q. Coach, it was a 7-point game at halftime, how important was it the way
you all started the second half?  
COACH BLAIR: They were making us bleed the last 10 minutes to score on
offense. If you remember their last three possessions before half was a banked
in 3, Nicole Wilson didn't block out on a backside rebound and then on a
inbounds play.  
We played great defense, and all of a sudden, I look up and we're only up by 7
because we gave up those three possessions. We didn't press because we had to
save ourselves. We were going to press if we needed it, but our half-court
defense is like a press because we extend it.  
B.G., Reado and T.K. gave us two steals and four easy points, and I think that
was the key to the ballgame right there. We went from 7 to 11, and once you
get double digits and you look up and you know it's the second half, that sort
of makes you, as the opponents say, "Wow, it's going to be a long way up,"
because we scored those points off defense.  
And those were the first two easy baskets we had all ballgame, because they
were doing a great job on us defensively on the perimeter in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, how important -- you talk about three games in three days; you
were able to play some of your bench a little more than normal.  
COACH BLAIR: I thought it was key, particularly for A'Quo, because of what she
is going to have to do to dissect the zone that we will see tomorrow. I hope I
can sit here and talk Bill into playing us man, but I don't think I will.  
They do a great job with their match-up zone, and Iowa State is just going to
be a load for us. Just because of how they play, they play with so much
emotion. But I want Bill and everybody to relax, they're in the tournament, so
you're in, you played, you got two games.  
Texas, you're in the tournament, just relax. Everybody chill out, have a good
time, let the seeds win! (Chuckles.)  
But I think I was -- Buchanan was able to give Micheaux a break because of
what she's going to have to do in the next two ballgames, but Buchanan did a
great job. And Sydney played under control, and that's the key for us, because
she'll be running the show for us the next three years.  
I was happy to see Baker hit that 3, because you don't know how much
confidence that builds up for those kids because they might not get the
opportunity in the remaining ballgames we have.  
We were able to rest some kids and keep rotating in, and when you have six
starters like we do, Morenike comes in and fill out whoever needs the rest.  
  
Q. Did you guys change anything, pick up the post normally more than you
would have after halftime?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I cannot go in and play 94 feet of full court pressure
defense the whole game. We hadn't done that all year. People think we do, but
we don't. I've got to rest bodies.  
At the same time, it's not the turnovers that we're forcing, it's the
atmosphere we're creating. We don't want that point guard to be comfortable.
Unfortunately, Richbow came in at half with zero turnovers, and she did a good
job.  
The key to the ballgame was what we did with their 3, 4 out of 16 for Hollins,
4 out of 11 for Johnson and then Jones. Paris place behind, we play in front,
and they couldn't get the lob over to her, and our style of play worked a
little bit better.  
I really believe that Missouri was just dead tired after that ballgame. That's
why it was so important for us to get the lead early on them, before they
started doing this David/Goliath stuff again. And the place would have
erupted, because I'm sure Iowa State and every team in the north would have
been pulling for them to keep on going.  
  
Q. Gary, UO gets knocked out of the way, Kansas State gets knocked out of
the way. Can your path to the championship game be any easier?  
COACH BLAIR: Yeah, am I getting a forfeit tomorrow? I don't think so.  
  
Q. What do you think about how it goes on for you guys?  
COACH BLAIR: Remember, Iowa State kicked our butts here last year, okay? They
beat me twice last year; cost me a good seed in the NCAA. We have trouble
playing against him. That's how much I respect him.  
You talk about the decade coach of the year in the Big 12, it's Bill Fennelly
for what he's done, not how many championships, but what he does, overachieve,
overcome injuries, all that type of stuff.  
Folks, we've never been in a championship game in our life in the Big 12
tournament, and I don't think our men have been in one either. We're going
into new ground that needs to be broken here, and when that happens, we'll
start getting more people out of Texas to come up here and follow us like they
do at Iowa State and some of these other places, and that's what I'm looking
forward to.  
Brian, it's that bandwagon and getting on that wagon train and following us
and the men in the Big 12 and the NCAA. This is the first time I've ever won a
ballgame in Kansas City. I got beat in '98 in the Final Four, I got beat my
first or second year here. This is the first win, so don't think it's been
easy, all right?  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Rachel Allison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18111)

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Angela Tisdale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16382)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on the game.  
COACH MULKEY: Tale of two halves, if I wasn't so young in my career, I would
resign tonight, put that in the paper. Make shots! You make shots the first
half, you take the lead, you miss shots the second half, you lose the lead!  
First five minutes of the second half, opportunity after opportunity after
opportunity, and we just couldn't finish a shot! Now why, I don't know. I
could say fatigue, seven players; I could say confidence, I could say panic, I
could say leadership, who the heck knows? Who the heck knows, but it happened.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, questions for our student athletes.  
  
Q. Rachel, what happened, in your mind from the first half to the second
half?  
RACHEL ALLISON: I think we came out flat in the second half. We ended the
first half really good, and I think we just got too high and we came out and
they made a run and we just didn't answer.  
  
Q. Angela, how are you guys -- obviously you're down right now, but what
affect is this going to have on y'all in the tournament?  
ANGELA TISDALE: Like you said, we're down right now. We've got a lot of stuff
to work on, and so we've got to go back and practice. If it has any affect, we
don't know. We've got to wait and play them games, but we've got to work on
stuff when we go back.  
  
Q. Rachel, they seemed like they did a much better job in the second half of
shutting down y'all's breaks, and y'all got a lot of layups on easy passes in
the first half and that wasn't there in the second. Were they getting in the
passing lanes better? Just not allowing y'all to have that one extra pass?  
RACHEL ALLISON: I think you said it; we didn't make the extra pass and it was
there, we just didn't execute. We were shooting too quick when we were making
the extra pass in the first half that was getting us our easy layups.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind as you couldn't get anything to fall and
they were hitting everything, and whatever you guys were trying seemed like it
wasn't working in the second half. What was going through your mind at that
point?  
RACHEL ALLISON: We were trying to stay calm and not get too riled up, and just
deal with the fact that they were making a run and try to get some baskets. We
were just trying to stop them.  
  
Q. Angela, you had the 3-point play to stop their run and maybe kind of give
you a little momentum. Did you think at that point maybe you had stemmed the
tide?  
ANGELA TISDALE: I thought we were going to go on a run then, but we didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, so many times this year you've said, "Give credit to the other
team." Do you give credit to Texas tonight, or was this a case of a collapse?
  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. I don't know, man! I'd have to look at the film.
Give Texas credit for winning the game. Good grief, we scored only 21 points
in the second half, so you gotta give them some kind of credit.  
We just couldn't score. I don't know if it was fatigue. I don't know what it
was. I thought we played as well as we could play in the first half, and as
bad as we could play in the second half.  
Was Texas's defense any different in the second half than it was in the first
half? I didn't think so. Did they stop us in transition any better in the
second half than the first? Actually, I thought the first half they were
hounding the rebounder to keep us from doing that, and in the second half they
quit doing that.  
Was it fatigue again? In the first 5 minutes when we didn't score, they didn't
score, and it went back and forth. We had an inbound layup miss and an
offensive rebound miss and another miss here and there. It started to snowball
and that's where leadership on the floor should take over and gather your team
and say "we're okay," and I don't think I found that with anybody tonight.  
It was two freshmen out there saying, "Oh, boy, what do we do?" And two
sophomore players that gave you 4 points, one played 25 minutes and one played
14 minutes, and we got 4 points out of two positions there. We got 2 points
out of the two freshmen positions. Gotta get more from everybody.  
We're so depleted depthwise, that anybody that's good, you've got to get
production from everybody, and we didn't.  
  
Q. Do you think these games are anomalies, or are there things in both of
these losses that are trends that bother you? Other than the fact that it was
a loss?  
COACH MULKEY: Bryan, when you lose an athlete on the perimeter like we did in
Jhasmin Player, you lose a rebounder, a defensive player, you lose a physical
athlete on the perimeter. We're replacing her with two freshman and they're
giving me everything they have; they are just inexperienced.  
Jhasmin has the ability when you play athletic teams, A&M, Oklahoma State,
Texas, their bread and butter is their athleticism on the perimeter. That was
our bread and butter, but when you take a piece of the puzzle out, you're
fighting with two freshman to try and patch it up.  
So I think it's the style of play of these three teams, and those are the
three teams we've played in the last three games. A different style team, I'm
not sure we would have had as much trouble. We've got to play with the
schedule -- what the schedule dictates you play. And we will head to the NCAA
Playoffs.  
  
Q. I think Rachel mentioned "came out flat ." Did you feel like that?   
COACH MULKEY: Jerry, how are you going to come out of the locker room flat
when you're up 16? Where it all snowballed and went to pieces is when you miss
shot after shot after shot after shot, and then you look like, "Oh, you shoot
it. I don't want to shoot it; I'm scared to shoot it," and it snowballs on
you.  
And they go down and make a 3 and you turn it over and you get trapped and
that kind of stuff -- that's what happened. And with one senior and all the
playing time, the younger people have gotten playing time during the year, you
hope you don't get caught in those situations.  
And we were and we will continue to be when you have an athletic team on the
perimeter that hounds you and guards you the way those three teams do. You
have to get offensive production in the paint. You can't win anything big if
you don't have a good point guard and a good post player.  
  
Q. With the 3-point play that gave you the lead back that Angela made, did
you think maybe you had stemmed the tied, maybe get a little momentum going?  
COACH MULKEY: No. I really didn't. I thought we were just hanging on. I think
it was a sense of trying to hang on. I never got a feel from anybody on that
floor, including Angela, because she was out there making some bad decisions
herself.  
I just didn't feel a sense of calm that I had prepared that basketball team
and that they could take over and get it done. That can be attributed to a lot
of things. I'll always protect my kids, but good grief, guys, some point you
play in the game.  
I can call as many timeouts as they allow me to call and drop as many plays,
but at some point you gotta make shots. You've got to make shots, and I know
that sounds simplistic, but that's what got you in the lead in the first of
place, you made shots.  
  
Q. At the same time, Coach, you're in good company; the No. 1 seed is out,
Oklahoma is out of the quarter finals, did you ever think you would see the
day when that happened?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, I think the game is good, I think the parity in the game
is good. Conference tournaments are where you see all this kind of stuff take
place. Rutgers loses to a nonrank team. Maryland up for a No. 1 seed loses.
None of it surprises me anymore.  
The game is getting good. The good thing is it's not our last game of the
year. The good thing is all of them are back but one. The bad thing for me as
a coach is they'll go to bed tonight and they'll sleep good. Because they're
18, 19 and 20 years old, I won't. I'll beat myself up, toss and turn all night
because I'd have to go back a long way to think of a tale of two halves where
you have a 16-point lead and then you get beat by 15.  
And that's a big turnaround there. That's what coaches do, and I'll protect
'em as much as I can, but they've got to grow up. They've got to grow up.
They've given me unbelievable effort all year, seven players. I'd like to
trade places with some of those you just said that got beat out early, give me
their depth and talent. I'd trade places with 'em just to see how far I could
go, but I wouldn't trade any of my kids.  
They play hard, they represent Baylor well. We've fought through a lot of
things late in the year. We fought through a lot of things late in the year.
To think we may get a 2 seed, huh, 2 or 3 seed somewhere down the road.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2008

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

### [Jackie McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16379)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let coach Kathy McConnell-Miller make an opening
statement and then take questions.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: This was a tough day for -- that's the way my day has
been like! First and foremost, I've got to credit Iowa State for coming out
with energy, passion, and the desire to keep playing. I did not feel like our
team came into this game without that same desire. I felt like we came in
extremely prepared, poised from a chemistry standpoint and leadership
standpoint and from an X's and O's standpoint.  
They are an extremely bright team in that when there are mismatches, they've
got the ability to exploit it. They set great screens, they've got the ability
in a 30-second span to break your team down, and they broke us down possession
after possession. We tried to make adjustments with switches, and they were
strong enough and smart enough to end up with our big on their guards, and we
couldn't stop 'em.  
Tried to zone 'em up when they did that and they found the open shooters. They
were hot! They were hot from the perimeter, and they were feeling it. You
could see their chemistry as a team continue to grow as the game went on, and
it was evident that we were struggling as the game went on. They progressively
got better and we progressively pulled apart. Individually, of course, Jackie
McFarland was solid, as usual, and continues to lead this team. I'm forever
proud of her commitment to this team and her passion for playing for 40
minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were getting beat up today. Were you surprised at how
physical this game was?  
JACKIE McFARLAND: Not really surprised. That's been the entire season is throw
two down there in the lane, and especially with Iowa State when they don't
have the post, where that's usually when I do get single coverage is if the
other team has a strong, bigger post than me.  
So I expected to see a lot of double team to stop our inside game, and toward
the end it was a free-for-all in the middle. It felt like everywhere I turned
I couldn't take a step without getting hammered, boxed out or anything.  
  
Q. Jackie, they threw up some desperation shots and one banked in, I think
another one swished. Did it feel like one of those games like you can't --  
JACKIE McFARLAND: I think that shot going into their halftime, I think that
gave them all the confidence in the world. I hit that ball out of her hands
and she grabbed it in midair and threw it in there. So I didn't think there
was any way that was going in.  
When it did, it's one of those things you have to take a step back and --
there are lucky plays like that, but they worked hard, and we came back in the
second half I think kind of second-guessing ourselves, and they came out
stronger than they did in the first.  
  
Q. Are you expecting to keep playing? Do you think -- are you expecting to
be in the WNIT?  
JACKIE McFARLAND: I would hope so. An invitation to that tournament is
something this league is so strong in, and when you look at the things we have
done this season, I think it would be an honor. I think we're looking forward
to a chance to continue on and play, get looks against people outside of this
conference and see what we can do there.  
  
Q. For either of you, you guys had 21 turnovers, they had 5. Is that
something they were doing defensively or did you guys just not take care of
the ball today?  
JACKIE McFARLAND: I think -- I mean, defensively we were hooked up, they had
us scouted as far as who were drivers, who were shooters, and I think we had a
lot of mental errors. We were aggressive, which is our main point, and we were
to be aggressive on offense and take it to 'em, but once we started our drive
we would get to the line and a lot of times didn't finish the shot, lost the
ball, lost the handle, finishing is a key for us.  
  
Q. Jackie, were you aware you were 1 point shy of Tara?  
JACKIE McFARLAND: No, I had no idea.  
  
Q. Coach, how hard will it be to replace Jackie next year?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Jackie is a great leader on and off the court, a great
person. It will be tough to find somebody like her next season to fill those
shoes. They're huge shoes to fill. I'm going to miss her a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kathy McConnell-Miller? Any questions?  
  
Q. Kathy, what were you trying to emphasize defensively coming in?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Initially we had put Spears on Nisleit, who was their
4, and Jackie on Bolte. They're both small forwards, neither one post up at
all, so Jackie was either on the one that had two inches on her -- but they're
both 3-point shooters, but Nisleit typically sets the screens to get Ezell or
Lacey open, which would end up with Spears on the ball quite a bit.  
And the first three or four possessions it worked well, and then Brittany
picked up two and became extremely tentative, and their focus became whoever
she was coming off of, they began to post Spears up, and I think it took
Brittany out of the flow on the defensive end.  
I thought she was tentative and she wasn't even aggressive going to get
rebounds, which is typically what she does. As far as that's concerned, we had
to change our game plan, put Jackie on the 4, and that's what they exploited
the bigs on their guards and tried to break us down and -- whether they pulled
up for a 3 or took it to score.  
  
Q. Did that affect Brittany on the offensive end, because she never looked
like she got back on track.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You know, I don't know where her mind-set was. This
was not a typical game for Brittany Spears. She is typically a lot more
aggressive on the offensive end. I thought they did a nice job when she was in
there; they stayed hooked up, came off the point guard, whether it was Susie
or Whitney, they planted one in the paint, denied Bianca and Spears any good
looks. They did not help off of them.  
When they pulled Spears out, they went to a diamond and one on Bianca and
asked the other players to step up to the block, and they doubled up on
Jackie. She just didn't get into the flow with the changing of the defenses.  
  
Q. Kathy, how important is it for you to get into the WNIT?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think it's extremely important. There is no doubt
that every coach and player's dream is to get to the NCAA tournament, and
that's what you would like to do. Again, the conference is extremely strong,
but I think it is very important for this team to continue to play and
progress as a group. Obviously Jackie has been the heart and soul of this
team. We need other players to develop and mature, and I think more games will
help that.  
To be able to take the step in the direction of playing in the postseason --
Jackie McFarland is going to be one of the few players in Colorado history to
not make it to the NCAA tournament, and that's unfortunate for her, but she
wants to continue to play, the team wants to continue to play, and I keep
looking at Kansas State and Wyoming ending up in the finals last year and
Kansas State winning our league and Wyoming being in the Top 25 and knowing
how important more games and getting to a postseason is, particularly a very
young team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jackie's career and what she has meant to you your
first three years?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You asked the question about -- she'll get Tara's
record, she'll get it. I feel good about our opportunities. But as far as
Jackie is concerned, whoa, people just don't see her every day. It's the most
amazing thing. From the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed she's
got a schedule, and whatever she does, whether it's stay home and be a mom,
whether it's playing in the WNBA, tax accountant, whatever she decides to do,
she'll be the best at it, because she is the most organized, most efficient,
most passionate individual you will ever, ever be around.  
The impact that I think she has made on this program and the players, you
can't see it. And right now she feels so bad about today, and she feels so bad
about not getting to the tournament, and it's just indicative of her passion
and her love for the University of Colorado, her love for the game of
basketball and never wanting it to end.  
I've never once had an issue with her in any regard other than she needed more
rest. The biggest problem we had is when she was sitting on the bench with two
fouls and she wanted to keep playing. She kept standing up, "I'm ready, I'm
ready, I'm ready" that's probably the only conflict Jackie and I have ever
had. She is awesome, I love her like a daughter and will forever.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the younger players learning from Bianca and
Whitney and others?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think maturity tonight -- I really, really hope we
move beyond this game, and we'll watch film, break it down, talk about things
and hopefully grow as a team, but when you make mistakes and things happen in
your life you've got to mature.  
We need to mature as a group and individually, when we're challenged on the
floor, when things aren't going well, to come together and fight through. And
the teams in this league are the ones that are strong with the best senior
leadership and have guards that can make plays.  
We've got to get a team that has all of those things. We've got to mature as a
team, and I'm excited -- today is not the day that or the platform you wanted
to see Brittany Spears have the worst game of her freshman career, but
hopefully she'll learn a great deal from it.  
I want to see our younger players evolve and see if we can play games and give
them an opportunity to compete out of the Big 12 and see how much they have
grown from the nonconference. They're young. I realize Jackie is a senior and
a great leader, but she is leading some young players that don't have a lot of
experience, and she has had her challenges. And Jackie doesn't think she has
done a great job leading this team, but she has, and she's basing that on wins
and losses, and I'm basing it on how we've grown as a group.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Jay Hawks from Kansas. Welcome. Coach
Bonnie Henrickson will make a comment or two and we will include the players
Kelly Kohn and Taylor McIntosh.  
Coach?  
COACH HENRICKSON: A lot of credit to our kids, a good first half effort. And I
give credit to Nebraska hitting big shots late, but I think our resiliency,
our best play out of the locker room on the year, we got some separation and
grew a lead for the first time, it felt like all year, but probably not all
year, but in the last two months, but Porscha Weddington, big offensive
rebound by Sade, big play by Kelly, and those two haven't been on the radar
screen lately.  
Kelly from injuries and Porscha from production and we were on the bus over
here, and I said, "Isn't that your best practice all year?" And she put her
head down and they told her, "Porscha, you need to tell Coach, 'yes, ma'am,
and I'm ready!'"  
Give Nebraska credit, they made a run at the end and made it closer than we
would have liked, but really exciting.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Taylor, this being potentially your last game in the Big 12, how much did
you not want to lose it?  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: I didn't want to lose any of the games this year, but I think
we're better than we've shown. And for the first time we were able to come out
of the locker room and keep our lead, instead of losing the first, and I
thought that was important.  
I started feeling good until they started cutting the lead slowly, and
everyone is happy and it's not like we didn't believe we couldn't win.  
  
Q. What was the difference in the second half, coming out and extending the
lead? And what was going through your mind as they were making the come-back
and how were you able to put that to rest and get the win?  
KELLY KOHN: I thought it was a huge goal for us. As coach said, probably the
best we've come out of the half, and the coaches went out of the locker room
at the half to make it seem like the beginning of the game and not just
halftime for us.  
It's a big growth for us, especially this time of the year in the tournament
for us to come out and win the first game. And that's something the coach has
been talking to us about all year, and it's a good thing we finally did it.  
  
Q. Kelly, talk about with 4:40 left, you hit the big 3 from the corner. What
was going through your mind? Through the season you haven't been able to play
as much because of injuries, but in the big moment, getting a big shot like
that.  
KELLY KOHN: I don't know if I can tell you how great it felt, but this season
has been tough for me individually, as far as dealing with injuries.  
You know, it's tough to try to come back once the conference has started and
find your rhythm again, and especially as a shooter it can be difficult. To
hit my shot is great, but certainly when we needed to break away from them
coming back, there was a lot of emotion. And I was just glad I could help my
team get more points up on the board and stretch the lead for us.  
  
Q. Taylor, seemed like from the start of the game you had a different look
to your team, almost poised out on the court. Did you have any different --
because you seem --  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: I felt loose and ready to play. Like, okay, this might be our
last conference game, so just leave it out on the floor and, you know, have no
regrets.  
So I felt it, and I think my teammates fed off of my energy. And then we just
kept it going and it just kind of feels good to get a rhythm and do all the
stuff we do in practice, and finally transferred it to the game, so it felt
great!  
  
Q. Taylor, what's this 6-11 deal? You've won the 6-11 game two years in a
row now. Is this similar to last year?  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: Oh, last year? It felt good. I told Bonnie two years in a row
we won the opening game! But I didn't pay attention to that --  
COACH HENRICKSON: We talked about the confidence of beating Oklahoma State
last year, and the confidence being able to beat Nebraska at home, and used
both of those.  
  
Q. Taylor, last year you did win that first game, but you didn't win the
second game. How are you approaching the second game this time?  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: Like I said, we have a different mind-set to us. A lot of
games we won in conference, we didn't get blown out. We lost by a couple of
mistakes at the end, so as long as we eliminate our turnovers and fouls --  
COACH HENRICKSON: I said if we turn it over 24 times we wouldn't win; we
turned it over 24.  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: Maybe if we turn it over more than we turn it over --  
COACH HENRICKSON: We did didn't do that either, Taylor.  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: We'll win if we do what we're supposed to do.  
COACH HENRICKSON: That's right, Taylor.  
  
Q. Kelly, it seemed that you had a lot of emotion and heart and a ton of
energy on the court tonight. Was it because you finally got to come back and
play from injuries, or because you got the win? What was the emotion for the
win out there tonight?  
KELLY KOHN: I don't know if I need much more personal motive, other than we
haven't won a lot of games down the stretch in the conference, and here we are
with a clean slate with a chance to go on a run that nobody besides ourselves
thinks we can do. So I don't know if I need anymore motivation than that.  
Like I said, personally, this has been a hard season for me, as far as
injuries and finding my rhythm and getting my confidence back on the court,
and it is time to lay it out. We have nothing to lose, really. We're coming
into this tournament thinking we're coming in to win it. And like I said,
everybody has a clean slate. That gives me all the motivation and confidence
in the world.  
  
Q. Taylor, going out with 4:25 left, how nervous were you on the bench?  
TAYLOR McINTOSH: I wasn't nervous, especially because everyone came off the
bench ready to play. Porscha came in and did what she's been doing in practice
lately. And Kelly and I was upset because I knew I should be on the court. And
the way I picked up the foul, I should have let it go, but at the same time, I
have confidence in my teammates, so I knew we could do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Bonnie Henrickson now.  
  
Q. Bonnie, it was noticeable tonight that you were, push, push, push the
ball.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. And that's not something you've been doing mostly this year. Is that the
late season mantra, to push it?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We talked about the respect for all the coaches in this
league, but we knew Nebraska wouldn't give us the quick looks.  
They're sagging. We weren't going to get her on a post, but a good read by her
in a play is what she got second half, but we knew they were going to take
away some of the looks we want, and we're going to take away some of what they
want. Although, it didn't look like it.  
So where you separate it is in transition. There is no scouting report in
place to -- and I think both teams did that; they pushed and ran on us and we
tried to run on them, but probably -- now I think we were 4 for 12 in the
half. I think our numbers were better in the second half, but trying to create
opportunities in transition has been an Achilles' heel for us against them,
but, again, trying to get a look before they can set up and take things away.  
  
Q. 33 points off of turnovers; that's got to be a season high, isn't it?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Absolutely, absolutely.  
  
Q. You did the two things in this game that you thought you didn't --
weren't going to be able to do to them, turnovers and fouls.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right.  
  
Q. What was the difference?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think we get high percentage shots; we shoot 65%, both
teams are hitting layups, and we got rebounds down the stretch and made the
extra pass when it was available. We drove and dropped it, and hung around the
rim.  
I thought we were good at times, on a box out in the first half. But I thought
we made the extra passing. There is a reason we shot 65%. We got good looks
and some uncontested looks. Our kids run unselfish, but a lot of times we're
not -- at the wing we can get the next guy and let go of a guy to guard us,
but that makes the post making themselves available to receive the pass, and
we did that better than we have recently.  
  
Q. Can you share your thoughts on the 11 and 12 seeds winning today?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Is it not fitting for the year that this league has had?
There's probably not a coach in the conference that's probably real surprised,
and it's not a knock to Nebraska or Oklahoma, or an extra pat on our backs or
Missouri, but that's the kind of year the league has had.  
It's got great coaches and venues to play on the road, and we've been in so
many one-possession games -- maybe not -- we've had our fair share with
literally the last possession, but we've been in one-possession games with
three and four minutes left, and not been able to finish, which is on us.  
You have a lot of teams hanging around, and there is not a lot of separation;
a lot of quality play in the league, and really just great battles back and
forth.  
  
Q. Sade came out aggressive tonight and made up for Danielle having a rough
night. Is that something she came in looking to do?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We always want Sade to come in looking good, and she is
going to guard the best offensive player. She's typically going to pick up the
ball in transition, and she does a lot of work that goes unnoticed physically,
as far as exhausting and how much work that takes, but I thought she played
aggressively, elevated and took good shots.  
It's a huge monster board in the middle of the lane that finished over the
rim, and that's game-changing. You can probably look at three or four that are
game-changing, but that's why we won. We did a good job down the stretch. A
lot of kids did a great job down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kelly and do you think she's been --  
COACH HENRICKSON: You've been bugging me about Kelly all year.  
  
Q. She's been the missing piece and --  
COACH HENRICKSON: She has been. Actually, I honestly thought about starting
her and then she came to practice and said her ankle was as sore as the day
she did it. And every time I've thought about getting her more time or
starting her, she got the flu, she got the chip in her ankle and the flu
twice.  
And all of the sudden -- so I thought, well -- but she practiced well, even
though she was in a lot of pain and I thought, let me just bring her off the
bench, she is playing confidently. And it's hard -- the game is so much about
confidence, and she lost it and struggled for a lot of reasons as far as not
being healthy, not producing and not being able to play.  
And she practiced as well as she has all year, and Porscha has practiced as
well down the stretch as she has all year. And it's about playing kids you
trust and putting those kids in the situations, and those two have done a
great job.  
Porscha Weddington spends as much time in the gym as anybody, and that gains
confidence. I said, get in there and get extra reps, Kelly -- she shoots --
makes 50 3's every day, and they were two kids I felt could help us down the
stretch, and just credit to both of those two to hang in there and come out
big.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by the Missouri Tigers, congratulations
Coach Stein. This is the first time that a 12th seed team has won in the
women's tournament so congratulations, if you would like to make an opening
comment and introduce your players?  
COACH STEIN: I would be proud to. Jessra Johnson, Alyssa Hollins and Amanda
Hanneman, all three a critical part of our success today. I think that 12
beating a 5 tells you how strong our conference is. I felt like -- everyone
kept saying, what are you going to do, because every time you come across is a
Top 25. Our conference is so good, they made us a Top 25 team tonight, and
that's all that matters!  
You don't live for tomorrow during the tournament unless you take care of
today, and I'm just really pleased. We had a lot of great plays from a lot of
outstanding young women today, and it was great to see everything connect
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Did you want to comment about your players?  
COACH STEIN: Gosh! Amanda Hanneman to my left hit a big 3, did a great job,
and Amanda played a smart ballgame today. That shot was a tremendous play! A
smart play! Alyssa Hollins, in between the two young ladies and Alyssa, I gave
her a minute break today, and I think that that's the most she's had in
probably 10 games and does a tremendous job. We've been riding her shoulders
all year.  
And Jessra Johnson, who took a few hits out there today, played very physical,
a physical game for her today. And obviously she gritted it out just a
tremendous fighter, and all three of them had a great hand in today's success.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, we'll take questions.  
  
Q. Amanda, what about the 3 you hit? You were right in front of me, took the
pass from Alyssa, and it looked like you were thinking about it and then
stepped back and shot 3. Did you feel like there was a second where you
weren't quite sure, or from the second you took the ball you knew that's what
you needed to do?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: I was actually going to go for a lay-up, but then I
remembered we were down by 3, so I stepped back and shot it.  
  
Q. Jessra, you got beat up out there today. I don't remember which twin it
was, but somebody landed on your head. What was it like banging against them
all day and still getting what you needed for offense?  
JESSRA JOHNSON: This is what you look for: I played like there was no tomorrow
and came out victorious, so I would do it again tomorrow if we had to.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you took the game over time and time again, talk about that.  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: There was a feeling in our huddle that we weren't going to
loose the game, and Amanda stepped up and got on the boards. And I was like, I
need to do something, and I got a couple to fall in overtime and, I'm so proud
of this team!  
  
Q. Both of you struggled a little shooting early on in overtime; I don't
know if you missed. What was it like being able to shake that off, knowing you
guys were still standing when you were down and coming out and managing to
shake that off and start hitting in overtime?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: I think you have to have a short memory. I wasn't thinking
about those misses in the game! I was just hoping to knock down shots and they
went down.  
JESSRA JOHNSON: When you're that close, you have to keep doing what you're
doing and come out victorious.  
  
Q. Alyssa, obviously the Paris twins had a good game, but you guys did a
good job of shutting down Oklahoma's supporting class on the perimeter. What
did you guys do defensively to do that?  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: Courtney is an all-American and she's going to get herself,
but we were just looking to cover her and staggering off other players and be
active with them and disrupt their offensive flow. I think we did a good job.
So.  
  
Q. What are some of the first thoughts that go through y'all's mind when you
hear this is the first time a 12 seed has ever won?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: We are just smiles all across everybody's faces and we made
history!  
ALYSSA HOLLINS: With the season that we've had, we're going to keep fighting.
Knowing we made history, it means a lot for the future, even tomorrow and
talking about next year, so it means the world to this team!  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow. Good luck.  
Coach, did you want to say anything else?  
  
Q. Love what we heard from these three, but I want you to talk about the
play of some of the people that weren't here, five steals and four assists for
Toy Richbow, doesn't get talked about a lot, but made a real difference in
what she did and talk about what Shak did today.  
COACH STEIN: Shakara gave us great presence inside, and we wanted to make sure
we were attacking inside. We wanted to go at the twins. Our whole mindset was
they're a great team, but we weren't going to stand back and shoot jumpers
around them, we wanted to make sure we were attacking. And Shakara definitely
did that and Toy had a great game.  
She picked up that third, it didn't rattle her. She came back out, was playing
aggressively, as much as playing with three fouls, and controlled the ballgame
and that's what you've got to have. Her maturation process has been very good
leading into this game.  
  
Q. Follow up. You I talked three or four times this season about the fact
that we had these three players being such a big part of the offense. How
significant is it that Amanda had the game she had and she was the one who hit
that big 3?  
COACH STEIN: It's huge for us. We've been talking about that with our team is
that we've got to have five threats on the floor, and we don't want to be
playing four on five, and Amanda takes that seriously.  
She works hard at it and I think she plays very well in Kansas City. She loves
playing in front of her family so they've got to go to every game now
(Chuckles.) Because she hit a great one.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering how you deal with Courtney down low, 16 points, 14
rebounds. The rebounds, there is no way she is anywhere near their size and
still fighting for them.  
And on the point, I don't know how she had anything left on offense. The few
times she got knocked down, it didn't look like she was going to make it to
the other end of the court.  
COACH STEIN: Jessra is strong and that's what allows her to get the rebounds.
Jessra is very explosive. She can position herself very well and her strength
allows her to do those things against the twins, and she just really battles.  
We knew for us to outrebound them, maybe it wasn't going to be there, but we
needed to stay in the fight on every single rebound. We may not get it, but we
got to be in the fight and not abandon ship. And Jessra was in there the whole
time trying to put a hand on it, grab it, and came up with some big ones there
at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned her aggressiveness, but what else did you see from
Shak, especially on the offensive end taking it to an All-American player,
especially as a freshman?  
COACH STEIN: I liked her confidence. I thought she was very confident tonight,
and she is a very good player and she's going to get better and better, and
she wanted the basketball. I can tell you there are a lot of kids, when
Courtney Paris is guarding them they, don't want the basketball.  
  
Q. Cindy, they have 26 offensive rebounds in the game, but the one they
didn't get was with 20 seconds in regulation. Three of your players converged
to set up the Hanneman shot. Take us through that.  
COACH STEIN: I would like to think I remember it, Brenda. (Chuckles.) Our kids
battled and that's why I liked the entire game, is that they just battled.
There was a two-minute spurt right before the half that I thought our
possessions weren't very good, but on the defensive end, we went in there and
worked hard and that's what you've got to do.  
We were outsized and they have a lot more depth than we do, and we had to stay
in there. That's exactly what they did, is we told them five people cannot
leave that end until we get the ball.  
  
Q. Cindy, talk about how Shak went so delayed in the second half without
picking up a foul.  
COACH STEIN: Isn't that an amazing thing? She's been playing really well
positionwise. I said it from the start, is that this conference -- I think
it's made us so much better.  
Even though it doesn't -- our record doesn't indicate that, it's made us so
much better. Especially with Shakara -- she has had to go up against so many
great players. She has learned a lot. I think that's part of it. The things
you saw today, she's learned. From a position standpoint, move your feet and
go with what they're calling and go around some of those things and how to get
open. She learned so much.  
  
Q. Coach, Texas A &M tomorrow, can you talk about the challenge for
tomorrow?   
COACH STEIN: I think that's -- Texas A&M, as everyone knows, they're a tough
team, great defensive team. I think that probably all their starters were
nominated for defensive team members and defensive players of the year in our
conference because they're that good.  
So obviously our offensive possessions are going to be important and they have
tremendous players and athletes and it's another challenge for us. That's how
we look at it. We knew we couldn't -- we haven't looked too far at Texas A&M
because we knew we had to get past Oklahoma, so we put everything into
Oklahoma. As soon as we get back, we'll start concentrating on them, but
they're a great team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck, we'll see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Yori has joined us up here and we would like to let you
make a few opening comments.  
COACH YORI: Well, it's the story of the season. In the Big 12, you look at
what happened today, 11 and 12 win against 5 and 6. Not a surprise to anyone
because of the competition level in this league and, how great this league is.  
And I thought Kansas played very, very hard. I thought they executed very
well. They got some transition baskets, they looked to attack us in transition
particularly early. I thought we were a little bit on our heels early when
they were attacking us, and they got some easy baskets.  
I thought we did a better job as the game got going of taking that away, but
we dug ourselves in a hole and we tried to battle back a couple times, and
basically ran out of time. Credit to their players, I thought they did a
really good job of making extra passes.  
You look at the fact that they had 20 assists, they turned it over a bit, but
they did a nice job of finding the extra person within the course of their
offense, and, you know, on our end we did some things right.  
We missed a lot of easy shots, but in order to win at this level, you've got
to cash in on those, and we probably missed six or eight point-blank shots
right at the rim, and that could have changed the complex of the game. You've
got to make those. Today was not our day to make those, for whatever reason.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the athletes?  
  
Q. Danielle, maybe you don't remember this segment of the game, but I think
you guys were within 6 and got a turnover, and they got the ball to you for
one of those point blank shots and you couldn't get it to go down. And then
Kansas takes off on that run where they get it out to 17.  
Does that kinda -- is that how this game feels to you, just if you break it
down, you know, the frustration of that possession, and then what happened
after it?  
DANIELLE PAGE: Um, I guess I don't really specifically remember that
possession. I remember missing a lot of point-blank layups, but, yeah, the
game was frustrating. We just weren't doing enough little things right on both
ends, I think.  
If we could have cleaned it up, executed better offensively, taken away a
couple of looks on defense, we would have come out with a win.  
  
Q. Did this bring about anxiety for the next few days while you wait to see
what happens? Or are you still feeling comfortable about it?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, I don't know if it's anxiety raising. I think we went
into this hoping to improve our seeding and you don't know, it's up to them to
decide. So nothing is for sure, but we've got to get back in the gym and work
on some things. And whatever ends up happening, we will be prepared for it.  
  
Q. How hard is it to feel as good as you guys did to finish the season with
Iowa State and Colorado, and then come in here and, obviously like Connie
said, having 11 and 12 seeds win and obviously being on the other end of it?
How hard is it to go back to Lincoln?  
DANIELLE PAGE: Well, it is hard, but you have to credit Kansas, they played a
great game. They did a lot of things right. They did more things right than we
did, and that's what basketball games usually come down to.  
To go back to Lincoln, if anything, I hope our team can use it as motivation
that we are a great basketball team. And if we do clean up and play like we
know how to play and like we can play, we should take confidence, if anything,
from this loss, in that we're maybe a much better basketball team than we
showed.  
Kansas played a great game, made us do things we didn't want to do
necessarily, but we can use that going into the tournament and hopefully use
that in the games to come.  
  
Q. In the first half, you guys had trouble on offense. Was it you guys or
was it something Kansas was doing to bother you?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I think it was a combination of both. Kansas executed well on
defense today, and they took away some of the looks that we were trying to
get. They were playing us tough in the post, really being physical down there
on us. But, you know, it was also -- it was us. We were missing a lot of easy
shots that we normally make and should have made today. I think if we would
have made those shots, it would have been a different game.  
  
Q. Would you two say that in the realm of 12 games, this was more physical?
About average?  
DANIELLE PAGE: It was about average, and we go out in the Big 12 playing hard
and you expect to get -- maybe that's why some of those didn't drop, because
we were expecting to get bumped and we didn't. But, no, it was about normal.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Connie, I thought they made you guys work hard offensively. Were they
working off the same kinds of things as when you saw them previously in the
regular season, or did they start somewhere else?  
COACH YORI: Kansas is a very good defensive team. I'm not so sure they aren't
one of the best in our league, and when you look at what they -- their
pressure is good.  
They've got big guards, reasonably big guards that can provide a challenge.
They work hard on the low block, they're going to turn you over some because
of their pressure. You know, we just -- we were coming off two games where we
weren't very pressured, and all of the sudden, you know, you play a team
that's going to pressure you and you've got to make that adjustment.  
I think Kansas really throughout the year is one of the hardest teams in our
league to score against. I think they're very, very sound, and I think they've
gotten better as the year has gone by. Their rotation is better, they don't
make as many mistakes in the rotation, and they are hard to score on.  
And you look at what they've given up, and I thought going into this game it
would be a difficult game for us to score, and obviously it was, particularly
in the first half.  
  
Q. Looking just kind of at the fact that there was no lead change and no
tied score after 0-0, what's that do to the psyche in a game -- in a game so
close when you just don't get over the hump?  
COACH YORI: In the psyche of the game? I'm not sure what you're getting at.  
  
Q. When you can't get over that barrier and there is no lead change in the
game --  
COACH YORI: Well, yeah, and our team has been a team of runs all year. This
game was very, very much the same, very indicative of the way we play.  
You know, you may think, why isn't she calling a time out? What's going on?
And we'll bounce back and make a 6-0 run, and that's the style that we play.
And we've been like that. Our kids actually, I think, are really good at
playing from behind. We've been that way all year.  
We don't want to play from behind, but when we have, we've actually played
pretty well. So I thought our team was still competent, even though we got
down big, that we had time to get back in the game. And obviously we did, and
we kept saying, hey, we can get back in this game. And our players responded
and that's the mentality that our kids have.  
And we've had a number of games this year that we've won when we've been down
by double digits. I didn't feel like there was any point in the game where,
hey, we can't win that game. Now, of course, when it got to whatever it was in
the second half, 17, you've got to be a little bit worried, but I felt like we
could still win if he just put together some good basketball.  
  
Q. How did you feel about your team's energy, though, to come out -- I know
you don't want to take away what Kansas did, but it seemed like they were
always getting to things?  
COACH YORI: I would agree. I thought they got the loose balls tonight. You can
say, hey, they shoot 53% and we shoot 33%, well, there is a reason that
happens. And they've got -- you know, number 1, they got to more loose balls.  
I thought until the latter part of the game when we made a push -- that's
credit to Kansas, but also I'm not -- you know, there was times where I
thought we needed to get on the floor, but at the same time I -- I thought we
played on our heels more than anything.  
I thought we just kinda played -- when they started transitioning early in the
game, I don't think we responded very well to that until midway through the
first half did we finally get back in transition. But Kansas definitely was
sharp. They were focused and they executed well.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck in the postseason.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Ashley Lindsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18076)

### [Brittainey Raven](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18078)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Overall pleased with the win. It's tough to turn around and
play somebody that you played during the regular season. At the same time, it
helped with the scouting. We know them and they know us, so it was really
about going out and playing. And, again, I thought we did a nice job overall
defensively.  
You know, they love to hit 3's against us. We were trying to protect the
paint, and I thought they did a good job -- we did a good job. However, they
hit the 3's, and they fought to the bitter end. Overall pleased with my team.
I thought we had nice balance.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: This is Brittainey Raven, Ashley Lindsey and Kathleen Nash.  
THE MODERATOR: First student athlete question.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about y'all's transition game, turning their
mistakes into a lot of fast break points tonight?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: We got a lot of our points from being in good position, and
we had good ball pressure and we did a good job of running the lanes and made
the layups at present.  
  
Q. Brittainey, y'all turned 'em over quite a bit in some of your other
games. Was that a big plan going into tonight?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I think the last four games we've played has been all about
defense and, we've done a great job communicating on the defensive end and
helping each other out a lot. And I think it's paid off in the last four games
we've won, so I think that was our main focus.  
  
Q. Kathleen, can you talk about the offense? I know it's all about defense
and rebounding, but it looks like the confidence is coming, the offense is
coming.  
KATHLEEN NASH: I think we've been working on this in practice, and everything
penetrating and kicking, and I think that's a lot of what we did tonight. We
either penetrated and scored or penetrated and kicked. Our post did a good job
inside, so that opened up things outside, too.  
  
Q. Ashley, can you talk a little bit about being able to shutdown Dominic
Seals in the post and your defensive game out there?  
ASHLEY LINDSEY: It wasn't just me, Earnesia Williams and everybody else was on
Dominic, but our defensive plan was to stop her and limit her touches inside,
which we did. Pretty much it.  
  
Q. Kathleen, ever since the home loss to Texas A &M, you guys are playing
with more confidence. Can you tell me what's changed in the last three or four
games?   
KATHLEEN NASH: I think we're playing with more fire now, executing on offense
and doing what the coaches tell us to do. Just knowing that we really need to
win, and I think that's inspired us, so we're just -- I don't know.  
  
Q. Brittainey, did this seem kind of like the same way as the last match-up,
when you guys get an early lead and have a shoot-out in the second half?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: This time, I think they took the lead early, they were up,
hitting a lot of outside shots and they made their run. And we tried to
tighten up on the defensive end, and there were a lot of runs, but we
continued to fight and pulled it away.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about the confidence in this team, what's been
going on in this win streak and how this team is different?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: Um, I think once we got our first away victory, I think that
helped our confidence and we played together and everybody stepped up in that
game.  
In the LU game, we fought really hard, and beating LU was good for us, that
boosted our confidence and people stepped up and showed that they were able to
get out there and play and help the team out.  
And I think encouraging each other and coaches encouraging us and just staying
positive and playing hard and fighting out there and wanting to get the win is
what's helped us get our confidence back.  
  
Q. Brittainey, can you talk about how much you've grown up in your game, and
as a co-captain, how much responsibility has Coach Gail put on your
shoulders?  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I think at the beginning of the season, it was tough for me
to take on the leadership role, but my teammates helped me out with my
confidence. And coach G and the coaching staff talked with me and told me I
can be a great leader, I just have to keep working on it.  
I think at the beginning of the season I struggled, but down the line, I
matured a little bit and learned more about the game and going with the flow
and things have been going good for us right now.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: Not there yet; trying to get there, a good leader.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Neisha Bailey's game, how important it was for
her to have a big game coming back to her hometown and everything?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think her best game was when we played at Kansas, and I
think it was a turning point game for her. We felt like if we lost that game,
our chances of getting in the NCAA tournament were close to none.  
And there was a point in that game where she just -- I said you have to -- I
say now or never, basically, and she came out on fire and played with such
aggression and set the tone for the rest of the team.  
She just felt very, very confident. And she's really closed out the season in
that fashion. So I know she's got many family members here, and I think that
gives her a sense of confidence as well.  
  
Q. Is Brittainey a great leader yet?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: No. No, she's not -- she's come a long way; she's just a
sophomore. I think it's hard for a sophomore to lead upperclassman, and it's
hard for a sophomore to lead when she's trying to find her way.  
She has turned the corner this year for us, and playing with much more poise
than she ever has and understanding better when we need her to attack, and
when she needs to pull back and we need to execute our offenses.  
Brittainey is extremely sensitive, and she wants everybody to always be happy,
and that's a great quality. However, we've talked about when you're a great
leader, sometimes you have to say hard things to your teammates and not care
what they think about you, just that they respect you. That is still a process
for her, and she has come a long way. I've told her by the time she leads, she
could be one of my greatest leaders, as she's only a sophomore.  
  
Q. Coach, how have you helped her to learn the game, Brittainey? And when
you said to E-Bai, it's now or never, what did you mean? I'm assuming it's
because she's a senior and time for her to crank it up?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right, and she is a tremendous athlete, but she wasn't
using her athleticism, and we knew it was time. And there comes a point in
everybody's season where everybody has to decide to put it all out on the
line, and that was her moment.  
As far as Brittainey, you know, we've watched a lot of tape together, so she
could see when she was a little bit out of control and when she was making
good decisions. And she and I -- we worked together for a half hour before
every single practice. She has been very willing to put in extra time, and I
think it's paid off for her and our team.  
  
Q. Coach, Brittainey mentioned Carla being able to get the ball to people in
transition. She also had four steals tonight on defense. How much of that is
her hustling to the loose balls, how much of that is -- the players being able
to get hands in passing lanes and knock the ball around?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Carla has the quickest hands of any guard I've coached. She
has incredibly quick hands, so she does get her hands on a lot of passes. I
thought she did a great job tonight, and she is a smart player. And she knows
if it's a foot race, Brittainey Raven is going to beat almost anybody in the
country. So she does a great job of passing the ball ahead and letting
Brittainey catch up to it.  
  
Q. Can you compare the confidence level your team is playing with now
compared to the game in Austin?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: No comparison. The A&M game, I think that was the lowest
point for our team, as far as our confidence level. I'm just really proud of
the team.  
After that game, we had a long talk the next day and we could have either
tanked or we were going to step up and put -- like I said, put it all out
there, be willing to put everything on the line and not worry about whether
it's going to be a win or a loss, just know that you gave your greatest
effort. And I think the players have seen when they do put forth that greatest
effort, they've done well and our confidence has continued to grow.  
  
Q. Texas Tech shot the ball well, took an 8-4 lead and you guys came back
with a 15-0 run. How did you do that and why was that important to take the
momentum back? Because you never lost a double digit lead after that.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We've been hyped in many, many games, and we've had the
ability to come back. So if a team takes a lead on us, we don't panic. We
stayed positioned and stayed with the game plan, and even though they hit a
couple of shots, we were playing percentages, and we said, okay, if they want
to continue to take the 3, it's okay. And they shot really, really well from
the 3.  
And we talked about it at halftime; they hit six 3's, they average three 3's,
we need to go out and get them. Well, no, it's working, let's show patience
and stick with the defensive game plan that we have.  
  
Q. Gail, how is your team different from what you played Baylor? You beat
'em the last time you played them, but can you talk about that match-up?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It was a while ago, but I feel like it was a great game for
us as well in that we played with a lot of confidence. We made tremendous
hustle plays in that game and we got great contributions, really, from
everybody.  
So that was -- at that point that was our biggest win of the year, and then we
turned around and lost at Colorado and we lost our confidence at that point.
Now we have our confidence back. I think we've had two great games with them.
I expect tomorrow will be an exciting game as well.  
  
Q. I think the last time I saw you at a conference tournament was in South
Carolina. You're used to playing a conference tournament a week earlier for 15
years. Can you talk about the difference in the Big 12 -- this is the only
major women's conference that has it this late. What's it like as opposed to
having a week to be looking forward to the NCAA instead of playing?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I always admired the Big 12 because they got to play later.
I felt like you got to stay in your rhythm heading into the NCAA tournament.
It was tough, especially we were talking today there were a few years at Duke
it happened to be our bye week was the last week of the season, and then we
would play in the tournament and have a week off and then you would play the
next week, so we played two games in 21 days.  
That's hard when you're in a rhythm and feeling good about who you are you
want to continue to play and get out there. Now, again, there were times when
I had only 8 players on the team, when having that week off we needed
desperately because we were so fatigued, so I think it can work either way,
depending on the injuries and the depth of your team.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is your first year in the Big 12, but what have you
seen from Kristy Curry and the progress of her program from the beginning of
the season to the end?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: They've come so far, and if they can shoot the 3 like they
did in the last two games against us, they will be a force to be reckoned
with.  
She brought in so many new players this year, even though it wasn't her first
year, the turnover was so incredible that it was like a first year for her,
because she had so many new faces.  
You can see that the team is more comfortable with the sets that they're
running and understanding what she wants and needs on both ends of the floor.
I think next you're going to see unbelievable improvement from them. They
started to gel. It's a shame it's at the end of the season, but I think it
gives them great excitement heading into next year.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach Bill Fennelly make an opening comment, and then
we will take questions and then release the student athletes and take
questions for Coach again. Coach Fennelly, congratulations and go ahead.  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I would like to say the respect I have for
Jackie McFarland and Susie Powers. They're great representatives of CU, and
I'm glad we don't have to guard Jackie anymore.  
But in all honesty, I don't know that we could have played any better. We
talked about it as a group before the game. We hadn't gotten it all together,
but we played great, shot it great and defended at a perfect time. We valued
the ball, made shots.  
You know when you get into this kind of environment, you want to feel like you
did the best you could, and I feel bad for Colorado because they caught us on
a great day. We should play all of our games at noon. Just excited to keep
playing and stay in Kansas City and we'll look forward to tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Heather, you said you watched the game here before, more fun to play?  
HEATHER EZELL: Definitely more fun to play. It's a great environment,
especially with our fans. We had a huge turnout, which is awesome, and a lot
of fun to play.  
  
Q. You didn't score for the first 11 or 12 minutes then it just clicked.
What happened from -- remember the 8-minute mark you made the first shot then
a couple of 3s? What clicked for you at that point?  
HEATHER EZELL: I was able to get some open shots and they fouled so just kept
shooting.  
  
Q. Heather, can you just as a player describe to us mortals what it's like
to be absolutely on fire? Did the hoop feel like a swimming pool? What was it
like?  
HEATHER EZELL: It felt good. When you get your first shot to fall and the
second, it makes things a lot easier for you, and my teammates gave me the
ball when I was in a position to hit the shot, and that was nice. I know
someone said at halftime, "Were you doing a heat check and letting it fly?"  
Once you get in that mode and everything -- you just kinda forget about how
many you're shooting or making, you're just doing what you do.  
  
Q. Allison, I don't have a final count but I'm sure 10 of those assists went
to Heather.  
ALISON LACEY: Thank you Heather.  
  
Q. How cognizant were you of getting her the ball while she was in rhythm?  
ALISON LACEY: That was my thought, where was Heather, and in the end when we
were in trouble, everyone looked to Heather and she stepped up and made huge
shots today.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. You guys had a rough time the first time you
played K State and a much closer game in Ames. Can you talk about the third
match up and what you need to do to upset them?  
HEATHER EZELL: I think we have to focus on defense and then hopefully we can
shoot the way we did today and put points on the board. Main thing we're going
to focus on is our defensive end.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, entering the second half you guys extended your lead,
but right from the start of the second half you went on a run, an extended
run. Did you think that was something you had to do, take the bull by the
horns early?  
HEATHER EZELL: We wanted to jump out in the first four minutes and knew we had
to keep fighting and doing what we were doing, and luckily coming out of
halftime our shots were falling, we were hitting them and getting stops on
defense and made big shots to open up the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Alison?  
ALISON LACEY: That was good.  
  
Q. Alison, the fact that Kelsey ended the shot at the quarter, did that give
you momentum?  
ALISON LACEY: I can't remember many games when shots like that go in for us,
so everyone was happy and cheering and screaming in the locker room, so it was
good for her and for the team!  
  
Q. Heather, can you talk about what this team has been through? A lot of
kids maybe have to play minutes they weren't expecting to play, because of
injuries, and here you are?  
HEATHER EZELL: Coming into the season you talk about how you are going to
replace people that have left, and I thought we did a good job, and then
losing T. And Nicky, they had to step up more and take on more minutes,
putting up more shots and everything like that. I think "As" doesn't get
enough credit sometimes.  
She has to shoot the ball maybe more than somebody would, and you have to step
up and get a look at the basket sometimes, and I think the biggest thing is
our coach has done a great job of preparing us for the games. We come in with
the greatest game plans we could ask for and they give us a chance to win
night in and night out. So you have to give credit to them; they put us in a
position to win.  
  
Q. Heather, did you know you tied the record for most 3-pointers made in a
Big 12 game?  
HEATHER EZELL: I didn't know that until we came down here and Aaron Smith let
me know. It's not something I focus on. If it comes, it comes but I'm just
glad we got the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Fennelly now?  
  
Q. Bill, could you talk about the job your post players did on McFarland on
the second half and when Genesis went in for Jocelyn?  
COACH FENNELLY: We always talk about trying to find a way to impact winning,
and we didn't score in the post tonight, but Joce and Gen did a great job of
defending Jackie McFarland. She ended up with 21 points; I thought all of them
did a great job, and they were a little down because when you don't make shots
your head drops down a bit. We're 19-11 and we're not 19-11 playing tomorrow
without Jocelyn Anderson and Amanda Nisleit. It's not an option.  
Sometimes you've got to do the dirty work, and it was defense for them today,
and the other kids made shots. There has been other games where Joce has
carried us, and I honestly believe it's one of the greatest stories in the
country what Jocelyn Anderson is doing, what we've asked her to do.  
Amanda is 6-foot playing on half a foot and guarding Jackie, and it's not fun
to do. It's not fun to go in there and get your butt kicked, and they're going
to throw it in there every single time, and you want to give them credit, they
deserve it, but it's hard when you're a young person and you're focused on how
many shots you made. They're not here.  
Everyone wants to see Heather because she made the shots. They found a way to
be successful, and tonight it was our guards making shots and our big people
grinding it out on defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the huge turnover differential, 20-5, which is also a
tournament record?  
COACH FENNELLY: We really took care of the ball. We added a couple of wrinkles
in our offense to open up the court, but Alison did a phenomenal job of
delivering the ball, making good decisions. When you play at this level and
you turn the ball over only five times, that says a lot. And we got rid of the
illegal screens, the three seconds, the travels, some of the things that have
been killing us losing possessions.  
You're going to get assists when people are making shots, and we had one of
those games or like the play Kelsey made at halftime, or the loose ball in the
corner and she shoots it. Heather had one of those games that Heather has been
looking to have, so when you value the ball like that you have a chance. The
trouble we have had all year is trouble scoring, and offensively we were as
good tonight as we've been in a long time, maybe all year.  
  
Q. Every one of these games is going to be for your team an audition for the
NCAA tournament. How important is it to continue this run tomorrow and into
the weekend?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think at this point the Big 12 is the biggest tournament
going right now, and you have a chance to play when everyone else is sitting
and watching. So you have a opportunity -- the ACC, the SEC, the Pac 10,
they're all done, so the focus of the basketball world is on the Big 12, and
all we can do is play to the level that we're capable of and hope it's good
enough.  
I don't know, I've never -- I'm not big on politics to get into the NCAA, and
I think it's a great opportunity to show people what kind of team we have, and
I think we showed people today that we have the ability to play at a very high
level, and certainly playing the number 1 team in the Big 12, the Big 12
champion tomorrow is an opportunity for an audition, but a very tough one, but
at least we get to play 'em! The good news is we get to play 'em!  
  
Q. Coach, I know you don't take any pleasure with the margin of victory, but
how nice was it to have that luxury to get your starters off the floor?  
COACH FENNELLY: You never want the game to get out of hand and that's not -- I
don't think -- I've been a head coach 20 years, and I can honestly say I've
never purposely run the score up, and we were making shots, but I think the
biggest thing was it was nice to see all the kids play.  
We have a lot of kids that have done a lot of things and they don't get a lot
of credit, but they get to get out there and play in the Big 12 and run around
and have people cheer for them, and you don't get that at this level.  
They were as excited as anyone to get in there and play, and that's a neat
thing to see, that, you know -- we all say we win as a team, we mean it, but
there are people that don't feel a part of it at times because they don't get
the attention and don't get to play, and you get to play four minutes in the
greatest tournament in this country; they'll remember that, and they'll tell
their kids they made shots and they played twelve minutes as opposed to four
minutes, and they were the key to winning -- you're in the box score, that's
what counts, man! More than I ever got in!  
  
Q. Bill, do you think about that game in Ames with K State? You said you
felt like you had guarded them as well as you could. If you are able to do
that, is offense the key?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't think there is any doubt, Michelle, that offensively
-- K State is a great defensive team. They do a lot of switching. In Ames they
switched almost every screen and made it hard to get something going to the
basket. We've got to do a better job of getting the ball to the free-throw
line and not just making shots from the perimeter. Kimberly Dietz had more
points at halftime than anyone on our team did.  
They're going to make the shots. We held them to 45 at our place; the pace was
slow, but, you know, we've got to defend similarly to what we did in Ames, the
opposite of what we did in Manhattan. We scored 49 and 42 against them, so
we're not an offensive juggernaut against them, and the confidence that our
kids have should be high and hopefully they're relaxed. And I'm not big in the
you-got-nothing-to-lose thing, because you have a game to lose.  
There is no pressure on this team. You're playing the No. 1 seed in the
tournament, and I'm glad we played today, and roll it out there and see what
happens tomorrow. I think what you'll see tomorrow are four phenomenal games,
and it's a great way to showcase our league, and you could have eight teams
all playing in the NCAA tournament after tomorrow.  
  
Q. What is entailed in the greatest game plan that any player could ever ask
for? Heather --  
COACH FENNELLY: Heather gets to shoot, I guess. They have to say that, you
know, it's required! I tell 'em that, make sure you talk the coach up because
my bosses are here and you're always getting evaluated. It's fun to win, but
-- my son flew in and surprised me! Thank you everyone!  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Jordan Murphree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18080)

### [Dominic Seals](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18079)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Kristy Curry from Texas Tech, make an opening statement.  
COACH CURRY: I think you have to give Texas a lot of credit. Congratulations
to Gail and her squad, and best of luck to them.  
Again, they were able to make a few more plays and shots, and you have to
credit Texas.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Dominic Seals and Jordan Murphree.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about the way that your team shot the ball today. At
the same time, it seemed like every time you got into a rhythm, they would
answer.  
JORDAN MURPHREE: I think they did get into a rhythm, and I think we saw that
and needed to make more stops defensively. We could never get in that rhythm,
so we had to counter it with our defensive end, and I don't think we got to
that point.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about ball security and, you know, they obviously
took a ton of transition points off y'all's turnovers and stuff. Is it that
they were in the passing lanes, there was no space? What do you think overall,
they were able to fluster you into turnovers?  
JORDAN MURPHREE: We weren't securing the ball and we didn't do a good job of
meeting our passes, and I think that hurt us.  
  
Q. Dominic, can you talk about early on they seemed to keep you limited in
the first half, and then you got going in the second half. Talk about what
they did in the first half against you.  
DOMINIC SEALS: In the first half they tried to double me and knock the ball
out of my hand, and then on the second half I wasn't knocking down shots like
I was supposed to.  
In the second half, I had the momentum that I knew we had to come out and play
hard, and I had to do better than I was doing the first half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it's meant to play with Erin and what it's going
to mean to you to be playing without her?  
DOMINIC SEALS: When I was in junior college, watching Erin play, she played
hard and gave her all. This year she has been a great leader to us. I hope she
has a wonderful life and just is a good person, because that's what she is and
she ain't been nothing but positive to us.  
JORDAN MURPHREE: I came in as a freshman and looked to her. She is successful
on and off the court, and I think she'll be successful in the business world.  
  
Q. Dominic, what do you think you're going to remember most about this
season when you look back on it in a few years, when you're a little bit
older?  
DOMINIC SEALS: I'm going to look back and say that, you know, we fought like
every game we played since day one, since we played Baylor. We came in with
the heart to win every game, but it's just not always in our hands. But when
you look at it in the sense you can't do nothing but smile about it, coming
from junior college to the Big 12 is nothing but a blessing.  
  
Q. Jordan, your outside shooting, that was slow to come along this year. Do
you feel like you've got that taken care of going into the rest of the
postseason and next year?  
JORDAN MURPHREE: I wouldn't say I have it taken care of, because I missed a
few tonight, but I've been working on it and I will continue to work on it,
and hopefully it will be better next season.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CURRY: I think Vonnie Henderson came a long way and everybody has, and I
think that should be one of our strengths, hopefully next year, if we keep
working on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kristy Curry.  
  
Q. How much of this Texas team improved defensively from the first time you
saw them to these last two games?  
COACH CURRY: I think Texas has always been known for their defense, the past
years, getting up in the lanes, full court pressure. I think for years at
Texas Tech that's been their forte, and they turn their defense into offense.  
And Gail has done a great job of continuing that tradition, and the kids are a
year older and better and they're athletic and quick. When you're athletic and
you've got those long arms, you can disrupt a lot.  
  
Q. What do you think is different about Texas now versus when you guys beat
'em in Lubbock, what's the biggest difference?  
COACH CURRY: Their balance, they're having people step up, three people in
double figures for them, Brittainey, Raven, Carla, much better play at the 1
without question. I could go on and on, but I think those are things that are
glaring, their two freshman, Nash has been giving 8, 9, 10 points, going to
the offensive glass, doing the dirty work, so she's done a nice job of making
them better as well. I really like her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the early stages of the game; you came out and took a
quick lead and then they go on a huge run to take the lead back and never gave
it up.  
COACH CURRY: I think the biggest thing about today is similar to what we've
been through all year. When you have a 2-1 turnover to assist ratio, you want
it to be reversed, and that's what we've had trouble with all year. You can't
have 23 turnovers to 12 assists, it's got to be 12 to 23 and that's what
happened all year.  
We weren't able to convert, make plays, finish shots, pretty much that's the
game. We miss a layup at the end of the first half and missed one at the
beginning of the second half. You've got to make those.  
  
Q. Technically this is your second year, but with all the turnover this
year, did it almost feel like it was a first year?  
COACH CURRY: Without question, you look down our roster tonight, 6 out of 9
kids that took the floor have never played in a Big 12 tournament. That was
the situation we inherited; we're going to turn it into a positive. We're
building for the future and we're going to stay positive and roll up our
sleeves.  
And the thing about it is, as hard as it's been, I consider it a blessing, a
wonderful opportunity to help these kids and we're going to get it back to
where we want it to be. It's just not going to be easy and it's not an easy
league to build back in.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you're in a better position now than you were last
year?  
COACH CURRY: I don't look back, I look ahead. Whether it's good, bad, happy,
sad, it's over. You learn from it, grow from it, turn it into good, and there
is no question we're excited. We have three new faces coming in, possibly a
fourth, and our goal is to try to get to the WNIT, and we're going to work
hard. And I think these kids have a chance to keep playing.  
  
Q. Regardless of what may or may not happen with the NIT, can you talk about
ball security, and when you go into the off-season, whenever that is, guard
play with that, how important is that going to be for y'all's long-term
future?  
COACH CURRY: I don't think there is any question, like I've said, Brian, it's
experience, it's handling the basketball at this level. And when you look at
our guard spots, you know, we put Vonnie Henderson to the 1, she is coming
back, and we've got to be stronger with the basketball, secure the basketball
better.  
It's a level of toughness with and without the ball, moving with and without
the ball. A lot of our turnovers come because we're not moving that well
without the ball away from the ball, spacing, all the little things.  
It's not so much who has the ball in their hands as what's happening away from
the ball. The more they play, the more they understand, and the more they're
having the opportunity to get better with every day.  
We're at our best when the assist/turnovers are 2-to-1 the other way. Maria
Moore probably had one of her better games, but she's got to learn to be
consistent with that. We've not been able to get perimeter play on a
consistent basis in two or three of the team players all at once.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Erin and the two years you got to spend
with her?  
COACH CURRY: Erin has done a nice job of being the epitome of what a student
athlete should be. The Big 12 academic team, it's not easy to lead eight new
faces, from my red shirt that sat with an injury, but she has had a great
chore and did a great job, and I think she wants to take y'all's job in
broadcasting, so you guys better watch out.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team when you huddled in the middle of the court
before you left for the locker room?  
COACH CURRY: I told them we're going to be here next year, and we're going to
be looking a whole lot better and hold their shoulders back and hold their
chins up and walk over to the bench and sing the song the way they should do
and to go over and thank those fans. We appreciate the fans, and hopefully
we'll get a chance to take it back home and play a little bit of basketball at
home.  
  
Q. Do you like your chances for the NIT? And if so, what do you hope to get
out of it?  
COACH CURRY: I think postseason, anytime you have an opportunity of something
that you think -- believe me, the NIT is not what Kristy Curry and Texas Tech
are about, but it's what we need to be about right now. It's the point where
in our program and what we need to do -- our goal is to get to the NCAA
tournament.  
You look at teams across the country that have been to this, it's learning
what postseason play is. And the more we play, the better we're going to get.
And when we're not playing, we're going to roll up our sleeves and have
individual workouts and continue to play in April and May.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck in the postseason.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2008

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Courtney Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13851)

### [Ashley Paris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16964)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH COALE: Give credit to Missouri, I thought they played hard with a great
deal of confidence and a spring in their step, and had a lot of guys wanting
to score the basketball and they did so, obviously.  
End of regulation, huge, but a lot of good plays along the way. Give them
credit; I thought they fought and they were a team that got better over the
course of the year and played very well this afternoon.  
We did not shoot the ball well. I don't know that I've ever seen a box score
where you had more rebounds than points. I don't know if I've ever seen that.
Name of the game is making baskets, and we had a hard time doing that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Comments about your players you have with you.  
COACH COALE: I think everybody knows them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Ashley, you got 23 rebounds and 20 shots off, but it looked like there
was a lid on the basket. Can you talk about how many close shots didn't go
in?  
ASHLEY PARIS: Our guards did an awesome job of getting us the ball. They were
single coverage most of the night, and I missed 15-foot shots, and I think
that has a lot to do with why we lost.  
  
Q. Courtney, where does this team go from here?  
COURTNEY PARIS: You've just got to keep working and getting better. Not even
just for the NCAA tournament, our future as a program. Got to keep working.  
  
Q. Courtney, talking about the bigger picture, is there a common thread with
the Texas game and the A &M game and this game today?   
COURTNEY PARIS: Yeah, we lost 'em. I don't know. Like I said, we didn't make
shots, didn't get it done. I think that goes to me more than anything.  
  
Q. Courtney, anything that you can put a finger on as far as what has to
change, what you guys have to fix before the tournament?  
COURTNEY PARIS: I think just finishing and decision-making and staying after
it. I think we're a little bit -- in the first half we finally started going
hard, as far as effort, jumped out-of-bounds and saved the ball, and I think
that makes us stay focused. We can be the team we want to be and we have to
figure out how to do that and figure out how to do it soon.  
  
Q. Ashley, talk about this team's confidence or lack of right now.  
ASHLEY PARIS: Obviously our last few games have been frustrating and we know
we have the potential and all the pieces necessary, and that we're capable of
being as good as any team in America. It's just frustrating trying to put it
all together. We're still confident we can figure it out and we're going to
try to.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will remain for questions.  
  
Q. Can you address where this team goes from here and what you need to do to
correct this thing?  
COACH COALE: Fortunately, we still get to play; we'll be in the NCAA
tournament and that's a good thing. Obviously we've got plenty of time between
now and our next game to try to take it apart and put it back together. I
think confidence is huge.  
I don't think we looked like a confident team throughout. I don't think we
shot like a confident team. We've got to figure that out first, figure out
where that germinates and try and get it moving in the right direction. We get
to play again, that's great.  
  
Q. Would you have thought with Courtney and Ashley having double-doubles you
would have lost this game?  
COACH COALE: I think it was more than that. They almost had more rebounds
between the two of them than the entire Missouri team, but we took 88 shots
and made 29 of them. We go 3 of 11 from the free-throw line. I mean, you --
it's our lowest turnover game of the season, we only had 12. You have to make
baskets to win this game, you have to make layups, you have to make -- on our
shot chart we missed 24 layups.  
  
Q. Sherri, you called time out and didn't get near the basket the last
play.  
COACH COALE: We had a set play called, and for some reason we threw it back to
Ashley. And that's inexperience at the guard spot, just not knowing the
urgency of the moment, not having been there before, and that's probably my
fault for not drilling enough on that situation.  
However, you take this sea of issues and you try to be good at the things that
happen the most first. That was a little down my laundry list, the play of the
game, but you can trace it back to inexperience, too. And at the end of
regulation, if you just run out to the 3 and make her shoot a layup, it's
over, so haven't been in that situation before.  
  
Q. Sherri, do you feel that you may have placed yourself out of the Ford
Center Regional, or do you fear you might get sent to Oklahoma City?  
COACH COALE: I have no idea.  
  
Q. How important is that? Or is that another thing that is down your laundry
list?  
COACH COALE: To get to the Ford Center, you would have to win two, so that's a
little bit down the laundry list, too.  
  
Q. Sherri, I know you tried some things to get this team going. Do you do
something drastically different in the next eight days, or do you have to try
different things? I don't know.  
COACH COALE: I have a long trip home to think about it.  
  
Q. Sherri, are Big 12 teams figuring out how to defend this team now? You
guys were so strong there in the middle of the season when you had that seven-
game winning streak going on. Are they figuring out how to do it where
Courtney and Ashley can still get their numbers and you guys come out on the
short end?  
COACH COALE: I think coaches in the Big 12 are very, very talented, and I do
think they've adjusted and they've seen what one team does that's effective,
but at the end of the day, 3 of 12 -- somebody has to make a shot. Amanda
Thompson plays 30 minutes and makes 1 of 8, somebody has to make a shot. It's
the name of the game!  
I don't know -- I don't know. To answer your question, we have to make
baskets. You can't shoot 18% from the field and 22% from the 3 and 20% from
the line and expect to beat anybody, regardless of what their game plan is.  
  
Q. Outside of Courtney, do you have people that can make shots or do you
just sort of have what you have?  
COACH COALE: I think we're a lot better shooters than what you've seen lately,
than what any of us have seen lately, and I think it speaks to how important
the mind is, your sense of focus is, and where your mental toughness lies, and
this team has struggled with mental toughness all season. That's not been a
secret, I've talked about it openly. We're not the best perimeter shooters in
America, but we're not this bad, either.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like there was a hangover from the struggle at the end
of the season and coming in here today, was there disappointment with playing
in the first round?  
COACH COALE: I think our guys tried to regroup and look at it as a breath of
fresh air, and they're just a bunch that needs something good to happen for
'em, and very easily the wind -- the wind is taken out of our sails easily.
And when you continue to miss shots, it takes it out of you.  
If you know, you know the adrenaline rush you get when you make 'em and how
depleted you feel when you don't. That was a bit of it. I think they tried to
prepare and have the right mindset coming in, and I felt like we were ready
before tip-off.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck to you in the NCAA tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2008

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
COACH LAW: (Telephonic portion started mid-interview.) I wanted for them so
bad to get this win so we have something to build on, and look forward to
building on this next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. What does it mean for you guys, you've been playing for four days and
where have you been this whole week?  
LACEY SIMPSON: We've been pretty fired up, confident coming into the
tournament. We were confident we were going to play today in the championship
game.  
  
Q. Jenna, you feel like you played your heart out and that's just the way it
worked out?  
JENNA SMITH: Coach was just talking about, I mean, it came down to last-second
shots. Obviously played A game. They made mistakes and we each capitalized.
When it came down, we hit box outs, they missed some box outs. But at the end
they had a last-second shot.  
  
Q. When you laid the block, did you think, okay, maybe that's it? 3.1 is a
lot of time I guess.  
JENNA SMITH: I looked up at the clock after I saw Freeman hit the shot she hit
and it was like -- it went in. So I didn't think anything at that point.  
  
Q. Toughest thing in basketball for a shot to go down in the last second,
nothing tougher than injury?  
JENNA SMITH: That's the toughest. It's the best game because it comes down to
the wire each team playing their heart out. But it's one of the toughest
losses. That last-second shot gets you.  
  
Q. Jenna, on your last offensive possession, did you feel like you got the
shot you wanted, that shot that you took there?  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, I knew they were going to play the move I usually do. So
my position coach, Coach Klein, said get up and under, try to get the best
shot you could.  
I thought I got a good shot at it. I just missed it.  
  
Q. Lacey, do you feel like playing the fourth game had any effect on you
guys tonight? Did you feel like fatigue was any role in this?  
LACEY SIMPSON: No, not at all. Coach got us well prepared a long time ago for
situations like this. Championship game, you don't think about stuff like
that, being tired. You just go out and play. Coach got us ready for it.  
  
Q. Jenna, I know the coach challenged you guys to make history, and you
didn't win, but you are the first 9th seed to make the final game. Do you take
something away from it? Do you walk away saying, Nobody else did what we did
before?  
JENNA SMITH: We're happy we made history being one of the lowest-seeded teams
to make it to the finals.  
But in our minds, I know the majority of us look at it as like we lost the
championship game, it's a big loss, but we take what we got. We made it to the
finals. We made history. We'll take what we got.  
  
Q. Lacey, do you have any sense of what's next for this team in terms of
where you'll play your next game this season?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Right now just sit back and wait to see if we make it to the
NCAA tournament. If we don't, then we'll start the process of getting ready
for next season.  
  
Q. Jenna, you guys switched to zone after they got out to the 10-2 lead. How
effective do you think that was in slowing them down and bringing you back
into the game?  
JENNA SMITH: When we switched to a zone it was kind of more -- they had a lot
of drivers, but we had to contain them. There's only Malone and one of the
other people who could shoot good percentage outside. We knew we had to, like,
pack it in the paint and control the dribble penetration. That's what they
were looking for. We had to box and get every board that we could.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Law.  
  
Q. Coach, did Purdue do what you thought they might do on that last
possession and with three seconds left to do?  
COACH LAW: Yes. We knew what they were going to do. Just I think one of my
players went to double because they thought they were going inside the camel.
When she took the shot, it was -- we didn't get the block out, and Freeman
followed her shot. And shot -- took a second chance on her shot. And it was
unfortunate that she got the possession that one shot off.  
  
Q. Can you describe your team's play during what you call the orange zone in
the final minutes?  
COACH LAW: We did everything we needed to do down the stretch, up until the
last 3.1 seconds. They got the shot. We knew it was a second-chance shot,
which we should have had that rebound.  
But I think my kids executed down the last two minutes. They executed and knew
it was going to come down to which team made the least amount of mistakes.  
We got opportunities. We had good looks at the basket. They came down. They
took some shots. We got the rebound. They came down to the last 3.1 seconds.  
  
Q. How far do you think your team has come since Thursday's win?  
COACH LAW: We've come a long -- this season has been a season of a lot of
growth on both parts. We've both had to deal with change. Adjusted to them and
they adjusted to me. We've grown and we've matured as a team and we definitely
became more, much closer. We're now more like family.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Jenna Smith having to go against Lavender and
then DeHaan and then Campbell consecutive days, what she was able to
accomplish?  
COACH LAW: Jenna has been working extremely hard day in, day out. We prepared
her as a staff. Each and every day she goes up against guys, each and every
day she was prepared to go up against those ladies. She's going up against
practice guys every day.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to keep Malone from doing all the things she did
tonight from steals to assists to everything?  
COACH LAW: Malone is a great player. She's scrappy. Knew she was going to try
to will this team to a victory. The most important thing that she did was the
steals. The key steals. When she decided to get the steals, pretty much I
think we contained her offensively, but it was defensive things she did as far
as getting the loose balls. Getting a couple of steals and she distributed the
ball. She did everything a point guard should do. She willed her team to
victory.  
  
Q. Do you have a sense of where your next game will be?  
COACH LAW: No, I have no idea. I thought it was going to be an automatic bid
and I was going to look at it on Monday, when I'm accustomed to it on the
17th. But I don't have a clue.  
  
Q. Does this change anything relative to the WNIT and accepting a bid to
that tournament?  
COACH LAW: I'll have to talk to my administrators and we'll discuss where
we're going to go from here.  
  
Q. Given how very close your team was to making history here, can you just
put into words what you felt like when you saw that last shot go through the
basket?  
COACH LAW: I wanted the kids to -- I wanted it so bad for them to get to the
NCAA, make history. Just to just see it, just taste it.  
When that basket went in it was like, Please give us five more minutes, let
them continue to fight, fight for it. But when the basket went in and they
said it was good, it was like a pit in my stomach.  
I wanted it so bad for them. It hurts that they worked so hard. They started
to believe and they fought and just how far our team has come. We've grown so
much. I just wanted so badly for them to reach the goal that they started out
and they won it, that they set out for themselves where we wanted to be in
June.  
  
Q. Making the last shot, did you have any hope that maybe that last shot
wouldn't count? Or did you from your vantage point -- could you tell it was
good?  
COACH LAW: Personally I knew it was good, but I was praying for a miracle. It
was like I knew she got it off in time. But I was hoping that I saw the red. I
look at the basket the last three seconds to see when the light goes off. But
I knew that she released it. I was hoping that I was wrong.  
  
Q. I don't know how many buzzer beaters you've been involved in in your
career, but is this as tough as it gets?  
COACH LAW: This year has tested me more than ever. I've never been in this
many buzzer beaters in my life. But this tested my storm. So I'm sure if I can
get through this year and I'm still standing, I'm sure I'll be able to keep on
going in the years to come.  
  
Q. (Question about locker room)?  
COACH LAW: I'm not one to cry, but I wanted it so bad for my young ladies. I
know how far we've come and they fought and they gave me everything they had
and for them to come in and defeat all odds, no one expected us to be here.  
I wanted it so badly for them, to cut down the nets. Be able to go to the
NCAA. So this hurt me more than any other loss that I ever probably had in my
career.  
I wanted it so much for my young ladies.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Lakisha Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18049)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Purdue we've got Head Coach Sharon Versyp, Kalika France,
Kiki Freeman and Fahkara Malone.  
Coach, if you would like to start with an opening statement and then we'll go
with questions for the student athletes.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I knew this was going to be a tough battle. Again, I have
so much respect for Jolette Law and what she's done at Illinois and those kids
were going to fight and so were our players.  
Both teams are on a mission and I just thought it was a great basketball game
for everybody involved.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Kiki, did you know immediately on the first shot where it was going and
sort of take us through that and what was your reaction and what did you
see?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: After the shot I saw what was going on. I saw she didn't box
me out. I knew I had to follow my shot, had a little time, got the shot up,
have it go in.  
  
Q. Any doubt it was good before the buzzer?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: I was just listening to my teammates. They said it's good. It
made it that much more exciting. I trusted them, basically.  
  
Q. FahKara, from your vantage point take us through the last 3.1 seconds
there.  
FAHKARA MALONE: Well, we just set up a play we could get it to Kiki and if
they overplayed it we were going to try to get it to Danielle. But Kiki got
open for us and she got a shot off and was lucky enough to be able to follow
it.  
  
Q. Kalika, could you talk about the defensive effort before that shot that
gave you an opportunity to take the last shot of the game I think it was at
least two possessions they had an opportunity to take the lead before you guys
had the last chance?  
KALIKA FRANCE: Yeah, that's something that we've been doing, but at least
trying to do all year. We're a defensive team. We may not have the best
shooting team but one thing we can rely on is our defense because we work on
it every day all day during practice and even before the game. So we were
ready defensively. And we just knew we had to get it stopped.  
In the huddle I said my man's not going to score and everybody committed to
that, everybody did. And they didn't score. So that was good stuff.  
  
Q. Kalika, how satisfying is this to you knowing that Lindsay and Jodi have
been on the bench all year long and you guys just sucked it up at the right
time and came away with the win?  
KALIKA FRANCE: Man, I can't even explain the feeling. Just being a senior and
getting a chance to play with such amazing players and you know just after
following up from last year, you know, and it was such a grind out there.  
Lauren made us battle, so that makes us even better. Ten times better. Because
we had to work for it. It wasn't given to us. And I can't explain it. Words
can't explain how I feel right now.  
  
Q. FahKara, similar question. Just everything that has happened to this team
since really June and to be at this point, what are the emotions? What goes
through your mind now?  
FAHKARA MALONE: You guys only know half the story. We've been through so much
more. And we just continue to grow and continue to listen to the people that
matter and that's us in our circle. We just try to block out everything else.  
We knew we could win this. We just wanted to show the rest of you.  
  
Q. Lakisha, in that final, in those final seconds, things sometimes get a
little frantic, how were you able to slow it down and gather yourself and also
what was that like waiting for the replay review?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Well, just having the confidence from my teammates and
coaches. Everybody believed in me. And that gave me the confidence to believe
in myself. So they're like get open. My post set some good screens for me and
I had all the confidence in the world. Thankful to them.  
  
Q. Kiki, were you nervous waiting out the replay or did you know in your
heart that it was good?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: My teammates, they gave me all the confidence. They were
excited. I knew for sure that it was good. So I just again listened to them
and believed in them.  
  
Q. FahKara, can you talk about this team fighting back all game. Seemed like
you were down most of the way until you took that six-point lead that they
sort of recovered from. But just what was the attitude with the team playing
from behind most of the way?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I think that we all knew that we were going to win and we
weren't going to give up on each other. Kalika when she got in the huddle she
got in everyone's face and made sure we believed in ourselves and each other
on defense and on offensive end, and that was really what pulled us together.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Versyp.  
  
Q. (Off mic)  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: We just continue to show the heart and the great
tradition that Purdue Women's basketball has. And, again, no one thought we
would do anything this year with Lindsay and Jodi being out.  
And I just think it's our staff, our mentality, when I took the job about we
didn't have anybody being player of the week except FahKara one time. You know
we got the accolades today, the team. But it's all about teamwork.  
I'm the leader, but I'm not any better than those kids. I just have to make
tough decisions, and I just think our team building and believing and having
confidence with a very fragile group early, you know, we could have went
either way.  
But, again, I think Kalika and FahKara really stepped up as leaders and really
just kept fighting. And they really turned to us. And I just -- our staff has
just done a great job with this group.  
  
Q. Four players on the All Tournament team. I think that's a first. I don't
think it's been done before. Want your comment on that. Could you comment on
Kalika leadership. I heard from other players the last couple days they're
mentioning her. Sounds like she grabs everybody and gets their attention.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: First, four players being on the All Tournament team. We
didn't have any individual stuff all during the year. Our players and
ourselves, we don't look at that. We're always a team, always a team concept.
All of a sudden the season is over in the Big Ten and we're just totally a
fresh slate. And our three games here is probably the best basketball we've
played. And FahKara stepped up and Kalika stepped up and Danielle stepped up
and they stepped up in different ways, and Kiki.  
And the bottom line we win as a team. We lose as a team. We're not about
individual accolades but it's great to have four players recognized, because
it was a huge, just a huge feat that we were able to handle these last three
days.  
  
Q. Kalika?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: She's a senior, she's got a swagger about her. You saw
her trying to get the crowd. We had the swagger last year. That's one thing
that we were missing, was that confidence. And, again, she wants to win
championships. That's why she left Maryland and came to Purdue. She wanted to
win championships. She's won two. And now the NCAA hope. And the kid's just
stepping out of her comfort zone and doing what she should be doing and we're
pleased that she's doing that.  
  
Q. Sharon, 56-50. Looked like things were rolling your way. Jenna Smith hit
the 3, then Harris hit the 3 with her legs gone. What were you thinking during
that time?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: It was a huge turnaround for them. And like I tell our
players, when you're ahead, you're not tired. When you're behind, you know
things are a little different. All of a sudden you knock down a 3 on a
scramble play, kicked out and they knocked it down and got some energy back.
But I knew when it was tied that we were going to execute. Our defense has
been the key. During the year against Ohio State we played defense to win the
game. Minnesota, we played defense to win the game.  
And I knew exactly that we were going to defend and get a stop and that we'd
have the last stop.  
  
Q. Can you put into words what FahKara Malone has meant to the team during
the course of this tournament, player of the tournament? She shot two for 13,
but yet was such a force in so many different ways. Can you describe her
importance what she did?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Our first game we had, FahKara has been here as a
starting point guard and had no starters returning from last year. And FahKara
really became a leader brought everybody on her shoulders. And the biggest
thing her first game that we played against IU, she was just doing everything
on her own because she was not going to be denied and really help her
teammates.  
I think that performance just continued to elevate our confidence as a team.
And they look to FahKara so much because she's our fire plug. She's always
communicating. And when a player steps up like that, they're just going to
continue to have incredible confidence.  
And she came back the next night, did the same thing. And I talked to her at
halftime and I brought her over. I'm like, "FahKara, you're not getting it
done. You're not getting it done. You're forcing too much. You're trying to be
the hero. Don't be that hero. Keep doing the things, get into your situation
and you're going to be the hero at the end because you're that leader."  
She knew. She knew. She's the type of kid that I can tell she's not getting it
done or point guard is outplaying her, like I said when we played Iowa, she
just responds to that.  
  
Q. Your view of the last sequence, probably standing right behind Kiki when
she let the first one go, did it look short in your mind? What went through
your mind?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I don't know if it was tipped or fouled. The officials
aren't going to call that. I appreciate that. But I saw it was short then I
saw Kiki go towards the basket rather than fading away. When it went in I knew
it was good.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Definitely. That's what I talked about. Kiki get the shot
up. I knew 22 was going to be on her. Good shot blocker, but take the shot. I
had Kalika back in case a long rebound. And I said but you gotta crash the
boards because it's going to come right back at you. And that's what happened.  
  
Q. Do you feel at this last game that you had with Illinois in Champagne, do
you feel it helped you with this game as a wake-up call not to take them for
granted?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Definitely, at Purdue University we don't take anybody
for granted. We know how intense every opponent is in the Big Ten. And they've
got a great team, player for player. But losing that game obviously hurt
because that might have been the situation where we might not make the NCAA.
We don't talk about it to the players, but we knew that one hurt. We knew we
had to do something well here to be able to advance to that.  
And when you win at home then lose on the road, most of the time we can
respond. It's neutral court. But it comes down both teams just played their
hearts out today.  
  
Q. Can you imagine Jolette's loss, could you imagine if the shoe was on the
other foot?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I've had a loss like that. It is tough. I said
either one, if they were going to win or vice versa, if -- obviously what
happened, it would have been tough on us, tough on them. It's heart wrenching
because she's done a phenomenal job. She's turned that program around. They
were on a run, an opportunity for them to get that automatic bid. It's heart
wrenching, and again she has nothing to bow her head down at all. Because
those kids played very, very hard for her.  
  
Q. Given everything that you've been through this year with this team, can
you just kind of put into words what you felt when that ball went through the
hoop and you realized this team was going to the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I can't describe it. I'm not a crier. But I was
emotional. To go through Lindsay's ACL when she was in Russia and Jodi's
situation and FahKara's concussion and some deaths in the family, never got
things going. I've never been so proud of a group where everybody says we're
not going to win this, we're not going to do that, there's so much negativity.
And our staff just brings positive thoughts to this group. And I can't put it
into worth. I'm speechless. Our kids are speechless. They deserve it. They've
worked so hard. But one thing they know about me, you put my back against a
wall I'm going to be fighting. That's what I've taught them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Allyssa Deehan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18061)

### [Kalisha Keane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18065)

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Head Coach Suzy Merchant, Allyssa DeHaan and Kalisha
Keane. Start with an opening statement.  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: They always had the mind-set that they were going to take
this game from us. I give Illinois a heck of a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Allyssa, can you talk a difference in the Illinois team you faced today
compared to the game at the end of the regular season, seemed like they were
attacking you a lot more inside and actually aggressively going to the
basket.  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: I think they played with heart. They just wanted it more today
more than us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what was going on mentally with the team in the second
half in the run that Illinois went on at the end?  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: Not only in the second half but this whole game was a totally
different team than how we showed up to play yesterday, and we really didn't
play as a team and we really weren't focused and didn't play together and just
fell apart offensively and defensively for us. We didn't have the same heart.
We didn't have the same emotion and we just weren't the same team that we were
last night.  
  
Q. Allyssa, what did they do defensively on you? Obviously yesterday you
were able to get posted up and get down low late in the game. Did they do
anything different defensively on you?  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: They were aggressive on the inside. They doubled down. They
sunk a lot of people on the paint. They were just a lot more aggressive on
approaches on defense and attacking us. And we showed them and we didn't
handle the pressure very well. And we just -- our offense was very mixed up
and we just didn't handle it very well.  
  
Q. Allyssa, I was wondering if you could talk about the rebounding out
there. Seemed so many times you were in position, it was like you had it,
didn't have it as far as rebounds. Those little instances seemed to add up. Is
that kind of what went through your mind as it transpired?  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: Rebounding isn't really, I don't know, there's not really a
technique or skill to it. It's all heart. Like we've been saying, they just
had a lot more of it than we did. And we're just as capable of pulling down
those boards. But we just didn't come out with the same heart and intensity as
they did.  
  
Q. You guys are now in a holding pattern until next week; what do you talk
about in this next week and how much do you think about what's going on, what
the potential NCAA berth?  
KALISHA KEANE: We finished out our season. We were seven over the last 10 so I
think we came to -- we're kind of coming in with a good win against Minnesota
as well. We didn't play our best tonight, obviously. But I think with a couple
of wins we have under our belt we still have a hope for the NCAA tournament.
That's what our main focus is going to be.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Merchant.  
  
Q. For the last four or five years the women's program at MSU has set high
standards. How do you handle, say, if you don't get an NCAA tournament bid
especially being a first-year coach knowing you had to go through injuries,
probably had to play a lot more people than you felt you were going to have to
at the beginning of the year? How do you handle something like that if indeed
you don't get an NCAA tournament bid?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: I don't think you can control any of that stuff. I feel
like we belong there. Our RPI is right up there. We've got five wins, I think,
maybe six over top 50 teams and won seven of our last 10. We had one bad
night. One bad afternoon. We beat a great Minnesota team.  
And I think we just had a little let-down. How do you handle it? I don't know,
deal with it when it comes. We put ourselves in position to be in a situation
where they need to consider us. I think we are an NCAA tournament team. We
didn't play that well tonight but I think we belong there.  
So until that time I'm going to think nothing less than that. I know we had
our injuries and we had some tough times fall on us. But I thought our kids
battled pretty hard from where we started to where we finished to finish as
strong as we did with an RPI. I think we had one of the toughest schedules in
the league and a lot of those were on the road. So I feel good about where
we're at.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Rebecca Harris's performance in the second half,
specifically with the switch-off with Brittney in foul trouble, how much of a
factor that played?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: She's just been carrying them. I feel like she's been the
difference-maker for them. She's what makes them go. Obviously Jenna Smith is
a great player, but I think Rebecca Harris, down the last few games, has given
them a lift. She was a senior who said she wasn't going to lose. She's taking
her team to a place where she can hopefully continue their season.  
You have to give their seniors a lot of credit and they've really stepped up
down the stretch. But you're right, taking Brittney out in foul trouble, it's
frustrating because Brittney was, defensively she was not there today. She had
that dumb foul with six seconds to go and had her third foul. And I just think
those were things, I said to the team in 25 seconds of play to start the game
we had two fouls. And our first eight possessions we had six turnovers. We
were not focused. We didn't have the same energy and the same fight in us that
we did the day before.  
And as a young team, that's something that we have to learn from and we're
going to fight to see another day.  
  
Q. They're notorious for coming apart at the end of the game like this
season. Did it all surprise you how strongly they finished the game and in the
second half even though you guys were up they had a run and came back?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: I just felt like for us really obviously you credit what
they did. They're a good team. They had some tough losses. I think we all do.
And I certainly felt like there's kids on that team that were just not willing
to go home yet. I think they outplayed us. They out hustled us, outplayed us
and outworked us. That's a hard pill to swallow when you're a coach. You never
want to see yourself, I felt like we beat ourselves in some respects. And
another side of the coin I thought they really, they just wanted it more.  
So I'm happy for Illinois. They've had some tough losses and it's good that
they were able to come out strong. I just wish it wasn't against us.  
  
Q. Before this tournament, people were saying only three teams in the Big 10
could get in. Now there's a potential Illinois, Purdue, yourself all could be
battling for maybe one or two spots. Make a case of one reason why you think
you should be in, like one game or one win and one thing that might keep you
out, like one loss that may have kept you out if it happens.  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: Those are hard questions, honestly, Chris, because you
can't predict what the NCAA people -- I know the criteria. Look how you
finish, seven to ten. Good deal. What quality wins do you have. I think we
have five or six. Five over top 50. And we beat Kansas state and Ohio State
and Iowa and Purdue. We beat the top three teams. We beat Minnesota. There's
top four. I think there's a lot of parity in the Big 10 and it's quality
basketball. I don't think it's down this year. It's just better, top to
bottom. That's just the bottom line.  
We added two more games to our schedule. And we beat up on each other two more
times, hasn't ever been done in the past. Do they look at that? I don't know.
But I feel good about what we accomplished. 19 wins with an RPI and seven out
of 10. We just didn't play well today, but certainly feel like we're very
worthy of being there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Danielle Campbell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18069)

### [Kalika France](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18068)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Purdue, we've got head coach Sharon Versyp, Kalika France
and Danielle Campbell.  
Start with an opening statement.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Iowa is one of the best teams obviously in the Big Ten
and obviously in the country. We knew it was going to be a tough battle. They
knocked down, they're a great offensive team and we were down by 17, and I
guess we decided to start playing our type of game.  
And we're very fortunate that we shot exceptionally well from the foul line
yesterday. We didn't, but, again, I'm just really proud of this group and I
think the keys to that was only six turnovers for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Kalika, what was the difference after you got down there by 17?  
KALIKA FRANCE: Well, we were down 17 early in the game. We had a lot of game
left. I felt like we played one of the best nonconference schedules and the
best conference schedule to get us prepared for the games like this. We've
been down in these kind of situations before. We know that Iowa is a good team
and they weren't going to let us just have it. We had to take it. So basically
we just came together and started playing together as a team.  
  
Q. Danielle, was it as simple as attacking and going inside, because that
seemed to bring you back a little bit there in the first half.  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: I think that and our defense. First half, first opening up,
we weren't together on defense. We let them do whatever they wanted to do.  
But we ended up getting stops because we were more physical with them, more
aggressive and we were moving our feet better.  
  
Q. Kalika, did you want to get out on the break earlier when they set the
defense in the half court? You guys were struggling with that and then got in
on transition?  
KALIKA FRANCE: I think Danielle hit it on the head. We weren't communicating
well on defense. They were just getting easy buckets. That's what this is
about. Defense wins championships and that's our goal, to win again this year.  
So when we stepped up our defense, we forced them to turn the ball over and
then we capitalized on that.  
  
Q. Kalika, did you feel like in the first 10 minutes that you took maybe
their best shot of the game and just had to maintain and survive after that?  
KALIKA FRANCE: Definitely. I felt like they came out hitting, Coach said at
halftime they were shooting like 69 percent. That was like unbelievable. Most
teams don't shoot 69 percent for the whole entire game. So we just knew we had
to battle back. It's a 40-minute game. You just have to play hard for 40
minutes. We got lucky that this one didn't run away from us. But we worked
hard, nevertheless.  
  
Q. Danielle, we seem to ask you this after every game, but can you just talk
about the progress that Keshia has made and obviously she's coming along at a
pretty good time for you?  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: Most definitely. Mo is a big body presence down low.
Whenever she gets down there she's going to score all day. She could have two,
three hanging off her, but she's going to go down there and get it done for
us.  
  
Q. Kalika, you guys have been in many games this year where the turnovers
just went, went and at the end you're looking at 20 or 25. What did it feel
like to be in a game with six, six turn overs today?  
KALIKA FRANCE: Feels great. It really does. I think that's a career high, or a
team career high, or maybe career low. (Laughter). That was great, though. I
mean, we gotta come out and do it again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Will fatigue play a factor tomorrow? You go six deep three days, you have
to put it out of your mind, but will it become a factor?  
DANIELLE CAMPBELL: It's tournament time. We're ready to play.  
KALIKA FRANCE: Not at all. We've done this before. We are basketball players.
That's what we do. We practice every day for three hours. If you can't get
ready for the game, then don't put the uniform on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, your only committing six turnovers was big, but you turned their
turnovers into 25 points, just taking advantage of their mistakes at that
point?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: We know we're not a stellar shooting team. In order for
us to do well, and I think for us to be where we're at today is because of our
defense, and because of our fastbreaks and being able to cause problems for
people and getting to the foul line.  
I mean, those are the two key things. That's been our bread and butter the
whole year. It can't change now. All of a sudden if you're knocking down
shots, that's a major bonus.  
  
Q. You've had some pretty good defensive efforts this year. But from that
eight minutes to two minutes where you took the game over, have you had one
quite as good as that this year?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: No, I know we've come back but to be down 17 points to
make that run, you know, these kids just continue to fight harder and harder
every second. And again if you have heart, you don't teach that. It just comes
from within. And I think that's been the big key. They did not want to be
denied again today.  
  
Q. Sharon, 69-63, you guys had a timeout and you called a pass over the top
onto the weak side to Danielle. Did you draw that up or did you see something
there?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Last six minutes I call every play. Usually FahKara does
a little bit and I'm yelling stuff out, but I'm totally in control the last
six minutes. And so I pretty much call every play.  
  
Q. What else can you say about Mosley that you didn't say yesterday?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Nothing. Just keep feeding her what we're feeding her, I
guess. No, I mean, you gotta love a kid that wants the ball down low. And she
wants it. She loves the contact. And there's not many true post players in the
world that really want that. And that's why she's got a gifted body for us to
be able to utilize. That's why we recruited her to play for Purdue.  
  
Q. Just to be back in the championship game for the second straight year?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: It's huge after adversity. No one is talking about it
anymore, but we talk about it. You have your two best players sitting on the
side line with Lindsay and Jodi. People don't talk about it. That's why we're
here is because we're playing for those two.  
And playing for Purdue University, and I'm so proud of this group. We're not
satisfied by any means. But I don't think anybody gave us a shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Lori Bjork](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18053)

### [Rebecca Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18052)

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Illinois we've got head coach Jolette Law, Rebecca Harris,
Jenna Smith and Lori Bjork.  
Coach, if you would like to start with an opening statement, then we'll take
questions for the student athletes.  
COACH LAW: My kids played extremely well the second half. I saw it in their
eyes. They believed. Now we only have 2,400 seconds left and our mission will
be accomplished.  
I'm so proud of these young ladies. They played 40 intense minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Rebecca, a week ago Coach was talking about how you guys needed to be
more aggressive at taking the ball to the hole up in East Lansing. How much
did that play into this game and so far in this tournament run for you guys?
And talk a little bit about the feelings of getting here to the championship
game a week after that?  
REBECCA HARRIS: I mean, it's been all season long we've been told to attack
more and whatnot. But I guess we're just having to do that more. We work on it
all the time. And most of us can drive. That's what we do.  
So, I mean, just being as close as we are and we can taste it, we're doing
what we need to do to get the job done.  
  
Q. LSU's defense was pretty disruptive in that first half. What kind of went
through your mind to kind of stay confident? This is for Rebecca. But I know
they tried to pressure you and all, but then obviously something changed after
that first half. What was it? What did you see?  
REBECCA HARRIS: Hmm, I don't really know how to answer that. The first half
was, I guess, pretty bad for us. But we never let up. And it was a close game
for as bad as we were playing. So we felt that the second half we'd do what we
do, get the job done. There's no going home for us. That's not what we came
here for.  
  
Q. Jenna, has it hit you yet the magnitude of what you guys are
accomplishing here, what you've accomplished and what's ahead of you, has it
hit you?  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, as a team it hasn't hit us. We know what we've done but
we recognize we're all cheering. But we were on the board 40 minutes, 2,400
seconds left. We know we have one more game. We didn't come all this way to
lose the championship game. We know we still have one game left.  
  
Q. Lori, can you talk about what it was like coming into this tournament?
Everybody said this is a wide-open tournament. Did you guys sense that and
know you were able to make a big run here looking at the draw at all?  
LORI BJORK: I think definitely, regardless of what the draw was, I think we
felt like this is the year that a team could win four games in four days, if
necessary. And, I mean, yeah, I think we felt like our goal at the beginning
of the season was to make the NCAA tournament. We saw that slipping away. We
knew the only chance we'd have to get here is to win these four games.  
So we took it as this is fun. This is what we play to do is to play games.
That's what we're here for. We're not here to show up at practice three hours
every day. That's part of the requirement, but we're here to play. That's what
we enjoy. And just take it as a fun thing and enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. Jenna, after three games in three days, how do you feel physically?  
JENNA SMITH: I think we're pumped up more than anything. Coach says get
untired. We took ice baths last night. Keep motivating each other. I don't
think we're thinking about being tired. We're thinking about getting that
championship more than anything.  
  
Q. Jenna, can you talk about the defensive job you did on Allyssa DeHaan
tonight and what the game plan was coming in? Was it to get her away from the
basket again and kind of give a body on her and push her away?  
JENNA SMITH: With Allyssa DeHaan we knew we had to get physical with her. If
we get her close to the basket, that's basically automatic two points. She can
shoot over any of us. We knew which guards were drivers and which could shoot,
so if you had a driver near Allyssa, you sagged off, or I just had to push off
the block or any posts I was near, you just had to push off the block and help
out as much as you can and just box out because she could rebound very well.
The key thing is to get her off the block and box her out.  
  
Q. Rebecca, you guys are closing in on a NCAA tournament birth. That's what
everyone is talking about here. Do you guys feel like you need to win tomorrow
to get it or do you feel like you guys have earned it so far?  
REBECCA HARRIS: We feel we need to win tomorrow to make sure we have it. If
people are talking about giving it to us, we want to take it for ourselves
anyway, make sure we have it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Jolette, you outrebounded them by eight in the second half. Did you
change something at halftime?  
COACH LAW: Add some choice words. Talked to my team said, Ladies -- well, we
talk about the small things. We've been here before throughout the season. The
close games that we've lost, we knew it came down to rebounding,
communicating, and taking care of the ball.  
And just emphasize, reemphasize things that we needed to do in order to get a
win, and so we can give it up in 20 minutes, we must give them one
opportunity. We must rebound.  
And put four things up on the board for them: It's up to us to go out and
control our own destiny. And that's what they did. Coach, we got it. We got 20
minutes. We're not going home. We refuse to lose.  
  
Q. How much did it help to have seen them right at the end of the regular
season when they were playing some of their best basketball, for you guys
coming into this game to -- in terms of scouting report, in terms of knowing,
keeping everything fresh for them?  
COACH LAW: It was a big advantage, because we just played them. We knew what
we needed to work on. Knew they were going to do the 2-2-1, and the 2-3 that
caused problems in East Lansing. We worked on that for the last two weeks.
Worked on some things, how we needed to execute.  
And it does make a big difference when you've just played an opponent. It's
fresh in mind. The kids remember. You don't have to go through as many things
and walk-throughs because we only had an hour to prepare.  
So it was very -- it was beneficial that we played them as close as we did.  
  
Q. Your team said that they're holding up very well physically and
emotionally. How are you holding up in your first Big Ten tournament as a head
coach?  
COACH LAW: You know, Coach Singer pretty much prepared me for this. I'm used
to March Madness. The adrenalin is flowing. Used to getting in a tournament.
Just trying to lead this team, lead them to places they haven't gone. And for
me it's all about -- there's no rest for the weary. Watching film, getting
them prepared. The main thing is to make sure I get them prepared. Keep them
motivated, keep them fresh and continue to motivate and prepare them.  
So I'm fine. I'm good. I can go as long as we are winning. And we want to win,
we want it bad. We set goals early on. I'll sleep in June, July, somewhere
back in those months. But right now it's March Madness, trying to lead this
team to places they've never gone.  
  
Q. Do you feel there's been times this year where you've used full court
pressure to try to get them kick-started? Is that what you did today?  
COACH LAW: Right now we've got 20 minutes. We've got to throw every defensive
thing at them, 55, go 32. Mixed it up. Went half court. Showed the 3-2.
Switched it to a man. The kids are just watching me. We throw up 3. They
thought it was zone. Had to trick them a little bit.  
My kids were on the same page. As long as we're on the same page, that was all
that mattered and it worked out for us those last 20 minutes.  
  
Q. Tonight it looked like your team kicked it into another key in the last
few minutes of the game. Can you just talk about the character of your team?  
COACH LAW: I have some very, very strong-willed young ladies. And I taxed them
early on in the season through things, while you're going through the
practices and taking them through a lot of tough drills and conditioning
drills, I had an opportunity to see the makeup of my team.  
I knew bottom line these young ladies are fighters. I just wanted to make sure
that I lead them, continue to push them, prepare them for this moment. And the
character of my team, they're winners. They put in the swagger and they, right
now, want to go somewhere. They put their mind to it they want to go to the
NCAA. They say, Coach, whatever we have to do, lead us, show us what we have
to do, and they've done that.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the job that Brittney Thomas did on
Rebecca how much her getting into foul trouble in the second half played in
that switch of matchups there with Rebecca and Brittany going over and taking
over Lori?  
COACH LAW: It was key in the first half, because they pretty much the game
plan was we were not going to let Rebecca Harris beat us. We're going to deny
the ball pretty much. They did like a an all-out man-to-man, pretty much a box
to one. Halftime I told Rebecca, Don't get frustrated, we'll still let plays
go to you. Let the offense come to you, don't rush it.  
When we saw attack her and get into foul trouble, it was to our advantage to
sit her down to free her up. When she went over to Lori, I was pleased because
then I knew I could use Lori to attack the other guards.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Wendy Ausdemore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18067)

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Stacy Schlapkohl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18066)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Head Coach Lisa Bluder and Stacy Schlapkohl and Wendy
Ausdemore. If you would start with an opening statement, then we'll take
questions for the student athletes.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Obviously we're very disappointed, especially the way the
game started out. We thought we had taken pretty good control of this game.
And Purdue just did a tremendous job of fighting back and staying composed
when they were down by 17 and they just kept chipping away at it.
Unfortunately, you know, we turned the ball over way too many times and we
gave up 25 points off of turnovers and that's just too many.  
I think that and the offensive rebounds, we gave up 16 offensive rebounds.
Those two things are really what caused a loss for us today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Wendy, what about their defense that makes it hard to bring the ball up
and keep control?  
WENDY AUSDEMORE: FahKara alone, she's a great full court defense. Puts a lot
of pressure on our point guards. Our defense all around, they did a good job
tonight. Just physical. And they did a good job.  
  
Q. Stacy, what was it like getting out with a 17-point lead; what were your
feelings then and then going into second half with a small lead?  
STACY SCHLAPKOHL: Any time you have that big of a lead, we were excited. We
were pumped and fired up. And we still had a lead at halftime. So I don't
think mentally we still had the lead but somewhere in there we, our defense
kind of let up and like you said earlier we had a few too many turnovers that
started their little run that continued kind of in the second half.  
  
Q. Stacy, how difficult was Mosley tonight for them, No 23, to keep off the
boards?  
STACY SCHLAPKOHL: You know, she's very tough. She's physical and she's got a
big body in there. And, you know, we tried to push her off the block, tried to
box her out. But we did the best we can. Very physical inside.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. Lisa, your turnovers were big but not being able to turn Purdue over,
they only had six turnovers tonight. How big was that not being able to get
them to cough it up a little bit?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: It was both, compiling both those together and just the
differential between that, it's a 13 differential. They got to shoot the ball
eight more times than we got to shoot the ball.  
So I mean definitely I thought our defense was good to begin with. But we just
weren't able to keep that up. But, again, I thought, you know, Purdue forced
us into some turnovers that were very, very costly.  
  
Q. How is Johanna?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, I don't know yet. I haven't been able to talk to
the doctor yet to find out how she is. So hopefully she'll be okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Purdue we've got head coach Sharon Versyp, FahKara Malone
and Lakisha Freeman.  
If you would like to start with an opening statement and then we'll go ahead
and take questions for the student athletes.  
COACH VERSYP: The Big Ten tournament is obviously a huge thing for every team
that comes in. I really felt that our team was very, very prepared. They're
very, very excited.  
We had a clean slate. Didn't feel like we finished as well as we needed to. So
this game was very key. Most of the time when we have had a loss we respond
very well, and just really proud of this group, again, through all the
adversity that we've had.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. FahKara, you've had your foot on the gas at times over the last month or
so. What was it about today that you were tracking for all 40 minutes it
looked like?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Well, it's IU. In-state rival. Don't want to lose to them. We
let a game get away from us at home. I have a paper in my locker after Coach
made us read and I just wrote some things should never happen. And we just
want to go out there and get this most importantly for our coaches because
they worked so hard all season.  
I just wanted to do whatever I could to get a win.  
  
Q. Kiki, was it just get out of her way type of thing?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Yes, it was like give her the ball. She was doing it all for
us offensively and defensively. She played a great game. That's what she's
capable of doing for this game. Didn't expect anything less from her.  
  
Q. FahKara, after playing IU twice, did you see something at least from a
defensive standpoint that would allow you to pick the pocket as many times as
you did today?  
FAHKARA MALONE: They're a great penetrating team. They all can put the ball on
the floor and go to the basket. And I'm just small enough that I can get the
ball before it comes back into their hands.  
  
Q. Kiki, what did you think you did defensively there in the last five
minutes or so? Looked like you were able to really clamp down on them?  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: I was trying to get some pressure on them so they couldn't
see anything. It was easy to get to the post due to no ball pressure on the
wings. Just wanted to help my team out and get over there and get some steals.  
  
Q. For both players, the lift that Mosley gave you there in the second half
with that personal 7-0 run?  
FAHKARA MALONE: She's amazing. I wish everyone else would realize what we
realize; she's a big body in there. Every day she comes in she produces every
single time. We expect nothing less from her than to knock somebody over and
get a basket.  
LAKISHA FREEMAN: Ditto. (Laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
Q. Coach, which was more impressive tonight, FahKara's offense or her
defense?  
COACH VERSYP: Both. She's been the catalyst for this team. We've met a lot,
and she just continues to make her team better. And that's the type of
attitude we need to have and hopefully it will continue to rub off.  
We have to have that "do not die" attitude and get after it, and things are
going to go up and down. But our defense has always been the big key and I
thought not fouling them was huge. But FahKara was a key for us.  
  
Q. The score tied with five minutes to go, a lot of time-outs. Anything said
in the huddle or what would you point to as the difference down the stretch
when you went on the run?  
COACH VERSYP: Our defense was able to get some steals and some fast break
points. We were trying to isolate Danielle in a little bit, have FahKara have
the ball in her hands and make decisions setting picks to go high-low. And I
just think our defense, we denied them a lot of points in not fouling them.  
We were able to get the ball and run. And that's when we're very good.  
  
Q. Follow-up on Mosley. Seemed like her points came right there in a period
where you were really looking to get something done offensively and she was
able to give you that short boost?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, Keshia doesn't care if she's got four people on her, she's
going to shoot. We didn't have a post player down low. Danielle didn't want it
and Natasha didn't want it. So Keshia, doesn't matter to her. We really got
the ball to her even if two people were on her. She's got some strong,
powerful moves. At least we get a shot up, it's not a turnover. It's very
strong.  
When she's feeling it, we're going to give her the ball. It went to her four
times in a row and we were able to score.  
  
Q. A little bit more about the steals, Indiana finished the season as the
number one stealing team in the conference. Source of pride to beat them at
their own category?  
COACH VERSYP: In the Big Ten we're tied for steals. Obviously all the games
we're not, but in the conference we're tied for steals. And Kiki and FahKara
are catalysts for us to get steals. For FahKara to get 8, it's like that
vision when you're pitching. You just get in a zone and she was in a zone
tonight. But our whole team defense was very, very effective.  
And they just followed FahKara. That's what she did last year. She was the
best defensive player for us on the floor last year and she's continuing it
right now.  
  
Q. Sharon, does it concern you at all since you've got a game tomorrow that
four of your starters played at least 35 minutes?  
COACH VERSYP: No, because you've got to win the game. You've got to win. These
kids are resilient. Right now FahKara has a little bit of a groin pull. So
we've got to try to get her healthy.  
But right now everybody's got to be able to play. Gotta be able to rotate. But
you can rotate a lot of people. If you don't come out with a win, it doesn't
matter. So it's all about winning that first game. And then a lot of it, the
adrenalin, getting to the Final Four, the adrenalin will take over.  
  
Q. Just the rebounding today. I think there was a stretch there with I think
Jackson had three offensive rebounds and scored. But to finish with two kids
with 10 or more rebounds, how important was that element today?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, the whole thing against IU is about rebounds. They really
destroyed us at home. On the offensive boards we didn't shoot well at that
point and we knew that we had to keep their post players off. Weak side board.  
When it comes to Kiki, she's six-one, she has a great ability to box out our
post players, sometimes get caught too far underneath the basket. Kalika is a
little smaller. But I was very pleased. They're going to get some because
they're a very good offensive rebounding team. But for both of us to have 13
and for us to secure the boards at the very end was very big key for us to
shoot free throws down the stretch.  
  
Q. Is Natasha a little banged up too?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, she's got a problem with her foot that's been nagging for
three weeks that nobody knows about. So these kids just gotta continue to play
through.  
And that's why I say they just dealt with a lot of adversity and are fighting
through a lot of things just like everybody else in the country.  
But I'm very pleased where we're at right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Jantel Lavender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18055)

### [Marscilla Packer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18054)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Ohio State we've got Head Coach Jim Foster and Marscilla
Packer and Jantel Lavender. We'll forego the opening statement and go ahead
and take questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Marscilla, how surprised are you by this outcome, having played them
twice before, is this the type of game that you thought you were going to
get?  
MARSCILLA PACKER: For sure. We definitely expected them to play hard and play
like they did. Obviously we expected to win the game, but they played great.
Harris did well for them and so did Bjork, her three. She got high, open
looks. It was hers in the end.  
  
Q. Jantel, you only got eight shots in this game. Maybe five in the first
half. Did they do anything different to you in the second half to keep you
from getting more offensive looks?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think they were playing good defense and maybe our guards
had some open looks, better looks than maybe I had. I think basically this
whole game I think we went away from some of the little things that we should
have did in total. Like just everything. So I mean we were kind of out of our
aura. So that's just a reflection of that, too.  
  
Q. How much did it hurt you guys that Shavelle, you didn't have her
defensive pressure throughout this game?  
MARSCILLA PACKER: She does a great job whenever she gets in and plays. I think
Maria came in, did a great job for us. We had two great point guards. And I
think Maria did a good job when she comes in. Shevy can go all the way when
she comes in, makes a difference in the game. But we definitely miss her. She
gets the balls, gets some steals and some easy transition points for us.  
  
Q. How are you going to approach tomorrow Jantel? What are you going to
think about as you guys prepare probably for the NCAA tournament?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think that we need to really focus on defense a lot. And we
need to focus on getting three stops, like the drills in practice that we do
every day, get three stops in a row. And we just need to transfer those things
we do in practice over to the games.  
And I think that we're a pretty good team once we start reversing the ball and
we continue to do the things that we are good at. And I think for the NCAA
tournament we know those teams are very tough teams and we have to come out
and we have to play hard for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Coach, were you surprised at all that they were able to penetrate and get
to the basket the way they were? They said that was a big part of their game
plan; that they were going to not try to shoot a lot of outside shots, they
were going to try to go to the bucket?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Well, I think they're very quick. I don't know how much they
penetrated when Smith had 13 shots. 15 3s. I think there were three or four
breakdowns where they got to the basket. I don't think they got there that
often. I thought Harris played very, very well. I didn't like our start. We
left Bjork wide open by turning our head and main emphasis was not to let her
have those free looks. And we gave her two or three early. That really gave
them a lot of confidence.  
But I thought their quickness at the guard spot hurt us a little bit. But I
think it was our guards playing fast that hurt us more.  
  
Q. Jim, when you look at the numbers, Ashlee and Marscilla had 29 shots and
Tam and Jantel had 16. Was that a large problem?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Without a doubt. I think we got into a period of time where
I thought we were taking very quick shots and not to the level of quality of
shot that you would like to take. I think a floater is a nice shot to have in
your game. But I don't think it's a nice shot to take with 22 seconds to go on
the shot clock. I think it's a nice shot to have in your game when you're in a
shot clock situation you have to get a shot off.  
I think we rushed at the guard position and weren't patient enough to take
advantage of our inside presence. Tam and Jantel's lines are terrific. More
shots would have helped I think in the second half we rebounded much better.
We were more active on the glass. I think the players produced some of their
own shots.  
  
Q. Was there a time in the game when you actually verbalized that to your
team, asked your team to go down low and it just didn't get done?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Yeah, it was topic of conversation a few timeouts.  
  
Q. How early on?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Early.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the Marscilla Packer run there
late in the half, 11 points in four minutes, really took off?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Marscilla is that kind of street player. She can get
unconscious and score a lot of points in a very short amount of time.  
  
Q. Roughly how limited were Shavelle and Ashlee? They didn't play their full
complement of minutes that they usually play.  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Shavelle's better. I think she's got to get back to being
able to practice a little bit and get some of her timing where we would like
it to be and her intensity. We have two weeks for that to happen. And Ashlee I
think tightened up in the second half.  
And a couple of freshmen came in, if they would have -- Alison I thought had a
couple of opportunities to take some shots. And first big game for a freshman.
I think she'll be ready next time we go out there. I think she'll be able to
help us. And Brittany rushed hers, but I think experiences make you a better
player. And I think we'll be healthier and ready to go.  
  
Q. Again, was this the kind of game -- this is the Illinois team you've seen
a few other times. But was this pretty much what you expected from them?  
COACH JIM FOSTER: Yeah, they only play one way. If there's one area that,
especially when you come down to a game this close, switching off on screens
there's probably four or five field goals they got that we did not do a good
enough job communicating or transferring responsibility from one to the other.
At this stage of the season I would view that to be a little disappointing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Brittney Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14521)

### [Alisa Wulff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18060)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. For Michigan State we've got head coach Suzy Merchant,
Brittney Thomas, Alisa Wulff, and Allyssa DeHaan.  
If you'd like to open it up with a opening statement.  
COACH MERCHANT: We're proud of what we accomplished today. We played Minnesota
twice, lost to them both times and felt like we were -- we struggled very much
to defend this group of kids.  
And we have worked diligently. These kids have worked really hard at their
scheme, the things that they do. They're key players, and I thought we did a
great job on three kids in particular. And it was just a great win for our
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student athletes.  
  
Q. Allyssa, can you talk about those final four minutes and what you talked
about in the timeout going into it and what happened afterward?  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: It was huge on the stretch. Everybody just kind of came
together on defense we made some huge stops and hit some fire calls and huge
stops on defense. And that kind of transitioned into our offense.  
And everybody just stepped it up and elevated their game and it was a great
win.  
  
Q. Allyssa, what was it like for you? You had to sit for more than 17
minutes in the first half. Didn't get off to the greatest start. What was
going through your mind? What were you doing to stay in the game? Obviously
had to be a frustrating time for you?  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: It was frustrating from the bench. I was trying so hard and my
team did so great and they played so hard and they fought for that whole first
half and I just had -- I owed it to them to come out in the second half and
really give everything I had. And everybody just stepped up and we all just
came together.  
  
Q. Allyssa, do you think you benefited almost from that? Not that you want
it that way, but you were pressured at the end and seemed like you were
calling for the ball down the stretch.  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: That was an advantage sitting for 15 minutes in the first
half. I was fresh and we could run and I think that did help us out.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about the job you did on Fox tonight?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: I think it was a team effort. Took a lot of hustle, but we
decided to start switching ball screens so she wouldn't get any open looks. We
did it on a couple of players, Ohm also, so she couldn't hit the 3 either. I
think we just really frustrated her because she had to work so hard for every
basket that she got.  
And I played on her most of the game, but like I said, it really came down to
they set a lot of screens so our posts were stepping up. They weren't scared.
They stepped up to the challenge and guarded her as well.  
Just like the team effort. We just made her work really hard and I don't think
she was used to that.  
  
Q. Alisa, talk about that 3-pointer and how big was that for this team? Was
that lead that you had?  
ALISA WULFF: Must give shut out to Allyssa because she's such a great post.
She's really unselfish as well. She saw the double team come and I called it
to her, she kicked it back out.  
I know my coaches and my players have all the faith in me to hit that shot. I
do it in practice, so when it came to the timing I was really glad that I hit
it. And, like I said, thanks to Al for kicking it out, because we really are
an unselfish ball club.  
And we just fought so hard tonight. And I'm so proud of this group. It really
means a lot to be a Spartan tonight, for everybody who was in the stands, the
media that comes here, everything. We're just a really, really proud group.  
  
Q. Allyssa, I saw more fire and more emotions in you tonight than I have in
games in the past. Is that something new or --  
ALLYSSA DEHAAN: Well, I've been trying to work on the whole emotional thing
this whole season. But I think it's kind of the whole March thing. Once you
hit March, there's this feeling and atmosphere you can't describe it until
you're a player. We're trying to get our freshmen come to understand that. But
once it's March, every time it's you're one and done, this is it, this is our
last time for our seniors to play, and you want to go out and give them
everything you've got.  
  
Q. Brittney, talk about what this means for you guys in terms of potential
NCAA bid. I think you were pretty well aware that this was, as was said, a
one-and-done situation for that?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: Exactly. We knew it was a big game, a chance to get into the
NCAA. We also had so many other motivational factors for that game, that may
have been the third motivational factor just because they sweeped us in
conference and we knew it was a really good matchup and they're tough to
defend.  
That was on the back burners in our minds because tonight we were just coming
at Minnesota, we knew once we got past this game -- they were probably the
hardest matchup we faced all season. So it's not going to be easy, but it was
nice to get that one out of the way.  
  
Q. Brittney, did the week off benefit you guys at all?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: Definitely. Any time you don't have to play, it's going to
help you. And you get time to prepare and go over things and practice over and
over when before you might have only had one or two days. All the extra days
you can get, that's definitely going to help any team in preparing.  
  
Q. Alisa, you got a chance to go back and finish your career, the way it
sounds, with an NCAA tournament. Talk more though about what this Big Ten
tournament means to you and your career and what you want to do here in the
next few games, possibly?  
ALISA WULFF: You know, it means a lot. I think this team has come such a long
way. And just the fact that we hit that streak near the end of the season, of
the regular season. We come in today and get the big win. It means a lot.  
We're really going out and playing our butts off and fighting every possession
and like it is do or die.  
And we might have got an NCAA bid based on this game, but it's all about
taking each game as if it's your last and going at it really hard. And we just
look at every team as a challenge and we're looking forward to that challenge
and stepping up to the plate and winning a Big Ten championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Merchant.  
  
Q. Looking at Allyssa, she seems to be completely different and more
confident than when she first came to Michigan State. Obviously you've only
been here for a year, but to see her comfort level, being six-nine, playing
college basketball, getting the kind of attention she's getting, what have you
seen from her since you came here and started this program?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think with Al, I'll tell you that I've seen her grow a lot
in this season, and I'll tell you mostly because when Aisha Jefferson got
hurt, they were a nice dynamic duo. Aisha took the pressure off Al. Aisha is
the emotional one, she's kind of the tough one down there, the rebounder. And
whatever Al did or didn't do, it seemed like AJ was there to clean it up.  
And they worked really well together and now I feel like when AJ went down, it
was Allyssa had to step up, she had to come into her own. That's a tough thing
to do when you're a sophomore, and obviously she's on a lot of watch lists,
and rightfully so. But that's a lot of pressure on someone like herself. And
you add in the fact she's also premed student, so she's got pressure in the
classroom, too.  
And I just think I'm really proud of her and her development in terms of the
emotional side. The play will take care of itself. But I really feel like this
year, because it has been mostly her that everyone keys on, she's had to
really grow and develop not only the physical side but the emotional side, and
I think that's been the biggest change for her.  
  
Q. Suzy, can you talk about Mia's play tonight and obviously her job getting
the line and specifically that last basket that she made, that baseline
drive?  
COACH MERCHANT: We really felt like we had to get north and south of the rim.
And if we didn't against these guys -- when you watch us play the last couple
of times, we really felt like we could get to the rim. We didn't get to the
rim, and Mia, maybe what she lacks in quickness, she makes up with her
feistiness, and she's just not going to take no for an answer. She does that
on the court. She does that off the court. I mean, she's just someone that
will will her way into success.  
And we felt like Mia was someone who could draw fouls, especially against Ohm.
We felt she was susceptible to a dribble drive. We went to an open offense
where we put Al in the middle and let our guards take them off the dribble
baseline and she did a great job of finishing that last shot.  
  
Q. Coach, Allyssa picked up two really quick fouls, you had to take her to
bench. After that Minnesota did not seem to take advantage of that and forced
you to take her off the bench. How important was it to be able to keep her and
protect her for that second half as far as fouls go?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think that was big. You have to credit this group of kids.
Because obviously Allyssa is a huge part of our offense. We don't put up a lot
of numbers offensively. We're not a high-powered offense. Now, you take our
leading scorer out of that and it can be a little scary at times. But what we
did do is I thought we defended them.  
We gave up, what, 74 and 81 against them. And so we knew if we could just
fight defensively, it didn't matter if we were in foul trouble, whatever, if
we could just stay with them defensively, we felt like we had a chance. And
maybe it worked to our advantage. I mean, when I sat her down, I was like uh-
oh. But a lot of other kids stepped up and she was fresher down the stretch.
So that made a big difference.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Brittney's overall night tonight? She seemed to be all
over the place.  
COACH MERCHANT: She talked about a team. It is a team. There's no question.
But I'll tell you, Brittney Thomas took on the personal challenge first and
foremost to really do the best job she could on Emily Fox. That's not an easy
task. I think she, Emily Fox, is one of the best guards I've seen in a long
time.  
And she's just smart and headsy and she can score in a lot of different ways
and makes everybody else around her better. So Brittney gave credit to the
team. That's just the kind of kid that Brittney is. But I don't think anyone
deserves more credit in this win than probably Brittney on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were down six about three and a half minutes to go.
Here's a team that has beaten you twice. What is it about these players that
allowed them to have the confidence to push through, all things considered?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought we got a key stop. And then we capitalized on it.
And I think in the past, with Minnesota -- I thought Courtney Davidson said it
best. We watched film ad nauseam. I don't know if we've ever been more
prepared for a game than this one.  
It was literally probably nauseous to them how prepared we were in so many
phases. But I guess I just felt like, you know, when we were down -- Courtney
said that they manage the ball so well when they're ahead. And I think I kept
-- I had that in my head right then.  
If we could get a stop and capitalize on it, I think six points is one thing.
That's two possessions. When it gets up to the next possession where they
start to pull away, they become a totally different team in a confidence
level.  
And I thought that was pretty astute by Courtney, watching all the film. Like
I said, ad nauseam at most. But long story short, she was right. If we could
get a stop and just pull it out and get one more score to keep it within
reason, to keep it within a battle, I thought we were going to be all right.
That timeout was pretty spirited, to say the least.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how important this win is for you guys? I
mean, in the big picture of the thing. You got obviously at least one more,
maybe two more here. But in the big-picture thing, everyone has been saying
that this is the game that you needed to get into the NCAA tournament.  
COACH MERCHANT: You know, I think any team that plays in March, I just think
you want to keep anything and everything you can in your own hands. I mean,
we're going to play an Illinois team that's got it right in their hands, too.
They're here to win this thing and get the NCAA tournament and we're here to
do the same thing.  
So one thing I know is we can't control what other people think about us. All
we can control is what we can do on the court. And I thought our kids did a
great job of fighting tonight and keeping our dream and our faith alive.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Jori Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18048)

### [Amber Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18028)

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Head Coach Jack and Amber Jackson and Jori Davis.  
Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Amber, what happened at the end, the game kind of got away from you?  
AMBER JACKSON: They went on a run on their own. We couldn't answer back. We
didn't make any shots, didn't capitalize on the key opportunities and it got
away from us.  
  
Q. Amber, Jori, it was pretty physical down low, pretty even game on
rebounds. What were you thinking there coming into the second half? A lot of
people banging around, did that change how you approach the game at all?  
AMBER JACKSON: Big Ten, it's very physical inside just like any other game.
Championship game, means a lot more. But in terms of the physicality of it
all, we knew it was going to be that way. In the second half we just knew we
had to get tough, work hard and go after everything and hopefully it would
come out in our favor.  
  
Q. This is for Jori or Amber. Can you talk about how difficult FahKara
Malone made it potentially for you guys?  
JORI DAVIS: She's pretty quick. When she comes off the double screen, it's
pretty hard to read if she's going to go because she has a good hesitation
move. She's a good overall player. But I think we did an okay job. But she
still found a way to score.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys. Jori, this is your first exposure to the Big
Ten tournament. But I guess it's Amber's too. Talk about thoughts for next
year. Does this leave a sour taste in your mouth; you just want come back here
and go nuts next year?  
AMBER JACKSON: Very sour. We're a good team. We're going to get better. It was
a long season. We're young, but this definitely put some fire under us to take
everything more serious and know that we never want to feel this way again. We
definitely weren't expecting to go out in the quarter finals. We were going to
win it.  
That was what we wanted to do. That's what we thought we were going to do. It
didn't turn out that way. It's going to be all about getting better. So this
doesn't happen again.  
JORI DAVIS: Yeah, as far as it being my first Big Ten, I never looked at it as
the Big Ten. I just looked at it as another chance to win another game and get
to the NCAAs and we're just going to come back stronger.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk a little bit about what happened there in the 13-0 run
there at the end.  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: They could put the ball in the hole and we
couldn't. FahKara Malone is a fantastic player. She's been injured all season.
That's what's been holding her back a little bit. Now that she's healthy we
see how good she is, not just for Purdue but for the Big Ten conference. So
it's really good to see great players shine on the stage like this. And even
if they're not your players you get really excited for her ability to be great
on the big stage.  
  
Q. The way this tournament is set up it's going to be tough for one team to
have to play the day before when the other one doesn't. You don't play back-
to-backs throughout the regular season. Did fatigue set in the last five
minutes?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: No, not at all. I was really excited the fact that
we did play. We brought in eight new people on our team for the first time
being in this atmosphere. Five of them never been to Conseco Fieldhouse. So
I'm really excited that we did play so we can get our kinks out. And we held
them. We played a great game for 35 minutes. And after that Purdue took it to
another level and we just couldn't.  
It wasn't because of fatigue. To be honest, they just played better than us.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the steals for a minute. It's been a strong point for
you guys all year. Talk about how much the steal really deflates like an
offensive possession against you rather than as opposed to like a missed
shot?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: They stole it. We stole it. We stole it 10 times.
They stole it eight times. They stole it 13 times. But FahKara got the key
steals and that definitely takes a little zap out of you. And I think that we
were running around the perimeter too long and we never tried to attack the
basket the way we normally do.  
Sometimes you just gotta take, get an offensive foul but you've got to impose
your. We certainly didn't impose ourselves on their defense in the last five,
seven minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, your 18-14 finish record in the Big Ten. You've got some good
quality wins on your schedule. You went to the NIT last year. Is that
something you're thinking at all about right now?  
COACH FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I hope that we could be considered for post
season, because I really think this team can value from a post season
experience, certainly know what's at stake. But we'd welcome any opportunity
to play in post season for this young team to get more experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

### [Zoe Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16866)

### [Kay Sylva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18062)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Minnesota we've got Head Coach Pam Borton, Kay Sylva and
Zoe Harper. We'll start with an opening statement, then we'll take questions
for the student athletes.  
COACH PAM BORTON: You gotta give Michigan State a lot of credit for their
defensive effort tonight making the plays down the stretch when they needed to
make them. I was very, very pleased with what our three kids off the bench did
for our team tonight. And they really stepped up. And we talked about how our
bench was going to be the difference-makers in tournament time here and also
post season. But we got 21 points from our bench with. Kay, Zoe and Korinne
did an outstanding job. We just didn't get the job done with our five
starters, especially down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Pam, what happened in the first half? Was it their defense, your poor
offense, what do you make of the first half struggles?  
COACH PAM BORTON: Didn't help us with Leslie picking up two fouls. She sat out
a lot the first half. She helps us keep our poise out there. But I thought
their pressure, really affected us, sped us up and forced us to take some bad
shots. But the ball also wasn't going in the basket. I thought the kids did a
good job holding the fort down on the defensive end and doing a great job
rebounding and keeping ourselves in the game. It was a miracle that we were
even tied at halftime with the offensive production that we hadn't had in the
first half.  
  
Q. Kay, can you talk about that first half and how that first basket that
you hit that kind of broke the slump there, did you feel like once you got
through the first half that things would be different?  
KAY SYLVA: Well, coming into this game, coach said our bench would be our
strength; people just needed to step up. And I knew coming into this game I
needed to step up, hit some shots and stuff. And when we were in a draw, I
knew me being in, they were going to leave me open, or if I have a chance I'm
just going to take it. And that's what I was trying to do, help my team out in
any kind of way possible.  
  
Q. Follow-up to that. Once you guys survived that first half, did you guys
feel like this was your game from that point on?  
KAY SYLVA: Well, we came into the locker room, coach told us what kind of
first half we had. And we were amazed that we were tied at halftime. We wanted
to come out of the chute in the second half blazing. But we couldn't execute
on the offensive end. I thought our defense was really good but just couldn't
put the basket in the hole.  
  
Q. Zoe, can you talk about the sequence there at the end; was it a matter of
you guys not making plays and them making plays; did you feel like you guys
were in control, you were up I think six late?  
ZOE HARPER: I think they scored off like three baskets in a row and we just
didn't have anyone at the end that wanted to step up and finish off the game.
And I think at the end, Alisa got that rebound or whatever, tap, and we just
couldn't grab the ball. We just needed to get a stop. We still had a chance to
win it and we just let it slip away.  
  
Q. Question for both of you. What's the mind-set going forward? I know that
after that Wisconsin game when you had the end of the game poorly there, you
bounced back from that, now you have the NCAA tournament coming up -- most
likely but you never know -- what's the mind-set of the team right now?  
ZOE HARPER: We have a week of practice before Selection Monday. And I think
we'll go out there work hard and we just need to get better. And as Pam says
just get better and that's what practice is all about. And you know Minnesota
prides itself on not losing twice. I don't think it's happened very much
during the season. So we're going to go out there and we're just going to work
hard and get better.  
KAY SYLVA: I agree with Zoe. We're going to get better this week. Focus now on
the NCAA tournament and wait for selection day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about DeHaan. When she plays with that kind of focus
and just brushes off that bad first half, sits 17 minutes, comes back and
responds like she did, what is she capable of doing in this league nationwide?
Seems like she's completely different when she does play with that kind of
confidence?  
COACH PAM BORTON: Well, she's a great player, and I think she's proved for two
years she's one of the best post players in the country. And great players
make plays down the stretch. And she did. I mean she put them down by two
points at the end and made plays, but she's a great player. And she's only
getting better.  
  
Q. When you look at this game, will you look at the first half more or just
not being able to finish it off at the end? What was the biggest thing for
your team?  
COACH PAM BORTON: We'll look at our execution in the first half. I thought our
defense was great. I thought our rebounding was great. We have to look at what
happened with our offensive execution, and see what they did to us and what we
need to do better and fix it this coming next week or two.  
  
Q. With such a young team, is it a case where -- how much do you talk to
them and try not to let this carry over into the NCAA tournament? Because I
think two years ago you lost in the first round and in the Big Ten tournament
and then lost your first NCAA tournament as well.  
COACH PAM BORTON: I think that's two completely different years. And I think
we've got a group of kids this year that are very focused and hard working and
we've got great chemistry on our team. We've got a group of kids that want to
play together as long as we can. So I'm not concerned about that. But when you
get the tournament it's all about match-ups, and who you match up with and
what bracket you're in and so forth. Our kids will bounce back and we'll get
better and we'll be better because of this.  
  
Q. In that stretch, right at the start of the game, were you getting shots
that you wanted, or were you forced out of, into taking shots that you weren't
real happy with?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I think it was a little bit of both. And I thought that
Ashley did a really good job in the first half just attacking the rim. DeHaan
picked up a couple of fouls right away because we did a great job attacking
the rim. I can't remember when the next time we attacked the rim in the post.
I think we stopped doing that when Ashley was on the bench.  
I think they did a good job on Emy. She didn't have a lot of open looks.
Switched on a lot of screens and so forth. And I think Emy was probably trying
a little too hard and so forth. But I think it was a mixture of both where we
had some turnovers there all in a row and we weren't getting shots we wanted,
and we were missing some shots that we were also taking.  
  
Q. You talked about Emily Fox already; she was a big factor against Michigan
State. Can you talk about the job that Brittney Thomas did against her?  
COACH PAM BORTON: I think it was the whole team did a great job, not just
Thomas. They switched on ball screens so there was never an opening for her to
get a shot off coming off a ball screen. Off of penetration, there was two and
three people there. I don't think it was just Thomas. She did a great job and
kept Emy in front of her and contested all of her shots. I think it was a
great team effort on her.  
  
Q. When you look at a team like Michigan State, how hard are they to match
up with in a situation like this when they have the caged animal syndrome
knowing their tournament life is on the line?  
COACH PAM BORTON: We knew that going in. I told our players they're playing
with a purpose here and they need to get a couple of wins to get themselves in
the tournament and so forth. And we beat them twice handily the first two
times. It's tough to beat a team three times, but we felt we were in a good
situation. But a team you've got seniors out there thinking we don't want this
to be our last game and they're playing with their pants on fire that it's a
different situation, especially coming down the stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, looked like your game plan early on at least was to go after
DeHaan. You got her where you wanted: On the bench. How crucial was it for
them that you guys didn't come through and didn't force them to take her off
the bench and allow them to basically protect her up to the second half
there?  
COACH PAM BORTON: Well, we didn't pull away. The score was close the whole
first half. And you know if we would have built a lead they probably would
have had to put her back in the game. And I don't think we did that. We were
having a tough time scoring. The other kids did a great job defensively on us
and they didn't need to put her back in the game.  
But Leslie had two fouls in the first half and Ashley in the first half. And I
think Brittany had two fouls. That prevented us from playing some players
also.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about DeHaan. Talk about when she came back in
the game and specifically the last seven minutes and not picking up a foul and
how that affected her. Looked like she was able to attack both the shots a
little bit better and also attack the boards.  
COACH PAM BORTON: You know, when your best player on the team comes back in
and she's six-nine, you know they're going to go to her inside, try to get
easy baskets. She's playing a lot smarter defensively, kept her arms straight
up. And she got pretty deep in the lane a few times and made plays.  
And our whole game plan was to make her catch the ball further away from the
basket where she's not as comfortable and not let her drop step in the lane.
She drop stepped in the lane every time she wanted to.  
She's a great player and one of the best players in the conference and she
made two or three huge plays down the stretch in the last three and a half
minutes of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kristi Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16869)

### [Johanna Solverson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18044)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Head Coach Lisa Bluder, Johanna Solverson and Kristi
Smith.  
Coach, if you would like to start off with an opening statement.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: It wasn't an offensive show for us. Thankfully our defense
was there today. We played really good defense and really just took care of
the boards. I'm so happy with our rebounding margin. I thought we did a good
job of boxing them out. Holding them to one offensive rebound in the first
half and five for the game.  
Very, very happy with that. Obviously had great balanced scoring today, and
that's what our team is all about. We're not a team of super stars; we're a
team of everybody doing their job and just having a very, very strong team in
every sense of the way.  
So I'm happy with our first performance. But it's kind of business as usual.
We're moving on to tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Johanna, what was the outlook for you guys coming in? What was the
feeling? You didn't really need to win. Were you afraid of a let-down at all?
How did you guys feel coming in?  
JOHANNA SOLVERSON: I wouldn't say we didn't need to win. You never want to
come into a game not wanting to win. You always want that win. I think we came
in prepared for this game. We just recently kind of played them. So we know
their mentality and their type of offense and it's a lot of movement. I think
that we just watched a lot of film and went over their plays a lot.  
They're a great team, but we just came ready to play. Not saying that they
didn't. Things just kind of went our way a little bit more, I think. So it was
a good game.  
  
Q. Kristi, can you talk about how this game was a reflection of how this
team is so much different than last year in terms of you guys put up a lot of
points last year, tried to outscore people, and when you weren't scoring you
oftentimes would lose them. But today when you guys won it basically defense
and rebounding?  
KRISTI SMITH: Yeah, we're just -- our maturity is definitely coming through.
Last year, you know, we weren't a very good defensive team. This year defense
has been a focal point of ours all season.  
And it's just working out for us right now.  
  
Q. Either one of you two ladies, any thoughts on playing an Indiana school
on an Indiana floor? Because you are either going to play IOU or Purdue in the
next round.  
KRISTI SMITH: I assume they'll have a good crowd because it's not very far
away from their schools. It's a new gym at the arena they don't play here
every day just like we don't. It's really all in the air and really just our
crowd. I think we have a pretty good crowd after who showed up tonight. I
think it's going to be a match on the floor come down to defense and
rebounding.  
  
Q. Jo, you've been getting a lot of pick and rolls. Did you see something
down in Michigan that you could get down low and get some layups?  
JOHANNA SOLVERSON: Every time I got the ball I could hear them say make her go
left. Made me want to try to go right even more. They had good defense, but
there were times where they forgot to slide over, left us open for wide open
layups. Great fakes. We were able to get to the basket really well. When it
wasn't there, we were hitting our outside shots, which helped.  
  
Q. Johanna, you guys get blown out at Michigan earlier in the year. What
happened in that game compared to what we saw today? What was the biggest
difference from that loss to this win?  
JOHANNA SOLVERSON: Playing at their place, it wasn't a great game for us. But
they did come out ready to play and played really well. They were a lot
different from last year. I think maybe some of us were thinking differently
when we went in there to play against them.  
But I think just, again, to see their style of play, got a new coach, their
style of play, the way they move was different than we were used to. When they
came down to our place we were ready for it and again here today.  
  
Q. Kristi, what do you think you guys did defensively that made it hard for
them to score?  
KRISTI SMITH: Well, I don't know. We were just focusing on boxing out and we
were switching on both screens. I don't think we did that last game. Switched
-- I don't know. We were just intense on defense.  
  
Q. Just put Kristi on the bigs, it works?  
KRISTI SMITH: I put some post D there, Johanna, could you speak about how much
it means all you've been through, the knee injuries and how it might not have
been a sixth year and here you are you in a big game and this is what the
players want to play, right, the big games?  
JOHANNA SOLVERSON: Like I've been saying, it's a great feeling knowing that I
was able to make it through this whole season without any real injuries to set
me back, because sitting out for two years is a long time. But this is what
we've been working for really hard. This is exactly why I wanted to come. This
is my last year. I wanted to leave with everything I have on that floor. Today
was the first win and for these guys it's their first Big Ten tournament win.  
That was an exciting feeling to accomplish for them and stuff. But really just
-- it shows all your hard work is for. So that's what I'm really excited
about.  
  
Q. To either of the players, you guys had 17 second-chance points and quite
a few offensive rebounds. Is there something about Michigan's boxing out or
the rebounding that allows you to get that advantage?  
JOHANNA SOLVERSON: Going into any game, rebounding is a huge factor in the
whole game as it is as a whole. But we just crashed the boards really well
today. I don't know if it so much wasn't that they were boxing out or we were
just getting out of their box-outs, but with you knew coming into this game we
really would have to rebound.  
Getting second-chance points is great. It keeps the clock running for offense.
Makes them play defense longer, tires them out more. Really we focused on
hitting and getting our box-outs one through five.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. When you saw it snow, did you have a good feeling?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: We actually did comment on that on the way over here. No,
storm and Iowa basketball goes hand in hand, so we felt right at home.  
  
Q. Johanna was talking about it before like with the rebounding, but you
said going after the Wisconsin game how you made that a primary focus going
into that. Was that kind of the main thing again today, just like keeping the
rebounding as a focus, especially knowing the problems that Michigan did
have?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: It was our second key to the game, is that we wanted to be
able to dominate the boards both offensively and defensively. We felt Michigan
wasn't very strong at it. We are. We can be a good rebounding team. We wanted
to take what was a strength for us, make it even better. We definitely did
really emphasize this coming into the game.  
First key was defense. They moved so well on their offense. They spread the
floor. There's so much movement that you sometimes can get lost. You sometimes
lose your weak side defense because you start hugging your player, especially
when they can extend the floor so much because they are such good 3-point
shooters. I know they didn't show it today. I think the defense obviously had
a huge benefit they had to play yesterday. Shots they normally hit they
weren't able to hit today. Tired legs I'm sure took its toll.  
But I do think we came out with an intensity right off the bat. But I think it
wore on them after a while.  
  
Q. Lisa, how different is it for you when you're on the sidelines and, like
today, you didn't score as much as usual, but when you look out and you see
the kind of defense that you're playing and you know you can depend on that,
how different does that feel from last year?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: It makes you feel so much better. It's easier. It's easier
to coach that way. I mean, you're not having to rely on every shot going the
right way or every bounce. Believe me, I sleep a lot easier knowing that we
have both parts of our game operating now.  
  
Q. How key was it in this game that none of your players played more than 28
minutes as you get ready to play tomorrow?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I'm really glad with that. Abby, I thought, came in, did a
really nice job for us. She got valuable minutes, let us rest some of our
guard players.  
I think any time you're playing in a tournament situation like this, if you
can spread out your minutes, it's to your advantage.  
So we are a team that has some good I think -- I won't say we're really deep,
but we're pretty deep. And so I think that alone helps us. But especially can
spread out the minutes, I think that's to your advantage.  
  
Q. What kind of progress do you think Michigan has made this year knowing
that for years they've had some of the worst records, worst losing streaks,
stuck in the basement of the Big Ten. Seems like they made a pretty decent
impact with the kind of season they've had?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I wouldn't even call it a decent impact. I'd call it a
great impact. They've done an incredible job. You know, a lot of those kids
were young the last couple of years. And so it was taking -- they're pretty
talented kids last year.  
But obviously mentally they're a lot stronger and they've got a lot more
confidence right now than they had. And you know they've bought in.  
And that's what it takes for a team to be successful is to buy into your
coaching staff and to buy into the system that you're trying to operate under.
And they've made great strides.  
But, again, they're pretty talented kids. They just weren't putting it all
together. They've played a lot of basketball. Jess Minnfield has been playing
since a freshman, playing a lot of basketball. Experienced team.  
  
Q. How important was your defense the first eight minutes of the second half
when you guys weren't scoring?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: We couldn't find a bucket for the last eight minutes.
Thankfully our defense was holding for us. We talked about not letting them
come back in, maintaining that. Thankfully our defense and rebounding were
able to maintain it because we were struggling finding the basket at the
beginning of the half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got head coach Jolette Law, Jenna Smith, Lori Bjork and
Rebecca Harris.  
Coach, if you would like to start with an opening statement, then we'll take
questions for the student athletes.  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: My kids played extremely hard tonight. They played for 40
intense minutes. They believed. And I'm just so proud of this team. So we
played our 40. We get another 40.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Rebecca, obviously the seeding was different. But do you feel this was an
upset? I know the regular season was very close both times, do you consider
this an upset or no?  
REBECCA HARRIS: Only if you consider us the underdog. Basically the seeding,
No. 9 means nothing to us, just a number. I mean, we know that we can beat any
of these teams any day because we've seen them already. So we've already faced
them. We know what to offer. So, I mean, if we're the underdog, then I guess
it was an upset.  
  
Q. Rebecca, was there something about their defense that allowed you to
penetrate so much and get what you wanted on the inside, or is that just the
way you play all the time?  
REBECCA HARRIS: I wouldn't say that. I would just say, I don't know, something
came over me. I don't know. It was more my will than anything, I guess. Like
you can play defense any day on a penetrater or shooter, but they're still
going to do what they do.  
  
Q. Lori, as good as this win probably feels, has it hit you guys yet that
you're only halfway to where you want to get to?  
LORI BJORK: I mean, we don't worry about that. We've been through a lot this
year, and, I mean, obviously I try to mute my celebration a little bit, save
energy for the next two games.  
But at the same time, when you've been through what we've been through, 40
minutes, we can do that, however long we need to do it. It's fun to play. So I
don't think it's going to be an issue. Because if you don't think about it,
don't worry about it, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Rebecca, this is I believe Illinois's first trip to the semis since 2001.
Just talk about the impact of this win for the program in general.  
REBECCA HARRIS: Well, you know, the farther we go, the better it is for
Illinois. You know, we're all about making history. And so that's what we're
trying to do. I guess -- I don't know, I guess it didn't really hit me until I
looked at my teammates, fifth-year senior, to see, like, how much impact it
had on her, and she's been here a while so she knows how far Illinois has gone
or hasn't gone. When you look at her, you can tell it's something to be
excited about.  
  
Q. Coach, Lacey seemed to contribute other ways other than scoring tonight.
Can you describe her play?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: We're a total team. Lacey wasn't scoring tonight, she did
the defense. Rebounds, did the little things, handled the ball. Made key
passes.  
So that's what I keep telling my team. Sometimes you might make shots. You
just gotta continue to play. Play on both ends. And she did that tonight.  
  
Q. Jenna, today and yesterday been a different sense of urgency on this
team?  
JENNA SMITH: I wouldn't say there's a different urgency. We just have a better
swag, and we know that each game -- like, we've been playing on a high since
Purdue. So we know that if we come out with the same energy, same intensity
each game, we'll keep having victories and we'll keep having fun on the court,
which we want.  
  
Q. Jenna, Lavender only got eight shots in the game. Is that something you
wanted to do and how did you do it to keep from getting what she usually gets,
double figures?  
JENNA SMITH: Lavender is very strong, so we kind of sagged off the other posts
and dared them to beat us. We had to body up on them, be real physical with
her. But other than that, it was just help side in communicating to work to
stop her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was this the pace you really wanted this game to be? Did you get the pace
you wanted and how did you do it if it was?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: It was the pace that we wanted. We knew that they were
going to come out trying to get their transition. We knew that was one of the
keys. We had to stop their transition. Our transition defense was going to be
key. Had to get to the ball quickly. Little is extremely quick. She moves the
ball up the floor extremely fast. Also Moeller, we knew we had to get there
sooner than we've been doing other teams.  
So we just wanted to get out to the shooters, stop the transition and we knew
we had to give the one shot. And this is a very physical team. Very deep team.
We could not -- we had to address the boards tonight. Once they took a shot,
look to the rebound, and the pace was in our favor tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is it to not be satisfied and for your players not
to be satisfied even though this was a huge win, but obviously there's more to
accomplish, correct?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: Definitely. We're here right now one step at a time, one
game at a time. Although I want them to be excited, but after you finish this
third, we get out of the locker room, it's back to the ranch, back to watching
film and getting focused on the next opponent, whomever it may be.  
I just want them to get rested, get focused, and get prepared for tomorrow.  
  
Q. A couple of other facts so you can revel in the moment without looking
too far ahead. This is the second time No. 1 seed has been sent home one and
done. Ohio State, this is the first time that's happened to them.  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: That's interesting. This team, we've been through a lot.
We've been through a lot this year. Right now we're nine strong. We're trying
to do a lot of firsts. Coming into this tournament, there's never been a time
when it was 9th seed could make it to the championship game and win it.  
I've been challenging my team, we're going to make history. So this is what
we're doing. That's our goal.  
We're not looking at chapter two of our season. This is chapter three. On any
given day -- on any given day we can win, and we've got that focus of we're
going to come in here. It's only going to take four. And I asked them, did
they have four -- enough energy in them to get four? They said yes.  
We're trying to make history here. Not looking past the next opponent. We're
trying to do it game by game, step-by-step.  
  
Q. Does Rebecca have a green light to go to the basket any time she wants?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: Actually, a lot of the play calls, we knew that off the
bounce that we needed to -- they can really guard us off the bounce. We were
settling too much initially off the jump shots. The rim was a little tight, so
the only person that really could -- I wanted to shoot the 3 was Lori, and
everybody else looked to utilize our abilities, get to the basket, Lacey
Simpson could get to the hole, ran a couple shots to her and Rebecca -- yeah,
she could get to the basket better than most people I know.  
Had to utilize our strengths to get this win tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Michigan we have Coach Kevin Borseth, Carly Benson and
Jessica Minnfield. If you'd like to start with an opening statement.  
COACH KEVIN BORSETH: Iowa has a really good team. They've come a long way
since the beginning of the year. I think Lisa has done a great job with those
kids. They're pretty talented. Obviously very good size and they're really
smart and that bodes well. Of course they've got a lot of veteran people,
makes a difference, too.  
They played well. They deserved to win. And here we are.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
(Lost Audio)  
  
Q. How did it transpire you don't get a 3-point attempt for about 25
minutes? It seemed like effort-related attempt that it was lacking. Your kids
did play really hard.  
COACH KEVIN BORSETH: The game plan to start was to get out on them, get out
and put pressure on them and see if we can get them to cough it up. And the
first half they got shots were on the basket. They got drives. They got rhythm
3s. They got offense. Everything. Everything.  
Second half, they didn't get anything. You saw the same game I did. But they
had 16 points with the right tone. We did a great job defensively. And to
start the second half we came out with a quick 2. And two wide open 3s and a
layup we missed. If we made those, boom, you're right back in the game. But we
didn't score. To give up 58 points in a game like that is really, that
devastated -- they caught us on a couple of flip screens late in the game when
we made some substitutions, two slip screens that hurt us late.  
In the first half we gave them a lot of things we probably wouldn't have given
had we decided to change the plan at the start of the game. But offensively
you've got to score. We couldn't score. We couldn't find any rhythm. And what
we do it just is so predicated having players that can create for themselves.
Really is. Gotta space the floor. We have perimeter players that we give the
latitude to post up. Janelle is down there against a kid six-two trying to
post up. Jess is trying to post up against kids getting their shots altered.  
I know why coaches run plays. You recruit players who can't play, and you have
teach them to get open. A lot of that comes into play. We like to get
ourselves into a position where our players can do it themselves. And until
today we did a good job at it. Iowa is big. You get around that basket, holy
smokes, Janelle gets right there. Boom, there's that big hand coming up there.
I thought we did a good job creating for ourselves. They played very good
defensively, I thought. That was my take on it.  
  
Q. You guys played Iowa tough for the first two matches, you guys beating
them at home and then following close in Iowa. Was there something different
they did today to be able to shut you guys down so much on defense?  
COACH KEVIN BORSETH: They got better. They're big and they're veteran, and
they're well coached and they're smart. You know, I mean I go back and look at
the videotape, maybe things are going to jump out at me. But nothing right now
jumps out.  
They're playing extremely well. They're a very good team. They're clicking on
all cylinders, they really are. I don't know how much we've improved in our
ability to put the ball on the basket between the beginning of the year and
now. I know early on we catch people because we penetrate and they would suck
and we would kick and hit them. And after a while people say make them score
it. Don't let them shoot it.  
And we really hit a cold streak late in the year from the arc. Hit one
yesterday and we hit a cold streak later in the year. My goodness, Carly shot
the first one against Wisconsin, missed the rim. Shot another one today and
missed the rim. We hit a cold streak late in the year, for whatever reason. We
were hoping not to be able to do that.  
Iowa is good, talented, big. We didn't turn the ball over. We had 11
turnovers. For the most part that's pretty good. But our assists during the
course -- we haven't had many assists. Consequently, I'm learning assists and
turnover ratio doesn't necessarily tell you how well you take care of the
ball. You keep your number of turnovers down, it will. This game we had 11
turnovers. That's pretty good afternoon. We just don't get enough assists. And
that's a pretty critical part of the game. To be able to create for other
players as well. Get to the rim, command such a presence that it forces teams
to W so you can create for somebody else and Iowa did a good job of taking
that away from us.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that the season met your expectations, exceeded or
somewhere around there?  
COACH KEVIN BORSETH: I don't know. That's a good question. I love the kids we
have. They work hard. They've really -- I hate the word "bought in." I don't
buy into any of that stuff. They've really accepted the coaching staff well.
We've given them some feedback on their games. They've accepted that. They've
tried to bring it to another level. I think they tried and there was never a
game where they ever caved in and just cashed their chips in and said we don't
care. I think they played hard the whole year. That's really what you want.
You want a team that's gritty and a team that cares.  
If you do that, sooner or later things start to work your way. But harmony is
a pretty big thing. Work hard, get along together and good things happen. I
thought we had a lot of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got head coach, Jolette Law, and players Lacey Simpson
and Jenna Smith.  
If you'd like to start with a opening statement.  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: I think my team played a great total-team game. They stuck
with the game plan. And we executed our defense and our rebounding for the
difference in this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Jenna, can you talk about how strong you guys came out in the first half?
Just the energy you guys had and making that statement, coming out?  
JENNA SMITH: When we had our meeting before the game, Coach told us to come
out with a swagger. Knowing that we lost at home, it was 1-1, so we knew we
had to come out big, we knew we wanted to play Ohio, and we knew we wanted to
go further in the Big Ten.  
It's mostly for our seniors. We wanted to send them off with a bang. A lot of
them don't -- didn't play in the Big Ten. We know we want to play like it's
our last every single game. So we know we need to come out with a lot of
energy and dictate.  
  
Q. Being the focal point of the offense, can you talk a little bit about
what it meant for you tonight to have some offense from Lacey and Becca and
Chelsea and all those people?  
JENNA SMITH: I know Lacey and all of my teammates will give offense. If I'm
doubled, they know they need to get open for me or shoot or penetrate to get
me open or to get somebody open.  
We're having a full-out -- we're actually communicating now and we're playing
better team ball. So it's a better offense.  
  
Q. Jenna, with the intensity on the Big Ten Player of the Year award, did
you feel some extra added intensity coming into this game to prove a point?  
JENNA SMITH: It wasn't to prove a point, but it was just I was thinking
another game. Coach was talking to me about it. I brushed it off. It will be
exciting to play Ohio State tomorrow. But I'm happy for her. But it was just
another game for me. I didn't think take it bitter. It was just I had to come
out and play today.  
  
Q. What did you think of your defensive effort, held them to 25 percent in
the first half.  
LACEY SIMPSON: We discussed it. We had to come out low on D. Box them up. We
were pretty fired up for this game. We knew we had to come out with a big
defensive effort, as well as our offense. We were pretty fired up for it.  
  
Q. You've pulled within four and I think three points twice at the end of
the first half. Did you guys talk at halftime just about containing them and
not letting them get a little bit of a run, or did you feel that your first
half was so strong that you could just take that momentum and build on it in
the second?  
JENNA SMITH: We wasn't worried. Just keep boxing out. Keep doing what we do.
We weren't worried at all about it.  
  
Q. Lacey, how much encouragement do you guys take from the success you've
had against Ohio State this year? Does it mean anything going into tomorrow's
game?  
LACEY SIMPSON: I wouldn't say -- we beat Ohio State. I wouldn't look at it
like the biggest game ever. We're just looking at them as another opponent.  
Going to go in tomorrow and play like another opponent and play like we did
today. Bring the moments from today's game into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Coach Law, what are you going to do to turn your team around in less than
24 hours and get them to play another emotional yet physical game?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: First of all, we're going to go get a nice dinner and going
to watch film. There will probably be ice baths. They don't like the ice
baths, but get them in ice baths and get them refocused.  
Because right now this is another opportunity. We paid to play another 40, and
these young ladies, they'll be rested and focused. And we'll be ready for
tomorrow.  
We're just going to go back to the ranch and do what we do. Get dinner, focus
in on Ohio, our next opponent, watch film, and just really it's going to come
down to what we do.  
It's all about the small things. All season long. It's always come down to the
small things, and I think my team is starting to address them now.  
  
Q. Can you address the defensive?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: Chelsea did a great job and I want to give my team -- I
applaud them because even when she got stuck on screens, there were times my
post players were stepping up to help her. I've seen Jolene run through double
screens, post and other guards were bumping her.  
It was a total team effort but Chelsea did a great job. I think her height
slowed her down a little bit. And I give it to my team. My team helped her out
a lot.  
  
Q. Jenna, you only played 30 minutes. Did it feel like a light workout
compared to --  
JENNA SMITH: Yeah, in the locker room, Coach was like, 30 minutes? Isn't that
your season lowest? I was like, yeah. Keep it going. I was so happy to see all
my other teammates play, so yeah.  
  
Q. A couple of 3s, I think you only made six all season, were you just
feeling it or was it just available, going along with it?  
JENNA SMITH: Well, Coach always tells me at the post always try to beat me to
a block, pop out and shoot 3. So I was kind of wide open. So everybody was
like, Shoot it, so I shot it and it went in.  
So my team is always like, You need to shoot more. Because I always shoot with
them in practice and I'll try and mimic Laurie -- shooting, which is a
horrible idea. But I always try and I'll shoot if I'm wide open.  
THE MODERATOR: No more questions for student athletes. I'll let you ladies go.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't know if you can really answer this yet because your
season's not over. But are you reasonably happy with the progress that you
made in your first season at Illinois from where you were your first practice
to today?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: I say it every day, I thank God for the experience. This
was a great experience, a learning experience for me. The most important thing
I can say is the growth in my team. We're closer. We're learning.  
Our record doesn't indicate how far we've come. And I'm so proud of these
young ladies right now. And I am truly grateful and truly blessed to be a part
of this institution and to be a part of this team, be their coach. Because in
the beginning change is always different. I had to change and adjust and they
had to change and adjust to me and a new philosophy.  
It takes time. And anything worth having, it's like a process. We went through
the process and now hopefully we can continue to carry the momentum.  
  
Q. Will you take that same performance tomorrow at 6:00?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: From the performance from tonight? Oh definitely. I want my
kids to even take it to another level. They're focused. Sometimes now I don't
have to go to the huddle or when I go into adjustments in the halftime I'll
make adjustments. They're like, Okay, Coach, we understand. How many rounds do
we get? They're focused.  
And sometimes you know you don't want to see the losses. You don't want to see
Ls, but this year those close games, you know, I just know and I feel in my
heart that we're going to benefit from those losses. Even in this game
tomorrow. I'm going to pump my kids up and let them know that we had with Ohio
State and we held them to 43 points. We made history with that.  
We beat them on our home court. So we should just continue to do what we do
and do it well and on any given day. Any team can win. I'm just going to do
the best I can to prepare them. Motivate them and hopefully they'll come out
and play the way they did tonight.  
  
Q. I know that you guys take pride in your defense, top scoring defense of
the Big Ten. But the whole Wisconsin, something like 26 percent shooting I
think it was in the second half. You take a certain amount of pride in that?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: Oh, definitely. I'm defense-oriented. When I see my young
ladies start to buy into defense, repeating some of the things I was saying
earlier on, that they didn't like the word dictate, dominate. You know, Oh,
Coach we're going to dictate and dominate on defense.  
When I hear them saying it, it's encouraging. When you hold a good team like
Wisconsin to 25 percent in the second half, that's definitely encouraging
knowing that when you go in to face Ohio State, all these other great teams in
this league, it's encouraging to know that my team, they believe it, are
buying into it and are actually applying it to that.  
  
Q. Coach, were you more cognizant of subbing especially early in the game
today or not?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: Definitely. As of late, I'm saying even before the last
couple of games, I've been watching Erin McCarthy in practice the last few
weeks and she's been really, really given a lot -- you know, working hard
against Jenna, working hard against Audrey. And it wasn't to just put her in
just because.  
I knew and I told them before, It's nine strong. If we're going to go four
games in a row, every person here must come in and play significant minutes.  
And she came in and she was just like, Oh, my God, I gotta go in high and
rebound. And right now it's just more. You'll see her tomorrow. You'll see
Chelsea Buher tomorrow, and definitely for us to go on and play four back-to-
back games, we have to rely on nine strong.  
  
Q. I have a question about preparing for the Big Ten tournament. Do you
scout all your teams before you even came down here or are you guys going to
be up like late tonight trying to break down some of the things that Ohio
State has done in the last couple of games? Or have you already done that?  
COACH JOLETTE LAW: No. Every day I watch, my staff and I, we watch them all
the time every day. We try to simulate different things. Our kids don't know
it now, but just changing different drills to simulate, you know, Ohio State,
how we're going to handle it. Instead of just bombarding them with all these
patterns. Because in less than 24 hours you gotta get ready.  
They're prepared. We just try to focus on the things that we needed, some of
small things we need to address, i.e., rebounding, because this last game
Wisconsin had 21 points on offense and rebound against us. And they
outrebounded us tonight. We addressed that.  
We'll run a couple more intense rebounding drills. We outrebounded them
tonight. With Ohio State it's going to be the same; they rebound the ball
extremely well. They push the ball up the floor. So just try to simulate
different drills to simulate the opponents that we might play.  
But as far as going back to the hotel and watching films, of course. I didn't
sleep but two hours last night. And that's pretty much the norm for me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Amber Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18028)

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

### [Whitney Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18029)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Indiana's head coach, Felisha Legette-Jack, and players
Amber Jackson and Whitney Thomas. If you would like to make a comment.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: It was good to see our team in my opinion peaking at the
right time. We got rid of those nagging injuries and we finally learned how to
play the game inside out, and I'm really excited about what the future holds
for our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Amber, talk about the opportunity now to get to play Purdue and how
excited you are especially when you are playing very well?  
AMBER JACKSON: We'll take it one game at a time. Purdue is our in-state rival.
I'm excited to get out and play hard, do what we can to win.  
  
Q. Amber, talk at the very beginning of the game. Personal 11-0 run there. A
chance you get those passes, but still gotta feel good to put those points on
the board.  
AMBER JACKSON: Felt good. My teammates found me when I was open. And it was
about them seeing me and making the easy layups. It was all about my teammates
finding me.  
  
Q. Going along with that, first action in the Big Ten tournament here, how
did it feel for your confidence to get off to a quick start?  
AMBER JACKSON: Actually, I was a little bit nervous before the game. It's like
a new season, where now we're 1-0, but going in here 0-0. And it feels good to
be playing. It feels good to be playing and hopefully we can do really well
and make some noise.  
  
Q. Whitney or Amber, overall the team's success as far as getting some
points in the paint today. Can you both just talk about being able to have a
strong day in the paint?  
WHITNEY THOMAS: I feel like it was a team effort. We were finding everybody
and finding the open person and we were making a lot of extra passes and we
were being a team today and that's what got a lot of points for us.  
  
Q. Whitney, let me ask you the same question that Amber just answered about
tomorrow's game and the opportunity to play Purdue. You split with them this
year, so your thoughts going into tomorrow?  
WHITNEY THOMAS: As Amber said, in-state rivalry. Coach Jack told us it's not
about them, it's about us. We came here for us to do what we needed to do, and
that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Just following up on that. Is there an advantage, do you think, that you
guys got to play today and maybe kind of work the bugs out a little bit and do
you think that might help a little bit going into tomorrow?  
WHITNEY THOMAS: It definitely does because we have a lot of freshmen that have
never been here, played here. For that matter we have the upper classmen that
hasn't got here and they've gotten to know the court and the atmosphere, and
that really helped us.  
  
Q. Whitney, talk about stat line today. It's a pleasure to look I guess 12
points, 10 boards, three assists, two blocks, four steals, as part of the 14
team steals. Talk about you were everywhere, like a woman on a mission, I
guess?  
WHITNEY THOMAS: It's my role for this team and I step up when I need to and do
what I'm supposed to do on this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll take questions for Coach Legette-Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at this potentially a four-game week, how important was it
to distribute the minutes as you did and get these girls out as early as you
could?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: The only thing about it, I think adults get tired more so
than kids. Kids can play forever. I remember playing basketball eight, nine
hours a day and my mom coming and saying come in. I was so angry with her, how
could you stop me from playing. So we don't look it as -- however long it
takes is how long it takes.  
Our kids are ready to go. We have a great trainer. Robert Black has gotten our
kids in tip-top shape. We have a great strength and conditioning guy. I'm just
the one that tells them the plays to run. Those guys are the reason our kids
are in great shape. It's good to distribute minutes, but they've got to go
40-40-40-40, let it happen. But right now we'll stand in the moment and enjoy
this Northwestern win.  
  
Q. Talk about Jamie for a minute. Obviously not a game for her zero points.
Still five assists and three steals so just talk about her contributing.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Jamie was a major factor in our success today. Her role, I
just think she's stretching, yeah, we know she can score. Now we know she can
distribute the ball. We know she can push the ball a little bit. How many
deflects she had today? Probably four, five, six deflects. She's doing some
other things on the court that doesn't get as recognized as the scoring in the
rebounding. But Jamie Braun is the reason why we go.  
  
Q. Coach, getting back to the start of the game again. I know you wanted to
see your team come out well. How big was it to see Amber go out on that run in
the beginning of the game.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: She's been working hard to have a moment like this. We
always say it's really not about you; it's about the team. But she's been
watching film, in the gym working hard in the weight room. From what I'm
hearing she's with her teammates, they watch a movie. During commercials
she'll get down do push-ups and sit-ups. She's doing all she can to be the
best she can be. For her to have an outing like this was really a tribute to
what she's done in the past.  
  
Q. If you could talk about your defensive effort, 14 steals and forcing 19
turnovers?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I'm one of those old-time coaches, even though I'm so
young in this business. Don't tell me I look old either. I'm not going to have
that. (Smiling) I've only been coaching as a head coach for six years. I
believe defense creates your offense. I believe you win championships when you
play defense.  
So how exciting it was to see these points get on board. I really was
perturbed by some of our defensive lapses. We had 14 steals. I thought we
could have had a lot more. I think we lost our focus a little bit in this game
and we're going to find out the weaknesses in this game, learn from them and
then move on.  
  
Q. Let me ask you the same question as with Whitney earlier, your thoughts
about tomorrow and what do you think it might give you a little bit a jump of
Purdue having played today?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I'm not looking for that jump. I want our kids to play
great. I think it's wonderful to have in-state rivalry. I certainly didn't
understand how big this rivalry was when I first got here. I learned from my
players the importance of it. So I'm excited about being able to have an
opportunity to own your state. I think we got a lot of kids that can play in
our state, and I think that when you go out there and compete and you are
successful in-state it gives you an opportunity to keep your kids on your side
of the turf, if you will.  
And so it's good for that. But when the ball goes up in the air, it's just
about us doing what we do and what we stand for. It's not about really
anything about Purdue. It's about Indiana and our growth and what we're trying
to accomplish and something they've already done already. We're trying to get
to where they are at.  
  
Q. Coach, you said all season you're never satisfied. But today's game
overall, the closest satisfactory effort?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: No, we're never satisfied. Happy. Everybody wants to win.
If you're a coach you want to win. I was hired by a great guy who understands
we've got to win around here. But at the end of the day you have to stand for
something. It has to be bigger than just a win.  
We're trying to create a championship program here. We're trying, at the end
of it all, create a dynasty. In order to do that you have to win a certain
way. At the end of the day we want to tell a story. We have a story that's
really important to us that we want to share but we don't want to share on
this level. We want to get to another level. In order to do that, we have to
keep competing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Tyra Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18020)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with questions for the players.  
  
Q. Tyra, what did you see during the big run of theirs in the second half;
were they doing something defensively to you guys, or was it their offense?  
TYRA GRANT: I wouldn't say they were doing anything different. They're a good
team. Like they were getting their open shots and they were driving to the
hoop a lot more. Like they were getting open and like weren't rotating so much
with help shots. But they didn't really do anything differently.  
It was just like their cuts were a little bit harder. Everything was working a
little bit in their favor.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Kamela or Tyra?  
Questions for Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys had -- you were up five points. Seemed like you were
on the verge of taking control, then it went the other way. What did you
notice with either your team or their team at that point?  
COACH COQUESE WASHINGTON: Couple things. I think we weren't attacking the
basket. We started settling for jump shots and weren't connecting on those. I
mean defensively it was more a situation where our defensive intensity just
kind of let go. They were able to penetrate, get into the lane and cause us
problems there.  
And I don't recall how many offensive rebounds they got, but in the key
stretch they got three or four offensive rebounds that were kind of killers
for us.  
  
Q. Obviously some of us don't see you all year long and we're used to Penn
State, what they've done in the past. How tough is it coming over, and this
losing streak has been tough to swallow; what have you said to them about
this?  
COACH COQUESE WASHINGTON: About the losing streak?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH COQUESE WASHINGTON: We really take it one game at a time, so we haven't
focused on however many it's been in a row. We have that approach whether
we're winning or losing. We take it one game at a time and try to get better
night in and night out. Nobody on this team is pleased that we kind of
finished the season on a down note. But they're a resilient bunch, and I have
all the faith that they'll get into the gym this summer and get better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Beth Combs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16862)

### [Jenny Eckhart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18030)

### [Amy Jaeschke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18031)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Northwestern Head Coach Beth Combs, student athletes
Jenny Eckhart and Amy Jaeschke. Coach, if you would make an opening statement.  
COACH BETH COMBS: Obviously a disappointing first round game for us. We really
expected to come in here and win a ball game. And kudos to Indiana. A very
defensive tough game, first half. They got a lot of transition points.  
I'm proud of what our team has done this year. I know it's not shown up in the
win-loss column. We've been through a lot of adversity this year. These
players like Jenny and Amy have led the way for us and have held up under a
lot of different circumstances. And I look forward to the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Jenny, 13 points. But I know maybe there's turnovers. If you would talk
about Indiana's defense to get to those steals?  
JENNY ECKHART: I was disappointed in that part of my game. Something that I
care a lot about, taking care of the ball as a point guard. So I was
disappointed in myself with that.  
But as you said, their defense was really good. Their hedging the screens, the
passing lanes. I mean they did play good defense but at the same time I think
I could have taken care of the ball better. I should be able to control that.  
  
Q. Amy, can you talk a little bit about trying to stop Whitney and Amber
down low. They were pretty good down on the boards. Could you talk about what
you tried to do to stop them?  
AMY JAESCHKE: All season long we struggled with blocking people out. The
common theme coach always sort of tries to impress upon us. Once again, step
up and back out. I think that's what's been killing us all year and killed us
in this game also.  
THE MODERATOR: If there are no more questions for Jenny or Amy, thank you.
Questions for Coach Combs.  
  
Q. Actually asked Coach Jack the same thing, but Jamie Braun, the team's
leading scorer on Indiana, you guys held her scoreless, but she contributed in
assists and a couple of steals?  
COACH BETH COMBS: She's a great player. And unfortunately for us everybody
else on the team stepped up. You talk about containing Jamie. She's obviously
a fantastic player. But that's what makes Indiana a pretty good team to recon
with. They didn't need her to score. They needed her to just hand them the
ball and make the right decisions, and she definitely does that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start of the game when Amber scored the first
11 points, what you thought at that point, what you tried to do after that?  
COACH BETH COMBS: Well, we've talked, a lot as Amy alluded to just, as far as
rebounding and help side rotation. Our help side rotation wasn't there. They
had four-on-three breaks and three-on-two breaks. They're making four passes
in the breaks and we're not making the stops. Amber did a great job finishing
them down low. But our help rotation wasn't there. Our box-outs weren't there
and it put us in a hole early.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Carly Benson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16857)

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

### [Krista Phillips](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18023)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the press conference with opening statements from
Coach Kevin Borseth.  
COACH BORSETH: We're obviously very excited. The guys haven't had an
opportunity to win -- the seniors, specifically, haven't had an opportunity to
win a Big Ten Tournament game since they've been here. So it was a very big
day for us.  
THE MODERATOR: We have Krista Phillips and Carly Benson.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 17-0 run? Did something change there and which end
was it better at, offense or defense?  
CARLY BENSON: I would say that we just came out and we knew that there were
going to be runs when they would go on and runs we would go on. We had to try
to stop their runs and keep our runs going as long as we could.  
I thought in the second half we did a good job coming back when things weren't
going our way in the first half, then we started to play really well together
and that helped.  
  
Q. Krista, obviously before Coach Borseth got here you were used to a lot of
losing and he's used to a lot of winning. Looking at his career, what does it
mean to be getting past the first round and not going home today?  
KRISTA PHILLIPS: It means a lot. When I got here, I wasn't used to losing and
we had a rough season, and, yeah, that happens, but it's in the past. He wants
to win and we all want to win. That's the attitude right now. We're playing
every game like we need to win because we want to win. I think that's what's
driving us right now.  
  
Q. In the first half, Penn State did a good job picking up offensive
rebounds but in the second half you did a better job getting the defensive
rebounds. Can you tell me what the difference?  
KRISTA PHILLIPS: I think after halftime we were cognizant we gave up a lot
more offensive rebounds. The biggest thing was we talked about it and we made
the adjustment, which was kind of the thing we've been doing all season,
getting better making adjustments and getting it done.  
  
Q. Was it the game plan to go in you, like, every time right at the
beginning of the game and set the tone, or did that happen just naturally?  
KRISTA PHILLIPS: I think any time -- you know, that's my favorite place to get
the ball, is to block, so as much as we can get it, I love it. I think it's
always the game plan. I like to get the ball and I like to -- I like to bang
the paint and I think that's what I do best.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
Questions for Coach Borseth.  
  
Q. Coach, with the expectations this team had at the beginning of the year
and this being your first year, how does it feel being, sitting here winning
one game in the Big Ten tournament?  
COACH BORSETH: To be honest, I didn't eat this morning when I got up. You just
get that feeling in your belly that you don't know exactly how you're going to
do it. You really want the kids to do well. They work so hard to make this a
special year. To come in the Big Ten Tournament and not get a game, it's
really -- you want to be able to do well in the tournament. You want to be
able to advance.  
We did that today. I think we earned it and we got a chance to play another
day. That's very exciting.  
  
Q. What did you see during the run? Was it more defensive or offensive?  
COACH BORSETH: It's funny, because we inserted Ronnie Hicks and we inserted AJ
and put Skrba, put three of our starters, those kids I think we were down five
at the time. Ronnie deflected a pass right away. They made things happen for
whatever reason.  
I think it just gave us a good fresh set of legs. They energized us and got us
back into the game. Actually when they came out we were back, the starters
went back in, those guys built a lead up so that energy really helped us.
That's what I felt.  
  
Q. What do you think has really led to so much improvement this year? A lot
of these kids probably aren't used to 17-0 runs in college basketball, things
like we saw today, being patient in a tight game like that?  
COACH BORSETH: In a game like Wisconsin, when we lost early, we turned the
ball over five times when they were making 3s. I told them I don't care what
kind of shot you got, just take care of it. Take care of the ball get a shot
every time down the court. They're going to make some shots. They're going to
hit some 3s and make things some things around the basket, make things happen.  
That's what happens when teams are making runs. Take care of it, get a shot
every time down the court. And that really helped. Plus, every time we turned
it over, Penn State is so good in transition. Taking care of the ball down the
stretch is pretty key.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the year you spoke about usually you don't use your
bench a lot. Can you talk about are you surprised by the fact that Skrba and
Jones and Hicks have solidified themselves as three key bench people? Can you
just talk about whether -- are you surprised that they've really stepped into
their role there?  
COACH BORSETH: We need to -- if you look -- if we need to win this tournament,
if we want to win this tournament we're going to need more players, obviously.
You can't just -- you're playing a game less than 24 hours, you've got to play
another one, you need to have more people.  
I guess our intention at the beginning of the year was just to solidify what
it is we were trying to accomplish as a group, first of all, with five people.
And I think if you get those five to understand and then the rest can learn
from that while they're sitting there, then insert them slowly, I think it
helps us.  
We've got a couple of kids in the lineup, maybe not as much as we'd like to
have, but it's a start.  
  
Q. You knew Penn State would be good at transitions but how frustrating was
it for them to see them go down and score some of those points?  
COACH BORSETH: Every time we turn it over. KP threw that long pass side line
to slide line. And I think Skrba threw one of those as well. And Coop missed a
layup in the first half. Any time you miss a layup or turn the ball over, they
come flying at you. They make them. We need to take care of it, obviously, and
make the layups. Those two things help.  
  
Q. You said you couldn't eat this morning. What kind of stuff was going
through your mind going into a game like this?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. What do you think? You want the kids to do well.
They worked so doggone hard. I love these kids. They have a new coach to come
in, and for them to accept us the way they have has really been really
special.  
They put some extra time in the gym. I come in in the locker room halftime,
one of them is diagramming things on the board. They just want -- they want it
to be a special year. Going into these games, Penn State is pretty good.
They're talented. Grant, 1 and 25-25, those two kids, they're pretty talented
kids. They get them on the run any time.  
You hope your kids are able to play well for them so they can enjoy part of
this college basketball experience as well.  
  
Q. Coach, two schools of thought: Dubious run where the team hasn't won for
a few years here. Do you mention it, dwell on it, or you don't say anything
because you don't need to say anything to them about it?  
COACH BORSETH: I talked to them about it. I said, How many of you guys won a
conference run? They said, None of us.  
Obviously it's there. You can't run from it. You know what I mean? You have to
face it. But it's our turn. It's our time to get down there and get a game out
of it and earn a chance to play a second day, which I felt we did.  
  
Q. How did you address the team at the end of the game? Telling them, Enjoy
this for a second but tomorrow we've got a game?  
COACH BORSETH: Haven't got that so far. I was so hungry. In fact, I was late
getting here because I was eating. Grabbed myself a pulled pork sandwich in
the locker room.  
We savor the moment until we get back to the hotel, then make adjustments for
Iowa because they're obviously very good.  
  
Q. How odd is it for you to see players diagramming plays in the locker room
compared to what you kind of start out with at the beginning of the season? Is
that the things you noticed that led to this kind of improvement?  
COACH BORSETH: Over the course of time you'd be surprised if you give the
players some latitude to make some decisions on their own, because they do
ultimately on the floor, they do make decisions on their own. You can't
diagram and coach every player they have. And as a result they've got to
accept some responsibility for it.  
So it's good. I feel bad when I walked into the locker room at halftime.
There's no chatter. And I feel good when I walk in and there is chatter
because it means they're trying to figure things out on their own, because
they have to be able to do it on the floor and communicate with one another.  
It's about them. It's all about them. They have to figure it out on the court
by themselves and it helps when they communicate.  
  
Q. What was the diagramming?  
COACH BORSETH: It was Krista. When I walked in she was diagramming. She went
and sa down. They're trying to figure things out. There was a couple of
scenarios we just weren't covering very well and they're trying to communicate
how they were going to cover it. They get a little nervous when you miss it
the first time. And then the second time everybody kind of just freezes. And
they were just trying to work it out.  
  
Q. Which Krista?  
COACH BORSETH: Krista Clement. She's a true leader.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Jolene Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16860)

### [Janese Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16859)

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Coach Stone, Jolene Anderson and Janese Banks. Coach,
would you like to start with an opening statement.  
COACH LISA STONE: Disappointed. Disappointed in our lack of energy, lack of
intensity to start it from the tip. Give Illinois credit, certainly. They came
out with a great defensive focus. Really hammered the boards pretty hard. We
were down 12-5 at one juncture. But rebound from it.  
And even though we were lacking energy for whatever reason, we're still within
four. We came in the locker room and scored right away. Got the stop. They
were on a 25-5 run. Couldn't stop the bleeding. Looking for some answers. Went
big.  
And what it boils down to we didn't shoot the ball really well. 26 percent in
the second half is just not going to get it done.  
And we couldn't take advantage when they took Jenna Smith out of the game. We
need to take advantage of the fact that she was on the bench. They tried to
rest her, obviously, which was smart. But we didn't take advantage.  
I thought Jolene had a great performance, did everything she could to win the
game for us. But we needed a little bit of help.  
I thought Alyssa Karel played well for a freshman in her first Big Ten
tournament. Danielle Ward, got her loosened up for the post, but it wasn't
enough firepower tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. Jolene and Janese, could you kind of sense the lack of energy from the
start, or did that surprise you?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: It definitely wasn't there, the first four minutes of the
basketball game. Shot selection, turnovers that we had. And Illinois came out
of the gate strong and we have to give them credit. They were ready for this
basketball game.  
I think when it boils down to it, all eight players or nine players that
Illinois has, they're all in it together. And I think none of us were in it
together as a team, as a whole boat, everybody didn't come ready to play.  
JANESE BANKS: It definitely surprised me. I guess when we first started I felt
like we were going to have energy, I think we were going to battle. But kind
of just dwindled down and nobody really showed emotion. Nobody was really
together. I don't think anybody wanted to play like that. I think for some
reason as a unit we couldn't get together. People themselves had some energy
but we couldn't find that cohesiveness.  
  
Q. Janese, towards the end of the first half you guys pulled within 3 twice
and were down 6, I think, at the half. Did you go into the locker room and
think we can get through this? What did you guys talk about coming out after
half time?  
JANESE BANKS: Definitely, we knew we had to crash the boards. That was the
thing that would turn it in the first half. I thought we were -- we were right
there. And of course we didn't -- we know we weren't shooting the ball
particularly well so we knew we wanted to take high percentage shots and just
play together.  
But going in the locker room, everybody was fine. Nobody seemed scared or
nervous. So I don't know. It's in the second half.  
  
Q. Jolene, how pivotal was the run in the second half? You guys were within
six, overcome deficits in the last couple games and they kind of come out with
a big charge.  
JOLENE ANDERSON: You know, they definitely did come out of the locker room
strong. I think it comes back to the first half. We had nine straight stops in
a row. We didn't capitalize on any of them or at least three of them maybe at
max.  
But I think that's what it boils down to. Once we get stopped in the first
half and capitalize, we go into half time in a better position than we did. We
have to be ready for Illinois. We knew they were going to come out strong.
Like I said, they were ready to play.  
But our team, I don't know if we have an answer for it. It's just that we have
to get better, obviously, and hopefully that's something that we'll work on.  
  
Q. Jolene, does the loss take away the excitement of the award today?  
JOLENE ANDERSON: It does. Definitely does, because I just want my team to win.
Any award I get just goes on the back burner. It hurts that our basketball
team didn't get the W. But you just gotta move on, really.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Lisa, I don't mean to pile on here. But your team, in conference schemes,
gave up more points than any other team. You were tenth in field goal defense,
tenth in 3-point defense. What do you do between the end of this season and
the start of next to fix that?  
COACH LISA STONE: We talked a little bit about that, too, looking at it.
Disappointing for us, to go and give up more than we want to. It's very
disappointing for us.  
What do we do? We scratch what we've been doing. We start over. And we really
do. We take a good strong look at our defense. And emulate my friend, that's
what they do. They went, talked to some folks. We're scheduled to do that
already. We talked about it, Don and Tonya and I have and talk about whether
we go to zone principles or a little bit more of an arm's distance.  
Actually, what's end up happening to us a lot is we're following so much.
We're getting up and guarding people. You can't put a team like Illinois on
the line 29 times.  
A lot of the points we're giving up also with many teams, it would be
interesting to find out that statistic, how many points we're giving up at the
free throw line. Because I think that's certainly coupled with open looks and
drives to the basket, et cetera. We need to fix it. There's no question. It
needs addressing immediately.  
And we will. Certainly will. I think we've got a younger, eager team with 11
kids on the team, freshmen, sophomore. They're just, show us where when and
how to do it and we'll do it. But we are going to -- we're going to go back to
square one with our defense, no question about it.  
  
Q. Lisa, what did you talk about at the half or did you want to make any
changes in particular going into --  
COACH LISA STONE: Half time, you know, first of all, I don't know if it was
Gordon or Lacey Simpson that stole the ball. Raided Jo up top. Could have cut
it down to 2, now you're down 6. 33 seconds left to go in the half. So we turn
it over there. They get a run out. We come down, play to Danielle. Doesn't go
in. Get a couple of good looks. As poor as we played in the first half, no
energy, I was feeling pretty good at half time.  
Went in and said, ladies, we're right there as far as how poorly we played.
Amp it up. Let's get a defensive stop right away. Start attacking the basket.
Get better shots, get better screens. Go inside out. Play together. Stick it
out and make some things happen. Defensively we wanted to double Jenna a
little bit harder. She got too many easy looks in the first half.  
What ended up happening, Harris takes off. And here comes Simpson and Gordon
and Lori Bjork. I don't know what she ended up with -- well, she didn't score.
No, she had five points. And that says a lot about Lori Bjork, if I'm reading
that right. She's a good player.  
If she has to score 20, she will. If she doesn't, she'll assist and do other
things. We wanted to be more aggressive defensively. We went with the same
starting lineup. Had to start small. Saw Lisa Karel was running 30 minutes out
there. Had her and Rae in at the same time. Finding some aggressiveness.  
I'm trying to find energy. Digging from everywhere. And it just didn't happen.
And that's what's disappointing. I don't know how you can come here and not be
fired up for this tournament. It's disappointing to me.  
  
Q. How surprised are you that Jolene was really the only one that could
score given how balanced you guys have been in the last half of the season?  
COACH LISA STONE: Well, I like the fact that we got Danielle the first half.
That was pretty good. Alyssa got to the basket a couple of times. We shot the
ball poorly in other areas. The fact that Jolene double-doubled and five
assists, three steals, those are miraculous numbers considering the approach.  
They face guarded her the whole game. It's not easy to score that kind of
points with that type of defense on her. But it wasn't enough. We needed
scoring from other places and more consistently. And we just didn't get it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2008

  

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Brandi Kimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17035)

### [Dionne Marsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14530)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The all-tournament team is Sara Hunter, Colorado State; Dionne
Marsh, New Mexico; Brandi Kimble, New Mexico; Allison Duffy, San Diego State;
Jene Morris, San Diego State; and tournament MVP, Dionne Marsh.  
Coach, if you want to begin with some comments on the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to San Diego State. They played
a heck of a game. I'm not sure anybody knew who was going to win that game
with about two minutes left to go or three minutes left to go. It was a highly
competitive game.  
From our standpoint, it took us a while to get accustomed to the speed of the
game. They're very quick at every position. I thought the first half it took
us a while to get effective at all on our offense. We started moving a little
bit more, setting some more screens, trying to get the ball inside. I thought
getting the ball inside was the key.  
And then Brandi slashing and Dionne posting was about the best that we could
do.  
Coming right down to that last shot, they fouled Amy, first of all, with eight
seconds or nine seconds left to go. And Amy's a very, very accurate free throw
shooter when the pressure's on her. She hit both of those. It made it a three-
point difference.  
Then at the end we were switching all screens. We were fortunate that that
ball didn't go in because they shot it up there. Didn't look like it was even
close. It rimmed around there.  
Again, congratulations to San Diego State. But I thought our two seniors were
just outstanding playing another great tournament for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Was part of the strategy to go in and put them in foul trouble? How much
damage do you think you did to San Diego State?  
DIONNE MARSH: Well, they're a very physical team. When you play in the post
position, it's going to be physical anyway. You know, it has somewhat to do
with kind of somewhat experience and hustle. When you're a little bit older,
you know a little bit more things to do, you know, to maneuver, get around
players, make sure you're getting into position.  
So the girls from San Diego State, they played very well. They're going to be
very good coming up in the next two years. But we were just the more
aggressive team towards the end and we kept our poise and we did well.  
  
Q. Third tournament MVP. Talk about that. What about the tournament gets you
going?  
DIONNE MARSH: That was like totally unexpected. Brandi did like exceptionally
well today. Especially there towards the end, I was having a little bit of
trouble offensively.  
But it's a great honor. I mean, I'm sure nobody would not want it. But the
team did well. As a team, we played our best basketball, I think, as of yet.
And hopefully we can continue that going into the tournament.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how the team seemed to grow as the season went
along. Can you talk about how they showed that poise at the end of the game.  
DIONNE MARSH: Yeah, like I said, San Diego State plays well. They're going to
keep fighting. They're going to keep hustling. We had a lot of practice with
that all year, trying to gain poise throughout games because we've lost a few
games by five points or less.  
The fact that you keep playing those types of games gives you more and more
experience. The more we play, the more the girls should be used to these type
of situations. And everybody was just ready.  
  
Q. Playing in the Mountain West Conference tournament year after year,
having the success, how much does it help you?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: We're very fortunate, you know, to have the chance to go there.
It means a lot to us, especially me and Dionne being seniors. We're looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Just talk quick about what, if anything, you two seniors told the rest of
the team coming into this?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: Actually, me and Dionne kind of talked to each other since
we're seniors. We just said, We have to step it up. We're the leaders of the
team. That's what we did. I think the other girls, they fed off our energy
after that.  
  
Q. Talk about the start of the second half. You go down six, they come out
get a couple, down eight immediately. How important was it for you to get it
going at that point?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: You know, it was huge. But basketball is a game of runs. I
think we handled their pressure really well. We just took one shot at a time.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. I know you enjoy every championship, but talk about this year's team. How
is this championship special?  
COACH FLANAGAN: It meant a great deal, first of all. This is a team that had
some failures. The top three teams in the league, we lost both times to them.
All of those games were close. A lot of the times we had leads going into the
last four minutes of the game.  
So we had some disappointments throughout the year. For them to come back at
this point in the year and play so well and play so confidently, that's a
tribute to the effort they gave in practice and the determination they had
when they came to this tournament to be successful.  
  
Q. You had some turnover problems, 17, but none in the last three and a half
minutes. Is that being tournament-tested or getting accustomed to the pace of
the game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, the speed of the game was not to our liking.
They were faster at every position, so that didn't bode well for us.  
Against them, 17 turnovers is not bad, really. I know it sounds bad. But UConn
had 26 turnovers against them. UConn might be the best team in the country.  
With the way they pressure the ball, what they do at every position, deny,
it's very difficult to not turn the ball over. But as you said, we didn't turn
it over in the last three and a half minutes and that's probably one of the
reasons why we won the game.  
I was trying to find a combination of players that would take care of the
ball. Obviously you could see that I was subbing. I wasn't subbing Brandi out.
I wasn't subbing Dionne out. I wasn't subbing Amy out. But the other players I
was rotating pretty quickly. Trying to get them to be calm when they caught
the ball to make good decisions on their passing because I knew if we got it
into Dionne, she could score.  
I knew with Brandi, Brandi could score on her player, also. So those were two
players we had to get the ball to. I guess we did it just enough.  
  
Q. Did you consider that last possession trying to foul them?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I considered it for about one second. What I don't like about
that is if you foul them, they go to the line, they shoot one free throw,
okay? They hit that one. They hit the second free throw. They could tip it
back out and actually win the game. That's the only way they could win the
game.  
To me, I know there's a controversy about it, it would depend on who handled
the ball. If they threw it into the worst free throw shooter on their team, I
might foul her. But other than that, I don't trust us to block out well enough
to be able to get that rebound after a missed shot.  
  
Q. The first couple times you played them, the zone was very effective. In
that first half, seemed like they shot the lights out. What did you talk about
at halftime on how to slow them down?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, what I felt at halftime was that we had to match their
effort, their hustle, their speed. It took us a half to get accustomed to the
speed of the game. And once we got accustomed to it, we were a lot more
effective as a team.  
But I'll tell you what, I mean, they earned those shots. We played zone
halfway decent, but they just knocked them in. I've never seen them shoot that
well. I thought the zone would be much more effective against them. They
actually got us out of the zone in a big hurry just because they could shoot
the three so well. Normally they miss some of those shots, but they didn't
today.  
  
Q. Dionne wins MVP. Can you talk about Brandi's performance?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I don't know how you make a decision between those two
players. There's not two trophies, so you can't give them each a trophy. I
don't know who was more effective.  
I'll tell you this, Dionne has had great tournaments here, just tremendous
tournaments here. Three out of four years being MVP, that's just unheard of.  
But Brandi has always guarded the toughest offensive player on the other team.
She played their toughest player and did an excellent job on defense there.  
I couldn't make a choice if I was the one to make the choice. Since I didn't
have that decision to make, I'm not going to make any comment about the
decision.  
I thought both of them deserved that trophy.  
  
Q. Obviously automatic bids to the NCAA. With 1 through 3 seeds out in the
tournament early, who do you see or who do you think deserves as spot in that
tournament?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Now I'm going to make some enemies if you make me say
something like that (laughter).  
I don't think there's any doubt that Utah deserves to go. Are you from
Cheyenne?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Wyoming deserves to go. I thought TCU had a good year, too.  
We've done it before. We've had four teams go from our conference. It would be
nice to have four teams go again. But we'll see what happens.  
I do think we certainly will have three, and it would be nice if we had four.
Sure has been a tough conference, I thought.  
  
Q. As little as Porche has played, did you have to swallow hard before you
put her in or did you feel like she had what you needed at that time?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, I was in Vegas and I figured I'd take a gamble. When I
put her in, I said, I'm shooting craps right now.  
She's very athletic, long. She's gonna be a good player. She just hasn't
learned some of the fundamentals she needs to learn. But I thought she could
rebound and I thought she could defend efficiently enough that we could get
some quality minutes out of her.  
I thought we were getting a little fatigued at that position and a little bit
standing around at that position. I wasn't going to play her too long. But she
hit a shot. I actually told her, I said, You know you hit a shot during the
game. I don't think she was sure she did score. She was probably a little bit
in awe of the situation.  
But every time I've put her in, she's played with a lot of poise. I see her
being a good player in the future. Maybe she wasn't ready for that situation.
But maybe because I put her in, she will be in the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, coach. Good luck next week.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some opening remarks
about the game.  
COACH BURNS: We'd like to open with just great congratulations to University
of New Mexico and Coach Flanagan for just a fantastic game. I thought their
team did a terrific job exploiting everything that we had. They're a great
champion and I know that they will represent us well when they get an
opportunity, especially to play with their home fans the first two rounds. So
that's great for the Mountain West Conference. They're a class act.  
Today's game, you know, I think the most things I was trying to get across to
our team, that we are right there and we kept it close, because our foul
situation, any flow that we might have had, made things really challenging. It
was really disruptive.  
I think that Dionne Marsh is a great champion and I think she's been the most
valuable player here before. She fouled three of us out. Came close to it.
That's a credit to Dionne.  
I think that Quenese did a fantastic job all week, but especially today. She
and Jene, they're running mates. I think coming into the game I knew that both
Jene and I felt that Brandi Kimble and Jene are the two best defenders in the
league. And I knew it was going to be a battle. But unfortunately Brandi
didn't get the chance to guard Jene because Jene spent most of the time on the
bench with foul trouble, which is really the first time all year. She's really
never, ever been in foul trouble. I know that now that you've seen her for
three games, it's remarkable with the kind of pressure she consistently puts
on the ball. She's that good. Her feet are that good and she doesn't foul.
That was a bit of a loss for us.  
I think both Paris and Allison struggled today. A lot of big bodies being
thrown at 'em. At the end of the day, rebounding does win championships and we
struggled I think beginning, middle and end in that area.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Quenese, could you take me through the last shot, whether you thought
that was going in.  
QUENESE DAVIS: I was just trying to get it as close as we can, just cut the
lead, get the ball up.  
  
Q. Jene, do you see this as an end or just the beginning?  
JENE MORRIS: I definitely see it as just the beginning. Our team has
definitely grown since the beginning of the season. And even though it's a
disappointing loss, there's definitely hope for the future.  
I think we finally found ourselves in this tournament. We gained our
confidence, and we finally found our flow. So it's definitely the beginning.  
  
Q. You're taking this loss hard, really hard, aren't you?  
QUENESE DAVIS: Yes.  
JENE MORRIS: Yes. I'm taking it very hard. I mean, you know, we work so hard,
we fought hard the first two games of this conference. I mean, we fought hard
today. Just didn't go our way. Like coach says, sometimes you aren't able to
cut down the nets. But we were right there. We were right there.  
  
Q. Were you playing with heavy hearts after what happened yesterday?  
ALLISON DUFFY: Well, of course we were. But I just think we kept her in our
mind and just kind of wanted to take into consideration all the support she
showed our team. It was more like we just wanted to put it out there and play
as hard as we could because we knew she wouldn't want us to give up in the
end, not to let that get us down, so... I think that pushed us even harder to
play hard.  
  
Q. Allison, can you talk about how foul trouble changed your game today.  
ALLISON DUFFY: It affects you a lot. I mean, offensively and defensively. When
you're working with so many big bodies on offense, you have to watch out for
offensive fouls. Then on defense, I mean, with Marsh, as good a player as she
is, you can't, you know, go as hard as you want to guard.  
So when the ref is telling you to back off, you need to lower your contact,
it's kind of hard because it affects your defense.  
With foul trouble, you have to take it down a notch, so that does hurt.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. Good job.  
Questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Could you describe how proud you are of this team right now and what
they've done the last four days.  
COACH BURNS: Yeah, it's been a remarkable week. This one is not in the manual,
how to put -- I can't even put it into perspective.  
I think we've grown so much. Before the game, right before we went out, I said
to them, I only have two words -- which for all of you that know me, they
probably know that I was making that up. I said, I have two words. One of them
said, You've already exceeded your two-word limit. And the two words were:
thank you. This is why we do what we do.  
Usually I say they kind of like you when they're around, and 10 years later
they remember that they love you. But to watch people grow up in front of your
eyes, at the end of the day, you get an opportunity to play in a championship
game, on a whole lot of guts. No matter what was thrown our way, it's been
remarkable.  
The most exciting part obviously is maybe this was a little bit of future. We
got a little taste, which how fantastic is that for the hunger that will fuel
us? Not just the hunger, but the experience.  
I mean, look at Brandi Kimble, look at Dionne Marsh, look at the experience,
because they've done this so many times. Every game we've played in was a
game. The experience and the confidence that we take from that, you know, if
we're fortunate enough to continue our season, whether it's the WNIT bid,
which would be great to add to it, or just to springboard us into next season,
would be great.  
  
Q. What do you think your chances are NIT-wise?  
COACH BURNS: You know, we've been locked in this little conference bubble for
about four days, so I don't know who's winning and who's losing. I mean, I
think it kind of comes down to that. In my case, the wrong people have to win
games. You know, you need some NIT people -- like New Mexico just made
somebody mad, because I'd like to think that both of us had to win the game to
get in the tournament. So we need some more New Mexicos out there to win some
conference tournaments to give us an opportunity.  
I know we've bid to host. But we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that final three, when Quenese threw that up, what was
going through your mind?  
COACH BURNS: We were fortunate we had a little time to get organized 'cause
Coco had never -- I bet you knew that was Jene's spot. But we had kind of a
little misdirection screen where either Quenese or Coco would set up for a
three. And I actually kept both my bigs in with Sandy who can shoot a three-
point shot as well, because I thought they were rebounding so well, even if I
put a fourth shooter on the floor, if we missed it, I thought I'd need two
rebounders to throw it out to three.  
Players make plays. You saw that yesterday. That's why I put Coco at the point
and Q -- I wanted Q to make the decision. Make the decision. You think you've
got a look, take it. For 15 years, if she doesn't have it, she knows where to
find her sister.  
All you can ask for is a chance at the end. She had a good look. It almost
went down.  
  
Q. I know you look at this team right now, you did this in three days with
seven or eight players on the bench. You have two sophomores, two freshmen.
What do you see your ceiling being?  
COACH BURNS: One of our signees won a California state championship last
night. That's pretty cool. We've signed four more that are coming in.  
I guess we kind of accelerated the future with the misfortune of Shanna Demus'
injury, because that was going to be our biggest loss, from the complexion of
this year's team to next year's team.  
I think Coco Davis had a fantastic tournament. Coming in as a freshman, that
is really big because even though the other ones you say, of course they're
young, but they've been playing all year long. I'm really excited for Coco,
for her confidence level.  
There's nothing better than to get -- you know, the guy who comes in 257th
doesn't usually cry, it's the guy who comes in second. That gives you the
hunger and the passion to do what you got to do. They're great kids. They're
great competitors. We'll work hard. We'll learn and come back.  
It's exciting. I'd like to think we've only just begun. But today is the
Lobos' day.  
  
Q. Was this a worst-case scenario where they beat you up pretty good inside
on the boards? They out-rebounded you by like 13.  
COACH BURNS: It's our biggest area of weakness. Consistently all season long
we very rarely have out-rebounded opponents and really focussed just as much
as we can to keep them off the glass. It's not surprising. You know, it would
have taken really a huge effort on our part. Not that we didn't, but day
three, we were asking a lot.  
They get the ball. You know, we had one, I would tell you, like point-blank
missed assignment. Brandi Kimble is the best 5'9", if she's that, on a good
hair day, rebounder in the country. She's relentless. And it was just we got
physically overmatched a little bit.  
The want to was there. This is what I said to the team when I said, not
everybody can cut down the nets. If we played really poorly, we'd feel bad. We
didn't play really poorly. We got in a ton of foul trouble. And they were
great. I thought they played very, very well.  
  
Q. Early on they went on that 7-0 run to open the game, you called a
timeout. Seemed like you fired them up, you went on a run. What did you say to
the team?  
COACH BURNS: Not the best start. Well, we opened the game. Two of our five ran
the wrong set. First ever championship game. So play through it. Play through
it. Just needed to calm them down. Just needed to remind them where they go.  
I look like I'm firing them up, but we just yell all the time. We love each
other. We just are yelling. It's a positive thing. We're all emotional. But it
was more just encouraging. C'mon, let's do what we know how to do. I think
that just settled them down to get playing.  
  
Q. You upset No. 2 and 3 seed, almost knocked off No. 4. Utah was also
upset. Do you think that shows the strength of this Mountain West Conference?
If so, how many bids do you think this conference will get for the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH BURNS: Well, part of the reason we think we've been able to sign such
good players in these last two classes is, thanks to Don Flanagan, Elaine
Elliott, Jeff Mittie, eight tournament bids over the last two years, then two
years ago obviously all five winning their first-round game. We're one of the
top seven RPI leagues in the country.  
I thought coming in that Utah and Wyoming were a lock. New Mexico was my dark
horse. I said that yesterday. So nobody thinks I'm making that up. I thought
TCU, only because they struggled in the non-conference, may have to get to the
championship game.  
I'd be really disappointed and surprised. Wyoming has earned it by what they
accomplished last year going through the run in the NIT and the non-conference
wins. I mean, Wyoming and Utah to me should be in. Obviously New Mexico's in.
The one who has a chance, because of the good Oklahoma State win and how they
finished their last 10, TCU is the tournament team now. That's a good
basketball team. Wherever they're seeded, they can win a game. But I'm not in
those smoke-filled rooms, so I don't know.  
I would hope three and I think we have a chance at four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you all very much.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Sara Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14526)

### [Amaka Uzomah](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18084)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to take a minute or two and give us your
thoughts on the game.  
COACH WARDEN: Well, you know, I think I was real pleased with the way the game
started. Defensively we came out, probably gave them something they hadn't
seen before. They missed their first six shots and we had six turnovers
ensuing in those first five minutes, including the media timeout.  
Although we were pleased that it was a two-point game, I think at that point
is when you have to take advantage and make sure that it's 10 to 2, make sure
you take advantage of your offensive positions while you're making those
defensive stops to open the game.  
After they missed their first six shots, they went on a string late in the
first half. They went five for six from the three. The rest of the game they
were four for 18 from the three. I think that concentrated onslaught of threes
kind of shocked us a bit and made us do some different things defensively.  
But in the second half, I was probably the most pleased with our mentality
offensively and the way we got on the attack and played a little more hard-
nosed and gambled a little bit more. I think if I were to play this game over
again, I might do a better job of setting the tone for that early.  
There's two reasons you make turnovers: because you're too conservative or too
risky. I think we made conservative turnovers in the first half. I think I
would have coached us to be a little bit more aggressive and carefree with the
ball, even though we didn't want to get into a running game with New Mexico.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions directed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sara, what were your thoughts when this finally came to an end after what
you have done here?  
SARA HUNTER: I don't know. I mean, we couldn't have fought harder. Obviously
we'd all want to take the first half back. I'm just proud of our team really.
I'm glad we did what we did here. Had fun. Wish it could have ended
differently. But we fought hard.  
  
Q. Amaka, in the first few minutes of the game you were able to really
attack inside. You got the two layups right off the bat. Did they change
anything they were doing defensively after those first four baskets or was it
other things that stopped working?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: I don't think they changed anything defensively. I mean, they
played me the same. We had to change the way we were playing our offense
because of the way they were playing me.  
But, you know, I don't think they did anything differently. The only thing
that I can think of is Kimble coming over and sort of looked like she's
helping, which made me second-guess should I keep going or should I kick out,
so...  
  
Q. Of UNLV, Utah and now New Mexico, was this the toughest game you feel you
played this week or do you think the three games in three days has finally
caught up?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: I don't think this was the toughest game we played. The toughest
game we played was yesterday and Monday -- the day before yesterday and
Monday. I mean, I don't know.  
SARA HUNTER: I don't know. Every game is tough.  
AMAKA UZOMAH: Yeah.  
SARA HUNTER: The first half killed us, so... Obviously, New Mexico is a great
team. They're going to do well. I think they're gonna -- you know, it's going
to be a great game tomorrow whoever they match up with.  
Every game we play is tough, obviously (laughter).  
  
Q. Sara, when you look back on this experience, what did this week mean to
you to finish your career on such a high note, at least coming into this
game?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah, I don't know. My career's been anything and everything that
I would have wanted it to be. You know, like I said yesterday, I couldn't have
asked for a better group of people to finish with. Glad we got a couple wins
(tearing up).  
  
Q. What were you guys saying at halftime? You're down by 21, looks like
everything is going south, yet you were able to come back in the second half.
What motivated you and had you fired up?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: Well, we had to pick ourselves up and we had to tell each other,
We have nothing to lose. We just got to come out fighting like we did the
first two games, to get on defense. If we shut down one person, you got to be
out there on the wings to cover the three-point shooters.  
As we noticed in the first half, every player shot a three and made it. We
were telling ourselves, If one of them's being shut down down low, we got to
make sure we get out on the wings, make sure we pick up our defense, not to
give up, just to fight, have fun, go out there and play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys.  
Questions for Coach Warden.  
  
Q. What does this do for you going into the off-season? One gal you signed
last fall, she's in the Colorado Final Four. I don't know if you've been able
to talk to her. Can you address going into the off-season coming off a high
and what she'll do for the team next year?  
COACH WARDEN: I think any program in any situation wants to finish playing its
best basketball so you can point towards the future and see some leaps from
the underclassmen as they establish their games in the off-season and you
establish the nucleus of the team to return.  
I think we definitely, when you look out on the floor, you know, we have
Dionne Marsh and Brandi Kimble who had 19 and 13 respectively, and obviously
Sara Hunter has done a tremendous job leading us.  
But for the most part I've got a junior, two freshmen and a sophomore or a
junior, two sophomores and a freshman on the floor. I think this is a young,
talented program that's kind of playing beyond their years right now, not
'cause they want to, but 'cause they have to.  
Those are the types of experiences that you build on.  
I think, you know, one thing that you tell your players, you know, in little
conversations in the hallway is, The freshmen are going to be the ones now to
tell the story about how this team did this, what it was like, what it took to
do it. They've been listening for a year and now it's time for them to start
speaking.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team at halftime after that first half?  
COACH WARDEN: I told my staff before I went into the team that I think -- it's
such a fun dynamic and a challenging dynamic because I expected us to have so
much kind of energy and anticipation, that I didn't kind of want to send them
to the moon emotionally with a tremendous pep talk. But I felt at halftime
that I maybe underestimated that they needed emotion and motivation more than
I had given them.  
I think, first of all, we just had to resist the temptation to have egos to
not believe what was happening. You know, we've got to play without egos. You
got to admit there's nothing to lose before you can play for something to win.  
To be honest, I think nothing I said at halftime was as important as Sara's
layup. When she got the first offensive possession and our smallest player
came in there and got in the paint and finished the layup with no assists, no
second pass, just said, This is the way it's got to be done, I think that set
the tone for the next five or six possessions where everybody kind of stood up
and took notice and said, We're going to have 20 more minutes of basketball in
this arena.  
  
Q. New Mexico seems almost always to be able to peak in the conference
tournament. What do you see in their program that might explain that?  
COACH WARDEN: I don't think I understand your question.  
  
Q. New Mexico almost always seems to peak here in the conference tournament.
What do you see in their program that might explain that a little bit?  
COACH WARDEN: What do I see in my program?  
THE MODERATOR: In New Mexico's program that explains why they always seem to
peak during the conference tournament.  
COACH WARDEN: You got to look at the leadership. That guy is phenomenal. Don
Flanagan is a phenomenal coach. Phenomenal coach at every level.  
I think if you look at their last six games, with the exception -- probably
TCU was a tremendous experience for them, although they might not have enjoyed
the overtime loss. You look at what they've done since they lost against TCU
in overtime, and that team found a sense of itself. I don't think it's looked
back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Jen.  
COACH WARDEN: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Brandi Kimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17035)

### [Dionne Marsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14530)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to take a minute or two and just provide
your opening thoughts.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to Colorado State. I thought
they had a good tournament. Obviously they were excited. Played a very
motivated and hard-fought game.  
For a team that did not win a game throughout the regular season, they had a
terrific tournament. They played very, very hard. Difficult to defend. Sara
Hunter is a great shooter. They have a couple other young players that I know
are going to be back and very difficult to defend. So congratulations to them.  
I thought our first half, our defense in the first half was excellent. We
didn't give up much. Kept them in front of us. Chased over screens. They set a
lot of screens. Defended them about as well as I thought we could defend them.  
And then they played a zone and we hit our three-point shots. When we're
hitting our three-point shots, we're a pretty good team. That pretty much was
the differential.  
We had a couple breaks late in the half where we'd get a couple more points on
a foul in the last second of the half.  
Then the second half, they made a nice run back. I knew they weren't going to
quit. I knew they were going to play for 40 minutes. They're that type of
team. They came back and got the game fairly close. We had a couple players
step up, hit some big shots. We got going again.  
Overall, I thought it was a pretty good game. We shot pretty well. I thought
we defended very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions now directed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For either player, the fact that Colorado State beat Utah, did that give
you instant respect for them? Is that why you came out and pretty much blew
them off the court?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think so. I mean, they're a good team. They played Utah
really well. We came in knowing that they're going to play us hard. You know,
they're a scrappy team. They're going to do whatever it takes to win. They did
a good job. I give it to them.  
We played our game and we were successful.  
  
Q. Dionne, except for one first-round loss to UNLV in the tournament a few
years ago, seems like you always peak at the right time. Is there a secret to
that? Something that Coach Flanagan does or talks about? How does that
happen?  
DIONNE MARSH: Well, usually -- I mean, this year we started off kind of rough
as a team. But the girls never gave up. And the fact that I guess he just
seems to recruit girls that continue to want to play during post-season, you
know, no matter how we're starting off in the beginning, everybody still wants
to be playing. Nobody wants to go out on a sour note during the season.  
Especially at UNM, for the girls program, we're known for being a pretty
decent team. The fact that the girls never quit this year, continued to
practice hard, made everyone better, said something about their character.
Hopefully we'll continue to play well in the next championship game and
hopefully into the tournament.  
  
Q. What did you do differently after the first three or four minutes when
they were hitting the inside buckets defensively to cut that off? Looked like
you tightened up your interior defense, backed off their three-point
shooting.  
DIONNE MARSH: Well, for us, our post play, we're pretty decent at our defense.
We're good at helping each other. We just talked really well. We realized what
was hurting us. We're very good at being vocal and helping each other out.  
That's one of the things. We talk to each other, say, You need to rotate on
help side, make sure we move one over. For being post players, our defense is
pretty decent. We're really good about listening to each other and taking each
other's advice.  
  
Q. Brandi, did you sense anything different about the way they played you
today? Gave you a harder time than in the past.  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think so. They were really hungry for the win. Sara Hunter, I
mean, she did a really good job tonight. I know how far back she goes from
that three-point line. They all played with heart tonight.  
  
Q. In the second half when they kind of made that little run, got within 10
at one point, what were you thinking as players at that point? You had a
21-point halftime lead. How did you get through that, get it back?  
DIONNE MARSH: Early in the year we probably would have been a little bit
nervous just because we've given up quite a few leads or lost games that were
close.  
This year, I mean, towards the end of the season, the girls are getting a lot
more poised. They're not getting as nervous when things tend to go wrong. Like
I said, all we do, we talk about it amongst ourselves, realize what we need to
tighten up on and just do it. That's one of the things we've improved on in
the last three or four games.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
Questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. What is the secret to peaking at the right time or is there one?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I'm not sure if there's a secret to it. But basically we're
staying consistent with our philosophy.  
One thing I think that is probably not discussed is that we've been good late
in the season throughout the last few years or last many years. I think when
you have a tradition like that, players recall how they played in the
tournament, how it felt to be successful in the tournament. They carry that
over as they become juniors and seniors.  
We had two seniors up here today. Both those players have gone to the NCAA
tournament all three years. Both those players played an outstanding game. So
they know what it takes to be tournament players.  
  
Q. What was going through your head when they made the run, got within 10?
Was there any worry on your part?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I was getting a little upset. That's a team that won't quit.
We were breaking down a little bit on the drive. They were trying to drive us
and create fouling situations, and we were playing right into that.  
I substituted a little bit. Any time anybody got tired at that three position,
we subbed them out. And then we just kept talking about, Hey, they're trying
to drive us, make sure you keep her in front, then block her out.  
There also was an awful lot of offensive rebounds in there that I was really
upset with.  
But for the most part we played pretty well. You know, sometimes when you get
a big lead and then it gets down to 10, all of a sudden everybody starts
getting nervous, and then all of a sudden it's a close game. That game could
have gone either way.  
But we had a couple players step up and hit some big shots. I thought Jessica
Kielpinski hit a big shot. Amanda Adamson hit a big shot. And those are
players that are not normally shooting the ball under pressure situations. So
we've changed a lot over the year with our confidence in tough situations.  
  
Q. You talked about Dionne and Brandi having the experience in big games.
How do you mentally prepare the younger players? Do you think the confidence
that Dionne and Brandi have will rub off on them for tomorrow's game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I thought their leadership ability has really improved over
the year. When they first started out, they're both very quiet young ladies.
They're not the type to -- rah-rah type of person. It was difficult for them
to assume the role of a leader.  
They've always just played the game and somebody else has been the leader.  
I think that they've matured over the season and they've helped out the
younger players. With their encouragement, them being positive with the
younger players, that helped our younger kids to start to play with confidence
like they do.  
  
Q. You've been in this league a long time. You've seen a lot of programs
rise and fall. CSU's experience, a young team coming back, what do you think
this could do for Colorado State looking ahead?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, I'm happy for them because they've had some tough times.
I think Jen has done an excellent job of keeping them together, keeping them
motivated. Now she has a team, I think, that has very good chemistry and good
young players.  
I expect them to be very good in the future. I don't know how good or when.
They'll miss Sara Hunter, as you said. At the same time they played very hard.
This experience right here, this positive experience that they just had, is
gonna help them a great deal.  
  
Q. When Colorado State in their first two games in this tournament made some
defensive changes right after the start of the second half, did you see
something like that? Did they do any of that to you today?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah, a little bit. We kind of keep running the same thing,
the same kind of offense. So it wasn't like we had to go to something really
different.  
Basically we felt like the middle of their defense was open a little bit and
we could exploit that. And it took us a while to make that pass. They did such
a good job of denying the pass to the interior that we were a little hesitant
to make that pass. But you got to throw the ball inside. And once we started
throwing the ball inside, then good things were happening.  
We were getting the high-low a little bit. Dionne was starting to hit her
shots. Then we were getting the second shots. Brandi started getting some
rebounds in there. Once we started getting second shots, second-shot
opportunities, then I thought the momentum changed.  
But I didn't see anything that I felt like -- you know, the zone right off the
bat was a little bit better than I thought. But we were hitting our shot. We
were a little hesitant to reverse the ball and move it where we wanted. But
when we're hitting our shot, I think we were five of six from the three-point
line in the first half. So she had to get out of that zone. Then she went back
to it again.  
It's hard to guard Dionne one-on-one, so a lot of teams will try to throw in a
zone.  
  
Q. Lack of production from the three has been kind of an ongoing thing this
year. Offensively between Georonika and Amanda, is this maybe the best it's
been?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Yeah. I thought Eileen went in there and played some good
minutes, more defensively than offensively. Georonika is a different kind of
player. She's not really a three, but she battled like a three. She rebounded
in there. She had five rebounds at halftime, did a nice job there. Plus she
hit some shots. She can handle it a little bit so she can play. She plays like
a two. That helps us.  
Then Eileen is more like a real three, maybe even a four. She's a physical
player. She's just got to hit her shot a little bit.  
I thought Amanda Adamson hit a couple big shots. I was happy with her
progress. I'm starting to figure out how to use the threes so they're most
effective. If I have three of them, I'm trying to get the best out of each
person for a short period of time and then rotate them.  
  
Q. Could you briefly talk about the matchups tomorrow, whether it's San
Diego State or TCU.  
COACH FLANAGAN: You want 10 matchups? I don't know who's going to win that
game.  
First of all, both teams are very fast. Both teams are very aggressive. One
team will play full court for 40 minutes. That's San Diego State. I don't see
TCU doing that. But at the same time TCU has players that can really go coast-
to-coast or baseline-to-baseline.  
You know, I don't know who's going to win that game. I think it's going to be
a great game to watch. I'm just going to sit back and relax and enjoy the
game. We'll play the winner tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2008

  

### [Lorie Butler-Rayford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18128)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Adrianne Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16393)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some opening remarks on
the game.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, yeah, first off, I thought San Diego State played very
well. Their pressure bothered us. They forced us into some turnovers. I
thought we had some unforced turnovers. But ultimately they played extremely
well second half. I thought they played their game plan very well. They
deserve a lot of credit for this basketball game. I thought they did a lot of
good things.  
Comes down to a play or two. And we didn't quite control the ball well enough
to make enough plays to win this game. But I thought San Diego State played
very well. And I thought our team fought really hard. Proud of their efforts.
Maybe just didn't quite play as well as we would have liked. But we certainly
played extremely hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Adrianne, that last play, where they inbound off of you, they have so
many different athletes that can make plays, was there one person you thought
they were going to and did that surprise you?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: The last play?  
  
Q. When they inbounded off of you to get the layup.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: I'm sorry. The question again.  
  
Q. Was there one place you thought they were going? There's a lot of
different athletes on that team. Were you looking at it coming from one
place?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: No, we definitely weren't expecting that to happen. I mean,
this has been a tournament where you don't expect a lot of things that
happened to happen.  
But we didn't take them for granted. We didn't take that last play for
granted. Things didn't go our way that last play, but you got to deal with it.  
  
Q. What changed in the last couple of minutes? Seemed like they had some
hard shots that didn't fall, but kept fighting. Did you feel like something
changed there, maybe the last 10 minutes?  
LORIE BUTLER-RAYFORD: I feel both teams fought very hard. I just think it came
down to them making more plays than us.  
I don't take anything away from our team. We fought hard. Just came down to
that last shot.  
  
Q. What did you want there at the end? Adrianne, I know you took the ball.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Just to make it and win (laughter). But...  
  
Q. Did you draw something up?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: We didn't have any timeouts. We were playing with two freshmen
on the court. They don't play like freshmen. We were really focused, trying to
get something good. Time was short. Literally we were just looking for a make.
Nothing special. We knew they were pressuring, so there would be room to get
to the basket, but...  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Good job.  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Where did you feel like the game changed?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, we took the 10-point lead. Morris hits two threes coming
off screens, ball screens. And then we fouled the three-point shooter in the
corner. We had a pretty good flow up to that point.  
That kind of got them back in it after we took the lead. They put nine points
up in about a minute and a half. It gets them back in it.  
I thought we had -- our failure to execute some things. We had a big advantage
in some spots. We turned the ball over on some interior passing where we had
some advantages where we needed to go shoot the ball. Those type of plays, you
know, you can't give up many of those -- can't give away many of those
opportunities, because we had some opportunities there.  
And then San Diego State, I just think their pressure continued to wear on us
over the length of the game. And we just couldn't execute a lot of things.  
  
Q. The last minute seemed very uncharacteristic of you guys, a lot of the
plays that happened.  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah, well, I think, you know, you talked about the "one play."
There's two seconds left on the shot clock. So A's job is to help up because
of the lob to Paris, okay? That's not an easy play for Davis to knock it off
of a player and step in.  
So you talk about that play. I don't think that's an uncharacteristic. She
probably needed to open up a little bit, which is what we try to get them to
see both, but also be up so you pinch that post.  
There's only two on the shot clock, so we felt pretty good about our defense
at that point. The last play is my fault. The last turnover by D on the out of
bounds is my fault, so...  
So, yeah, I don't think we got what we wanted to.  
  
Q. Why your fault?  
COACH MITTIE: It probably wasn't what we needed to do at that point. I thought
we could get the ball to A and give her some space, and we just didn't. I
didn't design it as well as I needed to. Players tried to execute what I
designed. It ultimately comes down to me not getting that play done to them.  
  
Q. The NCAA tournament. Any thoughts? Do you think you've done enough?  
COACH MITTIE: Boy, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I just heard the last part.
We've got some good things on our resume. You wanted a better quote than that
(laughter)? They're not going to put me on the committee, so...  
By the criteria, okay, it's going to come down to comparisons, as it always
does. But we finished strong. I'm proud that our team put us in position.
November and December we didn't play as well against the tough schedule. When
we started playing better, this team has played as well as any team we've had
in the seven years we've been in the tournament. If that's enough at the end
of the day, comparing to the other teams across the country, then I think...  
We've got a good win against Oklahoma State. I think we've got a good win
against Wyoming. We've got losses that -- you know, two teams we played are in
the Big 12 championship tonight, LSU. We've played a tough schedule.  
Some years there is different comparisons, and things happen across the
country differently. I'm pleased that this team has put themselves in the
position that I think we're on the board. I think our league is going to be
one that they're going to have to take a hard look at because you have an
improving San Diego State team that is a different team than they were in
November and December. Obviously they have an opportunity to get that
automatic tomorrow. That should be a great basketball game.  
I hope we're deserving. I hope on Monday they call our name.  
  
Q. Does it make it more difficult that it is the two teams who are playing
for the championship potentially who maybe weren't going to make the
tournament?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, it's one more spot that wasn't going to happen. You don't
want to see too many of those spots because both those teams coming into it
had to feel like they had to win it. The more spots that get taken, all it
takes is one extra to knock somebody out. It's one more spot. So you don't
want too many of those disappearing here in the next day or two.  
But we know that our league is going to have one of those spots that two teams
came into initially and felt like they had to win the tournament to get there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.

THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to take a minute or two and reflect on your
thoughts on the game.  
COACH BURNS: That might take me more than a minute or two (laughter).  
I just think it was as fantastic an effort. It was almost for us a turning
point right in front of our eyes because you got to believe, and we've never
beaten TCU, ever, ever, ever. Going into this season, I remember thinking, It
will be nice to coach against TCU because we've never been able to be at a
competitive level.  
And I thought that showed a little bit early in the game. We weren't sure, Can
we do what we can do against TCU? And I kept just reinforcing, You've got to
believe that you can win, and then you will, because you're good enough to do
that.  
I think we wavered a little bit in the first half. I thought Jene made huge
shots to keep us in it. And then we believed. And I'll tell you this, I think
TCU is a great team. I vote for the top 25 in our league, and I've been voting
for them for about three, four weeks now. They are a load to handle. And I
think they earned everything that they got.  
You know, we were guarding bigs with littles. But when it came down to it, you
have to make a play. I'll defer to my left for you to ask about "the play"
that you might want to know about.  
But it was just a great effort. I couldn't be prouder. I'm excited for about
10:00 tonight when there's going to be two Aztec teams in the championship
game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll direct questions to the student-athletes for the next few
minutes.  
  
Q. Quenese, do you want to talk about "the play"?   
QUENESE DAVIS: Well, the play was drawn up for Jene. We were supposed to run
one of our sets, one of our out-of-bounds plays. I just saw everyone
attracting their attention to Jene, especially Adrianne Ross. I just do what I
always do when I see that, I threw the ball off her butt and finished the
play.  
COACH BURNS: Just so you know, this is the fourth time she's done this. She's
four for four. Our team expects it. People expect it. It's interesting. She's
done it three other time, always in the body of the game. I've always had a
reporter that says, Does it bother you she's done that? I'll say, She's three
for three. Nothing bothers me when it works. That's from playing ball since
you were a little kid.  
In March players make plays, and Q couldn't have made a bigger one.  
  
Q. Jene, speaking of that play, could you talk about maybe how impressed you
are with what kind of wherewithal it takes to do something like that.  
JENE MORRIS: Like coach said, she's now four for four. I watched her do it all
last year when I was redshirting. So it didn't surprise me at all when she
pulled it off in this game today. Actually, I'm so happy she did it. Everyone
was attracting their attention towards me. Q makes big plays. She's a point
guard.  
  
Q. You had to come in pretty confident to pull off a couple wins like you
have here. Even so, are you surprised at all to find yourselves where you are
at this juncture?  
JENE MORRIS: No, I'm not surprised. You know, I think we had high expectations
during the season and we didn't really quite meet those expectations. And
every time we played these teams, we've come close, but we never quite got
over that hump. We were never blown out by these teams and I think we hung
with these teams.  
Going into this tournament, you know, it was time to prove what we could do.
There were a lot of doubts against us. We knew all along what we could do,
what we were capable of.  
  
Q. Jene, as far as that steal at the end of the game, when they had the
inbound pass, was that something you had seen the whole game, you were waiting
for the right time?  
JENE MORRIS: It was more instincts. Coach always says, Never throw a pork shop
by a wolf. She's a great player.  
COACH BURNS: She's the wolf, not the pork chop.  
JENE MORRIS: They're going to give it to her at the end of the game. I was in
the lane, dove for it, happened to get it.  
  
Q. What did you feel was the turning point in the game? When did you feel
like you started to take control?  
QUENESE DAVIS: When Coco hit the big three. That gave us a lot of momentum
right there. If they would have took that away with the foul, then I think we
would have had to work a little bit more harder than we did.  
  
Q. Paris, from one Caver to another, what is it like playing against a team
so big and physical, not just tall?  
PARIS JOHNSON: In high school, it always went to the top camps around the
country, and I was face to face with huge girls, big bodies. But those big
bodies are not like mine. They weren't very versatile. They were just in the
post mostly. We had to go head-to-head, toe-to-toe, get through it.  
It just makes me stronger. You know, I go up with them all the time. I just
have to dig deep, keep them off the glass, do everything I could do to stop
them. It was pretty tough, but I had it in me.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, you can go. Good job. Congratulations.  
  
Q. How do you recruit to Iceland?  
COACH BURNS: There's players all over the world. I said this two days ago
against Wyoming. I'd echo the same thing today. I can't have more respect for
Jeff Mittie and TCU basketball. They are the standard bearers. If we wanted to
be good, we have to be able to compete with these people. He is a fantastic
recruiter. His net is a little bit wider than mine, I guess.  
Interestingly, we'll tell this publicly. We call No. 4 Ice because she's from
Iceland. We didn't want to mispronounce her last name. It's hard to say, You
have and then all those syllables, so we call her Ice. I'd love to get some
ice because I think both No. 4 and No. 42, Paris Johnson, Allison Duffy, are
going to be beating on each other for the next three years in the conference.
Those are four really good young players in our league.  
  
Q. What do you think is going on with this program right now, this team in
particular? I know Jene talked a little bit about how you hung with some teams
during the course of the season. This is a team that beat you by an average
margin of 22. What do you think is happening right now?  
COACH BURNS: I think that, you know, when -- I don't mean to keep saying the
same thing. But as a unit, a team has got to believe they can be successful.
And I've never felt -- we never felt that we didn't have -- we have talented
people on our team, you know. We have talented people. They don't have
experience. And we don't have a lot of them.  
So as we experienced an injury spread out, and maybe that was due to our
immaturity, I say that more because of our youth, we lose Shanna Demus, we go
into the tank a little bit. Can we do this?  
It's really hard to play a full-court pressure style. Then it got to the
latter part of the season, and I can't certainly change what we've been doing.  
What's happening? People are believing. It's hard to change a culture. It's a
lot easier to change physicality than it is between the ears. That's what I
meant. It started on Wednesday, but the switch got flipped tonight because
everybody, you saw everybody on our team fighting, scrapping and forcing
turnovers. I think we were intimidated by their speed early. I told them,
Don't play against the ghosts of TCU past. This is right now. Use what you
got, do what you do.  
I think Jene making that steal kind of shows you, you can't be tentative, you
got to play.  
  
Q. Right before Quenese made that play, Jene drove baseline. Was that what
you had planned there?  
COACH BURNS: It's just a read. I mean, we were in our continuity set. We ran a
two game with Jene and Paris. We just wanted to get an isolation with Jene and
Paris, with Q as a kick-out. We were rotating Sandy back in anticipation we
might not get something.  
I hope I'm smart enough to put the ball in the hands of people who can create.
The less predictable the better. The ball was going to be in Jene's hands,
Paris was going to give her a rub, we were going to play.  
  
Q. The two seconds on the shot clock, ball out of bounds, are you thinking,
We made it so far?  
COACH BURNS: Goodness, no. You're giving me way more credit than that. It
happens fast.  
This was our challenge. They were so difficult to defend that we went with a
little lineup because we had to use quickness. We don't do that in the
majority of our games. So for all our sets, LaSandra Dixon was playing a
position she never really played, let alone in a situation like that.  
So we were just trying to get in a set where we have an isolation play for
Jene or a lob play to Paris. Again, Q made the play. March is about players.  
  
Q. The matchup with New Mexico tomorrow, what you think you need to do to
continue this run?  
COACH BURNS: We're having a really good time up here, and then you've decided
to... (laughter).  
No, I mean, I would say it's kind of the same thing again. We've had two
really tough, physical games with New Mexico. I can say easily on record, they
were kind of my dark horse going in. Now I hope I'm wrong. Because I think
they have two things: they have two great seniors and they have championship
experience. Those were the things that, you know, coming into the tournament I
felt I would not have been surprised -- I'm not surprised at the road they've
taken.  
It's going to be a great matchup. I think we've played them well both times. I
think we'll go into it confident. There's 40 minutes that separate two teams
that know the only way they get to the NCAA tournament is by playing that
game. I think it's gonna be a fantastic game.  
  
Q. This conference, the NCAA tournament, what do you think about TCU and
their resum e?   
COACH BURNS: You know, I'm not an authority on this stuff. I prognosticate
just like everybody else. I think they're a great team. I think what they've
done -- if they truly look at your body of work and your momentum towards the
latter part of the year, I think that bodes well. Obviously they came into
conference with some losses, and they have a win over a top 10 team in
Oklahoma State. I think it will depend on what happens throughout the weekend.  
I'd like to think that those three teams - speaking of Wyoming and Utah and
TCU - were the three teams that would get bids, and then whoever won our
tournament, if it was somebody different.  
We have eight bids over the last two years. We have nothing to back down for
in this league with the RPI and how good our teams are. So hopefully what
we've done in the past will help us there, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Good luck.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you all very much.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Megan McGuffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17036)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just some opening remarks.  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, I thought tonight's game, San Diego State played
with great intensity. I talked about at the start of the season that I thought
they were a sleeper in our league. I think they're very talented, well-
coached, and played extremely well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Next few minutes questions directed to Megan then we'll let her
go then finish up with coach.  
  
Q. Megan, you guys had a hard time hitting shots tonight. Was it their
defensive pressure, just one of those nights where they weren't falling, a
little bit of both? What can you contribute that to?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: I think it was just one of those nights. I think, you know,
we're kind of a team that lives off the three-pointer at times. So, you know,
nights when they're not falling, it's going be a rough one. And we missed a
lot of close layups too, which against a team that comes out and plays that
well and pressures you that much, you just can't afford to miss those shots.  
  
Q. Did they do anything different with their pressure? Was it a lot of what
you expected and just couldn't get it or did they do some different things?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: It's pretty much what we expected. You know, they're a team
that pressures you on the perimeter and gets out on you tough. And, you know,
we have to make sure we move a lot on our offense. Like I said, we missed
those easy shots, so...  
  
Q. Megan, they come out and played a real physical game on nights where
maybe the calls aren't going to go in that sort of sense. How frustrating was
it and how much did you guys have to try the battle back and how difficult was
that?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: It's always hard playing from behind. You know, you're always
trying to find a few plays to get you back in the game. And they just kept
countering everything we were throwing at them. And we had chances there in
the end of the first half and parts of the second half that we just couldn't
-- we just couldn't seem to get two or three plays in a row to cut it to, you
know, five or something like that.  
But they're a really good team, and it was just a tough game for us.  
  
Q. I guess how disappointing is this loss? Maybe it hasn't struck you yet,
but have you thought anything about the NCAA implications or anything like
that?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: We're just hoping for the best right now. You know, we try to
forget about this one and remember that, you know, we've had a great season.
You know, we've won 24 games, so hopefully when the time comes good things
will happen.  
  
Q. It's been a very crazy post-season all across the country. Is there
something about March that you can pinpoint I guess?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: I guess that's why they call it March Madness. But,
unfortunately, we're on the wrong end of things. But, you know, we drew a
tough, tough draw. San Diego State, they're a great team. And, you know, yeah,
I guess that's what makes college basketball exciting, upsets and tight games,
so...  
  
Q. You kind of came off the bench and gave your team a real lift and kind of
kept them in there in the first half. What was it that got you going, just
that sense of kind of feeling like someone needed to step up and maybe it was
your time to do it?  
MEGAN McGUFFEY: When you are playing with players like Hanna Zavecz and
Justyna Poedziemska and Jodi Bolerjack. They're going to be keying a lot on
them. They've had great year. They're experienced, so it makes my job a lot
easier. Going in there and hit open shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Megan. We'll let you go. Good job. Questions for Coach
Legerski.  
  
Q. Did they do anything differently defensively or was it just the quickness
and the speed that really threw you off tonight from them defensively?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think that's the tough part. You cannot simulate the
quickness in practice. And when I take a look at, you know, the number of
turnovers that we had, more importantly, I thought San Diego State played
well. Their post players Duffy and Johnson got off to a great start. And in
the first half I think they were either 8 or 9 for 11. I think 8 for 11.
That's 72%. When you are getting that kind of production on the inside it
really makes it difficult. Then when Morris started heating up from the
perimeter, then you have bigger problems trying to deal with.  
You know, we missed some easy shots that maybe would have tightened the game a
bit. But we were continually playing from behind.  
  
Q. Jodi went off out in the second half. She looked like she was in a lot of
pain. She did come back, but can you give us a prognosis of what she did?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know what, in practice earlier this week she bruised her
shoulder. So we held her out coming into this tournament. You know, we hit the
same spot again. And we're going to end up having her checked when we get back
and I'll know more then.  
  
Q. Going back earlier than you hoped from this. Do you go back and relax and
wait till Monday to see what your fate is or what do you do between now and
then?  
COACH LEGERSKI: We're going to take some time. You know, we're going get back
home. Some of the players are in their mid-terms right now. I know we had
players last night, Hanna Zavecz was there till about 11 p.m. last night
taking an exam. We got to get back and take care of that and then hope for the
best on Monday.  
  
Q. Joe, can you explain the decision to go to the zone defense against them
for the majority of the game tonight?  
COACH LEGERSKI: When you are having a tough time stopping people one-on-one in
the post, you got to make a change. And we had to try to give Rebecca and
Justyna some help down low. I thought we were able to do that in the zone and
try to slow it up a bit so the two post kids, Duffy and Johnson, were not
scoring at will.  
And we just didn't make enough shots on our end to close the gap. I thought we
played hard through the 40 minutes, even cutting it to about 7. I think with a
minute to go we just didn't make enough plays and San Diego State did.  
  
Q. She thinks you guys are a lock for the tournament. How confident are you
that you've built a resume that's good enough to get you in?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, I thank Beth for that.  
You know, before tonight we're 24-5. Our RPI's in the top 30. I think we
played a schedule deserving. I hope a selection never comes down to one game,
you know, whether you win it or lose it. As I said, I'd stack San Diego State
up against a lot of teams. I think they're very good. And hopefully we've done
enough throughout the whole year. And they talk about your body of work, and I
think we have the body of work. We'll be waiting on Monday to see what
happens.  
  
Q. Megan kind of talked about the missed layups, kind of a problem for both
Wyoming teams today. Just like she said, one of those days where the rims
weren't working in your favor?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think when you get to championship play you have to make
your easy shots. And I talk about lay-ins, I talk about free-throws. Some
nights you have to be able to step up and go for about 90% from the free-throw
line. And those are points when all of a sudden things aren't falling from the
perimeter. I thought we took too many three-point shots tonight, taking 20. We
have to be more aggressive to the basket.  
But once again, I give a great deal of credit to San Diego State for making us
shoot a low percentage.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Sara Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14526)

### [Emily Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18108)

### [Amaka Uzomah](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18084)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, begin with your thoughts on the game.  
COACH WARDEN: I think this the really began with our defense. I think again we
ran a combination of different defensive looks. I think Coach Elliott is one
of the best coaches in the country. Whatever we did, she countered. We had to
come back ready to look at something else, see the shape she was in, counter
it again.  
Next to Coach Elliott, I think our kids were just amazing. I mean they
followed our every move, where one slip or one miscoverage against this team,
as you know, is a three. Mitchell and Warburton and Whipple I think are three
of the most dangerous wings in the conference together, not to mention in the
west.  
And I think we're all really going to be proud of that team as they represent
us in the NCAA tournament as a conference. I know we're proud of our
accomplishment. And if I didn't coach against Elaine Elliott today, you sure
know that I was going be behind her bench watching her every move because I
think that program is first class. And I really appreciate the chance to be
able to compete with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. What was going -- at what point did you realize that you guys could win
this game.  
SARA HUNTER: I don't know. I think from tipoff. We went in just all out. We
didn't have anything to lose really. We were in a great position and we all
played hard. But when it came down to it, I don't think we even thought about
that. We just were concentrating on making our free throws. And, you know,
like Coach Warden said, Utah had something coming back at us all the time. So
we had to be on our toes. It was a ball game till the very end of the buzzer.  
  
Q. Any truth to a rumor I heard that some of the players had travel plans
and had to change them after this outcome for spring break?  
SARA HUNTER: No. I don't think so. We still got to go home and take tests
supposedly, but not any more. So that's all right.  
  
Q. For all three of the players, can you tell me how a team that lost 27
regular-season games out-hustled, out-muscled a team that had won 27? I mean
fans that were watching wouldn't have known which team was, you know, 27 wins,
27 losses?  
COACH WARDEN: Because that's how they practice.  
AMAKA UZOMAH: We've had a rough season. Like Sara said, we have nothing to
lose. You know, later on as the year went on or the season went on, we started
to gel with each other, and just start communicating and believing in one
another and saying the will will come. It will fall. It will happen. People
have doubts, you know, but we don't. We'll keep believing in ourselves.  
SARA HUNTER: I think when it comes down to it too, every single girl on this
team would fight till the end for each other. And I mean you can't ask for
anything more, no matter the outcome.  
EMILY NEAL: Just the same thing they said. You know we stay together. This
whole season, you know, it wasn't -- it was a hard one to have so many losses,
but we stayed together as a team. And, you know, we picked the right time to
win today and yesterday. And it just shows how much, you know, your heart and
just going out there and playing hard can do.  
I mean, it's not always statistical or any of that, it's always just, you
know, who is going to come out and play harder.  
  
Q. Emily, could you talk about the upcoming match-up with New Mexico? You
guys won two in a row here at the tournament after going through the
conference winless. Just talk about continuing that momentum in your match-up
against New Mexico?  
EMILY NEAL: That's exactly what we do, is just keep going. We know we can
compete with anybody in this conference. I mean Utah is a very good team, very
well-coached. And New Mexico is kind of the same way. They've got a great
coach, some great players. We just have to come out the same way and play them
hard and play them straight up.  
  
Q. Amaka, you had three rebounds in the first half. When did you realize you
could dominate like you did in that second half?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: When I got into the locker room and I looked at my stats or was
told to me what my stats were on my rebounds, I was like I had to come out and
rebound. Plus I had two fouls, and I had to sit for a little bit because I had
two foul troubles.  
But come second half I said to myself, Don't get in foul trouble, just go up
to the boards hard and rebound the heck out of it like you know how. I was
hoping to get 18, but a couple of them slipped. But I'm just a rebounding
queen.  
  
Q. Talking about Utah representing Mountain West Conference in the NCAAs,
but do you realize yet you are 80 minutes from the NCAAs yet, 80 minutes, has
that dawned on you?  
SARA HUNTER: It's a dream come true, but we got to take one game at a time.
Right now we're just going to enjoy the win, have fun tonight, practice
tomorrow, watch our men play and get ready for the next game.  
  
Q. Sara, we were talking the other day and I was telling you how I think you
had lost 83 games in your CSU career. How does this feel? Just can you put
into words your emotions at this point, and, you know, just what was so cool
about this?  
SARA HUNTER: I don't know. I'm not very good with words and that's a pretty
special thing to -- um, I don't know where to begin. I wouldn't first of all
pick a better group to share it with. And like we said all along, we've worked
hard no matter what. And good things are coming our way. So we just got to
keep having fun. You know, that's when we all play our best, relaxed and
having fun.  
  
Q. Sara, winning three games in a season, how do you continue to believe?
How have you been able to believe still?  
SARA HUNTER: Well, I don't mean to be redundant but it's really, like I said,
I mean, we come into practice every single day. And, I mean, there's not a
better group of girls really. I don't even -- that's what it comes down to. We
will fight till the end for each other, like I said. I'm sorry for being
redundant but that's what it's about. I mean, that's the best thing you can
ask in sports I think.  
  
Q. What was it like when you guys hit that locker room and could just
celebrate without the rest of us watching, without the fans, when it was just
the team behind those doors?  
EMILY NEAL: We were pretty ecstatic to be honest. We were having a little
dance party (laughing).  
SARA HUNTER: Some good dance moves.  
AMAKA UZOMAH: Some good dance moves.  
EMILY NEAL: I mean, this is a dream come true for everyone. It's unimaginable
for us, especially considering our circumstances this year. So everyone was
just really happy that, you know, we got the win tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks guys. We'll let you guys go. Congratulations. Questions
for coach.  
  
Q. You're up 6 with two minutes left and maybe some of us know-it-alls here
would have thought that Hunter shouldn't have taken such an early shot there
on the shot clock, then she comes back and gets her own rebound. Can you
describe that moment and maybe Sara's personality that goes along with that
moment?  
COACH WARDEN: That's when and I don't have this luxury with nine new players.
But coaching Sara for three years, you know what she's thinking, you know
where she's going. I will tell what you I liked about that shot. It showed our
team that we are not going to win this game unless we continue to look to
score. You're not going to dribble the shot clock out with two minutes left
with six points, even though that's not something we're real familiar with.  
I think what that showed our team is we got to attack the basket, we got to
attack the basket, we got to attack the basket. The fact it missed nobody
likes. And from the outset, you are right, it looks like kind of an emotional
release, kind of a door-or-die deal where we should be more patient with the
shot clock. But I think the statement that it made was powerful to our team.
That we are not -- you know, we're not going to sit on a six-point lead and
go, Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we're up six points, nobody else shoot the
ball. You got to continue to be on the attack. I think with a 30-second shot
clock there's a real balance there on how do you protect it and how do you
make sure that you've got a quality attack as we're going 10, 9, 8, 7. That's
a really good question.  
  
Q. Jen, you talked about mixing up different defenses and stuff like that.
Obviously, I think at one point they were shooting roughly 20% in the second
half. How many different defenses did you use? Was it really a lot of
different ones or just the same one with some modifications?  
COACH WARDEN: It was different. Our staple defense -- I don't know do I want
to give this away. I haven't played Elaine Elliott in a long time. Our staple
defense in the first half, and I told my players in the locker room, I said,
Look, there are going be decisions made to change defenses that don't make a
lot of sense at the moment. But you got to understand in order for our best
look to stay our best look, we've got to get the team, the rhythm out of the
offense, and you can't get them use to attacking that same look.  
So we'd have success in it, and we would call a different look for one or two
possessions in order to just get them out of rhythm and stop remembering what
they were trying to do against that initial look.  
So, you know, it's different style for me. I think my assistant coach has
really kind of mentored me in that style defensively and I think it really has
bridged the gap a little bit talent wise. Tim Miles even spent time with our
team this season and taught us the triangle and two. It's the first time I've
ever had another coach coach my team in practice. We probably used I'd be safe
to say six different defenses today. The theory behind them was the same but
the shape of them had to absorb what Utah was doing on the attack.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about playing New Mexico?  
COACH WARDEN: We made a pact in the locker room we were weren't going to talk
about that till breakfast. But New Mexico is a tremendously talented team.
Dionne Marsh and Brandi Kimble I think are athletes, are leaders, are
scholars. You got two seniors you are going to send off to medical school that
you are leading through the tournament. And obviously, you know, put yourself
in Don Flanagan's shoes. What's the average margin in both of our games? 25?
76-48, 74-47. So that's probably a happy guy right now. He might have sent me
flowers to my hotel room by the time I get back. But I think that's a very
talented team that we're going have to really not only work off the court but
it's going to be a battle on the court to contain some of the players we've
had trouble containing in the past.  
Dionne Marsh has been a real, real kind of a quandary for us, how to get our
arms around that. You know, her build and Amaka's defense style, we don't
always end up on the winning edge on that one. I've guarded her with a
freshman the last two games, and you don't want to guard a player of the year
with a freshman.  
  
Q. Where does this rank among your greatest coaching moments?  
COACH WARDEN: It's -- I'm really proud of the kids. You know, the kids own
this. I think as a coach I feel probably the most like a parent now as I've
ever felt as a coach. Might be because I have my own kids, but you start to
recognize the more they squeeze you out and the more they take over, that's a
good thing. And when you hear them talking about each other and fighting for
each other, all they need is a structure for you. But the motivation and the
will comes from them.  
We didn't give a big pep speech today. And I think the most satisfying thing
about it is just seeing the kids grow into adults and know they're not going
to get what they deserve, they're going to get what they earn. And those life
lessons in basketball when you can watch them evolve are real special.  
So the win kind of encapsulates those things and you almost need the win to
validate it, but I think the real victory is seeing what's going on in those
young guys and they see, they sit in front of you 3-27. But you know what,
they did it. They believed and they never quit.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Congratulations.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Mallary Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16396)

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Lauren Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17067)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks on the
game.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, we didn't play very well the first half. I was real proud
of my team the second half. Coming back, we kind of had an opportunity to cut
it down to single digits, and just couldn't seem to make the play or get the
ball to bounce one way for us.  
But I'm proud of this team because we've gone through a lot this year. We've
lost some close games. We've played a very difficult schedule throughout the
year. I don't know, some years it just doesn't click. And this year just some
things didn't go our way.  
But I always thought we gave an effort. I felt like that we tried to do the
things that we needed to. And I'm very proud of my seniors. I'm sure this is
not the way they wanted to leave, but they have been a big part of BYU's
success. And they should be proud of their careers and what they've
accomplished.  
I know each of them will be very successful in their life because of their
basketball experience and also going through the good and the bad.  
One thing I did say to them, and I really meant it, is no matter win or lose,
these seniors have been, to me, very classy and professional and have
respected their opponent. And I think that, as a coach, is one of the biggest
things you want your players to be able to achieve, is to be able to do that.
And I'm very proud of them.  
I wish it would have been better. These two deserve better. And I'm very proud
of them. And New Mexico played a very good game. Very good balanced scoring
tonight. We really wanted to take Marsh out of the game, which we did. But you
got to give credit to Kimble and Beggin and Harthill. Those three came in and
played very well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Can you two just kind of reflect on your career at BYU and this being
your final game, kind of what it's meant, and going out this year?  
MALLARY GILLESPIE-CARLING: We've had a great career here. We won back-to-back
championships our sophomore and junior years. Freshman year took second or
third in the conference, second I think in the conference. This year we
struggled a little bit.  
But, you know, we felt like we had good successful years here. And we're
hoping that we left a good example and for the younger kids underneath us. You
know, we hope they can come out and I truly and honestly believe they're going
to come out and work really hard this summer and have a great year next year.
They got the staff and the support behind them. And we're excited for them.  
You know, this game meant a lot and we were hoping to -- you know, we came out
and battled and gave it our all and left it all on the court. The ball just
didn't roll our way and we just didn't get those breaks. But at least I can
say that I'm grateful for my time here at BYU and the time I've had to play
here in the Mountain West Conference. It's been an honor and thank you.  
LAUREN RILEY-VARLEY: It's definitely been a humbling experience this year.
There's been so many times where we just kept thinking, Okay, this is it, this
is the game where it's all going to turn around. And it just never seemed to
click for us for some reason. Just the mix of experience and inexperience, I'm
not sure why.  
I don't know. It's been hard. But it's been a life lesson not just in
basketball but it's been something that we've learned about life and just
pushing through it and you can't just give up. And, you know, I think we'll
come out better people, all of us, from Juddy to anybody on the team.  
I think the coaches said it in their little meeting just then. They said
they're better coaches because of this. I truly believe they're going to be
and we'll be better people. And we'll take our life experiences and we'll
remember the good times because we've had a lot of great times since we've
been here and just move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the turnovers, how crucial. That kind of didn't
help your cause obviously and that wasn't the only factor but pretty key
factor?  
COACH JUDKINS: Yeah, you know, I think this year turnovers has been a big part
of why we haven't been as successful as we've been in the past. I know last
two years our turnover ratio was one of the top in the league. This year it
was the bottom. There's a lot of reasons for it. I think one reason is I'm
playing Mindy Neilson, who was not a point guard in high school, never played
it. I'm playing her at point, and she's a freshman and doesn't understand a
lot of things. And I think some of her turnovers are because of just not
knowing the position well enough and trying to make the play.  
Then I think what happens is it kind of like snowballs and gets to Mallary.
Like I see tonight Mallary had six turnovers. I know this year Mallary tried
to create a lot of things because we didn't have a lot of scoring punch. So
she tried to create more opportunities. I think by that, it made her turn the
ball over a little bit more than she wanted to.  
Mallary was a great passer. And I think this year was just trying to make the
play, to try to make the easy play. I'm not using excuses. I think this is
going to help Mindy personally for next season. To be able to have a kid that
played point, next year she won't play point. I'll have Haley and Jazmine. I
think Jazmine will be ready.  
No matter what team you're on, I don't care what it is, you can't -- a point
guard in the women's basketball game is so important. I told Dick this before
the game, and it's so important, to handle the tempo, to get your team in the
offense. Very few teams can have a freshman point guard and really expect to
be that good. You don't see it. You just don't see it that often.  
Utah has a five-year senior, Wyoming has experience, TCU has experience.
That's why those teams won. I mean there's really no secret to it.  
  
Q. Jeff, what kind of lessons has this kind of season taught you as a
coach?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, you know, we have had inside presence since I've been
here. That's something that I really focused on as a coach. And this year we
just didn't score the ball in the post as well as we have in the past. And so
next season I got to find somebody, either some of these freshmen that I've
got sitting out here or Cassie King, and get them to be able to get low post
presence.  
If I can't get it out of them, I'm -- I guarantee one of these freshman I
sign, the three or four freshmen I sign this year, three of them are big, I'll
get one of them to do it. You have to have inside presence in this offense
that we run.  
Secondly, what I am going to do is, hopefully, I'm going to try to get my team
where we -- you know, a lot of coaches in this game don't play motion any
more. There's a lot of reasons for it. It's difficult. It takes you a while to
learn it. And you get two players out of five that don't know what they're
doing and it affects the other three. And so I've got to really work hard on
our motion and get it down where we can execute and do a better job with that.  
I think Haley will help a lot because of ball pressure and getting the center
offense. The last two games of the season I really felt Jazmine has gotten a
lot better. And she'll work hard and do it.  
I don't know if you noticed, we had a lot of times tonight, four freshmen in
there. The best thing about a freshmen is they'll turn to be sophomores the
next year. I really think that will help us. And we're hopefully going to be
able to go over to Europe next year, give us seven games, five to seven games
next year. I think that will help us also.  
  
Q. Jeff, there was a point in the second half they hit a three-pointer on
the shot clock winding down, made it like 42-23, and you seemed to shake your
head. If you think about just your coaching career, are there times when it's
going bad, it's going bad, and when it's going good sometimes you catch some
breaks the other way?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think so. I think that's why I was shaking my head, is
because we have lost -- I've seen more baskets this year going in with a shot
clock going down and hitting a three this year than I've ever seen in my life.
That's kind of why I shook my head, like here's another dagger in the ol'
heart. And it's just been that kind of way.  
I think Mallary and Riley have said it: When we needed to make a play or we
had the ball bounce one way, it just seem to go the opposite way. I told my
team, Sometimes you are the ones that have to make that ball bounce that way
for you. What I mean by that is that you continually work on the things that
you need to and execute.  
If I could say one thing this year with the team that I think we really got to
do better, and that is we've got to execute better. I think that has been one
of my strengths as a coach, is my teams have executed down the end of the
games, both offensively and defensively. And this year we just didn't seem to
quite do that. Some games we did, but we didn't do it as consistently as we
should have.  
And, you know, as I look at this stat sheet and it's been this way the whole
year. You see three players on New Mexico scoring double figures. And I got
one on my team. Last year and the year before that we had three. 27 of our 30
games last year we had three people in double figures. This year I can't count
it on my hand when we had three players score double figures in the game. So
we've got to do a better job of being more balanced with it.  
I don't know if -- sometimes when players leave, other players step up to the
plate and take that responsibility. I saw it with 'Brosia her senior year.
When some other people left, she really stepped it up. I've seen it on really
other teams. Hopefully these young kids will be able to understand that and do
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you very much.

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Leilani Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18110)

### [Morgan Warburton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16975)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with general thoughts on the ball
game.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, obviously we had our problems. CSU, you know, you come
in, and, I mean, they're just -- they've got just great energy. They played
with great energy, played with, you know, a real intensity.  
You know, I don't discount -- I really believe in this team, I trust in them.
The there was no sort of coming in and overlooking and that kind of crap.
That's not what it's about. It's team who, you know, played really well, is
playing with sort of a real intensity. And for us to -- it's tough. We're in a
tough spot. You know, we're in a no-win spot. And there's lots of things you
can talk about that -- you know, why did you have your struggles, or why now.
I'd say, Well, why not now? I'm sure the questions will be, Is it better to
lose now than going to the NCAAs and the whole bit?  
We just want to give credit to CSU. We want to put this where it belongs for
us because certainly for us as far as what we've accomplished and what these
kids have done and the incredible consistency that they've shown in their play
has been phenomenal.  
So, you know, to have a blip on the radar screen is just something that
usually happens many more times than this and usually, you know, isn't
something that doesn't crop up earlier. So that's the good news. You know,
we'll try to just rebound from that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Obviously, you're both going to play again this season. And CSU was done
as soon as they lost. I mean, coach says you didn't overlook. I mean, do you
feel you had the intensity in this game that they did?  
LEILANI MITCHELL: I think to start the game we did. Then, you know, towards
the end, um, when it was time to make plays, I think they made more plays than
we did. And they did a good job the boards. You know, they were aggressive. I
think we kind of, you know, we kind of shied away from that. That's time when
you need to make plays if you want to win the game.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, can you just talk about the effort trying to slow
down Amaka there in the second half? I mean, she went off for like 12 rebounds
there.  
MORGAN WARBURTON: I mean, she's a really good player. She showed a lot of
intensity tonight. I mean, their whole team did. You know, we had the
intensity at the beginning of the game like Lei said. It comes down to big
plays.  
The whole year we've made the big plays but tonight it just didn't go our way.
The credit to CSU. They're working hard and doing the things they need to did
to win ball games.  
  
Q. Did you make a more concerted effort to contain her there in the second
half?  
COACH ELLIOTT: You mean, put three people to check her out? We could have used
ten to check her out. She was just a horse. She did a great job on the boards.
All the credit is hers.  
  
Q. This is for either of you. They talked a lot about their defense. They
had several defenses. How much did that confound you, going against the
defenses they showed you?  
LEILANI MITCHELL: They did a good job of, you know, switching it up. But I
think we, you know, we got good shots. I mean we shot 29%. You're not going to
win games shooting 29%. So I think we did a good job with handling it and, you
know, just running our stuff. Just the shots didn't fall for us.  
  
Q. For the players, just how do you guys regroup from this and head into the
tournament? I mean, can you use this as a positive? It might hurt your seeding
a little bit, but can you still maybe take something from the loss and make
sure you bounce back?  
MORGAN WARBURTON: Yeah. I mean, you know, coach just said this to me and Lei
out there. Just rather it be now than the first round of the NCAAs when you
know you're done for good. So, you know, it's hard to take this, but at the
same time, you know, things happen for a reason. And, you know, maybe this is
just a little bit of a wake-up call for us. You know, we've had a great year,
been really consistent with everything. You know, maybe we just need to get
grounded and find what we do best and take it to the NCAA tournament, you
know, and go far there.  
  
Q. Elaine, CSU scored 28 points on you guys first time you played them.
Scored 60 tonight. Can you tell me the difference between them offensively
that night and you guys defensively that night and then tonight?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, that's a long time ago. That was a long time
ago. So, you know, I'm not sure I got any remembrance of why. You know, I mean
I just -- we just want to try to use this to help us as much as we can. You
know, we're going to rest. We're going to, you know, not do a thing until
Monday.  
You know, these kids, the ones you are looking at there, boy, they've put a
lot into this for a lot of time, starting clear last summer. You know, they're
asked to do a lot. We're thin, you know. We don't have a deep bench. So
there's been a lot of minutes over the course of the season. And we just will
turn this into an opportunity to say, Okay, let's, you know -- we'll use this
to sort of revive and rejuvenate and rest up and just move to the next segment
of our opportunity.  
It's really, really difficult to do what they did in the regular season. And
though we will never say that's not -- that's not an excuse, like we came in
here to win. We didn't come in here to say, Who cares. You know, we intended
to battle hard and win. CSU just did a great job. And for whatever reason
there are certainly many that you can speculate.  
But, you know, it's the first game all year that we've had that difficulty
shooting the ball. That's what's amazing. I mean, you know, it's just really
an unusual scenario. So let's just talk about how can they help us. Well,
okay, better now than later. We just got to simplify this and be in a good
place come next week.  
  
Q. Did you think the shooting, particularly the three-point shot selection,
was good and they just didn't go in?  
COACH ELLIOTT: I'll watch the film. We didn't shoot the ball extremely well
the last time we played them either. But we didn't shoot this poorly. I'll
watch the film. You know, the first time I was quite pleased with what we got.
And this one, you know, I mean it's really the first time that we haven't been
able to sort of call on our mental toughness down the stretch. And that's the
good news. I mean when you can sit here and talk about an entire season and,
you know, all the ways that we found to win games, and this one we didn't,
that's actually pretty positive.  
  
Q. Recovering from this, how do you think this might affect you? I know as a
coach, but the match-ups matter in the tournament. Do you think this might
affect your guys' standing as far as seeding placement?  
COACH ELLIOTT: You know, I mean everybody who loses early it does. Upsets all
over the country. I don't know if you have been watching TV, but, you know,
the men's tournaments, the women's tournaments. I mean, Oklahoma loses to
Missouri and Rutgers loses a quarterfinal game. These are like top-ten teams
in the country and they're losing to lower-echelon teams in their own leagues
in the tournaments.  
This is very hard to do. What do you have to say for your championship? You
want to play them again? It's very difficult. It's very difficult. And we just
didn't -- we just weren't quite good enough to do that. So, you know, we'll
just try to say -- that doesn't mean that we've done a bad job. We just didn't
get it done tonight.  
  
Q. Do you think that the shooting woes were -- was it like a fluke situation
or do you credit CSU's defense?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, I mean, you know, you always credit an opponent. I mean,
you know, they came, they played hard, they did well. But we've seen
everything. I mean, they played the same defense this game that they played
against us the last game. They didn't do anything new. We understand what it
is that they're doing.  
We just run our stuff. We didn't try to make big adjustments and try to do
things. It's the first time all year that all three of our scorers struggled
on the same night. And that's just -- we just feel like, you know, that's more
of a statement about how good we've been, not how bad we were tonight.  
  
Q. You were around when Utah men's team left the tournament early and played
till the last day of the season. How much will you use that with your team?  
COACH ELLIOTT: It's really interesting. It's true to sort of use this question
about, so, you know, what about losing now and would it have been harder to
keep winning and going into the NCAAs? And, you know, I told them even though
they think this one hurts, like it wouldn't have hurt any worse -- you know,
it didn't hurt worse to lose this one or the semi-final game or the
championship game. I mean, losing would have hurt.  
As far as looking at this as, you know, okay, you know, we lost. I'm like
sorry. You know, you just sort have created your own monster. Like, Wow, how
did that happen? You gotta go, Well, because it happens and because you can
have bad nights and because there can be different motivations and there can
be teams in different places. And you know what? We just want to try to put
this where it best helps us and move to hopefully, you know, be refreshed and
ready to go.  
You're right about that. I mean, that particular scenario they lost and went
on and did well. I was telling our kids that went to the Elite 8. You know,
they lost, they had these kind of things happen to them during the conference.
We lost two games that year at home on buzzer-beater putback baskets against
us at home, I mean, the kind of losses that can crush you. And that team did
not win the regular-season title. So they went on though and won the
tournament and had the moment.  
It's real interesting, you know, mental and emotional place, things that go on
in competition. And we just want to try to be the ones who can control it well
enough for ourselves so that we can use whatever happens to our benefit.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck next week.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Jamie Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18126)

### [Pamela Findlay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18127)

### [Ardie McInelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13836)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just begin with some general comments
about the game.  
COACH McINELLY: Well, we made improvements from last week. We played them last
week, and we had a much better game today. I felt like the first half we let
that get away from us. We look at the score in the second half, you know, we
scored 25 points, they scored 24.  
The difference in the game was, as I said, in the first half we turned the
ball over too many times, we sent them to the free-throw line. I thought our
players did a great job of making adjustments, coming out in the second half
and doing the things that we asked them to do. And I'm awfully proud of these
young women.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. When did you hear about I guess Colorado State beating Utah, did that
provide any inspiration for you guys knowing that that upset had been pulled
off?  
PAMELA FINDLAY: I think most of the team, you know, was watching the game
before we left. And then one of our players had her dad on the phone kind of
keeping us updated. We were really excited. We're so proud of them. And I
think it did inspire us. I mean we were already inspired, but it added a
little bonus, I think.  
JAMIE DAVIS: The whole time on the bus we're like, Oh, CSU, it's close, it's
close. Oh, CSU is doing this. It just gave us like a big spark just to know
hey they can do it, we can go out there too with that same just having the
mentality that we can go out there and get a win. So it was good.  
  
Q. Did you feel like coach did, that the turnovers kind of did you in in the
first half? I think you shot 50% in the first half, but was it the turnovers
that maybe did you guys in in the first half?  
PAMELA FINDLAY: Yes, I mean, obviously every time you turn the ball over
that's one less shot attempt. So we did. When we got it up, we hit them in the
first half. We just didn't get it up very often.  
JAMIE DAVIS: And fast-break points, too. There was a few times when we didn't
get back. Those are changes in momentum too. So that's one of the things that
I also contributed.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies, thank you. Good job. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about having to play without Raimee Beck and also
Alecia. Also just a comment on I guess her effort. Looks like she was in a lot
of pain out there but tried to gut it out.  
COACH McINELLY: Well, first of all, with Alecia, she has, you know, we have
our trainers and our doctors and they've been keeping a very close eye. And
Alecia really wanted to play this game. And although she didn't start, I said,
When you're ready just let us know, we'll let you play. She would go in and if
she got bumped or hit a little bit more, or had some pain, you know, she would
just kind of raise her hand and we'd take her out. Then when she said she's
ready again, we'd go ahead and put her back in.  
It's her last time of playing competitive basketball. You know, the young
lady's going to be graduating. So I felt like as long as the doctors said that
it was fine, that we could go ahead and let her kind of, you know, play some
minutes here and there. I'm very proud of what Alecia Steele has done at the
Academy. She set many, many records. So I think she deserved that.  
Raimee Beck, she has a -- I don't even know the name. I'm going call it a
stress fracture in her hip that was just found out yesterday with an MRI. We
were all out at Nellis Air Force Base. Because of that they feel like they've
caught it quite early and hopefully she'll be able to be back in six weeks.  
That does certainly affect the things that our team poses to the opponent as
far as scoring. Alecia led our team in scoring and in rebounding. Raimee Beck
led our team in assists, steals, and also she averaged almost ten points a
game. So those things hurt.  
The good thing is we had some other people step up. Ashley Myers stepped up
and played a very good game tonight. Chasmine Jones. It gives some other
people an opportunity to get some experience. So, you know, there's always a
positive thing that we can find from someone's injury, someone else has an
opportunity.  
So I just want to say that I think that our team played well. We didn't play
well enough to beat a good team like TCU. Hats off to them. They're very, very
balanced, probably one of the most balanced teams in the tournament at this
point. And with that I mean that there are numerous people on their team that
can score, you know, from anywhere on the court.  
So I wish them the best of luck. I wish Colorado State the best of luck. I
wish New Mexico the best of luck. And we got our last one playing right now.  
  
Q. The CSU game, did you mention that at all to the players as a kind of,
Hey, look, anything can happen?  
COACH McINELLY: Yeah, I did. I did mention that. I also said, Look at who's
running for president. Anything can happen, you know? We have a woman,we have
an African-American. Anything's possible this day and age. So don't let anyone
say it can't happen because it just might.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Lorie Butler-Rayford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18128)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Adrianne Ross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16393)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you can begin with just some general comments on the
game.  
COACH MITTIE: Okay. Well, I thought it was a sloppy game early. We were -- I
thought we were really ready to play. You know, you worry about your energy
level. I thought we had good energy early. Just a little sloppy, got ahead of
ourselves. A few more turnovers than we're accustomed to.  
The assists number is not what we're normally accustomed to. I give credit to
Air Force for keeping things off balance with their switching and things that
they do.  
But all in all I think, you know, what we've seen is just happy to advance
because anything can happen, and we've already seen that in our tournament. So
we're just happy to advance.  
I thought we did some good things. There were parts of this where I felt like
we were a pass or two away from looking really good. We didn't complete a lot
of those, but there were some good things.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, knowing what happened in this tournament, was
that on your minds, just thinking, Okay, we got to take care of business
here?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Um, yeah, until we're on the bus and we were shocked and Coach
Mittie came back and was like -- what did he say, Lorie? He said something to
get our mind off that upset and got us focused on Air Force.  
But you're right, anything can happen. So we got over that real fast.  
LORIE BUTLER-RAYFORD: Obviously we were on the bus coming here, getting ready
for our game. I heard the news. I was trying not to pay attention to the game
because, you know, we were so focused on Air Force, but we couldn't help but
to hear the score of the game.  
It taught us two things. It taught us, one, anybody can beat anybody on any
given night. And two, not to take anybody for granted. So we were the team
that came in here thinking not to take Air Force for granted because we all
know that Air Force is a good team, and there's no way we can look past Air
Force.  
  
Q. I guess either one of you as well. Do you guys feel like you've done
enough for the NCAA tournament? I mean, did you guys feel like going into this
you needed one win or do you feel like you need to do more?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: I hope so, but I'm not going to count on it. We're going to
watch this game that's coming on next after ours, really focus on that and try
not to get ahead of ourselves. But hopeful.  
LORIE BUTLER-RAYFORD: I think we're here to win. We were here to win three
games. And we're trying to get a championship which will, you know, secure
that spot in the NCAA tournament anyway. So I think we need to take care of
winning the Mountain West because our conference is kind of tough, and going
on to the NCAA tournament.  
ADRIANNE ROSS: One game at a time.  
LORIE BUTLER-RAYFORD: Right.  
  
Q. Adrianne, at the end of the first half, I mean you guys were pretty much
taking care of business. But at the end of the first half you hit the three-
pointer then had the lay-up. Did you feel like that was important just to
really step on it?  
ADRIANNE ROSS: Because, I mean, from the bench to the players on the court, we
had great energy. Like we were yelling at each other, you know, like getting
excited over those big things. And, you know, that carried over to defense. So
we were able to get some stops as well. It was fun out there tonight. We were
looking at each other yelling, like, Yeah, good. And it was just a free throw.
So I think our energy really helped us.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you two go. Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you try to keep that score from them at all or did you show it to
them, you know, make sure they were serious coming in?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, you know, with every game televised back at the hotel, you
weren't going to keep the score from them. And I didn't try to anyways. But
what I did step back in the bus, I said, Okay, somebody tell me what that game
has to do with our game versus Air Force. And just said, you know, you got to
control the game. We weren't going to play that side of the bracket till the
championship anyway. So we have other things in front of us.  
But you can't deny the shocking fact of that score, okay. You can't deny,
Colorado State hadn't won a game before they got to Vegas. You know, they'll
be trying to play all neutral site games in Vegas next year. So you can't deny
the shocking fact of that. So, you know, March Madness hit here pretty early.  
  
Q. You guys, like I said, were pretty much taking care of business. But that
little spurt at the end of the first half, I know you like to close out the
half well, but was that pretty important just to carry over into the second
half?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I thought it was important to get a little bit of
separation. And I was not happy -- I wanted Helena to be more aggressive with
the ball. You're right, the coast-to-coast, we could have taken the last shot
and one of the assistants said something when we got it, and I said, Let's see
what we get out of this. I wanted to see what she was going to do. And I liked
her aggressiveness with the ball.  
You know, this is a player that we've talked about all year, her versatility.
And she doesn't have to throw it to Mo every time on those. I want her to have
that mentality of the point guard. So she took a couple coast-to-coast and I
liked her mentality on that play.  
It was important I thought to get some separation. We were trying to
accomplish a couple things. One, we wanted to play cleaner than we played
tonight. Although I did like our energy. I thought we tried for a lot of home-
run plays tonight, Mercedes. I liked that attitude about that home-run play
but I would have liked to see us play simpler and keep things a lot simpler.  
The second thing is we wanted to get rest if we could. We wanted to get
different rotations on the floor. We wanted to take a look at how players were
playing together, just to see. I was pleased with D. Nunn. I thought D. was
very efficient. Four of four from the field. I thought Helen Roden was
aggressive from the field. She gets to the line seven times. There were good
things that came out of this game. Lorie Butler was aggressive. There were
good things. Adrianne had a good first half.  
So while maybe we had a chance to stretch this thing from 15 to maybe 20 to
25, I thought all in all we were decent tonight and we're just glad to be
moving forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

### [Paris Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18124)

### [Jene Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18125)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to just open with some remarks on the game.  
COACH BURNS: Well, we have, as well-documented, a very young team. And when we
play together and play on all cylinders, we've had great success this season.
And I think that we had great confidence coming into the tournament, that if
everybody did their job. You know with young teams it's harder to learn roles
as quickly. If everybody did their job, then we could do what we could do.  
And I can't tell you how much it means to us as a program because of the
respect I have for Joe Legerski and his team, and how good, just how good they
are and how far they're going to go in the NCAA tournament.  
But I thought we set the tone defensively. Their offense is so good and they
run such a rhythm offense that we really wanted to use our speed and stretch
the floor and get ourselves in passing lanes.  
And I told the bigs before the game that they had to be big. Duffy and Paris
had to play for us to be successful because they can, and they did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions directed to the student-athletes for
the next few minutes.  
  
Q. Jene, can you talk about just how big a step this is for this program at
this point in time?  
JENE MORRIS: We came into this tournament looking to go to the championship.
This is a huge confidence builder for our team. You know, we kind of had a
little rough point in our season, but we ended on a nice little run. And we
came in here with confidence. And, you know, we're looking for the next step,
the next game.  
  
Q. And talk about the defense a little bit, particularly from your guards.
That seemed to bother them a lot early.  
JENE MORRIS: That's what our program is built off of, defense. We're a
pressure-type team. Our guards played excellent defense today. You know, they
had open looks but our pressure prevented them from getting those open looks.
And like I said, we came out ready to play, hungry, and we started off the
game great.  
  
Q. Paris, the physical play seemed to be a big factor. Is that the way you
like to play and talk about how that carried you guys in the game?  
PARIS JOHNSON: Yeah, that's the way I like to play. Physicality is my number
one thing to do, is get the rebounds, play tough in the post. I mean, a lot of
girls are bigger than me but I don't back down from anybody. I go as hard as I
can every night in practice and in a game. You know, I grew up playing around
big girls all the time so they punched me around. It just made me stronger,
made me a better player.  
Just being in this game, it really meant I had to do something as a goal. Me
and Allison both had to go in and play as hard as we could, stop their post
players. A lot of their post players can shoot threes so we were mainly on the
perimeters the whole time playing defense and getting our hands up on those
three-point shots and that's all we could do, just play as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Were you guys surprised to see the zone defense tonight or was that
something that you guys expected?  
PARIS JOHNSON: Well, we went in thinking, you know, they start off in a
player. But any team, they always go in a zone. It wasn't surprising. As soon
as they went into the zone, we knew we could pull it off. We had many things
to run.  
It just opened up the middle for us. I like playing against zone actually. It
opens up the middle. I thought it was okay.  
JENE MORRIS: It wasn't too much of a surprise. The last two nights we played
them, we didn't have very good shooting nights. If I was a team playing
against us I probably would have zoned us as well.  
  
Q. Megan McGuffey is someone who hasn't got a lot of playing time this year.
She had 22 points tonight. Is she someone who was overlooked? Were you
concentrating on the other players?  
COACH BURNS: She's a tough match-up because really she plays a small forward
spot and with us having the lead I just was going to have one of my bigs guard
her. And it was asking them to do a lot. We talked about her a lot, talked
about the things that she does. But I think it was more her will and her
ability to get to the baseline and shoot that pull-up. And they're two
freshmen. That's really why when Mick had asked, we really sometimes have to
extend our pressure because they run into each other. You know, they're
freshmen. And I think it was more Megan making great plays and expecting it.  
You know, yes, they knew Podziemska, yes, they knew number 10. But I think she
did a fantastic job. We tried to adjust to it and talked about it in several
time-outs.  
  
Q. Beth, I know you have continued to refer to these guys as a young team,
but they seem to be maturing pretty quickly especially after, you know, almost
30 games. Where are they with that maturity process right now?  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think probably the unsung MVP, the locker room MVP right
now is Quenese Davis. Jene got in early foul trouble. Quenese never came off
the floor. She played full-court pressure the entire game. Last time I
checked, bigs can't score unless somebody gets it to them. I think that her
evolution -- we did have a tough stretch. Every time an injury hit and we lost
a player, it took us down and we had to fight back from it. And it's
interesting. I shouldn't say young because I yell at them all the time, Hey,
it's March. You all have been playing since October.  
It's more the experience factor. It's more the -- when I came in here this
morning I have to explain you can't pick up a ball or the clock will start.
They've never been to a tournament. They don't know these things. And it's all
new and it's all exciting. But they're confident. And as well as our bigs
played in the first half, we talked to the guards and said, Hey, they're 8 for
10, get your hands up, it's going in, it's coming back out, you got to knock
down shots.  
I think they're growing before your eyes. And the more success you have, the
more confident you become.  
  
Q. You talked about this team making a run in the tournament, but do you
ever think maybe this win by you guys could put them on the bubble and maybe
even put them out of the tournament?  
COACH BURNS: Wyoming?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH BURNS: Oh, no way. No way. With the -- Iowa came in second in the Big 10
and they won on their home floor. K State almost ran the table in the Big 12
and they beat them. They have so many quality wins and so many wins in the
regular season. If you ask many coaches, I think regular-season champions are
regular-season champions. They do it over the long haul. I don't think this
affects Wyoming at all.  
You know this is our 17th win. We've had some injuries so I don't think it's
as if that it's a quote/unquote bad loss. It's third time on a neutral court.  
  
Q. I guess I didn't mean it as a bad loss. With the upset earlier in the
day, if a team other than TCU wins it, that would mean they would have to
maybe put four Mountain West teams in the tournament.  
COACH BURNS: I would have no problem with that, because that's the only way
we're getting a ticket. I think going in, Utah and Wyoming are locks. But
crazier things have happened before. It might affect seeding somewhat, what
happened earlier today.  
TCU has had a fantastic season. This is as good a TCU team as I've seen. Their
Oklahoma State win will loom large for them. So if they -- you know, I think
TCU has as good a shot as well.  
I think the champion, if it doesn't come from those three, could potentially
be a fourth. I really do. I have no doubt on Utah and Wyoming.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2008

  

### [Amy Beggin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18107)

### [Don Flanagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13837)

### [Brandi Kimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17035)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Flanagan, if you want to take just a minute or two to
give a recap of the game and your opening thoughts, we'd appreciate that.  
COACH FLANAGAN: I thought the most important thing probably first of all I
want to congratulate BYU. I thought they played really hard. Very difficult to
defend. As Brandi knows, running over those screens is no picnic. They set a
lot of screens.  
I thought what we did very well was stop their interior game. We didn't ever
stop [] bar ling. I thought she played a great game, especially under the
conditions with us chasing her. We helped each other out a lot on defense. I
thought the first half was the key that we shut them down. They didn't score
many points first half.  
Second half we had a little lull there, which we've had before, but I think
everybody has that. We shot well. Shot our free throws pretty well. A little
unhappy with our offensive boards. We need to do a better job of blocking out.
But other than that I thought it was a good team effort on offense and on
defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions for the student-athletes please.  
  
Q. Amy or Brandi, what goes through your head when you see they're focusing
so much on Dionne, and then she is limited in the first half and you guys are
still able to build up a pretty good lead.  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think we did a good job of stepping up. Our younger players
came in and were confident and knocked down shots and played good defense.  
AMY BEGGIN: I think we still try to get the ball to DM. But when they're
doubling her, we just try to fake it. And our four players played pretty well
today, hitting their shots on the outside. So really just trying to get
everybody involved in the offense.  
  
Q. Amy, you guys got up ten early and they never got within single digits
again. Did you see this kind of game coming? You guys were really ready. Do
you know what accounts for that?  
AMY BEGGIN: BYU is a tough team and always seems to be close games when we
played them. But we just came out fired up and excited, we just were able to
jump out to the lead right away and able to maintain it and played pretty
solid.  
  
Q. You guys hit a couple threes early on. Did you feel like the shooting was
kind of contagious early and the confidence raised as soon as you hit those
first couple?  
AMY BEGGIN: I think it makes us feel a lot better and play a lot better when
one person starts hitting them. Just like you said, it's contagious, and we
just look for our shots and try to knock them down.  
  
Q. On the defensive end, forcing all those turnovers, I think you scored 35
points off the turnovers, what got into your guys on the defensive end?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think we were pumped up this afternoon to play good defense
and we did a good job.  
  
Q. Amy, just talk a little bit about the environment here. Seems like
there's a lot of Lobo fans, and you guys seem like you felt pretty
comfortable.  
AMY BEGGIN: Yeah, I mean, it's just really special to come running out of that
tunnel and see all the Lobo support here. Just kind of reminds us we do have
the best fans in the nation, just to come and drive all the way out here to
something that's really special, and we're just really appreciative.  
  
Q. Brandi, seems like the fact you guys have done well in this tournament
before, that seems like it has been a little bit of a factor. Does that make
you guys more confident going into a game like this?  
BRANDI KIMBLE: I think it does.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll let you guys go. Thanks very much. We'll continue
with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The focus, the defense on Dionne, she gets in foul trouble, she obviously
doesn't have the first half maybe you expect and you guys still build a big
lead. So what did you learn about the rest of the players?  
COACH FLANAGAN: You know, I know about the rest of the players. The only thing
was, I thought Jessica Kielpinski played very well in place of Dionne. I
thought the team played very well when Dionne was on the bench. We tried to go
to Dionne early. She hit the first shot of the game, then after that they
really defended her hard. They were sometimes double-teaming her. And that
gives Angela an opportunity.  
You know, we've seen the double-team throughout the year obviously because
Dionne is the key. So they're going to double-team her. So that frees up our
other post player. Angela has become quite a good player. Now they really
can't do that as much. I don't see teams doing that as much unless they want
Angela to get 20.  
  
Q. Without asking for comparisons per se, do you feel like Amy gives you the
same kind of steadiness that you've had in the past at the point with Mandy
and Katie at this stage of her career?  
COACH FLANAGAN: You know, I've had a lot of outstanding point guards. I think
I've been fortunate with point guards. And Amy is a leader, tough kid. She's a
great defender. And she makes our team go. She's really made a lot of
progress.  
And, you know, I don't have a lot of subs for Amy. Our point guard that we had
at the beginning of the year injured her knee, so all through the year she's
had to go 38 to 40 minutes. And she does that without any problem at all. I
ask her if she's tired after the 40 minutes. She always says, No, I feel
great. As long as she feels great, I feel great.  
  
Q. How does she differ from Katie and Mandy? I mean personality wise or on
the court?  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, she's hyper. And Mandy was never hyper like
that. Mandy was on the floor. She was very -- she was demanding on the floor.
Amy's not as much like that. But throughout the day, I mean, you can't calm
her down. She is very hyper. Yet when she gets on the floor, she calms down.
So her off-the-floor behavior is more you can't calm her down. She is just
running around, causing problems everywhere. Once she gets on the floor, she
utilizes that energy appropriately and plays a smart game.  
Now Katie was a little bit better shooter. But, you know, Amy didn't come in
being a good shooter. And she's really improved her shot by hard work. It
doesn't look pretty, but it goes in.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the first half being the key basically. Dionne
basically had three points and had to sit out the last eight minutes. But you
had eight players score. Has to feel pretty good to see that happened because
early in the year it obviously didn't.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Throughout the year we've been kind of experimenting. It
wasn't because I wanted to experiment a lot of times; it was because I had to.
There was times when we weren't playing very effectively and I'd throw people
in. I was trying to find a combination that I thought would work. And pretty
soon, as the season progressed, some of those players surfaced and started to
play a little bit better. And now I think we have more depth than we would
have had if I didn't have to experiment.  
So I might have eight or nine or ten players that can play and they've all
played some minutes and some important minutes throughout the season. So I
think our depth has really improved.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said that your defense has been pretty consistent
throughout the season. Another solid performance today. Is that something
you've just come to expect of them and how important will that be come
Friday?  
COACH FLANAGAN: We work a lot on defense. It's not something that just
happens. A lot of our practice, I would say about 60% of our practice, is
defense. I always feel like if we can defend and get enough points, we'll win
games.  
But, you know, I think we're somewhere around seven or eighth in the nation in
defense. Even though we haven't had the kind of year we wanted to have, it's
getting better and our defense is excellent.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.

## March 11, 2008

  

### [Sara Hunter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14526)

### [Elle Queen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18083)

### [Amaka Uzomah](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18084)

### [Jen Warden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13833)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with some opening remarks on the
game.  
COACH WARDEN: Well, I was just mentioning to Amaka how much I like the way she
operated from the inside. She's developing a rhythm of an old-time NBA pivot
player. At times she made weak side assists. At times she made ball side
assists. She can sneak in a wheel and a lay-up every once in a while.  
But I think what she's creating is giving players like Sara some open looks.
Because every team gets distracted when the ball gets to the pivot player. And
I think she's really helped our team develop in this offense over the last six
weeks. And I think we saw some of that and had a little fun with it tonight.  
What can you say about Sara Hunter? Four for eight, two critical back-to-back
threes where I really feel like the door kind of flew open and we knew if we
defended we could get a win. And that's not a small thing for us. And I felt
like we were very confident about the run that she led us on and knew we could
hold it.  
Sometimes I wish Elle Queen would be regarded as she is to us: one of the
conference's best freshman. Because her play and her demeanor are so
consistent and so valuable to us, and I think the teams in the stands that see
that know what's going to be come back to Colorado State as we continue to
build the program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. This is for Sara. How does it feel to finally win?  
SARA HUNTER: I don't know. Just it's so much fun. And the whole game was fun.
That's how I would describe it. Everyone was playing hard and, I mean, whether
baskets were falling or not we were just playing hard no matter what. So
hopefully we carry it over to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sara, hit the three that put your team ahead for good. Did you sense at
all at that moment those back-to-back threes, the momentum shifted?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah absolutely. When Amaka hit me in the corner for the fist
three, I was feeling it, and I think our whole team was, and we were just
going on a run. We were getting stops. Amaka was getting deep boards every
time. So it was those big shots I think we missed a lot during the season. But
this is when it counts.  
  
Q. If all three of you guys, and coach you too maybe, just quickly, the work
ethic has always been there but the work ethic really translated into huge
things today. Have you told yourself in the past just keep working, keep
plugging, good things will happen? And is this evidence of that?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah. Well I remember coming out of the game one time and Bonnie
Barbee on the team was sitting on the bench, and she's like, Man, our team
just works hard every single time. We're just fighting. You see Juanise and
everyone in there just getting banged around and no matter what. I mean, and
we do it every day whether we -- you know, obviously we were winless in
conference but we came into practice every single day and didn't lose hope. I
mean that's what makes wins like this feel the best.  
ELLE QUEEN: I think this season since we struggled a lot offensively, I think
it's hard to put up a fight against teams when shots aren't falling and stuff
like that. But I think our team's done a really good job of just continuing to
work hard on the defensive end whether our shots are falling or not.  
AMAKA UZOMAH: I think team chemistry also off the court. You know, most teams
that have a losing season tend to fall apart. But with us, we stick together
no matter what. And we talk about it, everything, and just are like our win is
going to come no matter what happens. We can do it, you know.  
SARA HUNTER: Yo, quote that. (Laughing).  
  
Q. Amaka, I wanted to ask you, you guys kind of took the UNLV's physical
game back to them and seemed to really kind of catch them a little bit off
guard. Is this more so than you've done in the other two games, and
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see the other two?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: I think it has. Because, as coach said earlier, once we get
physical, they're going to get physical back, but we have to keep up the
physicalness. Think that was all the matter of fact that happened. I said, Yo.
Sorry (laughing). If Hampton was going to get physical, I got to get physical
right back. That's why my voice is like this. I took about three shots from
her elbow, man. It hurts.  
  
Q. Quick question for Amaka. With the assists, I mean, you led your club in
assists. That last little flip behind the back, you had to be digging that. I
mean, was that as much fun for you in terms of satisfaction, assists,
rebounds, that kind of thing?  
AMAKA UZOMAH: It was. At the end when they told me I had six assists, I was
like, Yo, that finally -- finally six assists. You know, my teammates finished
their lay-ups and, you know, they made their baskets. It was awesome.  
  
Q. For any of you, just what's this mean? What can you take from this into
tomorrow's game now? Obviously you are going to against a really good Utah
team. Is there hope?  
SARA HUNTER: Yeah. I think, I mean just the way we played them last time is a
testament to what our team can do. And if we just stay composed and, you know,
keep playing hard like we can, we just go all out and have fun.  
ELLE QUEEN: I think we're definitely going to enjoy this one for tonight. And
tomorrow we'll be focused for tomorrow and ready to beat Utah.  
AMAKA UZOMAH: Come out with the same intensity that we did today, we can
definitely have a win tomorrow.  
  
Q. In danger of picking up my third Mountain West reprimand...  
COACH WARDEN: You asked if we did anything special to stop Sequoia Holmes.
Interestingly enough, we did box-and-one her at UNLV the first time we played
them. But the style of zone offense they run, they overload it. Anytime you
overload a box, you are going to have trouble if Sequoia is not the overload.  
So at the 16 minute time-out, I put in a defense our team had not seen before.
I had a diamond at the top and a baseline runner. So the bottom player played
like she was the bottom of a 1-3-1. The top three players matched their
guards, which is where we had a hard time before because they could penetrate
and kick and penetrate and get it to the centers. I had Amaka play block to
block. I like Amaka to play block to block. I wonder why, right?  
So I kind of design defenses on where we want Amaka and where we can match
their zone offense. I thought they might adjust some things but I knew even in
overload couldn't hurt it. So even though we didn't match Sequoia player for
player and face guard her, so to speak, everyone whose area she was in was
well-prepared and coming from an inside-out stance to guard her so we weren't
giving her a first step to the rim when we closed out.  
  
Q. What was it like to see your players smiling for the first time since
December? And what did it mean to you and your attempt to kind of get this
thing going in the right direction?  
COACH WARDEN: Well I think as a credit to them, and this whole thing belongs
to them, if you would walk into our practice on Sunday, and my assistant coach
came to me and said, You know, coach, for about ten minutes I kind of took an
outside look at our team and you would have thought we were 22-7.  
And I think that's really the testament of the players. I don't think of the
coaches. I don't think of the trainer. I think that's a testament to the
character of the player, that they can come in on a Sunday when they are the
number 9 seed in a winless conference and they can come in and have a
spirited, high-energy practice, and a spirited, high-energy shoot-around.  
And I think those things, they're going to produce results. And you got to
trust your work. But all of that belongs to the players. And I don't want to
say that we haven't smiled since December. We haven't won since December. But
we've smiled a lot.  
  
Q. When you played Utah before and played -- I didn't see the game --
describe that game to me, describe to me why you were able to hang in the
game, what you did well, and what you need the do better tomorrow?  
COACH WARDEN: Can I tell you after the game tomorrow?  
  
Q. You can wing it.  
COACH WARDEN: I think defensively, again, it's no secrets. We played an
unorthodox scheme. And it was, again, a scheme that the players hadn't seen
before and we hadn't practiced before. But I had a sixth sense it would work.  
We drew it up at the 16-minute media timeout that seems to be my creative
phase. And I thought we played that defense maybe four or five possessions
just to change things and get Utah out of a rhythm, but in fact we played it
for about 35, 38 possessions. And it really seem to make an incredibly
brilliant team -- don't get me wrong, if I weren't here to play Utah, I would
be sitting as close to that bench as I possibly could. I think Elaine Elliott
is a brilliant coach and they have an incredibly talented club. But I think it
made them think a little more and get out of a rhythm a little bit more.  
And it's going to be more difficult to create that tomorrow since they've seen
it for 40 minutes and they've been able to watch the film. But, you know what,
that's what our job is.  
  
Q. How have you managed to stay positive through this whole experience? How
have you personally managed to find a way to stay positive through all the
negativity?  
COACH WARDEN: Well I think, you know, you circle the wagons. The department
circles the wagons and the team circles its wagons and my family circles the
wagons. And you circle the wagons. I think it's important, just like you teach
kids that go into junior high: you got to be real careful with who you
surround yourself with and you got to be real careful about what you let
through the filter between your ears.  
You can't hold onto anything that doesn't help you and you have to grasp real
hard onto everything that you think can help you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH WARDEN: Thanks you guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach if you want to begin with some opening remarks on the
game please.  
COACH MILLER: I thought that we had opportunities in the first half to try to
build off the lead. And we got some stops. Basically, they had 13 turnovers
early in the first half and we just didn't convert enough of those stops.  
I felt like we needed to change the momentum of the game by building a little
bit of a lead. We got stops from our defense. And we were able to I think get
it to four points.  
But other than that, you know, then we let them right back in. I think you got
to get it up to 10 or 12 and force teams to play from behind.  
Then for the most part I thought there was one run during the game, and
Hunter, their best three-point shooter, one of the best three-point shooters
in the league, hit two big threes midway through the second half. Then we
obviously missed a couple checkouts, gave them some second-chance
opportunities. And they converted those. And that was the only run of that
basketball game.  
I certainly wanted it to be UNLV instead of CSU. They made the run and took
the momentum from there and down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
  
Q. Sequoia, their coach said that she changed her defense on what she did
against you previously, going from a box to this time going to the diamond in
the second half and did some other things with it. Did it throw your game off
when they changed defenses on you?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: Not particularly. I think what was key is just that I just
have to make plays. As a player, when I do get my opportunities to make open
shots, I got to hit those shots and just look for my teammates to contribute
what they can. And when I do get opportunities, to make plays.  
  
Q. Shamela, it seemed like they got a lot more physical as the game went on
and kind of matched your guys' physical play. Did this seem more physical than
the other games against them?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I felt that they were a little bit more physical. But as them
being physical against us, I don't think that should have took us out of our
game. Think we should have just focused more and play hard and let the refs
call the foul on them, and just mentally stay in the game and do your job.  
And my job was to post hard and, as Coach Miller told me, that's what she
wanted me to do. And eventually I got the calls.  
  
Q. You guys were on a losing streak coming in. When they started making
their run, the team started pressing even more. And just how difficult is it
just to end the season this way?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I think it's difficult to end the season this way, especially
for Sequoia because she is a senior. You know, next year I have another
opportunity to win the Mountain West conference. And I just -- I'm really
upset that the season has to end this way. But, you know, it was on us. We
made the season, and, you know, our conference game to end this way.  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: Yeah, it's difficult ending the season this way. Especially
knowing that everything this season that happened to us as a team was mostly
-- everything was in our control. The close games that we were in, even from
our pre-season schedule where we could have had -- had them down and either we
didn't execute to keep them down or we had made runs toward the end, and we
didn't at the last second execute a play or get a defensive stop.  
Everything that we've accomplished or didn't accomplish this year was in our
control for the most part. And we could have made our season better just as a
team.  
I just think that that's the most disappointing part about it, is that not
many other teams made us what we are; it was basically on us.  
  
Q. Sequoia, I wanted to ask you just when you're facing a team that's
winless in conference play, they've lost 20 in a row, even if you try really
hard not to focus on that, does that somehow enter into your thinking that
this is a team that maybe you don't have to take as seriously as if you were
playing a Utah or BYU?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: I think not for UNLV, not at all. Because we know that we as a
team underachieved this year. And we don't have time to think, Well, this team
might not show up. We need to think UNLV needs to show up every single game,
every single play of that game. Doesn't matter what somebody else's record is
because we know that our record isn't where we want it to be either. So we
can't really -- we respect all.  
  
Q. Did you feel like your team was focused and everything more this way, the
way they should have been going in?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: I felt like we were pretty focused. I mean, we had a goal in
mind. Just when we got to the point where we needed to stay in our run, we
didn't really execute. And that's what hurt us pretty much all year.  
  
Q. Sequoia and Shamela, that run they made toward the end, you guys had the
one-point lead, I think 44-43, whatever. Then Hunter hits those two threes and
just seemed like everything kind of caved in. Is that what kind of turned the
game in your guys' minds?  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: In my mind, being that the game is over now and I can say that
we didn't really sustain their run, yes. But in the game, that wasn't our
focus. Our focus was to stop their run and try to, you know, maintain and
execute our offense, like stop them from scoring, and not let her get easy
shots off, and let them get their momentum and their confidence going. That
was our focus at that time.  
But, yes, since we didn't sustain a run, that was pretty much what it looked
like and seemed like.  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: In my mind, I didn't think the game was over. Coach Miller
told us, you know, at that time-out we need to D up on Hunter and don't let
her get any more shots off. And the coach -- you know, the team was hyped up
and said, We can't let her get any more shots.  
I think in everybody's mind at that point we knew the game was over and we
were just trying to focus on things so we could execute and end up winning the
game.  
  
Q. Do you think Coach Miller should come back next season?  
SHAMELA HAMPTON: I think Coach Miller -- -- I think she should because she's
great coach. I mean, you know, we've been through a lot this year. One thing I
can say about Coach Miller is she always had faith in us no matter what. She
never gave up on us. She never quit on us. So next year I think she should
come back. Just the fact it's my senior year and I want to have a good coach
like her to graduate over.  
SEQUOIA HOLMES: I definitely think coach should come back I definitely think
coach should come back because I spent four years here with her. And a lot of
the times everybody else doesn't see what goes on inside the lines. Coach
Miller is somebody who really cares about each student-athlete, not just as an
athlete but as a person. And I really grown playing in this program and
understand her tutelage. I just think that she has shown that basketball
relates to life, and personally life is more important than basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies.  
  
Q. Did you notice when they made the defensive change? I mean, Jen said she
changed defenses to the diamond about the 16-minute media time-out. Did you
notice that? Or was that something you guys could see or was it something that
wasn't so obvious at the time?  
COACH MILLER: Well, for a team like CSU that places a lot of emphasis on
running and practicing their offense regardless of what defense they decided
to play shouldn't disrupt what we wanted to do offensively.  
I think when you play junk defense, you know, obviously the middle of the
floor was wide open. We didn't need to run much offense. We needed to attack
from top end, diagonal, and what we talked to our post play, or even Sequoia,
anyone in that particular area, just to step to the middle of the floor and
shoot a soft touch in front of the rim.  
We didn't need to run much offense. We just needed to attack the basket. And
we really struggled trying to make that adjustment. It was a little bit -- you
know, the diamond looks like an odd front, this, that and so on. Obviously
matching Sequoia, we know she is going to draw attention regardless of if she
has two people on her. She's played with two or three people on her all year.
It was nice to see her actually have more assists and turnovers today, because
that mean she's was looking for her teammates.  
So even if she dribble-penetrated against it, teammates moved to the open area
and stepped up and hit open shots. We missed too many open shots. They hit
open shots. Players that are penetrators for CSU hit open shots today. You
know, and we had some wide-open ones at key times and we didn't knock it down.  
And I told the team that it certainly would open up Shamela a little more in
the paint if we would knock down some of those wide-open shots. That's pretty
much how the game's played. Either you are going to execute better than your
opponent.  
I don't feel like their defense really distracted us. We made the adjustment;
we just didn't make the adjustment on the court, which was unfortunate because
we wanted to be very fundamental in our attack with our point guard. And we
were not. And we threw it away by trying to make the air pass instead of the
bounce pass into that area. Again, that's part of executing your fundamental
skills.  
So, you know, the bottom line again for us is that you are going to score from
defense. And we got enough stops, and we didn't convert our stops into points.
You know, you can only set that defense on a dead ball. You know, if you are
running an up-tempo team, you don't allow teams to set their junk defense or
their zone defense because you are in attack mode.  
I don't know if you noticed late in the game that we finally fed Shamela to
score in the first post, and that was there whole game. But that's just that
connection in seeing each other. You got to take advantage of the gaps and the
holes in the defense.  
  
Q. Regina, considering the whole season and how it ended, a 20-point loss,
19-point loss to a team that hadn't won two games all season?  
COACH MILLER: I don't think of it that way. Yeah, it was a 19-point loss, but
obviously it was closer than that.  
  
Q. I am saying, is this almost like the most disappointing? You lose and you
are done for the season, but is this the low point for you with all that's
what happened?  
COACH MILLER: No. It's been -- as the players said, it's been challenging most
of the season. One thing that has been difficult, because I don't think we
really built anything this year of consistency, and you can tell how that game
played out, you know, where we have an opportunity to make a run from our
defense or from our stops, and we didn't take advantage of that.  
And then, you know, it's a close game. We allowed them to go on the run by
hitting a couple of shots. And then, you know, we missed, I thought, some key
checkouts and gave second shots and we got beat on a couple backdoor cuts.  
And when teams push on us or when they're challenged, you know the old saying
is that: When the going gets tough, the tough gets going. Instead of digging
in, I thought we gave in. And that's kind of been indicative of how things
have happened to us, you know, this particular season.  
And as the players said, a lot of that we've been in control of. So when teams
start to push on you, you got to push back with your game. And that's with the
execution. So I thought that was a key time for us. And so the inconsistency
in the game is kind of how our season has gone.  
  
Q. This you feel is a low point then?  
COACH MILLER: Well, it can't be. We came into this game obviously very
optimistic. I think we just didn't build. You know, early on we had some
disappointing, some tough losses, games that we probably could have won,
should have won if we hit a free throw, make a lay-up, get a defensive stop,
as they said, you know, build the confidence.  
And I don't think we built confidence in what we were trying to get done, our
game plan, and committed to that and sticking with it when it gets tough. And
that happen to us early. You know the mental psyche of young kids. You know,
either they get over the top. You know, we played a very challenging schedule.
I mean, if you look at our schedule, every team we played in the non-
conference were either -- I think we had seven or eight teams that made it to
post-season last year, or more than that, the NCAA tournament. So we played
teams that were either going to win their league in a league that might not
have been ranked as high as ours or we played teams, you know, the Big 12, GW
was a great win. Thought we would build off that. We had a great win, but we
also had a lot of disappointing losses.  
We played teams out of the PAC-10. So, you know, then our conference is ranked
sixth in the nation. I mean every game's going to be a tough game. For some
reason it seems as though UNLV seems to attract, you know, the intensity of
other programs a bit more. It doesn't matter what type of team we have. On any
given year people want to come in and beat UNLV. I think it's what's been done
prior to this team, this particular year. So we can't look at it that way. We
have to look at it that we didn't learn a lot from a lot of mistakes. We have
to grow from those mistakes.  
  
Q. Regina, there's obviously going to be some conjecture about your job
status. What's your take on that? And can you make a case for why you should
still be the coach here?  
COACH MILLER: I don't feel like I really need to make a case. I certainly
don't feel that way. You know, we obviously had a tough season. I've been here
at UNLV for ten years. And, you know, we have a team of eight newcomers. And,
you know, we had I felt like a good core of returners. If you look at Shamela
Hampton, had two knee surgeries in the off-season, and she played this whole
year. I think she might have played 40 minutes today. But she's probably just
back. She is still a little tentative. I don't know if you watched the way she
moves on the court. She played most of the season as a shell of herself.  
I think obviously Sequoia Holmes wanted to do really well. But one thing I
challenged Sequoia with is that Michael Jordan never won anything until he
made others better around him. And he scored a lot of points, but they didn't
win any championships until everyone else was in the flow of things. And I
thought she had some of those capabilities. And I thought she probably tried
to her capabilities to get that done. It's a learning process.  
You know, next year as a fifth-year senior, which she's not going to be here,
maybe she would be better. Who knows. You know, maybe down the road in her
professional career she'll be better at that. Sometimes it takes longer than
others. Brittany Halberg, you know, we anticipated that she would provide us
some consistency. And she's a great player, running the offense. That doesn't
mean that you are a tremendous point guard by making others better either and
the decisions you make with the basketball.  
So those are some of the key players that we relied on coming in. Other than
that, the majority of our team are all new. It's like having eight freshmen in
a system. So learning that, and with the schedule we played, you know, we had
a tough season. I said we didn't build anything, we didn't build that
confidence. Perhaps maybe we should have gone out and played every team that
was, you know, between 250 to 300 RPI in the non-conference, get all these
wins, but I don't think it would have necessarily prepared us for this league.  
So, you know, I feel, you know, as the coach here at UNLV we had a tough year.
I've been here ten years. This is our first tough year. You know, all I can do
is stay focused on helping this program reach its goals, and that's my focus.
I enjoy coaching at UNLV, and I plan to be the coach here in years to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Appreciate it.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Marist postgame press
conference. We'll have opening remarks from coach Brian Giorgis, then we'll
have interviews with our student-athletes.  
Coach, your opening comments, please.  
COACH GIORGIS: You know, as I told the kids in the locker room, I couldn't be
more proud of a group of kids. That's a great basketball team that we played
today on their home court, and I think we gave them everything they could
handle and more. Unfortunately we couldn't sustain it through, you know, the
whole 40 minutes.  
I thought Erica White was the difference. Her energy and her hitting the
perimeter shots, you know, caused us problems in our defense. And obviously
Sylvia's Sylvia. I said it yesterday, I think she's the greatest center that
I've ever seen as far as complete centers. There's a lot of them that can
score, but the things that she does on the other end as far as adjusting
shots, I mean, she came out of nowhere to block two shots, I'm sitting there,
Rachele with a 14-footer is open, is money, and all of a sudden it's blocked.  
You know, way tip our hats to them. We left everything on the floor. I
couldn't have asked more from our kids. We were right there with them on their
home court. A sign of a great team is a team that overcomes adversity, and
they overcame us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Julianne, particularly on the perimeter, their defense made you dribble
around so much, shot clock violations. How difficult was their defense to try
to penetrate?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Their defense is really unbelievable, probably the best
defense I've ever played against. You know, they really come at you,
especially in the second half. I mean, they were swarming us. When Fowles
starting jumping screens, it's even hard to see over her head. I mean, it's
hard. It really was hard. We did the best we could. But, yeah, I definitely
give them credit for their defense.  
  
Q. Rachele, it seemed like you had a good plan that when you got shots, they
went in. You had to like your game plan. How hard was it to sustain against
that kind of defensive pressure, even though you had a good plan?  
RACHELE FITZ: It's very hard. It's difficult because they do have such
athletic and long players, especially inside. So it was difficult to get the
ball inside, I feel.  
But when we did, we produced. We made our shots. It's hard, you know, after
Julianne had a good first half, so I'm trying to set screens. Her girl was
just sticking to her like nothing. So it's hard to set screens and continue to
get her open. It's hard to get the ball inside when you've got someone 6'6"
who's right there in your face. Even their other two post players are very
athletic and long. So we tried to capitalize on their size if Meg had them
down low, or me vice versa. It was just a rough game, battle down there.  
  
Q. The mood in the locker room at halftime to be only down two on their home
court, how is the team feeling coming out of the locker room for the second
half?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Well, we were feeling good because we were hanging right with
them. We were down, I don't know, maybe 10 or more points at one point that
half - more than that - and we came back. You know, going in at halftime, only
down by a couple points was huge. Sometimes that's what happens when you play
schools like this that go so deep. You start to lose gas in the second half.  
But we did, we were excited during halftime. You know, they just -- we ended
up just kind of, like I said, running out. But the mood was good at halftime.  
RACHELE FITZ: Definitely, I think we came in with a lot of energy. We had
confidence. Like coach said, we had our game plan and we made the other people
heroes that we were supposed to.  
  
Q. Julianne, just hitting some big threes in that first half, emotionally
how you were feeling you're helping to keep this team hanging around?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Well, it felt good to hit them. I knew I had to do something
to get us going 'cause I felt like we started out a little slow. So it
definitely got things rolling, I thought, both individually and I think as a
team.  
I was definitely blessed that they were going in. It was helping us somewhat,
right?  
  
Q. Julianne, in the middle of the second half, Erica, there about midway
through the first half, single digits, she would hit a big shot. She had
steals, did this, did that. When you're watching another player get hotter,
get off like that in a stretch, what are you thinking?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Yeah, she started going off. But she was one of the players
that we kind of wanted to force to beat us, and she stepped up, she really
did. And it was frustrating. It's frustrating to watch another player just,
you know, go off and light it up. There's only so much you can do. You pick
your poison. We had a really good game plan.  
But, yeah, you know, to answer your question, it is frustrating when
somebody's getting steals and then making shots left and right when it's
somebody that you were hoping wouldn't. And she did, so I give her a lot of
credit for that.  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to excuse the student-athletes now. Coach Giorgis
will now preside at the press conference. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. You said yesterday a lot of people weren't giving you a chance coming in
today. Being down at halftime, how were you feeling about the way the team was
playing?  
COACH GIORGIS: We felt great. First thing I said when we went into the locker
room, I said, This is what happens when you execute a game plan.  
Again, we were a little out of our element because we switched to the matchup
after the first couple of series where we obviously struggled with fouls. And
Meg picked up the two fouls early, so she's going to be cautious. We said, You
have to give up shots. Our kids aren't used to it. We've been a very good
defensive team. We pride ourselves in getting out on shooters. Our whole game
plan basically was, you know, if Thomas, White, LeBlanc, anybody else but
Chaney and Fowles is shooting the ball, that's a good thing. That's what we
tried to do.  
In fact, I think in the second-half run, if I'm not mistaken with the stats, I
think White only had eight threes all year. She hit the two. She hadn't taken
many. It's not that she wasn't a good shooter, but she only made eight threes
all year. She hit those two in a row. The dagger was -- we had done a great
job on Chaney. And twice we had communication problems where she got open
looks. She hit the one three that put it into double figures. You couldn't
hear yourself think. It really got the crowd back into it. That was right on
the run when we had to call the quick timeout. Another one was on an inbound
play. We switched out like we normally do and then all of a sudden we left
her. She stuck the bucket.  
You know, for her to get 10 was really what we didn't want. We had done such a
good job on her in the first half where she only had the one field goal. And I
got on Erica's case because she was supposed to be all over her and force her
to drive. We had just a couple mental errors there. Then when you're down 11
and now all of a sudden you start doing things, start panicking a little bit.
The crowd did a great job for them, you know, because we'd call out things or
we'd show signals and either we couldn't see them or couldn't hear them so a
lot of kids weren't sure what we were in.  
  
Q. You've talked all year about the senior leadership. For the seniors in
that locker room, how are you feeling? What are you going to remember about
the years they've given you?  
COACH GIORGIS: One, I'm going to remember how hard they cried because they're
pretty upset right now. But like we told them, I mean, 102 wins in a career,
you can't ask for much more. You're averaging 25 wins a year. National
rankings two consecutive years. Again, I think they said they felt they
validated their top 25 ranking. I mean, heck, Tennessee lost to these guys by
19 on their own court. We were right there. If Rachele makes the bucket at the
end of the half, would have been the ultimate contortion shot, we would have
been tied at the half.  
You know, it reminded us when we played UConn a couple years ago in the NIT,
we get to that 10-minute mark of the half, Gino benched his whole frontline
because he's ticked at them, we're down three at the half, all of a sudden
that same type of thing, that little run. Then all of a sudden, you know,
you're gasping for air, you're trying to do something to get back.  
So, you know, hopefully we build on that. But, you know, we have some great
seniors to replace. We've got a great recruiting class coming in. These kids
have helped build what I feel is a top 25 program. I told the kids today when
we did the tour of the football stadium, when you look at the resources you
have here, compared to a school of 4,000, it's an absolutely wonderful
academic school, one of the prettiest schools you'll see, you just see the
difference in terms of that where -- you know, I can't be more proud of a
group of people because we don't have any BCS scholarship offers for our kids,
yet we played with them for 30 minutes today and had a crowd and a bench that
was very nervous, you know, with kids who didn't receive scholarship offers
from the big schools that have these types of facilities and resources. They
just wanted to go and have a great academic education, you know, playing in a
great conference that's known for its academics, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. You have an outstanding program.
Best of luck next year.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 24, 2008

  

### [Lisa Etienne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18370)

### [Jennifer Rizzotti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18369)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Hartford. Coach Rizzotti will have some
introductory comments, then a session with the student-athletes.  
Coach, your opening comments, please.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, obviously we ran into a defensive buzz saw tonight. The
pressure that Texas A&M put on us was unlike anything we have seen and
probably anything we would have been able to prepare for, even if we had a
week. Just giving them a lot of credit for how hard they played and how they
were able to maintain their intensity for 40 minutes was really impressive.  
We always talk to our kids if they want to go deep in the post-season, you
have to do it with defense and rebounding. I certainly think Texas A&M has the
same philosophy about defending to get them to advance. They proved that
tonight. They were phenomenal.  
I'm proud of my kids and the season we had. 28 wins is the most we've ever had
in the program's history. Although they're upset, which I'm glad they're upset
we lost, when they look back and reflect on the year, for the seniors on their
careers, they have a lot to be proud of. We accomplished a lot this year.
Their hunger to try to get to the Sweet 16 was to me very impressive. Although
we didn't play our best tonight, I know they gave a lot of effort. For the
guys coming back, it's a great experience for us to learn from.  
Lastly, I know I'm going to make her more of a mess and she's probably not
worth anything to anybody right now talking-wise, but I'm just proud of
Danielle, what she has done and what she has meant. She's really been the face
of the University of Hartford women's basketball program. Nobody has ever come
through those doors and done what she's done as an individual. She's really
taken our program to a whole 'nother level. Whatever we accomplish in the
future, she will always be a big part of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lisa, talk about their defense tonight, how difficult it was to even get
an entry pass into the post or anywhere on the court.  
LISA ETIENNE: As y'all saw, it really was that good. I mean, it was like 10 of
'em out there. It was so hard to get the ball into the wings. Couldn't get it
to the post players. They were just everywhere. It was really hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll excuse the student-athletes. Coach,
we may have one or two more questions for you.  
  
Q. Jen, you had expressed some trepidations yesterday about points on
turnovers. It was like 19-0 at halftime. What did you see out there that you
could have done that you didn't?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I felt like, you know, their defense to begin with was taking
us out of our offense. But it also took us mentally out of the game. That's
probably what I was most frustrated with. Even when we drew something up out
of a timeout or talked about something at halftime to adjust to their
pressure, I think our kids were so mentally flustered with their pressure and
physicalness, they weren't even in the right spots. That's something I said to
them. I can't help you score a basket if I draw something up and you run it
wrong.  
That's a maturity thing. That's something that we'll have to get better at.
But, again, it's hard to put them in that situation a lot. We played a pretty
good non-conference schedule and were very successful against everybody but
UConn in terms of playing against pressure. But no team we've played has been
able to maintain their defensive intensity the way that Texas A&M did tonight.
Not even close. I mean, even the UConn game, as good as they were, it was a
different kind of mental breakdown. Tonight was just all about them physically
staying in denial, pressuring us, taking away cuts, taking away passes for 40
straight minutes until the buzzer ended.  
Looking back and talking to the younger guys coming back, that will be our
focus, is that we got to be able to still think the game and still mentally
adjust when teams are outplaying us physically. That's something that I was
probably most disappointed with tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you've had a magnificent season. You have only three
seniors on your team, lots of great things to look forward for.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: We'll be back.

## March 24, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have a brief opening comment from Coach Chancellor.
Coach, your opening comments.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: First of all, I want to give our opponents a lot of credit.
I thought Marist, they were so well-coached, so disciplined and did so many
great things. Maybe they didn't have someone 6'6" and a guard that played out
of her mind today like we did.  
I was just amazed at how hard they play, how much heart they have. And no
wonder they went to the Sweet-16 last year and come within a hair of going
today to a Sweet-16.  
They come into our building and played great. That should be hats off to that
group of kids and their coaching staff. They had a great plan and followed it.
We just probably had a little bit too much height at the end for them and our
point guard play.  
I'll say this, our point guard tonight, when she got her second foul, I don't
want to say all the thoughts that were going through my head at that time. But
when she came out, she was well-rested for the second half, played like she
did, I just thought that was your best performance since you've been at lust.
Agree or disagree?  
ERICA WHITE: Agree.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Sylvia, you were just Sylvia. You're a great player.  
Sylvia Fowles just became the all-time rebounder in the history of the SEC.
All-time rebounder. Did you know that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Brian told me in the locker room (laughter).  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I told y'all yesterday about who was smarter than me
(laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Sylvia or Erica, a game like this is a game that a lot of teams need the
extra push heading into the Sweet-16. Is this the game you needed tonight to
let you know nothing comes for free when it's tournament time?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yeah, I agree. During this time, when you go up against
opponents, it's a win or lose and they gonna give they all no matter what name
you got written across your chest. Marist came out tonight and proved they
wanted it, but we wanted it even more.  
ERICA WHITE: I think Marist was a great opponent for us, because they're so
disciplined, they play so smart and they never quit. To have to fight as hard
as we did to win, you need that in a tournament. Even if we're the No. 2 seed
playing at home, you're gonna get a game, so it was great for us.  
  
Q. Erica, I gather you weren't too happy about having to sit on the bench in
the first half. You played like you were on a mission in the second half. What
went through your head, even though the coach doesn't want to say? Sylvia, is
LSU two teams, one team wither her and one without her?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I won't say we're two different teams, but our momentum changes
when she's off the floor. Like I say, Erica gets everything going. She the
head of the snake, and without her we're kind of lost.  
ERICA WHITE: When I got my two fouls, those were some tough calls. That was
tough going out of the game so early. But I just tried to stay focused, just
stay in the game mentally and come back in the second half and play well.  
  
Q. Erica, can you talk a little bit, in the second half it looked like you
had a certain fire and intensity in your eyes. You were not going to be
denied. Can you describe what was going through your mind midway through the
second half.  
ERICA WHITE: You know, the style of Marist, the style of defense they were
going to play was Pacman defense. They were basically going to sit four people
on Sylvia and dare us to shoot. So basically all night I was just dreaming
about knocking down open shots. And so, you know, I didn't get a chance to do
that in the first half. So I just tried to stay focused.  
You know, my teammates and I received a handout before the game where some
Marist players thought that our defense was questionable. That definitely fed
into my intensity and made me want to play even harder. So I was happy I could
compete, you know, in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, Erica did everything but dust off her shoulders in the middle of
the game. Was it hard controlling her? Or do you let a player like that go
when they're feeling it like they are?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: About three times on the bench tonight, our staff was
saying, No, no, no. Then she would make play after play. We were saying, Man,
I taught her to make that play. I thought that was a great shot (laughter).  
I thought one of the differences for us tonight, in the first half, we were
going to put Sylvia on 14 and put Ashley on 12 because we thought 12 -- we're
trying to keep Sylvia out of foul trouble. So when we switched that in the
second half, we were able to put Sylvia on 12 because she didn't have but one
foul. I thought that turned us around. Then we stopped those guards from
penetrating. But we were trying to get to halftime for her with one foul.  
Sylvia's defensive player of the year, but I think Erica White is the best
defensive point guard on the ball in the country.  
  
Q. For all three of you, talk about Marist's defense, especially in the
first half. They seemed to triple Sylvia, were running a box-and-one on
Quianna, took her out of the game. Talk about the way they played defense the
first half or so.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You want to answer that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Erica.  
ERICA WHITE: Well, in the first half, like you said, they had someone trailing
Quianna so she couldn't get the ball. They basically had three people on
Sylvia daring us to shoot.  
The difference in the game was in the first half we were not able to knock
down open shots. In the second half we knocked down perimeter shots, then they
have to come up and guard us. You look up and Sylvia is being guarded by one
defender, and no one defender in the country can guard her.  
I think that was the difference in the game in the second half. We just said,
If you're going to dare us to shoot, we're going to knock 'em down. That
opened Sylvia up and that opened the game up.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Coach Starkey suggested in the second half, we were setting
high ball screens, and we decided to set low ball screens. When we did that,
make the forward come off of Sylvia, that's how we were able to get her open
in the second half a little bit. Our players were really smart and ran it
really good. But I thought they had a great defensive plan for our team.  
  
Q. Erica, with 13:30 left in the second half, you got a steal. You proceeded
to go the length of the floor, get the bucket. That was the ignition point. Is
that the kind of performance you'll need not only from yourself but other
players as you make your run towards the Final Four and possible national
championship?  
ERICA WHITE: Definitely. Making a play on the defensive end of the floor,
that's something we've hung our hat on her at LSU. That's something we're
going to have to continue to do. We pride ourselves on our defense and make
those plays. Then on the other end, if you have a layup, make the basket. We
have threes, let's knock 'em down.  
As we continue to drive through the tournament, that's gonna be our focus,
just to make plays, especially on the defensive end, but on the offensive end,
as well.  
  
Q. Erica, could you tell us what was going through your mind when Coach
Chancellor pulled you out for the last time, and then when you were out there
at mid-court after the game, knowing this part of lust is over.  
ERICA WHITE: I was thinking, this is my last time in this building and these
fans are incredible. I just wanted to just go out and touch every single one
of them. I knew that that wasn't possible. But I just wanted to wave to as
many people as I could and just make eye contact to let them know they do mean
a lot to us. Our fans are incredible. They've been incredible for four years.
At that moment, I was thinking of them. They were up on their feet, cheering.
I was just thinking about all the things I love about LSU, the fans, the band,
the cheerleaders, the Tiger Girls, everyone on staff. Every aspect of LSU,
everyone that goes into this program, I was just thinking of them.  
Sad that I have to leave, but just wanted to pay a tribute to them.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: What was going through my head was that this was my last time
on the court. I got a little numb feeling in my stomach, but it was a good
feeling just to see our fans up yelling and screaming and knowing we did a
great thing and we left on a good note.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you got the record on one of the cheapest rebounds ever. Ashley
blocked a shot, the ball went right in your hands. But seriously talk about
getting the record in this league. You know how many great players there are.
How special is the record to you?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's very special. But to be honest, I barely think about it.
If I go out there and I do what I have to do on the court, it will pay off. It
has showed.  
But I credit my teammates for that, for getting me in the right position,
especially Erica. I know there's a few times she had to tell me to get to the
ball, to do this, to do that, help on this.  
But I'm happy to hold the title. But it's just another thing for me. Not too
exciting, I guess.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll excuse the student-athletes now and have a
session with Coach Chancellor. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, particularly the defense, the way you were able to hold Marist to
really a few shot clock violations, also make them chew up the shot clock, how
important was that?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought we were able to -- we kept them from just running
their offense so fluid like they had in the previous game. So when the shot
clock ran down, and I thought in the first half they hurt us with penetration
because Sylvia was outside on 14. Then in the second half, that's why I took
the 30-second timeout. I usually don't take that. I don't like to take it. But
I did because I wanted to change the adjustment. That let our perimeter people
know they could pressure more because if their man got by them, two or three
times 3 and 22 drove in, but they saw Sylvia out of the corner of their eyes,
not how many shots she blocks, but how many shots she changes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that handout that Erica mentioned that said Marist
said y'all didn't play defense or something.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Bob Starkey gives out handouts and motivational tapes and
everything. We just talked about the things that they did. See, when you have
a turnaround of only one day, we always call what I call bullet points that I
try to emphasize. I think you can emphasize too much. You got to pick out one
or two things you're gonna try to take away, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Coach, this team was almost a tale of two halves. Two-point lead at
halftime. Second half was pretty much a runaway. When you look at this, is
this team going to need to have two solid halves as the competition gets
better throughout the tournament?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Here's what happened to us. I've said it all along. I didn't
want to say it in front of Erica too much 'cause I didn't want to give her the
big head. Any time we've lost her, she is kind of the head of our defensive
operation. Tay-Tay gets a lot of credit, Sylvia does. But when we lost her, we
lost our little offensive sync, and we were trying to hang on till halftime.
At halftime, we knew we were going to switch Sylvia, then we were going to
turn Erica lose because we thought she would be fresh. We wasn't trying to do
anything in the first half but hold on.  
  
Q. Coming off the court at halftime, you seemed a little bit frustrated
maybe about LSU's last attempt to get a shot. Didn't go well with Ashley
Thomas. A failed layup there. What was the mood like at halftime and what did
you say to the team in the locker room?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: At halftime, our mood was one that we didn't think we were
playing that well. So my mood was to take the first part of the half and
correct some things that we were going to do. But at that time we began to
talk about positive things. We were playing at home. Our crowd would make a
difference. Let's execute. We're going to wear them down sooner or later.  
Then I cautioned Q. Sometimes when you're having a little box-and-one run on
you, they're manning you, zoning the rest of them, you're used to shooting a
lot, you get frustrated. We talked to her about that. We talked about just
getting the ball to Sylvia. We told them at halftime if they put seven around
her, bring two off the bench, get her the ball. We were saying, they had three
around her. I think they had everybody on the team around her. None of them
can stop her.  
  
Q. You had a lot of missed shots from outside, Allison and RaShonta. But
they kept shooting it. Did you continue to give them the green light?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Perhaps in my mind, that's the most difficult decision in
coaching. You're there, they're just packing your post player, they're manning
your best outside shooter. You can't get any shots. They're just getting other
people wide open. If you stop 'em, that hurts their confidence, then you can't
get the ball inside.  
So I first of all tried to say, Just shoot it. Then I stopped them and said,
Let's don't shoot it till the last 12 seconds of the half. And then I called
them over, the two that were struggling, I bragged on them, told them little
funny stories, different things. Obviously did none of that help (laughter). I
tried every psychological ploy I knew.  
So I finally stopped all of that and called another timeout and told them to
pass the ball inside. If that hurts you're feelings, I'm sorry, but enough is
enough. I have great faith in my shooters. I can't get them to have as much
faith in them as I have in them.  
  
Q. Do you remember a game with that many shot clock violations?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's amazing. Our team -- that's because a lot of teams play
us. I'm going to say this. We have them come in here all the time, on the
road, everywhere else. I read in the paper the next day, they say we just
didn't shoot well. But we have the most suffocating defense I've ever been
around. And I'm bragging here about our team. And usually we do cause a lot of
shot clock violations. We play kind of an inside-out type of defense.  
  
Q. Talk about the crowd.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: When we went up six, I thought our crowd made a major
difference in our defense today. When we started, it really ignited Erica.  
  
Q. When you look at the way the game went tonight, home crowd played a huge
part in the game. Is that something you're looking forward to when you go down
to New Orleans? The second half, it sounded like an LSU/UConn or Tennessee
game. Is that something you're going to be counting and relying on?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think this: crowds don't win games, but they can help you
emotionally. I thought tonight they just helped us so much. When we were
struggling a little bit offensively, we had to win the game defensively, and I
thought they generated a lot of enthusiasm and got us pumped up. That's where
our crowd helps us you more defensively than it does offensively. And I hope
we'll carry a great crowd to New Orleans.  
I thank you for your support of this tournament and women's basketball. I hope
you have a great day. I'm going to have a tremendous night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck in New Orleans.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the postgame press conference. I'd like to welcome
the victorious Texas A&M Aggies. Coach Blair will have an opening comment and
we'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach Blair, your opening comments, please.  
COACH BLAIR: I thought basically our defense controlled the tempo of the
ballgame and we were forcing them to making drives in the last five seconds.
Their post player was doing a good job of hurting all of my post players on
her drives at the end.  
I thought our wings was doing a pretty good job. You got to give up something.
We'll have that talk about our post players about giving up the drive to the
basket, but 24 was doing a good job the whole night. I liked our intensity. I
liked what we were doing in transition. We got a lot of easy baskets off of
steals. A lot of that -- whoever scores the layup is not necessarily the one
that created the turnover, she's the recipient, because we're a very unselfish
team on giving up the basketball, like in the second half when we had a three
on one, when it went from T.K. to Morenike back to Gant. These kids are very
unselfish and they do the things.  
Certain nights it might be Starks' night. She just got selected District 5
Kodak All-American today into the top 40. We're happy for her. On other nights
it might be D.G. we have instant offense coming off the bench.  
Eastern style of basketball is old school of basketball that I really admire
because they have to play the game between the ears, not necessarily above the
rim. You have to set screens. You got to run a good motion. And they are a
very good team, just like you saw Marist earlier. I think ourselves and LSU
were just a little bit too athletic for them. I think that showed. But what it
didn't show was on the rebounding. Hartford came in and just kicked us on the
boards just about the whole night because of just special effort. But as a
result they were giving up something in transition. But I would just like to
commend Hartford, what Coach Rizzotti has built over there in such a short
time. You better enjoy the ride if you're in the mid-level schools.  
But Marist made it last year to the Sweet 16. Perhaps next year it will be
Hartford's time. We got a tremendous break when 23 got into foul trouble
because she runs the show for 'em and does an excellent job. When she went out
of the ballgame, it created a whole lot of more scoring opportunities for us.  
But I'm proud of these young ladies up here, just like I am of the ones in the
dressing room. But it was a very businesslike game for us. We're gonna play
pressure. I thought the officiating was fair for both teams. We've got to get
a little bit better at making the right decisions and do it consistently once
we start going against the teams that will be in the Sweet 16.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the evolution? Last year was one-and-done, two
years was losing in the first round. To get to the Sweet 16, talk about how
satisfying it was and your goals going forward.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Well, I will start out by saying we were still growing as a
team. We were inexperienced. We hadn't been there before. We didn't know what
it took to win games. We had the talent, but talent -- Coach Blair mentioned
it to us before we came out to the game that talent doesn't win games. Every
night you have to be smart, you have to play together as a team.  
But I think this is a great win for us and we've grown over the years. This
just gives us great momentum and we'll just keep growing as a team every game.  
  
Q. Danielle, we quizzed you about going into the press table. On the first
possession of Hartford, you went halfcourt for a loose ball that set the
tempo. Talk about the defense and what you wanted to establish early.  
DANIELLE GANT: We wanted to get a lot of turnovers. In the first half, we
didn't do that. In the locker room we got a little, uhm, word from Coach
Schaefer. He wanted us to come out in the second half and play great defense.
And I think that's what we did.  
  
Q. Danielle, Oklahoma City, you're going home. Talk about how that's going
to feel to play there.  
DANIELLE GANT: It's great. Always great to go home and play in front of my
family and friends. Like I said, it's going to be great. We went there not too
long ago. I seen all my family. But just to go back and see them there again,
it's going to be great.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about the feeling of this team, the businesslike win here,
on this winning streak, talk about the feeling inside the locker room, the
confidence going on?  
DANIELLE GANT: I think it's great. The four losses we got in the beginning of
the season really got us going now during this part of the time. But it's
great just to have all these wins. I mean, the team, at first we were a little
down because we got those four losses. I think that didn't do nothing but help
create this winning streak that we have now.  
  
Q. Mo and La Toya, I notice there wasn't a whole lot of celebration out
there. First trip to the Sweet 16 in 14 years. Is that because you're still
looking at more business, more things to accomplish?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think what was different is -- I'm not saying in the past
years we haven't expected to win. Like I said, we have grown. We're smarter as
a team. We play together. We expect to win big games. We're not the No. 2
seed, no one picked us No. 2 seed for no reason. We just go out and try to
play like a No. 2 seed should.  
La TOYA MICHEAUX: I think what Mo said was correct. We're happy inside. But we
realize we have business to take care and we're looking forward to the next
game. We're very excited to make the Sweet 16. I believe it was the first time
in school history that we made that. No, since 1996. Much as we feel we're
expected to be there, we worked hard. I just think that's something we
deserve. When you look at the Final Four and stuff like that, you'll see a
celebration there.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Can you talk about shooting. If I would have said you weren't going to
hit your first three till nearly halfway through the second half, would you
have been pretty concerned going in?  
COACH BLAIR: They were doing a good job of denying us out. I just said, Get
the midrange shot, hurt them inside. We started doing that at the start of the
second half. I said, We do not have to shoot the three. It's something that we
do very well, is defend the three. It's something that Hartford does very well
also.  
Most of the time we were shooting a three on the end of a shot clock
situation. We were short on almost every one of them because they had a great
high hand in our face. The rest of the time we got to create, put it on the
deck, go to the hole, try to draw the foul, kick out or something. Our ball-
handling skills was not very good today at end-of-game situations.  
There's some things we did well. When you look at the assist-turnover ratio on
Starks and A'Qua, they might not have had the best shooting game, but they
took care of the ball and set it up for other teammates. The best thing we
could do is to use our dribble-penetration, get it inside. And that's what
Gant was doing a number of times. Reado played well in spurts.  
  
Q. Obviously now this is your third program to take to the Sweet 16. What is
different in a program when you reach the Sweet 16? What happens? What's
different?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, I would love to be facing a bunch of Cinderellas in there.
But I don't think that's gonna happen.  
You expect to play the best. That's what it's all about. We're the lowest No.
2 seed, but we're there. Everybody else is trying to play to get there. We
want to represent the Big 12. But what we want to do is represent that you can
get to the Sweet 16 without a bunch of parade All-Americans all the time.
Sure, we'd love to have 'em. But all of a sudden you can get there with just
pure basketball players that know how to play the game.  
I think we play both ends of the floor very well. That's our strength. Other
teams play one end of the floor well or they might be great on situation plays
or they might be good on the other end. But we play both ends very well. And
we've got a tremendous bench that gives me the luxury of staying in the press
a little bit longer than we normally do. That's what I did today. I stayed in
the press, trying to wear out and make their point guard have to make some
decisions. As a result, we were able to get a couple of charges on her just
because she had nowhere to go.  
  
Q. What about the program? What does this do for the program?  
COACH BLAIR: There's room for people to jump on this bandwagon at any time. I
don't think we have our spring football game for at least a couple weeks,
right? Okay, baseball's doing fine. They're doing fine. Our men had a great
season. They went right down to the wire on another tough call.  
Right now it's just about women. Isn't that great? The front page of your
sports page is going to be about women, either our swimming team finishing
fourth in Nationals. Shoot, we might even have a woman president. You never
know what's gonna happen.  
But right now isn't it good for women's athletics? Right now all across the
way, people actually do care. That's what this program is all about. We want
to go to that next level. We don't just want to get up there and play hard,
everybody pat us on the back. We're in this thing to win now, okay? When this
hair gets gray, I get greedy, and I'm ready to win.  
Hartford, you got a heck of a basketball coach. I don't know how much longer
you can keep her, but keep her just having babies and she's just going to stay
closer to home, okay, because you've got one heck of a basketball coach. And
you don't have to go to University of's to be successful. I had a great run at
Stephen F. Austin, which is very similar. Take care of your coach. Take care
of your assistants. Keep her there.  
  
Q. Danielle had the hot hand. Your thoughts on how she came through?  
COACH BLAIR: Danielle Gant never takes a bad shot, okay? She's very left
shoulder orientated, but at the same time try to stop it. I mean, it's hard.
We ran a couple of set plays for her on a lob early to start the ballgame,
then they made the adjustments, we went to something else. She's just very
good at putting the ball on the floor. Her first step from defense to offense
is the quickest I've ever coached. So when there's a steal about to happen,
she's already down the court. She anticipates very well.  
The kid is a next-level player. The best thing about her, she's a junior. Sort
of like Archie in the comic books. He never was a senior. He was a junior for
all those years. That's how that comic strip kept going.  
I love Danielle Gant because of how hard she plays. She makes the rest of us
play just as hard because she does the same thing in practice every day. It
never stops.  
THE MODERATOR: I think that's a wrap, coach. Good luck in Oklahoma City.  
COACH BLAIR: Appreciate it. You've done a great job of running this
tournament. Thank y'all.

### [Marylynne Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18416)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: No. 23, Lisa Etienne, No. 24, Danielle Hood, and No. 33,
MaryLynne Schafer, and the head coach of the Hartford Hawks, Jennifer,
Rizzotti. Coach, would you please open up with a comment, and then we'll open
it up.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Thanks for being here. We're excited to be playing another
day, and it's what our purpose was coming down here, to advance in the NCAA
tournament. Yesterday we broke our school record for wins with 28 on the
season, so I'm proud of the adversity we've handled throughout the year and
the amount of wins we've been able to get against quality competition, and
certainly Syracuse was one of the hardest teams we've played. We're excited to
be playing another game, and we know Texas A&M is going to be tougher, but
we're certainly up for the challenge.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, how late did you stay up to watch yourself on ESPN?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I actually went to sleep. We saw it at dinner I think once
and then I've had family tell me about it later but I haven't had an
opportunity to see it again.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, I was down at Tampa and Ty Rogers from western Kentucky hit a
shot and he said he went back and had 172 text messages waiting for him. I
wondered if you had any and if you could tell me the interesting part of
that.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I had 10 or 12, family and friends, old AAU teammates,
people I've come in contact with. It was nice to have that support.  
  
Q. Danielle, I would like you to talk about their man-to-man defense versus
the zone defenses you've been facing lately and how you guys plan to -- is
that more beneficial for you or less?  
DANIELLE HOOD: I think we play better against man but, I mean, we've
definitely beat teams who play us in zone so it's good to play a team that
plays us in man so we can go back to running our plays that we love to run so
we're excited.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about when you played for Coach Blair? He talked
about when you played for him in the Jones Cup.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I don't know any secrets, but I feel like I know what his --
obviously watching them but knowing from -- playing for him his team is going
to play really hard. The way that he coaches and the respect that he shows for
his players, I think, makes them want to play hard for him. He's not the type
of guy who berates kids, he's encouraging, but he knows how to get you to play
hard, and he demands the right things, and you can see in the discipline that
they play with that they listen and they buy in.  
It's certainly worked for them. They're a phenomenal basketball team,
certainly one of the best in the country, and we're excited about having a
chance to play against them and, like Hood said, test out our man sets now,
instead of forty minutes of zone. But they're one of the best man-to-man teams
in the country, and it's going to be a battle, and we're going to have to be
ready for it.  
  
Q. Jennifer, Texas A &M people talked about going into this tournament, it
was a big year for them; they needed to get to the Sweet 16. What could a win
like this do for your program?   
COACH RIZZOTTI: Obviously it takes us to a level we've never been before and
gives us the national exposure that this group of girls has been seeking.
We've been fighting to be in the Top 25 all year; we've been on the cusp of
it. We've played a tough schedule to give us consideration as an at-large bid
team, which I think we did, even if we weren't to win our championship, and,
you know, this team has been to this point before, MaryLynne and Danielle and
-- not Lisa as a player but she was part of the team.  
They've played in the second round of the NCAA tournament. For us it's a
chance to take a step further, and I know there is nothing more that Danielle
and the players want more than a birth to the Sweet 16.  
So I think for any team in the country getting to the Sweet 16 is a big feat.
So as much as it means to them, it means that much to us, as well, and it can
do wonders for the exposure of our program and what we're trying to do to get
to the NCAA every year, and not only get there but be a team that wins in it.
It's certainly going to help us in that cause.  
  
Q. Lisa, the post players obviously have been your biggest offense most of
the year. The guards have broken out in the last few games. Can you talk about
that a little bit, your mindsets as guards, you and MaryLynne, what you guys
have been doing differently?  
LISA ETIENNE: I think we've been doing what we've been doing all year, but a
lot of teams have focused more on our post players, so we're getting a lot of
open shots and more opportunities to shoot and score, so I think we're
stepping up and knocking down shots right now.  
  
Q. Danielle, your game went down to the wire, and I think all the starters
played over 30 minutes. Texas A &M, nobody played more than 25 minutes. Even
with a day off, does that make a difference at this point in the season?   
DANIELLE HOOD: I think it makes a big difference. Coach Rizzotti can go deep
in her bench, and when everyone can play, it limits your minutes and keeps you
fresh. So when other teams have to play their starting five for over 30
minutes, they're going to be more tired than we are.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Don't forget, Danielle only played 18 minutes, because she was
in foul trouble the whole game, so she should be plenty fresh. Maybe she can
give Lisa and Beverly and MaryLynne a break!  
Certainly it may make a difference, but mentally it shouldn't. You're playing
for everything right now, and we talked about this in our America East
tournament, we were the fresher team because we were able to play people less.
But never underestimate an opponent, because what they have in their heart and
their effort can overcome any type of physical fatigue, and we might have to
count on a few more guys off the bench this time.  
I think Lisa and Erica and MaryLynne are strong enough to play 30 and come
back and play another 30 if we need them to, but hopefully we'll have some of
your younger guys ready as well.  
  
Q. Jen, I wanted to ask you about preparation this time, vis-a-vis after
knocking off Temple and going to Georgia -- against Georgia, is your team more
mature this time? Are you better ready? Did you feel that you were ready last
time? Could you talk about that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Honestly, I probably feel like our coaching staff is more
ready this time around. I think that when we beat Temple there was such an
excitement about it, that -- not that we didn't prepare for Georgia, but it
might not have been to the degree we would with one day in between.  
And I feel like this time we learned from that, and we had been watching tape
on Texas A&M before we played Syracuse -- not me, but someone on my staff --
to make sure we were prepared and ready. And just like during the season when
you only have one game, or in the case of a tournament like Hawaii or the
America East tournament, you don't have any days to prepare, you still as a
coaching staff know what to expect, and you can convey that to your players.  
These guys adjust well. They can adjust to a team in shootaround if we need
them to. That's what we did out in Hawaii, and they were ready when we had to
play Virginia on the third day, and it's similar to that except we got an
extra hour and a half today, and we are going from zone to man-to-man, and a
"man" like we've probably never seen.  
I feel confident that our kids have worked hard all year to prepare for this
moment, and our guards are going to have to be ready to handle the pressure,
and our posts are going to have to be effective certainly in the paint and
also rebounding, but I think our team is more prepared for this moment than
they were two years ago, definitely.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Coach, student athletes, thank you very
much. Best wishes.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome back to the podium here Marist, the Marist
Red Foxes. No. 12, Rachele Fitz; No. 22, Nikki Flores; and No. 14, Meg
Dahlman. The head coach, Brian Giorgis.  
COACH GIORGIS: Nice to be able to come back and make an opening statement.  
We're excited to still be here and looking forward to tomorrow. I don't have
that much to say; we'll just take your questions.  
  
Q. Coach, happy Easter. What impresses you about Louisiana State?  
COACH GIORGIS: About everything. Their length and their athleticism, just
unbelievable. Their defense is obviously extremely strong, and we're going to
try to find ways to attack it and hopefully score some baskets.  
  
Q. Particularly the way the team won yesterday, what's that say about the
explosiveness that they have, which you might need against a team like LSU?  
COACH GIORGIS: The one thing that's great about our kids is because of their
experience and the success that they've had, they're not going to quit on
anything. They know that we have a formidable opponent tomorrow, but at the
same time, you know, we've played against people like Tennessee in the last
couple of years, and that doesn't mean we've won 'em, but, you know, it hasn't
been because we were intimidated or haven't attacked.  
That's what I like about our kids. They're just going to get after it. They
know it could be their last one and, you know, that it's on their court, with
their high-ranking. It doesn't matter; they're just going to get after it.  
  
Q. Coach, going back and reviewing the end of the game, the 32-2 run. I'm
sure you haven't been following anything like that. Is there anything in your
recollection as a coach or watching the game that you can recall something
like that happening?  
COACH GIORGIS: You know, it's kind of interesting, when you're in the game,
you don't even think of it. I didn't know we had a 32-2 run to finish the game
until somebody told me after the game. I just knew that we hit a bunch of
three's to get back into the game, and we got a lot of good stops, and our
biggest problem was giving up second-shot opportunities.  
And I noticed we were forcing tough shots and getting the rebound, so it was
one and done for them, and we were finding ways to score from different people
down the stretch. So, like I say, I hadn't been a part of something like that,
but it was lot of fun being part of something like that.  
  
Q. For Meg and Rachele, Coach talked about attacking the defense. Tomorrow
night how do you plan to do your best against their bigs?  
STUDENT ATHLETE: I think we have to realize we're not going to -- it will be
hard to stop them completely, so they are going to get their buckets, but if
we can limit them to one shot and rebound the ball really well, then hopefully
that will lead to our offense on the other end.  
STUDENT ATHLETE: It's going to be hard to get inside, we know that, from the
get-go. So we have to use our ability to shoot outside and to draw the posts
when we're going down low and kick the ball out. That's it.  
  
Q. For the players, just kind of a question off the topic of basketball.
Being here for Easter so far away from home, it seems like it would be a tough
situation, but Coach Blair from Texas A &M mentioned you guys miss lots of
holidays. Is this another one like it? Is this just the usual for you guys?   
MEG DAHLMAN: We're used to being on the road a lot, and I think we like
playing on the road, and I know my mom and brother are here; Rachele's parents
are here, and Nikki's dad and mom, so our families are great, and they travel
with us practically everywhere we go, so we're not that far away from them,
because they're always with us.  
  
Q. Nikki, how hard is it going to be for you to get the ball inside, and how
imperative is it for you and Juls to have a good game from the outside?  
NIKKI FLORES: Well, the guards are athletic, as is the rest of the team, so
we'll have to be able to make decisions, utilize penetration and kick, maybe
even kick interiorly, it depends on what the defense gives to us.  
  
Q. Coach, it's a familiar refrain what Meg said about limiting them inside,
but you limit them inside and Chaney might start hitting 3's, White might
start driving, it might be hard to not be pro LSU here, but how hard will it
be to stop everything they can do?  
COACH GIORGIS: It will be extremely hard. Again, you've got to take something
away and hope something else isn't working. We might try, you know, in certain
possessions to try to hold down Chaney and those types of people, and other
times we will try to limit what Sylvia can do inside. That's why they're good.
We'll have a few different things up our sleeves and try to do the best that
we can with them.  
The one thing I like about our kids is when things don't work, they don't
necessarily panic. Like with yesterday, with DePaul, the two guards just shot
lights out. Then all of the sudden in the last, you know, quarter of the game,
they went cold and we went on our run.  
We didn't make a lot of different changes from what we've been doing all game.
Just one slight adjustment and it seemed to help. We know that they can score
in a lot of different ways, and really to be quite honest with you, we're more
concerned with how are we going to score. They're the best defense in the
country right now, I think, scoring, defensewise.  
We've got to find ways to get good shots for us. Kind of like last year when
we were playing Tennessee and they were asking how are we going to stop
Candace Parker, we were like, how are we going to get shots for Julianne who
is going to be guarded by a 6-3 kid, that type of thing. We've got lots of
things to think about in the next 24 hours in terms of our game plan and what
we're going to try to do.  
  
Q. You've played big teams in the past couple of years but what is tomorrow
night going to present as far as being here in their own gym with a Rocky can
you say crowd, I can imagine?  
COACH GIORGIS: Well, that's going to be the one big difference. We usually --
although we have faced Maryland at Maryland, Duke at Duke, we just like the
challenge. Put it this way: There are not a lot of people out there that have
given us much of a chance. We've been in that situation before, and sometimes
we come through, sometimes we don't, but we don't care. We're just going to go
out and try to be -- try to pose as much trouble as we can and hope that it's
good enough.  
  
Q. Could you see any way at all that the emotions that would be involved on
LSU's side, with this being a senior class playing their last game here could
work as an advantage to you, as players looking from the outside in?  
Everyone would assume it's the obvious advantage with them, but could it be a
distraction?  
NIKKI FLORES: I think it will help us. We have a lot of senior leadership on
this team. Between Courtney, even though she'll be back next year, and me and
Meg, and then you have Alexis, who is still on the bench and basically leads
the bench with cheering, I mean, the senior leadership on our team is going to
help us.  
With our experience being here and everything, I can see what you're saying,
it can hurt us in a way, but I think it will work to our advantage.  
COACH GIORGIS: To be honest with you, I never thought about it until you
brought up the question. We've got a lot more issues with length and
athleticism than in terms of it's their last game at home. We know that we've
got a big challenge ahead of us. We like it that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, and student athletes. Best of luck.

### [Ashley Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18428)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have No. 12, RaShonta LeBlanc; No. 34, Sylvia Fowles; and
No. 54, Ashley Thomas. Now for the introduction, head coach Van Chancellor.
Coach?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We have a lot of players on this basketball team that get a
lot of publicity. Today I thought I would bring two players that have been the
difference in our team by accepting great roles and doing whatever is good for
the team. Ashley and Tai-Tai don't need the ball, and if you're gonna win,
that's what you got to have. Y'all know everything about our team. Let's open
it up for questions.  
  
Q. Ashley, kind of what Coach alluded to. You were always a post-season
killer. People don't expect you to have an offensive game. You get the ball
and knock down shots. Talk about your focus once the second season begins and
taking some teams by surprise.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: When it comes down to these last six games, either you win or
you go home. I want to continue playing until the last game and finish our
season on a win.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ASHLEY THOMAS: That's -- with, I guess, any team we played all season. They're
always focused on Sylvia, so whatever opportunities I get I take advantage of
them.  
  
Q. I know we had senior night a little while back, but tomorrow night will
be the last game in the PMAC for the Lady Tigers. Can you talk about the
emotions for tomorrow night.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's going to be a lot of emotion, after the game. During the
game or before the game, I don't think we'll think about it as much, but after
the game I'm sure there will be a lot of emotions.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: During the game you can't worry about that, because sometimes
you can let your emotions affect how you play. We'll just worry about that
when the game is over and as long as we come out with a win in our last game
at the PMAC that will be fine with me.  
RASHONTA LEBLANC: Like Ashley said, you can't worry about it when you're
playing, but after the game we'll deal with it then.  
  
Q. No one ever had to call your name to ask you to talk, did they, Van?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: No.  
  
Q. Ladies, talk about, is there a more quiet intensity on this team? There
is not a lot of talk or hoopla from the players but just the determination to
win and, I guess, take care of business, which is what you've been very adept
at doing in the NCAA tournament. If it's not a lot of emotion, what is it
between you guys that helps you succeed? The determination, business-like
attitude, what is it that helps you succeed in these situations?  
ASHLEY THOMAS: I think because we do have the same goal in mind and we are
determined we play off of each other. We don't have a lot of hoopin and
hollering, but we play off each other, and I think we have the same goal,
which makes us successful.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you've been through this before, but what was it that got
you off the golf course to get back into it? From watching them last year,
what changes did you want to make? I know specifically more outside
shooting.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Everybody thinks I came back to LSU because of the contract
and because I wanted to play for a national championship. Those were the two
great reasons, but I really got off the golf course because I felt like I had
in my life a lot of gas still left in the tank, and I wasn't ready to go out
and play golf every day, and I wanted to make a difference in people's lives.  
When you're coaching in high school and college, you have the opportunity to
influence kids' lives, and that's what I wanted to do. Then the biggest change
I wanted to make was let them enjoy the game. Sometimes -- the great news --
this team does not show, Scott, a lot of emotions, but that is what has made
them play consistent all year.  
I don't think we played but one bad game all year. And that's why we're so
consistent. We don't have a lot of ups and downs. But I came back into college
coaching because the best way to be young is to be around people that are
young, and this team has been a lot of fun to coach. They listen to ya, they
do what you want, and you tell 'em something to do, you're going to pretty
well get it done.  
  
Q. What about your impressions from watching them last year as a
commentator?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I did LSU's games in the SEC and then I did their games in
Austin, Texas in the first and second round, and it's pretty eerie at times.
Every time I played by my house out here, and I come back and see Tiger
Stadium, I say to myself, "Are you the LSU coach?" It's hard for me to believe
that I'm in purple and gold.  
Last year I was worrying about subjects and verbs on the air, and this year
I'm worrying about winning a game. I never dreamed this time last year that I
would be coaching a team. But when you move and take a coaching job -- this
team has gone far beyond any expectations I had for it, as far as enjoying it
and being a lot of fun.  
I want you to be aware Sylvia is 12 rebounds away from being the all-time
leading rebounder in the SEC history. Of all the great players I've been
associated with from my time at Ole Miss and doing TV, it's mind boggling she
is about to become -- I'm trying to motivate her for tomorrow night. I need
12, Biggon, I'll tell you that right now.  
  
Q. You've known Gary Blair for a long time. How good of a marriage is that
between him and Texas A &M?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think Blair was the perfect hire for A&M. They needed a
guy that wanted to build the program, work the program, wanted to work the
state of Texas. He coached high school basketball in Dallas, so in turn he had
a great connection, and I thought it was really good.  
Gary Blair leads the nation in coaching and making out the most NCAA brackets
in the history of coaching, by the way, if you don't know that. Before the
NCAA Committee makes their brackets out, they ought to call Blair. They could
save themselves a lot of time. He called me and told me I was No. 1, but that
just shows he doesn't know everything he thinks he knows about it. I'm just
kidding.  
  
Q. Ashley and Sylvia, talk about your defensive effort and going up against
Marist. They put up a nice run, did some nice things behind the arc. Talk
about your defense and stepping up and knowing that they were a 13 seed to
advance last year. Anything is possible.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: You can't overlook any team that you play in the tournament.
Guarding their post players, they can step away from the basket, but where our
post players, we're quick enough to guard those players that can step away, so
I think we'll be fine on our defensive end of the game.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I agree with Ashley. Their posts do step out, and they will
shoot three's and they will drive, and it will be a challenge, but I'm willing
to take it.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: They present a unique challenge for Sylvia. She'll have to
guard a post player on the perimeter, and that's something she is not used to
doing, but she's pretty quick, so we don't anticipate that being a major
problem. I think she presents problems for them, defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're aware that none of the young women sitting up there
with you have any idea what it's like to play a season without making it to
the Final Four, and this is their last year trying to make it four in a row,
and you're here in your first year, and I wonder what kind of dynamic that
adds or challenge that adds to you as a coach.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: People ask me all the time, is there a lot of pressure
trying to get this team back to the Final Four, and I've given all the answers
that are not necessarily the ones I was ready to. Here's the facts: I feel no
pressure for Van Chancellor. I feel a lot of pressure trying to help them --
being frank with you, I don't want to mess it up.  
I want them to have every opportunity. I study tape every day, because I want
these players to experience that. A lot of high's have already happened for me
in my life, but I also believe in this: I believe with all my heart that you
do the best you can when you play a game. You do the best you can as a coach
and as a player, and if you've done that, everything is fine.  
I would like to be in a position that we could play for a championship, so --
because I think we're pretty close right now, pretty close.  
  
Q. Tai-Tai, could you talk about Erica and how she's improved from last year
to this year? She seems to be more confident.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: Erica is more of a leader on the court. She runs the team well,
moves the ball well in transition, and she's clutch on her free-throws, and
she's developed her jump shot more this year. She shoots the ball better this
year than she did last year.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I want to make sure, since we have more of you here today
than we had the other day when I made this announcement: For everything you
hear about what's wrong with college athletics, I'm going to give you to my
right what's right about college athletics.  
Ashley Thomas has received a scholarship from the NCAA very few people get,
combining character, academics and basketball, to go to postgraduate work.
That doesn't make headlines, but that's what I'm proud of. What I'm proud of
is these players right here are ready to graduate. Some of them on our team
have already graduated.  
Some of them are going to graduate with a 2.8, 2.9 and 3.0, which is pretty
good. They might be smarter than their coach, but some might say that ain't
very smart, but that don't bother me. (Chuckles.)  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I'm smarter than you Biggon, so don't get carried away over
there. Thank you for covering this tournament. We've enjoyed it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our three substitute athletes are A'Quo Franklin, Morenike
Atunrase, and Patrice Reado, and we will have the Coach for opening comment
and then questions. Coach Gary Blair, who says he loves making the trips to
the stable.  
COACH BLAIR: Did you all go to Easter Egg hunt today? I did. That was fun.
Nothing to do but when you have a four year old grandson -- and they had to
drive back this morning, and my wife had to fly back, because they've got to
work tomorrow, but we had an Easter Egg hunt, and that was good. When you do
it with your four year old grandson, it's even more special.  
We're excited to still be sitting up here. It's beautiful weather. We've been
treated great, the administration here at LSU has ran a great tournament. The
NCAA reps have done good things for us, I hope they have for you. I would like
to comment -- I haven't seen all the other papers, but I would like to commend
the Baton Rouge paper.  
This morning it was nice to pick up the paper and see so much coverage on
women's basketball. And for you out-of-towners, they do that all the time.  
Okay? It's not just in this tournament, but they do a very good job of
coverage and so does the New Orleans' paper as well, but it's good to see that
coverage, and it's been going on down here for years.  
Jennifer Rizzotti. I had the opportunity to coach her on the Jones' Cup team,
along with Michelle Marciniak; those were our point guards, and Carol Walters,
one of our post players, Natalie Williams, Nakisha Sales, Sheri Sam, Pee Wee
Johnson, Katie Smith, Tina Thompson. It was the best team that didn't go to
the Olympics they ever put together, because every kid on that team has gone
on to be a WNBA All-Star.  
It was a pleasure to coach Jennifer Rizzotti because of the fire. You knew
right then she was going to be a great coach. It was just a matter of time
until she got all that playing time in the WNBA out of her, got a little bit
of Geno out of her and a lot of Geno in her, and she's brought it all to this
next level.  
And she's similar to who I coach against in my league when I have to go
against Kim Mulkey. It's good to see explayers get back into this game and
take these programs, the mid-level programs, to the high level, because the
mid-level programs can win at the highest level.  
You do not have to be a BCS school to get to the Sweet 16, as Marist showed us
last year and George Mason showed you in the men's game. It's good to see
everybody get an opportunity. We're going to have a lot of opportunities
tomorrow. We're going to see defenses that we didn't see against San Antonio.
They played us 85 to 90% man-to-man, which we didn't expect, and we're going
to expect triangles, box-and-two, denial-and-one's and different defenses to
try and slow us down.  
We will be playing our same man-to-man defense. That's what we do best. It's
not time to change. It's not time to change for Coach Rizzotti if she's held 7
of her last 10 opponents to 46 points or better on the defensive side. She's
doing something very well. Go with what brung you to the dance, because it's
working! I think we're going to have one of the best second round games
around. Open it up for questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Ladies, could you breakdown the match-ups, how you see it, what needs to
be done outside. A'Quo and Patrice could you talk about what needs to be down
outside against Hartford?  
STUDENT ATHLETE: As far as the match-ups, preparing for the Big 10 is just
like preparing for the Big 12, like Iowa State. We're going to match-up
perfect with them, pressure up on our defense, and on offense we're going to
dissect and attack the zone.  
STUDENT ATHLETE: I think on the defensive end we need to play like we have
always been playing, and on the offensive end we need to rebound and get the
put-backs.  
THE MODERATOR: Morenike?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: They said it all.  
  
Q. Coach Blair talked about a different approach this year, no Time Square,
no Disneyland, no sightseeing, more of the business-like atmosphere. Could you
talk about the approach you guys are taking?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I believe it's the same approach, we go out and sightsee
a little bit, but as far as us, we know what to expect. We've been here two
years straight, and we know what to expect. We're not just happy to be here,
but we're here for business.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Just to reiterate what A'Quo was saying, we haven't been
sightseeing as much as we have. Coach Blair likes to travel, and we've been
everywhere so far, but it's all business. We're here to win games, and that's
what's first.  
PATRICE READO: I agree with both of them.  
COACH BLAIR: These are my three senior starters, really, because we call her a
starter, still. They've been to Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Europe, they've
been to Disneyland, the state of Washington, they've been to New York City,
ESPN Zone, everyplace in the Big 12, which is not Disneyland, and it's been a
great ride!  
This is what college is doing for ya. Travel is an education, and I believe in
taking kids places that will help us in recruiting, but help us in the
competition factor, and we will play anybody, anytime. I think that's what you
need to do. But when you can get them on neutral floors and have a chance to
play teams, like in the Virgin Islands or in Hawaii or something, you take
advantage of that. We don't stay in the hotel rooms and just watch game tape
all day. We get out and we have a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Sort of along that line, when you signed with A &M they were coming off
an 8-straight losing season under their coach. What made you believe you could
turn this around, especially for the two of you from Texas?   
What was the vision of A&M in those days as compared to Texas or Texas Tech or
Baylor?  
PATRICE READO: When I was in high school, I excluded all of the Texas schools,
but for some reason when Coach Blair called me, right after they moved from
Arkansas to Texas A&M, I knew people that went to Texas A&M, and that kind of
gave me a hint that I could go there. And when I made my visit, I fell in love
with the coaches and the athletes that were there.  
And the schools that were recruiting me, they were the top teams, so I wanted
to go to a top team that needed more good people, like A'Quo and Morenike, to
bring the program up.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Same for me. I didn't want to go a program that had a
name for itself. I would rather be in a program that was on the rise, so I
chose Texas A&M.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I would say I didn't think I would end up in Texas, but I'm
glad I'm there now. I wouldn't go anywhere else. As far as me coming, I played
against A'Quo for all my years in high school. We played against their high
school, and I knew her, but we weren't talking, but I was playing against her.  
And once they told me who all they were recruiting, I said, I think they have
great athletes, and I think I have something I can bring to the program and
turn things around, and Coach Blair had successful years where he was at prior
to coming to Texas A&M, so I knew what type of coach he was and what type of
coaching staff he had. I didn't want to leave Louisiana, because I wanted to
stay close to home.  
  
Q. What schools were recruiting you?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: You were asking what schools? Tulane, LA Tech,
Southeastern; it was mostly the Louisiana schools.  
  
Q. For Coach and Morenike, this could be addressed to the both of you. I
know Morenike has overcome injuries and IS a senior, and you've had to battle
adversity, and, Coach, I saw in a story that you were quoted a couple of
months ago that you said people better learn how to pronounce her name,
because she's come to battle with avengence, so I'm curious, if Morenike --
maybe what she brings and what she has brought since her latest come-back.  
COACH BLAIR: First, you have the best voice among these guys because. You're
in radio; together, me and you, Morenike, Morenike, Morenike. If I had your
voice, I would be doing a radio show, too, but I've got a Monday tone voice. I
want your voice, but once you know it, it's Morenike, and it flows like she
does out there on the court, okay?  
  
Q. Got it.  
COACH BLAIR: All right. And hopefully we can keep playing, and everybody is
going to realize it's not Morenike anymore, because we're with Adidas now,
thank you.  
Now, what was the question?  
  
Q. Battling adversity, injuries, that kind of thing and what she kind of --
her role with the team now.  
COACH BLAIR: Basically the role of the team -- she's a senior leader. She will
do whatever we ask of her. You notice in that ballgame yesterday, I think she
was in the game 5 seconds and all of the sudden drilled a 3 from the corner.
She did it today in practice, the same time. She rotates in, all of the sudden
the shot is up, and she's got that flow about her. She's instant offense.
Sometimes your best players shouldn't be the ones that are starting all the
time, particularly when you have a team as balanced as we have.  
Because you've got to learn to accept roles. It's nice to know if somebody
gets two quick fouls, you can bring in an All-Big 12 performer or All-SEC or
All-Big East performer off the bench. The last team that could do that, I
believe, was Kathy Poindexter, and we've been able to do that. Danielle Gant
did it her first two years. That's because of the strength we have of those
top-six players that we have, and we've got some good ones behind them.  
So her role is to come in and fix what's broken, and she can play the 2
position, because Takia is in, two fouls, Gant goes to the 3, and she stays at
the four. If Gant is coming out, Reado comes out, Gant goes to the 4, and
Reado -- I told her when she came out of the ballgame, I said, "3 minutes go
in and get Micheaux," so when she went to the bench four minutes into the
game, she said, what did I do wrong, probably, in her head, but now I told her
in 3 minutes go in and get Micheaux.  
But now it's a positive spin, it's not a negative coming out of the game. It's
trying to balance six talented kids and get the most out of them.  
  
Q. Coach, you're selling basketball. Can you talk about how important
tomorrow night's game is for your program?  
COACH BLAIR: I'm selling basketball all over the country, Robert, not just in
Aggieland, because we're still in the growth stages all over the country. Our
men got eliminated last night in a tremendous basketball game, similar to two
years ago when LSU beat our men in the last-second shot.  
But it's time to quit playing close and be satisfied. It's time to have that
little bit of a hunger. These kids are never going to get another chance.
These kids have got to sit there -- yeah, they've earned another Big-12
Championship rank, but to keep playing, you've got to have passion for the
game, you've got to know a little bit of the history of the game and
appreciate the history, and then you've got to have some hunger to get to that
next level. And the eight teams that are seeded in the top two -- we're
expected to get to regionals. We're expected to get there.  
I looked at the stats this morning in one paper. I think a 10 seed has won
three times. They're 3 and whatever -- I want to make sure that doesn't
happen. But to do that, give your opponent respect. Because I know what it's
like being a nine seed, because we were the lowest-seeded team at Arkansas
that ever got to the Final Four in '98; we were a nine seed.  
I want to make sure that Coach Rizzotti is going to have her team ready to
play. The best thing about it is Rizzotti can't play, okay? Because if I had
to play her one-on-one, she would kill me. We're going to have our team ready.
It would mean so much for our area back there. We're in the business of
selling season tickets. Yes, I've been disappointed, but we still have a 33%
growth in season ticket sales. We're 8th in the league in attendance, okay?  
That doesn't satisfy me, not if you're Big 12 Champions. I want to go on to
that next level. We'll keep working. If I weren't a basketball coach, I could
be a damn good marketing director, because that's where you have to do it in
certain parts of the country.  
And, Robert, you have no idea how low basketball was in the state of
Connecticut before those teams that went to New Orleans in '92 and '93.
Basketball wasn't worth a flip, men or women, and look at what they're doing
at Connecticut now. Could it happen at Texas A&M? It's happening at Hartford
right now, and it's happening at a lot of other places. It can happen at Texas
A&M, and it's my job and these three girls up here to make sure it does
happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions?  
  
Q. Gary, along that line, Big 12 is No. 1 in RPI this year. Has it surpassed
the SEC in the best conference, and if so what makes it -- it's taken 5 years
to move up and get competitive. How do you see it?  
COACH BLAIR: There are a lot of great conferences out there, particularly the
SEC and the ACC and the Big 12. What makes our conference so good is there is
not a bottom. You've got Missouri on the bottom right now, because they're the
youngest team in the league, and they graduated everybody in two years. What
makes the league's strength is the continuity among the coaches within the
conference.  
In the late '90s the SEC by far was the best conference, because look at who
the head coaches were, and they were not going anywhere. Well, there has been
a whole lot of change since Moody left Alabama, Champie retired, Foster to
Ohio State, Sue passed away, Carol Ross is out of basketball, I left Arkansas
and somebody else is gone, too. Van. Okay?  
Well, you cannot just replace those players. It takes a while to get it there.
We're doing it because we have balance. Perhaps in the Big 12 we do not have
the great, great team, but we've got a lot of teams that can play great on a
certain night. Those teams can win national championships. That's what we have
right now. When we got 8 teams in there, when you look at Iowa State and Texas
at 7-9, they deserve to be in that NCAA tournament.  
And the SEC will get back once their coaches stay put for a few years and you
don't change 'em out as much as they're changing them out right now. The ACC
has gotten better and better, the Big East has gotten strong at the top and in
the middle, but they're pretty weak at the bottom. When you have 16 teams,
there has to be a bottom.  
So I love my league, but I love the SEC as well. But right now I think we have
the best balance. I'm not going to say we're the best conference, but I'm
definitely going to say we have the best balance and the most commitment from
administration of the 12 schools.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any closing comments?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I've already talked too long. I'm going to go back and watch
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, we'll see you all tomorrow.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: First of all, I want to give a line to Hartford. I thought
they played really well. They are a very strong team. There were a lot of
plays down the stretch and they are very physical, like I thought they would
be. And we got to give them a lot of credit because they really hung in there
and continued to fight and continued to play throughout the game and made some
plays down the stretch. They made a few more. It was a great game.  
First of all, we enjoyed the game. Coaching for me is fun. I do it because it
is fun. If I can't have fun, I can't get up in the morning. So for me it is
fun. Just the love I have for my team and my kids, how hard they compete, what
they bring to the table every day is just remarkable. It was one of those
things where when you look at Hartford on tape, you get ready to play them,
they keep coming at you and bringing that type of intensity. It is like
playing one of our teams in our conference.  
It was a great basketball game. It was fun to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Take us through the remaining minutes of the game, the emotions you were
feeling. Fantasia hits the big shot, and they come down and get the 3 from
Schaefer, the ups and downs of that.  
ERICA MORROW: I mean, it is really an up-and-down game. They made their plays;
we made our plays. Like Coach said, they made more than us. We got to be able
to stop them, and Schaefer comes out and hits a 3. You were thinking about
defense and now you got to turn it to offense. The emotions were up and down.
She is a great player and she made a great play down the stretch.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: (Indiscernible). It was a big shot. (Indiscernible). I
thought we played a great game. (Indiscernible).  
  
Q. (Question regarding game plan and shots not falling.)  
ERICA MORROW: We got the shots. They just weren't falling. They play great
defense and our shots just weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Fantasia, I guess the toughest thing about a loss like this is going from
complete anticipation to realizing that your career is done as a senior. How
are you feeling right now?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I had so much fun playing. I love all my teammates. I am
trying not to cry right now. It is my last game. I'm done. It's over.
(Indiscernible).  
  
Q. Both of you made all your free throws and you hung in the game despite
the spots weren't falling. Take us through your mind in a tournament game like
this and making all the big free throws.  
ERICA MORROW: Free throws are part of the game. That's what we needed to, I
guess, stay in the game, then that's what (indiscernible). It is just -- I
guess our minds were thinking how do we just stay in the game. As long as we
stay -- you know, when we were down two points or whatever it was, we still
had a chance. I think it is part of us being mentally tough and coming down
the stretch.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: (Indiscernible).  
  
Q. Fantasia, you said the emotions are with you right now. Can both student
athletes take a step back and appreciate what this program did this year, no
matter what happened today? You guys just had the most successful season in
school history.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I am blessed to be a part of this program. The coaching
staff, the University has been great with everything we've been through.
(Comment about offseason).  
My career has been awesome. I love (indiscernible).  
ERICA MORROW: I am proud to be a part of this team. A lot of people didn't
believe we would be here, even do half the things we did this year. I think we
came out and showed we are a great team and we are a great program. The
coaching staff and the players, everybody was great. This experience, we take
back the bad and learn from it and get better and get ready for next season.
Try to get back. We will be back next year.  
  
Q. How much was today resourceful? You were shooting 30% and still in the
game at the end of the game. Can you talk about shooting the ball from the
floor.  
ERICA MORROW: We're just not a shooting team. We have different players who do
different things. We have people who can shoot, go to the basket. I think it
is important that we played at the rim today. We showed them at the basket. It
was the NCAA tournament. No scholarships here. All teams are a great team. It
is the last 64 out of 300 and something. So I just think coming down the
stretch, you know, we tried to do what each individual player did nice and add
to our game.  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the student athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, I think -- I'm guessing if someone had covered you before the game
and said you would make 21 out of 41 free throws and out-rebound them by 14, I
suspect you would say I'm all in on that.  
COACH HILLSMAN: No question. What we try to do, we try to remain aggressive
and play at the rim. A lot of steps that you did did not (indiscernible).  
(Indiscernible). We tried to attack the rim and be aggressive. That's our
game, just trying to stay close to the basket. Trying to stay at the rim and
take the ball, that's what we do night in and night out, get to the basket.
That's part of our system, let our athletes get to the basket, Erica, Tasha
(indiscernible).  
  
Q. Coach, the end of the game situation where you guys were down, trying to
get the ball in the hole, just talk about that play that you were trying to
set up and did you think about calling a time-out to try and set a play up? Or
were you going in the goal there?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We practice this situation every day in practice. We don't
call time-outs in those situations. (Indiscernible) when the ball goes no
matter what the situation is. I am really nervous when we got the ball
inbounds. Why take a time-out? We practice these situations every day
(indiscernible). Get the ball out of the free-throw situation with 7 seconds
(indiscernible). They did a great job with Erica. They did a great job of
getting out (indiscernible). Nicole popped out and got the catch. We were in
good shape. We put time on the clock and run 7, 8, 9 sets straight through
with the same look. So I'm real comfortable not calling time-outs in a
situation.  
  
Q. What was the explanation for the technical foul?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Explanation was that I was too animated. Watching the tape, it
is very animated. What do you say to that? Somebody gives you a technical in
the coach's box, it is what it is. She did the best job she could.  
Even after that, with the type of game, you can't lose like that. The
basketball gods, they are going to do that to you, so I'm not going to worry
about it.  
  
Q. After the season ending like this, what do you tell your girls in the
locker room after this?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I tell them to make sure we will be back here. I told them we
will be back here and to be strong. (Indiscernible). That's pretty much what I
told them.  
  
Q. Coach Q, your freshmen came up big and made plays at the end of the game,
Tasha with the shot, Erica with the free throws. How proud are you with them
under that kind of pressure to make the plays they did, despite losing?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Very proud. We got a lot of building with this team. We have
to practice situations. We did what we had to do to get here. (Indiscernible)
be able to do that, you have to impact players who are unafraid. To be in
conference -- in the Big East conference, recruiting is so important.
(Indiscernible).  
You got to continue to get young kids that can compete at this level and
definitely have a future.  
  
Q. Coach, can you reflect on the seniors now that you have to say good-bye
to them? I think they have played together for ten years or something.  
COACH HILLSMAN: It is unbelievable. (Indiscernible) so obviously.  
She grew up into a fine young lady and turned into a great kid. Talking about
Fantasia, I'm sure, especially local media, you understand -- you know what
she's been through. To sit here night in and night out and face you guys
(indiscernible). She embraces opportunity. What can you say about her? You
think about the choice you have (indiscernible). To come back and be able to
compete at this level and to be aggressive. (Indiscernible).  
Hopefully you can continue to play, compete at this level.  
  
Q. You won a rebound and battled. How frustrating was it?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Frustrating that that wasn't the game plan. We got in foul
trouble. (Indiscernible).  
And, you know, down the stretch, the last play we were talking about taking
that shot. Are they going to have the guts and the courage to take that shot?
That was a tough shot to make. You miss it, you go home. You make it, you got
a chance to advance. Making a big shot down the stretch, that's in the
tournaments and that's what it's all about.  
She made a good adjustment and (indiscernible). She makes (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Take us through your emotions, knowing how close it came to you beating
them.  
COACH HILLSMAN: (Indiscernible) we have been in that situation before. Erica
made those shots in that situation. So we got to get the ball in her hand.  
This has been a really good experience and we've enjoyed being here. And I
have to give credit to Hartford. They are a tough team and playing and being
aggressive. I thought my kids really competed at this level of the situation
and this experience, to give us this opportunity. We would like to make it
next year.

### [Rae Rippetoe-Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18360)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student athletes, Monica Gibbs and Amanda Foster, and head
coach, Coach Rae Rippetoe-Blair.  
Opening comments, Coach?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Thank you. Give Texas A&M a lot of credit. I thought our
team was very prepared. We just couldn't handle the pressure.  
Going into the game, the one thing that we talked about as a team, we got to
handle the ball, and we had, I think, 30-something turnovers. You can't have
30 turnovers. I thought the rebounding -- and that's another area that we had
talked about the first half. Second half, we just -- we just did not do a good
job on the boards. I thought our kids played hard. I thought they worked hard.
I didn't think they gave up. They played until the end. Texas A&M is just
good.  
  
Q. Ladies, just talk about that pressure. What makes it so difficult? I know
you faced tough teams in nonconference, in power conferences. Talk about what
makes A &M different, their guarding you, either their man-to-man or their
back-court pressure.   
AMANDA FOSTER: I would say whenever -- they would kind of let you penetrate,
get in the lane, kind of bate you a little bit and then be out in the passing
lanes. We didn't step to the ball very well. Our passes weren't as sharp.
Since we were moving at a faster pace, it made it a little bit difficult to
pass the ball and see the floor as well. Lanes that are usually open weren't
as open, things like that.  
  
Q. Monica, maybe you could tell me, I noticed the first couple times down
the court and you and Micheaux were exchanging elbows a little bit. How much
more physical was this than what you usually encounter in the Southland
Conference? And did that make it tougher for y'all? Their defense, how tough
was it to operate against it?  
MONICA GIBBS: Well, in the Southland Conference, it is not as rough as we
probably played today. We had a lot more calls called on us if we actually
play in the Southland like that. Today was a big change.  
But I tried to use -- I am a fifth-year senior and I tried to use my
experience of playing that long and go with it and play as tough as them. If
they do so something, do it right back, like don't back down as a player. But
know your limit and don't hurt anybody in it. But just stand your ground,
basically.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student athletes? Thank you,
ladies. You may retire. Does anyone have any questions for Coach?  
  
Q. If you would, just assess your post-season as a good run to get here and
then just overall for the season.  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: It was a great run. Our last three games, we really
played well. To be honest with you, in our last three games, everybody has
sagged in their man defense, has not guarded Monica or not guarded Whitney. So
in most of the year, that's happened just because they have such a knack to
get to the basket. We probably have not played -- in fact, we have not played
as talented as a team or top ten team like Texas A&M.  
I knew the physicalness of it we would struggle a little bit with. And it is
just hard to simulate what they do in practice. We talked about it. We worked
on it. I thought we were very nervous, I'll be honest with you. I thought we
were very nervous coming out and we knew in those first five minutes things
can get away from you, and that's what happened. You try to tell your kids
that. They have never been here before. We've got a young team.  
I hope this experience -- it has been a great experience. Definitely not --
losing is not great, but it has been a great experience being here. Hopefully
we've told our young kids they will remember this, they will carry it over. No
matter who you are playing, you got to be ready. You got to handle the
pressure, and we just did not handle that pressure.  
Honestly, I'm little surprised. I knew they were that good, but I thought we
would handle the pressure a little bit better, the ball pressure.  
  
Q. From a coaching standpoint, how difficult a matchup is Gant out there
from the defensive end?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: She's tough. I mean, she can dribble. She is not going
to shoot the 3. We gave her a little space, and she was knocking down every
shot. We didn't do a very good job of guarding her, I'll be honest with you.
We got to block her out. She is just so talented. I thought she played an
excellent game today. I thought she was an excellent player. I think she is
one of their best players, and I am talking about all-around. She can guard on
the defensive end. She can get to the basket, the short jumper. She is just
very tough. It was definitely a very tough matchup for us.

ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Rachele Fitz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18376)

### [Brian Giorgis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18375)

### [Julianne Viani](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18423)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations, and your opening statement, please.  
COACH GIORGIS: Just a tremendous comeback by the kids. I can't say enough
about these two people here, being down 13 didn't look very good, but
obviously Julianne shot us back into it, and Rachele just kept doing her thing
that made her a MAC player of the year.  
The third component that really helped was really our bench. I think when
Elisa Caron and Sarah Smrdel and Lynzee Johnson went into the game, they gave
positive things, and a team that shoots the ball as well as DePaul does, to be
able to hold them without a field goal for about the last nine minutes, you
know, it's really a credit to the kids' defense.  
We had trouble in the first half rebounding, but I think we outrebounded them
in the second half. We just persevered.  
It's hard to express two years in a row now of being able to come in and beat
a BCS school, a little school like Marist. It's tremendous, and we're just
looking forward to Monday.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Hitting all those three-pointers in a row in the second half, how were
you feeling when you stepped beyond the arc?  
JULIANNE VIANI: I was feeling pretty confident. I missed a couple in the first
half, but I had to remember that my team needs me to step up. I was getting
open looks so I was just going with the flow and taking them.  
  
Q. There was one sequence in there where as Coach said, you've been
outrebounded so bad in the first half, and I think the ball was tipped around
three or four times and then tipped out of bounds to you and then got a three-
pointer on inbounds. Did that seem to be a turning point?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Absolutely. At halftime, Coach really told us we needed to
step up and rebound, so it was good. I think we stepped up our aggressiveness
in the second half, going after balls, not worrying so much. That was a big
turning point for the second half, I really believe that it helped us get
going.  
  
Q. Particularly early there in the second half as they were growing their
lead did you ever lose faith at all and think this isn't our night?  
JULIANNE VIANI: I didn't because before the game I had this supernatural faith
that we were going to win. It was God. I have to credit him, but I really
believed we were going to win the game. Before the game started I actually
prayed to him for the victory, so I thought that was cool.  
  
Q. So God was against another Catholic school?  
JULIANNE VIANI: He wasn't against them (laughing).  
  
Q. Rachele, did y'all have any idea you guys outscored them 32 to 2 over the
last 12 minutes? Could you talk about the frustration you could see on them?
Did you have any idea what kind of a roll you were on?  
RACHELE FITZ: As soon as Julianne started hitting shots and we got open looks
inside, we knew we were on a roll. I think they were getting really down on
themselves, and we got up by 9 and then 11 and 13, just kept going. I think
they were getting frustrated and they weren't focusing as much perhaps. But
it's really frustrating when that happens.  
  
Q. Rachele, can you contrast the first half to the second half both the
inside battle and the rebound points?  
RACHELE FITZ: It was a battle the whole time. They're extremely strong and
aggressive post players, and we knew that coming in. But like Julianne said,
and Coach commented in the locker room at halftime that we really do need to
step up our game and stop worrying about fouls and just go hard to offensive
and defensive boards, and I feel that we really stepped up the second half,
everyone, rebounding, the guards, boxing out, post boxing out and getting more
rebounds and getting the ball out, and I think that helped a lot. Then we
matched their aggressive and physicalness.  
  
Q. For either of the players, just having last year's experience behind you,
did that do anything to maybe calm your nerves as they increased their lead?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Absolutely, yeah. I think that gave us a lot of confidence
that we've been there before and we can do it again, so I really do believe
that did help us a lot coming into the game. I mean, we didn't have pressure,
either way, but it helped. It helped boost our confidence.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse these young ladies and thank them very much.
Questions for Coach Brian Giorgis?  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Julianne. Did you ever lose faith? Did you ever think,
well, maybe this isn't our night? Maybe this isn't our year?  
COACH GIORGIS: No, because there was enough time left. Actually the whole
thing that we tried to do was to convince the kids that we don't have any
12-point plays in our play book, and don't try to get it all back at once. So
basically we just -- when we got down 13, we basically just tried to break the
game down in pieces and say, guys, by the next media time-out let's get it in
single digits, by the next one after that let's try to get it to five or less,
and it seemed to work, although Julianne got hers in bunches. We ran a couple
plays for her to see if we could get her a look, and we were successful with
that. So then we ran a different play for her to get a look, and that worked.
She brought us back in the game, and that combined with finding Rachele inside
and really putting the clamps down defensively, I think we got them to play
the way that we were where they tried to rush everything back once we made the
run because they seemed to come off beyond the ball screens a little bit
faster, a little bit out of control or not under control in shots that we were
making earlier that didn't make.  
The thing that we were fortunate with is we didn't give up the second and
third opportunities. I think at halftime they had seven second-chance points
to our zero, and it ended up 9-9. We did a much better job, again, being a
little bit more aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. You've been with Julianne a long time --  
COACH GIORGIS: I've known her since about the fourth grade. Her dad is my
dentist and has been for a long time, so yeah, I've known the Vianis. I've
coached three of them, so you could say that.  
  
Q. Is it what you expect out of her?  
COACH GIORGIS: There is no greater person I know of as a person of faith than
that girl there. She never loses confidence in herself, and she just believes
and she believes it's going to be willed. I'm not going to argue with her.  
  
Q. How long do you want them to appreciate this and enjoy this? And then
when do you start practicing --  
COACH GIORGIS: No different than last year. We're going to enjoy this tonight.
We're going to go to church tomorrow and celebrate Easter, and then we'll get
going after either LSU or Jackson State tomorrow afternoon. I'm sure we've
already done a little bit of work beforehand just in case, and again, BCS
wins, they've been happening more frequent, but this is another big, huge,
important moment in our school's history, and we're going to enjoy it. We've
always enjoyed these things.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the possibility of facing the No. 2 LSU on
their home court tomorrow?  
COACH GIORGIS: Yeah, that's -- they're a tremendous team, but that's what you
wanted to do. When you see the brackets come out, you knew DePaul is just a
heck of a team. And to be honest with you, we didn't really think of LSU. We
didn't talk about LSU because our focus was on DePaul, and tomorrow our focus
will be on LSU, assuming they get there, and obviously they're one of the top
-- they're one of the seven or eight teams that people talk about that can win
a national championship, and they're playing on their court.  
What the heck, we'll go after it just like we do everything, and we'll have a
lot of fun doing it. And if they beat us we'll tip our hats to them and we'll
go home and say it's a tremendous season. If we're fortunate enough to play,
have the type of comeback and shoot the ball like we did in the second half
and pull out another miracle, it's not Palo Alto, but we're game for it. We go
about things. No one expects the little 4,000 school to do much, and we'll
just go after them. We've played Tennessee, Duke, Maryland, Ohio State, we've
played a lot of the big schools, and yeah, we've lost to them, too, but we'll
go after them the way we try to go after everybody.  
Our little theme in the locker room has been the midge. We've got a lot of
people from Cleveland including myself, and the midge is that little bug that
landed on Joba Chamberlain during the Yankees' run. That's what we want to be.
We want to be midges. That doesn't mean we're going to win things, but we want
to be pests. That's the way we've gone about the NCAA Tournament last year,
this year. We just want to be pests. We aren't the most athletic team out
there. As you could see today we aren't the most physical team, we just want
to be pests. If it's good enough to win, great. If it's not, we've had a heck
of a year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Giorgis, thanks very much. We'll see you at tomorrow
afternoon's press conference.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [LaSharee Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18393)

### [Denise Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18389)

### [Erica Trahan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18392)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate LSU and Coach
Chancellor for winning the game today. We played a great basketball team, and
I thought for our team, our young ladies, we had a game plan but we didn't
execute our game plan, so I have to give LSU credit. They talked about their
sticky defense and that's what they did tonight. They disrupted our offense
and didn't allow us to execute our offense.  
But I'm so proud of these young ladies that they competed till the end.  
  
Q. LaSharee, could you sum up the season a little bit?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: We had a great season. I mean, we had our highs, we had
our lows. We made -- we won our conference championship tournament, which was
one of our main goals from the getgo. We competed all season and never gave
up, kept our heads high. And again, this was a good experience. So as far as
our season went, I think it went great. We stuck together as a team, we grew
together and made friendships. That's all you can ask for, isn't it?  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk a little bit about trying to get things going
inside offensively?  
ERICA TRAHAN: Yes. All I know is my shot wasn't falling. I was rushing it
instead of reversing the ball, and I was trying to get going but I couldn't.
LaSharee is a great player, and her presence made me adjust my shot, but I
just never could get the shot to fall. But once again, you have these nights
that your shot don't fall, and you have to go to something else that can help
the team out. And that's what I tried to do.  
  
Q. You talk about your team having a game plan when you came into the game
tonight. How did you want to attack LSU defensively and stop them defensively
and how did you want to attack them offensively?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: Defensively we were just trying to limit the touches.
They're a great basketball team. You're not going to stop them altogether, but
we were just trying to limit some of the touches to some of the leading
scorers. We figured if we did that we could stay in this game, so that was one
of the game plans.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You ladies are excused. We appreciate your
participation in the post-game press conference. Coach, it's your turn now.
Any questions for Coach Taylor from the media?  
  
Q. If you could address the same thing about the offense, about the game
plan.  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, that game plan was to sag in and try to limit Sylvia's
touches and also Chaney's, the two main scorers, so we played a match-up and
tried to sag in and double-down on her and limit her touches.  
Offensively we wanted to spread the floor, and whoever she was guarding, try
to pull her out, so we ran a four-up set, but their defense kind of disrupted
us at the point of opposition, so we were just kind of out of synch
offensively. But that was the strategy, to limit her touches and of course to
contain Chaney.  
  
Q. At some point Jackson State is going to win an NCAA Tournament game. How
hard is it to break through? It's a great challenge. If you go back through
the tournament book and look at the match-ups, they're tough draws. How hard
is it to, I guess, break through and to get the respect to break through and
maybe get a little bit better draw?  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, great players make great programs, so it starts there.
You've got to keep recruiting and get one or two great players that can really
change your season. I agree with you that it's going to happen. If you look on
the men's side, they're closing that gap, and I'm hoping one day that it
happens on the women's side.  
But it is a challenge, and we also talked with the girls about believing and
coming out. It's a 40-minute game, and on any given night anybody can win. But
I think you just have to keep working and of course winners make programs, so
you've got to keep recruiting and hope that the administration keeps giving
you more resources in order to go out and get those players.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You had a wonderful season. Best wishes to
you and your student athletes next year.

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought it was a good game except we just got
characteristically turning the ball over more than we've turned the ball over
all year. For some reason we turned the ball over -- if I was going to give a
game ball out tonight I would have given it out to Mesha Williams. I thought
she was pretty good. 14 points, 7 rebounds and played extremely well, and we
are pleased with tonight's win.  
  
Q. For Sylvia, this was one of the lowest scoring games in NCAA history by
any team. Talk about the pride you guys take in playing defense, and did you
do anything special? Looked like the typical way you guys played defense. Was
there anything different?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't think it's anything that was different about it
tonight. I think Erica got us through because our defense style were her, and
once we seen her get things going, she makes it much easier for everybody else
to play defense.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Sylvia, just basic defense, Erica gets us started
on defense and just came out and played good defense.  
  
Q. Sylvia, could you talk about Mesha tonight and just having her in there
with you? What kind of game does that open up for you?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Mesha, the name speaks for itself. She's aggressive, she's
going to get you points. She's going to rebound the ball and she's going to
play great defense. That's something we see every day. Mesha has to guard me
every day. She makes me better, I make her better. But just to have her on the
floor at the same time, she makes things quite easy for me when I'm in the
game. So thanks to Mesha.  
  
Q. Erica, you played such good defense. What are some of the keys? What do
you try to do especially starting the game to disrupt the other team's
offense?  
ERICA WHITE: Just try to get ahead on the ball and try to make sure that their
point guard doesn't get comfortable and that she's not able to run her team's
offense. Just try to get deflections. When my teammates see me doing that, I
think they get energy from it, so you just try to get a hand on the ball.  
  
Q. Sylvia, how do you put a game like this into context? Obviously the games
are going to get tougher down the road. You guys have a chance to make history
with a fifth straight Final Four, which is looking down the road, but how do
you put this into context?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: You just come out and you play to the best of your ability.
It's not about the opponent, who you're playing. You've just got to come out
and play the way LSU is capable of playing, and that's something we did in the
second half. The first half wasn't as good, but you've just got to put things
into perspective and think about the long run.  
  
Q. For the players, Coach Chancellor kind of touched on the fact that he
wasn't pleased with the turnovers for this game. What's y'all's take?
Obviously you dominated Jackson State, but what is y'all's take on how you
played tonight?  
ERICA WHITE: Looking at the stat sheet that my coach has, we turned the ball
over 22 times. I cannot believe we turned the ball over that much. I take a
lot of responsibility for that because as the point guard it starts with me.
My take on the game is just -- that's 22 possessions that we didn't get a
shot, and it's 22 opportunities that we didn't get to score, and it's
something that we definitely have to clean up, and that starts with me.  
But 22 turnovers, I'm shocked to see that on that paper.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Like she said, 22 turnovers, possessions that we could have
got a shot out of, and I had a few that I shouldn't have had. But we'll clean
it up tomorrow in practice and just get ready to play on Monday.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Me personally, I'm pretty sure we can clean it up. We have
time. I'm pretty sure coaches will do a great job in practice tomorrow
cleaning it up.  
THE MODERATOR: The student athletes are excused. Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Talk about Mesha, I guess. You had said earlier in the year you should
have played her more. Are you kind of gearing her up for this run here?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought that -- usually in the two weeks between the SEC
Tournament and the NCAAs, I always try to evaluate some things I think I would
have done different. So tonight I was determined to get her in earlier. She
had 14 points and seven rebounds, which I thought was unbelievable. She was
just inspiring.  
When I said it, I don't wish but two games I'd have played her more. We're
going to make sure she gets in the game because she can just rebound the ball.
I thought tonight we were pretty dominant rebounding. I thought our field goal
percentage was good. We just were really just very careless with the ball,
which is uncharacteristic of LSU. We only averaged 12 turnovers all year.  
We shot 50 percent, held them to 32 points. They shot 23.1 percent. That's
pretty good.  
  
Q. What do you see in Marist? I know you watched a little bit of the game
tonight. What do you think you can do to pose a problem for LSU?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Just how tough they are mentally. They were down 11 and I
thought they were in trouble. By the time I turned back around, they went from
down 11 to up about 10, and they did it just because they're so tough. They
don't ever give up. They play hard. Those two kids inside are tough. Their
guards are tough. This is just a tough team. This is a team that, if I'm not
mistaken, I think they beat Ohio State to go to the Sweet 16 last year. I
wasn't in college coaching but I think that's right, so you'd have to look
that up. This is a team that's won 32 games this year. I don't care who they
played, 32 games is still 32 games. They've got a nice team.  
They beat a good team in DePaul. I thought DePaul was the best 10th seed in
the country. They beat them pretty good.  
  
Q. How did the time affect you?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: The time didn't affect me at all because after practice
today I went home, and because I was feeling bad, I rested most of the day. I
would have been ready by the time I got here tonight.  
The New York Times guy was here, and I told him if Marist won the game that we
would play at 6:00. You know why? Because they're out there in New York and I
thought they wanted all them New York people to see that game at 7:00 Eastern.
I thought if DePaul won we'd play at 8:30. That's good. I'd like to play at
12:00 in the daytime. Waiting on the game drives you nuts.  
  
Q. You were talking about making changes in the offense when you came here,
but you didn't want to go much to the defense. Talk about what kind of defense
you found when you came here and what makes them play so well, that sort of
thing?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's the most amazing defensive basketball team I've ever
seen. We do everything fundamentally sound.  
When I say this, when I see a men's game, I say, man, if they would have had
Bob Starkey they would have won the game. There's so many things at LSU that
is so sound, I don't want to change anything. We cut cutters and we double the
ball and we do everything defensively sound without gambling a lot. That's why
we gave up 32 points tonight. We led the country in defense this year for
however many years in a row. We are really good defensive.  
Our rebounding has gotten better. I want to say this, I am amazed how good our
defense is when you consider our rebounding is one little bit above average.
It's not average, it's a little better than average, but it's not good. But
tonight it was.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Chancellor.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Allie Quigley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18383)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bruno, your opening statement, please.  
COACH BRUNO: DePaul won 70 percent of the basketball game, but it was the
wrong 70 percent, and Marist won 30 percent of the game, and it was the right
30 percent. The reason we got beat tonight was because Marist was tougher,
smarter and better. The second reason, the same basketball team that
outrebounded Marist 30 to 15 at halftime got outrebounded 20 to 14 in the
second half. Again, I just want to make sure that this Marist team, I think
the nation understands how good they are.  
Believe me, I believed how good they were before we played this game tonight.
If our basketball team is good enough to be able to be up 11 at the 11-minute
media timeout, then we should be good enough to finish the basketball game.
But the reason we didn't was because, again, at that timeout -- let's just ask
questions and I'll go there later. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Allie, seems like everything was going you guys' way. Do you have any
idea what kind of happened to flip the switch? And what was it like out there
for you?  
ALLIE QUIGLEY: Yeah, definitely the momentum changed. I think that we just
didn't guard them. We didn't get rebounds and they did a pretty good job of
everything basically, shooting. Viani went off, and defensive rebounding, and
once again, they were better off.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the students and thank them very much. Coach,
would you like to continue your discussion and then we'll ask whether there
are any questions from the group?  
COACH BRUNO: I mean, when you ask me to continue the discussion, the 11-minute
timeout, I remember it like it was a second ago, and we knew -- we stated to
our team that Coach is going to take over the game with No. 12, and No. 3,
Viani is going to take over the game on her own. These are issues that we had
thought we had prepared for, and that's exactly what happened at that moment.
Fitz and Viani took over the game, and we had no answers for them.  
Again, I'm very -- I'm very irritated about the lack of -- no, I'm so happy
for Marist. They're just a great group of young women.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. You had a great season, and best
wishes for next year.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us the head coach of the victorious Hartford Hawks
and three student athletes, Lisa Etienne, Erica Beverly, and MaryLynne
Schaefer. Coach Jennifer Rizzotti?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Obviously we're thrilled with the win today. Beating Syracuse
is no easy task. I think they are a phenomenal team. They've had a great
season, and they made us really work for this one. But I'm just pleased with
the way our kids toughed it out, overcame adversity. Nothing really came easy
for us tonight. Wouldn't say we shot the ball great, never really got our
post-game going, and we didn't get to the free-throw line a lot. But I thought
that we toughed it out.  
We relied on what we have been relying on all year, and that's our defense.
Our kids were phenomenal. I told them in the locker room we proved we're more
than just a one-man show and we're also more than just a post show because I
thought our guards were great on both ends of the floor today.  
  
Q. Erica, can you just talk about the rebounding inside and how difficult
that was for you to even get rebounds tonight.  
ERICA BEVERLY: It was very difficult. They're very strong. We knew that they
were going to be pushing and hustling to get those rebounds because they have
about three players who have, like, 100 rebounds for the year, which is a big
deal.  
I just toughed it out with my teammates, got some battle scars over here a
little bit. Tried to get the rebounds.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, just take us through that last possession when you hit the
shot and what was going through your head going into it.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: It was plays we have drawn up in practice a lot,
situations. And I was supposed to come off and see the post players. When I
came I felt like they were guarded, so I just didn't really think about it and
I shot it. I thought I had an open look and the thing went in, so ...
(laughter).  
  
Q. MaryLynne, the last time when you won a game, what was the last shot
like?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I don't think I ever have.  
  
Q. High school game or anything?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: No, Not in that situation with me getting the shot, I
don't recall.  
  
Q. You see big shots all the time in the NCAA tournament. Do you think this
is something -- it just happened, I know. Could this be something you think of
in the future?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I think when you are younger you think about it, a
potential game-winner shot. It is just a great feeling. And it comes down to a
team effort, like, just battling it out throughout, so ...  
  
Q. I guess, MaryLynne, to lose Danielle 6 minutes to go, you must have to,
the team, dig deep.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: Yeah, we did. It is another thing to -- yeah, we did. It
is one thing to overcome adversity when you have one of your top scorers going
to the bench, fouling out. We just knew we needed to come together. It is
something we've been able to do all season when something like that has
happened with one of our players. And it just shows the strength of our team,
that we're able to push through and win the game, so ...  
  
Q. Erica, you were talking about Syracuse being a physical team. Texas A &M
looks even more physical. I know you are just now turning the page. How much
are you and the team going to have to turn it up a notch to match the
defensive intensity tomorrow?   
ERICA BEVERLY: I thought we turned it up here. As you can see, we came out
with the victory. I don't know. We just have to dig more deeper. I don't know.
We are going to stick to our defense like we always have. Offense will come,
like Coach said. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Lisa, it seemed like a very tough, hard-fought, physical game. How did it
rate with the games you have had to play this year?  
LISA ETIENNE: It is definitely in the top two, three. It was very physical out
there. Like Erica said, we came out with a victory, so it was worth it. I
think if you are in NCAA and it is not like this, then you are not in a NCAA
tournament. So it was good.  
  
Q. Lisa, you guys haven't lost since December 12th. Talk about what it's
like to be on a team like that. What do you get from getting a winning
streak?  
LISA ETIENNE: We haven't lost since when? You are thinking about Marist. We
ended Marist's winning streak on December 12th.  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to thank the student athletes for their
participation in the press conference.  
Any questions for head coach Jennifer Rizzotti?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: No? Okay. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, you got a lot of experience sitting in that chair. What did you
tell the players after the game about coming out and winning the game at a
NCAA tournament?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I just talked to them about two main things was overcoming
adversity, that it was a 40-minute basketball game and I thought they did a
great job of keeping their poise in a game where there was times where it
didn't seem like anything was going our way. We found a way to make shots. We
found a way to get stops and that was number one.  
The other thing I said was that we're a balanced team. Talk a lot about our
big three, Diana, Erica, and Danielle. And sometimes they forget. I think
Lisa, MaryLynne and Jamie are underrated. MaryLynne and Jamie kept Erica
Morrow and Chandrea Jones to 8 for 27 from the floor. I would say that's some
pretty good defense. I think those two guys were pretty key to our success
tonight.  
Obviously MaryLynne scored a lot of points. I thought it was their focus on
defense. So I was proud of how they overcame adversity. When they took away
our post game, we found a way to win anyway.  
  
Q. Coach, were you surprised at all at the end of the game the way Syracuse
went to the goal to try to take the lead back, with Nicole not calling a time-
out and just aggressively going for it at the end of the game?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah. I think it's such a hard call as a coach, you know. Any
of us in that position, you feel like if you had called a time-out, maybe the
other team will change their defense. If you don't call a time-out and you
don't score, it is like your fault for not setting something up. And it is
just tough and you just got to trust in your decision.  
I think Nicole Michael is their most experienced player. She has been in a
Syracuse uniform the longest. I felt like she had success driving to the
basket and getting fouled. I thought they were aggressive and got the shot
they wanted. We were fortunate they missed and able to pull down the rebound.  
That was kind of her game plan the whole game, was they weren't out there to
shoot a ton of 3s, they were looking to really attack off the dribble. And
they stuck to that right to the end.  
  
Q. It seemed like if you could have kept them off the free-throw line you
would have won this game easily. Did you expect them to get that many points
from the free-throw line? Why do you think that was happening? What do you
tell your team when you see them making 90%, shot after shot?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It is definitely tough to sit back and watch other teams
shooting a lot of free throws and your team isn't. And sometimes, you know,
you think, well, we're settling. I felt we went inside and trying to be
aggressive.  
They're just really tough to guard off the dribble. You don't face a lot of
teams that have, you know, kids like Erica Morrow, Chandrea Jones, and Nicole
Michael at the 2, 3, and 4 that can all shoot it well from the three-point
line and put it on the floor. And they were killing us on the glass. I don't
know that we've ever gotten up by 14 with this group. Usually that's one of
our strengths. They just had an attack mentality from the beginning. I thought
our kids did a good job of hanging tough and not allowing their made free
throws to affect us.  
We just countered them with made baskets, and that's what we have to do in
that situation. There are things you can control and things you can't. You
can't control the way they call fouls; you just have to overcome it and not
allow it to really deflate you at all. And I thought our kids kept their poise
pretty well in that situation.  
  
Q. You called a time-out before you got the three-pointer. What do you want
to do in that time-out? I'm sure you probably didn't want to lose on any
options. So what was coming to you when you saw it going up?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: The point of the play was actually to run MaryLynne out as not
a decoy but to pay attention to her. And when they came out on her from the
bottom of the zone, we had Diana and Erica on that same side. And so we said
to her if they come out from the bottom, hit Erica in the short corner so we
can drive; if they come out from the middle, hit Diana and she can attack to
the middle. That was kind of the point of the play, was to get it to our post
players. And it was the first time we had run that baseline runner set, and I
think it threw them off guard. So they didn't quite shift everybody.  
Again, you are worrying a lot about Diana and Erica because they are usually
our leading scorers. And, you know, Jamie is right there on the wing with
MaryLynne. You don't want to leave her. I think MaryLynne made a good decision
of shooting that ball. MaryLynne is not afraid of anything. I will take her
shooting free throws, making 3s, defending the other team's best player any
day, because that kid -- she has a lot of courage and plays with no fear.  
  
Q. You guys held Nicole Michael without a field goal. You shut down Chandrea
Jones. You had defensive intensity earlier. What was it with those two that
you did defensively around them?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, you know, with Nicole Michael, we put Erica Beverly on
her. Like, that's our defensive stopper. Whenever we have a post player, we
really want to focus on Erica gets the call. And she did a phenomenal job. She
played 32 minutes, which is a lot of minutes for Erica, and I thought she was
great defensively.  
And then our goal with Chandrea was to make her shoot it over us. We knew she
had a lot of ability with the ball in her hands. We just said if she pulled
back and shoots 3s or pull-up jumpers and she makes them, we will have to live
with that. Let's try to make her take tough shots so we don't get ourselves
out of rebounding position and we kind of force her to not really get any easy
looks. And, again, Jamie had a charge on that one. She did a phenomenal job.
And I know it expended a lot of energy for her on the offensive end, but it
was certainly worth it because that's as good a defense as I have seen anyone
play on her. I know she had 12 points and 12 rebounds, but you are right, she
did have to work for everything she got.  
  
Q. What does it take for a school like Hartford to continue with opponents
with resources like a Syracuse? Do you believe that the stability you have
brought along to the program, how much does that help you in recruiting and
building this program?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It helps a lot. Kids want to play in the NCAA tournament. So
when you can sell that as a point that you have and other teams don't in your
area, it's a pretty big deal. And I think our coaching staff has to work
pretty hard to find players that will allow us to keep at this level, but also
aren't getting recruited per se by a St. John's or Syracuse. Because a lot of
kids want to go to a big main conference.  
There are a lot of good players out there. We try to work really hard to find
the ones. Erica Beverly and Diana Delva, those two kids weren't recruited by a
lot of people and they were as good as any post player on the floor today.  
I think you got to get tough kids. You got to get winners and you got to get
them to buy into it. I tell them from day one that I know how to win. I have
done it as player and I have done it as a coach. If you do ask, I promise you
we will be happy at the end of the year. And these kids never doubt it for a
second. They do everything we ask. They play really hard, as you can see, and
we don't worry about what resources we have.  
Fortunately we are at a school that has a lot of great support from the
administration. It is not necessarily always about money. Sometimes it is just
about having people care about women's basketball and give you what you need
to continue to be successful and fly their ADs and presidents and everybody
from the school down to support us. That means a lot to us and I know our kids
really appreciate that as well.  
  
Q. Good first half from some of the freshmen, Silvia and Hollins as well.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: They've come a long way. I think a couple months ago we
couldn't really play our freshmen. We were playing Virginia and some of the
bigger-named schools. They really worked hard to find a way to help us and
give us minutes. I know Mary only played 2 minutes, but her 3 was pretty big.
And just the fact that I had the confidence to put her in the game after the
way she's played over the last month and a half and the way she's practiced, I
knew I could go to her for a little bit.  
And then Jonyce was ready. She was ready all week. She was aggressive in
practice. She was looking forward to the pressure. Defensively, she's been
dynamite in the last couple games we've had. So I have no qualms about putting
her in the game. Obviously you worry a little bit about experience. The only
way they are going to get experience for the next time is to play them now.
And I'm really proud of how they responded.  
  
Q. You have won a lot of NCAA tournaments. What does one win mean for your
program? Not saying you are not going to win Monday, but just getting this one
win, what does it mean?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It is a big deal. It is kind of like going to a Final Four at
a big school like UConn. It is not winning the national championship, but it's
like getting to that next level.  
And it means a lot to our kids that over the last three years now we've
advanced to the second round twice. And knowing that they can do it, knowing
that it's not just a fluke, knowing that we are able to compete at this level,
it means a lot, it really does. I think building forward, when Danielle and
Courtney and Jamie leave, this team is going to have a lot to build on for the
future.  
You know, they were excited. I mean, they were really, really happy. They're
happy in the locker room. They were happy at the end of the game. They know
they worked hard. The best thing about it, they're excited about Monday. They
know Texas A&M is really good, but just having the opportunity to play them
for a chance to win the Sweet 16, I mean, you can't ask for anything more when
you are a college player.  
There are very few teams that have the ability to win a national championship,
and then there is very few teams that I think will have a chance to make it to
the Sweet 16. We are 40 minutes away from that. As hard as it's going to be,
still the opportunity is in front of us.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, you have the floor, sir.  
COACH BLAIR: First, I would like to thank the media for being here.  
Way back in the days when I was at LA Tech, they used to have fashion editors
cover us when we'd go to New York City, and look at the media now. You're here
because you want to. You didn't draw the short end of the stick. You're here
because of women's basketball. That's what makes all of this worthwhile.  
We were ready to play today. The best motivation we had was watching the men's
tournaments and watching the upsets or the near upsets. When Duke almost got
upset, when Connecticut did get upset and all of a sudden you have to give
your opponent credit, give your opponent credit, we have been in that league
before so I know what the Southland is all about and it is a very good
basketball league. This was their first time to the dance, and we wanted to
make sure the first ten minutes was played under our pressure defense and our
press and then get out of it and see where we are.  
23 turnovers forced in the first half and a lot of them are unforced. I think
UTA showed what they could do in the second half because it was an even ball
game in the second half. But when you're the 2 seed, you cannot be nonchalant
when a game starts. You have to be ready to play. And our coaching staff did a
very good job because we respected UTSA. We respected their dribble drive. We
respected 33 and 23. We respected what they did.  
So defense keys us for easy shots. We were able to give the ball to Danielle
Gant early because we figured they would take Starks away, and they were
trying, but then all of a sudden Gant was able to get loose. And there is not
too many 5' 10 kids -- forget what the media program says. She's 5' 10", not
5' 11". There are not too many 5' 10" kids that can play all over the floor
like her.  
It was a good victory. We were able to rest a lot of kids, be able to get my
bench. It feels good to finally win a game in the LSU's gym and not have to
play them. I have been on the losing end against LSU a few times.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how frustrating it must have been for them and, I
guess, just the aggressive nature of your defensive intensity right off the
start?  
TAKIA STARKS: In our pregame talk, we just talked about putting the pressure
on, like Coach said. In a game like this in the first round you don't want to
come out playing nonchalant. We wanted to put the pressure on early with our
press. They committed turnovers, and just really upped our game on our
defense.  
  
Q. Danielle, is this the way you typically play defense? What's your mind-
set? What's your basic philosophy you are trying to do? Looks like you get a
lot of turnovers and just trying to be more physical than the other team?  
DANIELLE GANT: Yes. This is the way we like to play in the Big 12 where we
play aggressive defense, and that's what we wanted to bring to this tournament
today. Like Takia said in the pregame talk, defense was our main focus, and I
think that's what we came out to do today.  
  
Q. Takia, what's it feel like to be on this winning streak you're on right
now? What kind of rush has it been for you guys?  
TAKIA STARKS: Really, we are just trying to stay humble and take each game as
each game and not really looking forward to the next game. Just handing out
our business game by game and just staying focused in our game plans and just
staying with our principles on defense.  
When we play defense, how we did today, we're going to win a lot more games,
and hopefully we'll make it far in the tournament this year. That's our goal.  
  
Q. Morenike, can you talk a little bit about playing in your home state and
what that was like for you today. Do you have any family that came down from
Shreveport?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Yes, I have an uncle and a lot more relatives that live
here in Baton Rouge. My mother was able to make it from Dallas and the rest of
my family from Shreveport.  
A lot of my fans that also followed me throughout high school were able to
make it down. It means a lot to come back home and play in front of my family.
Haven't had the chance to, but I'm glad that we just happened to come back
home. So it meant a lot to me.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you just talk about the different feel for that game as
opposed to two years ago, TCU, and last year, UTA. Can you just talk about
when you take to court what's different about this year?  
TAKIA STARKS: Well, I think the main thing -- Coach addressed this before we
came here to the media room -- that two years ago we were excited to be there.
We were just excited to make it and advance into the NCAA tournament. This
year we came out, we have a lot more experience. We've been there. We've been
through the wars. The Big 12 has prepared us well for this tournament. And I
think they saw this tonight, just how tough we played defense and it just
creates so much opportunity for us on offense.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you just take us through that one play that kind of began
when you went plowing into the press table, almost into the gate there and
ended up with the lay-up? Just take us through what was going through your
mind on that play.  
DANIELLE GANT: Well, Coach Schaeffer, our defensive coach, was telling me to
get up the line because I was letting my girl catch the ball every time down
the floor. I just got up the line and knocked it out of bounds and flew over
the table. Got back up and my teammate passed me the ball, and so I thought
about going to the hole, and I went to the hole.  
  
Q. Danielle, wanted to ask you about that play in particular. Was that
something that comes from your preparation in defense, the way that y'all
practice and play, that you got to make a play like that? And, also, Coach
Blair yesterday talked about the restaurants y'all been to so far. Now you got
a couple more days here. Do y'all have a preference what you'd like to have?  
DANIELLE GANT: Seafood, shrimp gumbo, and little things like that.  
COACH BLAIR: Mike Anderson's tonight.  
DANIELLE GANT: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. The play when you went into the table and all, is that something that --
you are up 38-10 at that point. What makes you play that intense with a game,
you know, already in hand? Is that personal? Is that something that's grilled
into you in practice or what?  
DANIELLE GANT: That's drilled into us in practice every day. Just getting up
the line and pressure defense is what we really look at in defense and
practice, just getting up the line and denying the girl the ball.  
  
Q. Danielle, first of all, how tall are you? Second --  
DANIELLE GANT: 5' 11".  
  
Q. Now you've gone up an inch. Talk a little bit about your position
offensively, what would you consider yourself and then kind of explain your
role in the offense.  
DANIELLE GANT: I am just a versatile player. I can play the 1, 2, 3, 4, maybe
the 5. It is just great being my height and being able to play different
positions, being aggressive on the 3 position and the 4 position, just being
able to go inside with the tall players and make great shots.  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the student athletes now.  
Coach Blair, any other comments?  
COACH BLAIR: Monica Gibbs, very, very good player. Give her a lot of credit.
She's very good. She's hard to defend. And if she adds that good outside shot
to go with everything else she has, she'll be a Southland Conference player of
the year in years to come, if she's not this year.  
Reado and Micheaux played very well. Even though you don't see it on the box,
what we do to free up our outside game all starts with the inside gains, with
their screens in the offensive boards. They do so many little things, hedge
and screens. What UTSA does a great job of is dribble penetration, but we did
a good job of hedging their high-low, and particularly in the first half.
Reado is going to jump out. We can recover back and we can get A'Quo through,
and that's the key to our defense.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk a little bit about Danielle's role in the offense and
how it's evolved where injuries have played a factor in her playing different
spots and helping her grow her game.  
COACH BLAIR: We're a very unselfish basketball team. I think Danielle had
maybe 14 or 16 in the first half. And all of a sudden she's not going to say,
boy, I'm going to go for my career high. We ran the first play of the game for
her, a little UCLA cut on the post-up. We missed it, but then we scored on the
second or third option off of it.  
What we want to do is make sure they don't know how to prepare for us. Who are
you going to stop? We've got a lot of different weapons. You can bring
Morenike off the bench, and she was in the game for about 5 seconds and hit
the most beautiful 3 you've ever seen. Not too many kids can do that.  
But Danielle, you can play her at the 4 and you can post her up, which next
year we'll probably play her at the 4 like we did her freshman year a lot
because we've got Tyra White who will be healthy next year and they will play
a lot of 2-3. We're just going to move her all over the court.  
She is definitely a next-level player. If I am a WNBA team, I am just
drooling, waiting for a 5' 10" kid that can play the 2, 3, or 4. Hopefully
next year we will play the three-point game to her repertoire. She shoots it
in practice. We just have a little bit of a yellow light on her during ball
games.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how defense was the key. But only giving up 16
points in the first half, does that even exceed your expectations of what you
wanted out of this morning?  
COACH BLAIR: We were just -- we were just hooked up, baby. We were wired. When
you go in as a coach and realize there's never been a 15 seed beat a 2 seed, I
didn't want to be an asterisk, okay, like Stanford was a couple years ago when
we watched it firsthand ourselves because we had the winner of that game. We
had our team fired up. And you also got to understand, I'm a little slow
drawl. You know me very well.  
But I've got a guy on a different voltage over there next to me, Coach
Schaeffer. I can't keep him down. We're in the second half in time-outs and I
thought we were 20 behind because he's wired because we expect perfection. If
you practice perfect, you got a better chance of playing perfect.  
And we don't have a Candace Parker. Okay? We've got to do it a different way.
We don't have a Sylvia Fowles. We do it a different way. My little miniature
Danielle Gant and Takia Starks, they're pretty good imitations.  
So we have to do it by doing everything we do perfect. And when we don't do
it, they're going to hear about it.  
  
Q. What's it mean going into the next round to be able to sit your starters
basically the last ten minutes and also the reward for those substitutes
coming?  
COACH BLAIR: They've practiced so hard. I cannot remember the last game we
had. It had to have been November that we had a game like that. Those kids
work so hard and they get their shots. I was glad to see Buchanan get very
active. She was missing shots early because she was double-teamed, should have
passed out. But she was active.  
It was great to see Maryann Baker come in and do what she did. All of a sudden
we were running a little circle offense, and that's a three-point play. Hit
the cutter and she kept hitting the cutter. I said don't hit the cutter, wait
for the next screen. We still scored off of both of them.  
Those kids have waited their turn, and they realize that top six is very
special. It is like looking at LSU with nine seniors, and the same five have
started all year. They've earned that right.  
This is what my six have done. And if you want to come to A&M, you might have
to wait in line because we've got some very good players that are already in
place. And that's what kids want to do. They want to play with kids that are
fun. 25 minutes is the most anybody played in the game. And Morenike had 19
and 21 minutes. So it's not bad. We were able to rest, get a little bit of
Mike Anderson's tonight. We'll sit there and watch this ball game here, and
then we will go in to a little hole and get prepared for the game. All right?
We want to make sure that we're not sitting there going to Disneyland or
something like that.  
The first two years that was nice. It's winning time right now, and we got to
figure a way to beat one of these two teams that's fixing to be in here.  
  
Q. Coach, you said in Kansas City, I think your exact words, we need to play
Saturday, we don't need to wait until Sunday. You are on this roll 13 out of
14. Do you still have a sense of you wonder what's out there? Do you worry
about taking it from a Big 12 tournament to the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: You worry. You do not leave a single stone unturned. We had to
play this game like we were playing a Big 12 opponent. As a result, you can
see we were a little bit larger, a little bit more physical, and they were not
used to this type of pressure in their league. We were able to put the
pressure on, force 23 turnovers, ball game.  
Second half, they played well. But we didn't have the same intensity or the
same pressure and we were playing a lot of kids.  
This team is ready -- since we've never been there before, Robert, I mean,
Sweet 16 would be great. Second round is damn good. Okay? Second round is
good. And I can't wait to see what shirt you are going to wear in the next
round, because that's a blockbuster right there.  
But we're hungry. We hope you're hungry. We hope you brought a few more shirts
because we plan on dancing a while.  
By the way, my sister thought you were good. She is back home in Dallas and
she reads every one of them. When Brian doesn't write anything good, she lets
me know.  
  
Q. Could you just take us through -- I guess through a big-picture
standpoint, when did the defense kick in? It was your trademark, but early in
the season it wasn't there. What kind of jump-started things for you?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we had a lackadaisical off season. We had gone to Europe
the year before. We had played a lot of basketball. We sent kids to USA
basketball. We gave them a lot of time off during the summer. They didn't come
back in the best possible shape, or at least Aggie shape. There is no fat on
us.  
There is a difference between shape and being able to play the defense that we
want to play. And I think it just took a while. And the best thing that could
happen to us was probably those four losses. You get a little humble pie
early, you get hungry and you get better.  
And the biggest thing about this team is every ball game in February and
March, including the Oklahoma loss, we've gotten better. A lot of teams win
ball games, but we've gotten better and that's what's exciting as a coach.  
It is like being a teacher in the classroom, when you can see the kids get it
and you feel like you've done something as a teacher. That's the most
important aspect of our coaching staff, is we teach the game pretty well.  
  
Q. On behalf of the Houston Chronicle, you can get that where you live.  
COACH BLAIR: We sure can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your potential opponent, either one of these teams.  
COACH BLAIR: I told the teams in the dressing room, I want you to watch.
Eastern style of ball is a little bit different than the south. Okay? We might
run a little bit more. Hartford is a very smart team. They're a reflection of
their coach. Jen Rizzotti, I coached her in '96 in the Jones Cup team.  
The kids up east know the game very well. It is like every coach I've ever met
from Philadelphia or something, they're just junkies of the game. They're
gurus, and they talk it 24 hours a day. And when I -- I don't recruit a lot of
kids from the East Coast because they're not going to come to the south. But I
respect their brand of ball, but I respect the coaches first because of the
knowledge of the game that they have up there.  
It is old-school basketball. And then you get Q that coaches Syracuse. They're
as athletic as we are. I will find a little bit more when I see them live. I
have seen enough film on them.  
They are very athletic and they have old Moody sitting on the sidelines
helping them out, and that's like having Tex Winter over there. And they're a
good ball club. Who would we like to play? I would like the next game to go
into five overtimes and make them late for their dinner appointment. That's
what I want. I want their starters to have to play a little bit longer than
ours did.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Erica Morrow, Nicole Michael, Fantasia Goodwin, and the
head coach, Quentin Hillsman.  
Coach, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the tournament. We'd like to ask you for
any opening remarks that you'd like to give us today.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, thank you. Obviously we're very excited to be here. You
know, we've really worked hard to get our program to this level, and you know,
coming into this tournament we knew that Hartford would be a very tough game
for us. We knew that we were very good, and they've been here three out of the
last four years. Every interview that I've done, I've been very complimentary
of the things that they've done and which Coach Rissotti and has gotten them
to and the level that they're at now.  
One thing that I will say is we worked hard at our program to get to this
level, and when you read things in the paper that has you as being an underdog
or have you being an upset alert or see things that's written by your opponent
that, you know, they try to schedule you and you're going to play them, and
now the game is here, so I guess we're here. Yeah, if I seem a little
irritated, I am, because I've been reading a lot of things that they wouldn't
schedule this game. So now we're here and we're playing it.  
I'm excited because, you know, it doesn't take much to get me going and get me
motivated and ready to roll, so I'm ready to roll now. You know, they're a
very good program, and I would never say anything that would steal the thunder
from our kids. But we're ready to play, and we're very excited about the game.  
Obviously these are things that you look at and you feel that, you know, we
deserve to be here, and we're excited about being here. And all I can tell you
is that when it's time to play, that we're going to compete and we're going to
play very hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's roll with some questions.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what the scheduling -- what exactly
were you saying there? They had called to schedule -- what's the whole story
from your side so we can be clear, because I'm just finding out about this.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Sure. Well, the story is that there's a local kid from our
area that actually plays at Hartford, and they've been trying to schedule the
games to get her home. What we do in our scheduling is we put down 35, 40
teams that we intend on playing every year, and that's how we schedule. It
just never seemed to work out.  
It's been written a lot, and I know this is no secret because I know you guys
read, so it's been written a lot that we wouldn't do this game. You know, for
me, it's kind of disrespectful, I mean, it really is, because we worked hard
to be at this level for this to be just a basketball game and not to turn into
some sidebar thing. I've been really tight-lipped about it for two weeks now
-- sorry, for a week now. I've been very tight-lipped about it. But when you
keep seeing these things over and over again, it kind of, you know, gets you a
little irritated.  
My deal is, you know, I just want to play basketball. I just want to get to
this tournament and play the game, and this will be ours. So we're excited
about the basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach Q and Fantasia, you guys are always honest with me. What does it
mean to be here and be part of the NCAA Tournament for you guys?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Honestly, it means a lot. This is our fourth time in 37 years
being in the tournament, so we're excited about the game.  
When you talk about what it means to compete at this level and to have a
chance to win the national championship, I mean, that's what you strive for.
You strive to be here so you can win the national championship. I mean, we're
excited about the game. It's an honor and it's a pleasure and we've worked
very hard to get here.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I mean, it's overwhelming. We worked so hard this year, and
to finally be here is like a dream come true. We worked hard, and I'm just
happy and my team is happy and Coach is happy to be here. We worked hard. We
played hard, and we gave it all we've got.  
  
Q. This question is for all the players, starting with Erica. The chance to
do something no one else has ever done for Syracuse, win an NCAA Tournament
game, how motivating is that for you guys?  
ERICA MORROW: That's very motivating. As everyone said, we've come out and
worked hard this year, and just to be on the national stage at a national
level showcasing our talent and showingcasing how hard we can play and just
how far our program and our whole staff and all the players have come is
exciting.  
You know, just any NCAA Tournament game is exciting, and we hope to continue
and go as far in the postseason as possible.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I think a lot of people don't take us seriously as a team,
and I feel we have a lot to prove in winning this game on Saturday. So we're
just going to go out and throw the first punch and hopefully come out with a
good result.  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I just feel it's great to be a part of a team that made a lot
of history this year. I feel like we played hard and we worked for it as a
team, and together we built our confidence up, and we just played hard.  
COACH HILLSMAN: I want to follow up, too, by kind of echoing what they're
saying. This is a great tournament. You've got 64 teams in this thing, and
when you talk about from the first seeds down to the 16th seeds, they're all
very good basketball teams and they're all players and coaches that have
really sacrificed a lot to be here. So obviously there are no bad teams in
this tournament. Everybody here really deserves it, and everybody here has a
point of wanting to win these games and not just show up for one game and out.
So we're excited about that.  
  
Q. When I saw you guys last night at the hotel I was reminded just when you
guys were all dressed up and having a good time headed off to dinner of how
close you guys are as a bunch, and I was just wondering, you're obviously a
very talented team, but how much has that closeness led you to where you are
now and how much will it take you into this tournament do you think?  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I think it's amazing to have a team that's just so close.
There's not a lot of teams that are close like we are, and I feel like it's
amazing, and we play hard together and we work together, and I feel that's a
major part of our season and a major part of our record today. I feel we just
bond together and love each other, and it's great.  
ERICA MORROW: I feel we play well together as a team. We do everything
together. We all know each other's weaknesses and strengths, and that's a huge
part of the chemistry on the court, and it shows. I think we do a good job in
showing that.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I think our closeness strengthens us because when one person
struggles we all struggle together. When we win together, we all win together.
And when we lose, we all lose together. I think our closeness, including our
staff and our coaches, I think that strengthens us going down the stretches in
tough games. And when we struggle and when we are successful I think it brings
us closer together.  
COACH HILLSMAN: We believe in what we do. We believe in each other. We just
know that every night and every day that we go out and play basketball that
we're playing for our teams. We're playing for our University. We're playing
for our conference, and we understand the responsibility and the importance it
is for us to come out and be competitive and to win basketball games and to
put a productive product on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just say, do you see a key to this game, either
something that has to happen or you have to prevent?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Oh, yes, definitely. I've watched a lot of tape on Hartford.
You talk about an amazing basketball team, great post players. Danielle Hood,
she's a senior, and she's just a very effective player from the low blocking,
from the high post, very good off the bounce. And they have very good shooters
on the perimeter, and I think that as of lately, their point guard has been
playing extremely well. They're a very good basketball team. You're talking
about 27 wins, you're talking about Coach Rissotti winning 171 games and 103
losses over the time that she's been there. I was joking earlier before we
left, I said, I'm just glad she's not playing, because if she was playing we
would have a problem (laughing).  
We have to really control their players. They have five players on the floor
that can score the basketball, and for us we've got to continue doing what
we've been doing, playing at the rim, being aggressive and making sure that we
don't take one possession off, because this is a game where I think it's going
to come down to the last two or three minutes of the basketball game, who's
going to be mentally tough, who's going to execute, and I think the team that
does that will win the basketball game.  
  
Q. I was just wondering how the loss in the Big East tournament affected
both the players and the coach, and how did that help you prepare for this
game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, one thing, it was a very tough game. I really believe
that our conference is the best in the country. And when you talk about from
top to bottom, it's just any night if you don't come out and make shots and
you don't defend up to your standards and what we've set, you can lose a
basketball game. And it happened to us. I don't feel any ill-effects from that
game, because South Florida was a very tough opponent. But I mean, it gives us
a chance to really go home and get back in the gym and work, and understand
when you have tournament-type settings and you have opportunities to win
basketball games that you've got to come out and compete to your potential. I
thought we competed to our potential, but I didn't think that we executed to
our potential.  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I just feel that loss was kind of tough for us. Our conference
is one of the toughest conferences in the country, so if we don't bring our
"A" game night in and night out, we'd lose. I just felt like that game taught
us a lot as a team, when you have to get in the gym and work together and just
work on what we had to work on to win. It was tough, but we have to move on
and focus on our next game.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: The lesson learned was that you can never take a team for
granted no matter who you're playing or why you're playing them or anything
like that. What we did was went in the gym and cleaned up some of the things
we had to clean up and polish and make sure that we don't make the same
mistakes in the NCAA Tournament.  
ERICA MORROW: I think the loss for us gave us the opportunity to get back in
the gym that following week before selection Monday and just tweak the little
things that we needed to correct and clean up the little mistakes and just
make adjustments, because now coming into the NCAA Tournament, it's one game
you lose and you're out. I feel like it just gave us the opportunity to just
get back to focusing on details and just being competitive and playing
basketball, how we did in the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that, how do you get Shawndrea going again after the
Big East tournament and how big a factor will that be in the game with
Hartford?  
COACH HILLSMAN: That's going to be a huge factor. It's funny because it's one
of the reasons why I brought her to this press conference, because she's the
shyest kid on the planet here. She's sitting here and might freeze up on us a
little bit. We've got to continue to have her be aggressive. I mean, she's a
very explosive scorer, and we've got to continue to put the ball in her hands
and have her looking to score the basketball, because I'll tell you, the more
and more I watch Hartford's defense, they do a good job of shutting down other
teams' leading scorers, so we've got to find her ways to get her touches on
the floor so she can score the basketball, because they do a very good job
defensively of keeping you out of the lane, and they do a good job of when you
turn the corner of having second and third help, and it's a remarkable thing
when you watch them.  
You see a lot of UConn in Hartford and the way they play and their toughness
and their defensive intensity is great.  
  
Q. This is for Fantasia. Your coach mentioned about the Big East being the
toughest conference top to bottom in the country. What's it like being in the
Big East where UConn and, to a lesser extent, maybe Rutgers gets so much of
the attention? What's it like to fight your way up for recognition and so
forth in that lead?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: Can you repeat the end of your question?  
  
Q. Being in the Big East, so dominated by UConn and Rutgers, what's it like
trying to lead your own program up to that level?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: You know, it just challenges you, and I think that a lot has
to do with it is working hard every day in and out of the gym, on your own and
stuff like that. It's a huge accomplishment, and I'm just thankful to be
playing at a level this high.  
  
Q. This is their third time in four years to be here, and this is Erica and
Tasha and Shawndrea were not here last year, so how big of an advantage is
that for Hartford?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's a huge advantage. Honestly, nothing can overcome
experience. You can't gain the experience that they've gained by being at the
tournament three out of the last four years. When you look at their program
and what they've done and the players they have, it's remarkable. They've been
here -- I think they were here and they beat Temple last time. They were here
early. It's something that I don't think you can overcome. The only thing that
you can do is get your kids prepared to play basketball.  
You look at their games, their teams when they've played, they've beaten
Michigan State, they've beat Virginia, they beat St. John's, they've beaten
Providence, so those are very good teams. So I can see why they would have
some doubts about us coming into this basketball game and being able to win
this basketball game, because they're very experienced and they've been here
and they've beaten some good teams.  
We're going to go out and do what we've been doing all year. I'm going to play
my babies (laughing), and we're going to throw them in the fire, and we're
just going to go play basketball, and hopefully they come out and play the way
they've been playing. Hopefully Erica comes out and plays like she played at
Murry Bergtraum, and hopefully Tasha comes out and plays the way she played at
St. Michael's, and we'll just go win the basketball game, because I think
you've got to keep it in perspective for your kids because you've also got to
put it in the perspective of they have a lot of experience and they know and
they've been through this three of the last four years.  
A lot of the players on this team have experienced this a couple times. We're
just going to come and play basketball and keep it simple and do the things
we've been doing all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, do you have any closing remarks?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I'll close up by just saying, obviously, we feel honored to be
here and to be competing at this level. I mean, when you talk about our
opponent, just a very, very formidable team who's been at this level for a
long time, and they win at a high level. We have a lot of respect for them,
and we are really preparing a game plan. We're going to come out and put
ourselves in the best position to win this basketball game. It's going to be a
tough game, and we are excited for the opportunity to play in the NCAA
Tournament, and hopefully we can keep things in perspective on every front on
what we need to do on the floor and the things that we need to do to win this
basketball game. So we're excited, and hopefully we come out Saturday with the
win.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Hartford, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the tournament here. We
have Katie Kelley, student athlete; student athlete, Danielle Hood; student
athlete, Lisa Etienne; and the coach, Coach Jen residing.  
Opening statements, Coach?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Thank you. We appreciate the welcome to Baton Rouge. So far so
good. We hear it's snowing up at Connecticut or close to it. Happy to be here
in the warm weather, and the hospitality has been great.  
There's nothing like playing in a NCAA tournament. We're excited about it. But
fortunately for us we have kids on the podium and a couple of kids in the
locker room that have been here before and have an understanding of what it
takes to win a game at this level and, I think, are prepared to put the work
in to try to do that.  
So we have a great first-round opponent. And the Syracuse team, they're tough,
they're athletic. They're determined after coming off the first round loss in
the Big East tournament, so we know have our work cut out for us. But we
certainly feel like we have the experience, and we're prepared for that.  
  
Q. I just wanted to talk to the players and also, Jen, about your experience
two years ago in the tournament and how much that will affect tomorrow's
game.  
KATIE KELLEY: Since it has been a year since we made the NCAA tournament, it
is really great to be here. I think the main thing we learned is keep your
composure. Anything can happen in the tournament. Just stay focused and stay
calm and just bring your A game.  
LISA ETIENNE: Well, I wasn't playing two years ago when they made it to the
NCAA tournament, but I was able to sit back and watch and it was just -- I was
very excited and anxious to get here and now that I'm here, I just want to
feel what they felt a couple years ago.  
  
Q. Katie, talk about matching up with Syracuse and what was your reaction
when the brackets came out and you saw that you guys were going to face
Syracuse.  
KATIE KELLEY: I was pretty excited. I am from Syracuse, right from in the
city. As soon as it said Syracuse-Hartford, everybody turned at looked at me
and I was like, "yes," because I have been wanting to see them since I was a
freshman. We tried to get games and stuff.  
I am excited to play them. I wish we could play Syracuse at Syracuse. It is
gorgeous down in Louisiana, so what's better? But I'm real excited. I know a
couple of girls on the team. I think it will be pretty fun.  
  
Q. She alluded to it, Coach Q was a little bit miffed that the papers had
been saying that no scheduled game in the regular season could be worked out
and that might have been noticed by you guys and this was a game that maybe
you guys would -- could get some revenge there. What do you think about
that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, I don't know where that came from. We m have called up
there to try to get a game in Syracuse for Katie for her senior year, which is
next year, and it hasn't been worked out. They're not on our schedule. So it's
not coming on our end. Let's just keep it to that.  
This has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with playing Syracuse.
It was just a matter of trying to get a home game for our seniors, which we do
every year. So whether it was just the timing thing or just wasn't right, we
just -- we couldn't work that out.  
So, you know, when it comes down to matchups, you're just -- you're more
focused on who you're playing and what you have to do to win and advance to
the next round and, you know, whether we play them at Syracuse or play them in
Baton Rouge doesn't really matter to us. We're just excited to be here and for
the opportunity to be back in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, what's it like -- you're in a state that's so dominated
by UConn. They're right next to you. Your coach is one of their most famous
players. How do you build your own identity, carve out your identity as a
program?  
KATIE KELLEY: Our coaching staff is great, and because of that, we're a pretty
good team. I feel like we have so many fans that are very supportive of us in
Hartford and just as a community.  
You would be surprised to know that there are a lot of people in Connecticut
that are Hartford fans over UConn. We do have a supporting crew behind us.  
KATIE KELLEY: I think we also make a name for ourselves by beating team that
nobody expects us to beat, like when we beat Michigan State this year, we have
gone and beat BYU and then we won the Hawaii tournament. Winning games helps
us make a name for ourselves in Connecticut.  
  
Q. Jennifer, this is a question for you. A few years ago when you were in
Syracuse playing at the Manley Fieldhouse, I think, your senior year, you came
up on the losing end.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: You really have to bring that up, right?  
  
Q. What can you tell us about that game, if you remember?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, it was one of my four losses in my entire senior year.
So when you don't lose a lot, it is not something that you forget very easily.
I just remember that the team they had was a really good team that year. They
played really well and it wasn't like it is most of the time when you go up to
Syracuse. It was rainy and sleety and snowy, and I remember we were trying to
charter home and they were having a problem deicing the plane and there was
absolutely no more miserable of a time to be sitting on a plane when we had
just lost the game waiting to go home.  
So it doesn't erase from my memory very easily. It was one of the lower points
of my senior year. But I don't think we lost after that game until the Final
Four. So every now and then -- you know, every coach will say this. Sometimes
a loss is a wake-up call and gets you prepared for what's ahead. Certainly
with this team.  
I think we understand how good Syracuse is, and I respect them a lot. This
year's team and what they've accomplished, you know, that they're pretty
hungry because it has been a while since they've been to the NCAA tournament,
so we're certainly, you know, prepared for the challenge. Like I said earlier,
we know it's going to be a tough one.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit on what experience does for your team
and maybe how you handle it differently now than you did when you were first
in the tournament?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah. Well, with this group, you know, Danielle was a
freshman, you know, with this group's first time in the NCAA tournament, our
second overall. I remember we were a 15 or 14 -- 14 seed. I was eight months
pregnant. I was praying they didn't send us anywhere far so I could make the
trip, and they sent us up the road to UConn.  
I remember our kids were a little disappointed because they wanted to go away.
But, you know, having to play as a 14 seed, usually you're getting a top-ten
program and Rutgers was a very formidable opponent, even at that time.  
And I think our kids were just kind of excited about being there. We were
excited about seeing our name on the screen, and it was the first time for
that group.  
And then the following year, there was just such a much bigger sense of
purpose like, "All right, last year was for fun; this year is business."  
When we went down to Trenton, it was business. We were -- we prepared for
Temple, like we were going to beat Temple. And we were preparing for the NCAA
tournament like it was another tournament we were playing in.  
As a coach, it was much more fun to be a part of that because you felt like
your kids really understood what it meant -- they appreciated being in the
tournament, but they understood what it meant putting the hard work into try
to win a game. And so I feel like those -- that nucleus of players, Danielle
was a sophomore and Erica Beverly and Katie were a freshman and MaryLynne
Schaefer, they've been here before. They understand it is fun and, yeah, the
weather's great and we're going to have a good time while we're here but
there's a sense of purpose and what we're trying to accomplish.  
We understand after last year's failure to get to the NCAA tournament that you
can never take it for granted and you can never waste an opportunity because
it's such a long time before you have a chance to get back. And so I think
this group wants to make sure that they won't waste this opportunity and that
they are ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. I want you to talk about the defensive intensity that you guys had in the
conference tournament and has that carried over this week in practices. Do you
think that will carry over until tomorrow?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I think it will. I think that's what we built the last month
of our season around, is our defense and our rebounding and trying to really
limit what people do. I think it's a little different when our players are not
as familiar with our opponent, the way that they were familiar -- we were
playing everybody in the America East tournament for the third time, so
tendencies and player personnel, it was like we didn't even have to go through
the scouting report and they knew what we were supposed to be doing.  
So tomorrow will be a little bit different. It will take us a little time to
adjust to what Syracuse players like to do. You know, they have so many good
one-on-one players that that sometimes can take you off guard in terms of
trying to figure out what players like to do best and what kind of shots we
want to force.  
And then plus they're relentless on the offensive glass. You know, that's
something that, again, you can work on it, you can tell them about it, you can
show them on film. But until you're in the heat of the battle, it is hard to
prepare for that. So I think it's going to probably take us a few minutes or
even a half to get adjusted to what Syracuse likes to do.  
Plus, I think their defensive intensity is something we will have to adjust
more so than anybody was able to do to us in our tournament. So on that end of
the floor, valuing the basketball and handling their pressure on the ball or
in a trap situation is going to be -- half to be something we adjust to as
well. It is hard to stimulate that and know what's coming until you've played
it.  
So that is a disadvantage for us and for them, when you're not as familiar.
But at the same time, I think it is exciting to finally be able to play
somebody that we haven't played three times already this year.  
  
Q. Katie, you spoke about knowing some of the girls on the Syracuse team.
Can you talk about Cintia Johnson, the matchups you had with her in high
school and maybe looking back on it a little bit.  
KATIE KELLEY: Me and Cintia are pretty close. We talked three or four times so
far. She was the cross-town rival, Corcoran-Nottingham. We were always 1-2,
2-1. Ended up she always won by one point or shot clock buzzer, usually at the
end of the year. We always won the regular season, you know, game and they
always won in the tournament. So I mean, it is going to be exciting to see
her. I know what she is all about. I am real excited to play her again.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: And they played AAU together.  
KATIE KELLEY: We played AAU. We were on the same team. We played this summer
at the Empire State Games together. It was fun.  
  
Q. Two questions, Coach, then Danielle. First, Coach, Big East tremendously
deep this year, 12 teams playing now, I think in the post-season with the NIT.
And Syracuse is a team that's just had this recent success. You alluded to it
before but, how do you kind of prepare for this team? They're very tall.
They're deep. And this is kind of a new success to the program. So, you know,
recent success Syracuse, new up-and-coming teams kind a few years ago, how
Hartford was. How has that gone?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, I think that, you know, it is different if you're new
and up-and-coming and you sneak into the tournament as a 14 seed and when you
have a great season, you beat -- knock off some of the best teams in the Big
East and you get in as a 7 seed.  
You know, this is not a team that's just happy to be in the NCAA tournament.
Their kids are very focused. Along the lines of what Katie said, we've watched
a lot of their players in AAU. We recruited some of their players. There's a
lot of familiarity with what they're capable of. We've seen them a lot on
film, and this isn't, like, a new bunch of freshman, an inexperienced team.  
The way they've been able to pull together as a group and play together, you
would think they've been playing together for a couple years. You know, that's
a compliment to what they've been able to accomplish in a short period of
time.  
So they're certainly going to play with a lot of intensity. They're used to
playing with intensity every single night when they have to come out in the
Big East schedule. They got West Virginia one night, Rutgers the next and
Louisville on the road. So they know what it's like to have to come out with
intensity every night.  
Our kids are going to have to challenge themselves to be able to match that.  
  
Q. For Danielle and Katie, as far as the depth in the post, they're very,
very big. Again, like a team like West Virginia or Pittsburgh or Connecticut
that they played routinely throughout the season, this is going to be, I
think, a pretty tough task and pretty demanding on Hartford's post players,
where you arguably have the most depth. That would be the biggest challenge of
the game, I would think. Danielle?  
DANIELLE HOOD: They do have good post players. At the same time we have really
good post players, too. I feel like we can go deep. There is a lot of us on
the team that Coach Rizz can turn to. When one person is tired, she takes them
out and puts in another person. I think she does a really good job of playing
everybody so we're not as tired during the game.  
I mean, there have been many teams we have played during the year where the
post players are good and we just come together and we beat them.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Once of reasons we played the nonconference schedule we did
was to prepare for this moment. Maybe the teams in the America East don't get
us ready for a first-round NCAA tournament game. But certainly Michigan State
and Virginia who is a 4 seed and Marist who is a 7 seed, those games -- UConn
who is a 1 seed overall, those are the games that prepare us for this moment.
That's why we play them. Whether we win or lose, it gives our players the
experience that they will need this time of year.  
I'm really confident that our kids will be able to handle whatever is thrown
at them because we've, you know, hopefully over the last two, three, four
years put them in a position to be successful.  
  
Q. Jen, everyone points in the women's tournament to this -- pretty much the
same cast of teams that can be contenders and stuff like that. I'm sure you
still have a soft spot in your heart for your alma mater in some ways. Is
women's basketball, to take that next step in popularity, have to have more
teams that can contend more? Or is it still get good for Tennessee and
Connecticut to carry on this Red Sox-Yankees rivalry like they have every
year?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It definitely doesn't hurt the game when UConn and Tennessee
match up. Especially with all the tuck and the hub-bub about them not playing
in the regular season. If that were to be the national championship game, I'm
sure there wouldn't be a higher rating. No offense to anybody else, but I just
feel like that's what everybody would love to see.  
At the same time, I think when you listen to the commentators and you listen
to people around women's basketball, you know, there is a sense that there's
six, seven, eight teams maybe that have an opportunity to win. And I'm not
sure that was the case four, five years ago where it seemed like it was always
UConn or Tennessee.  
So, you know, I feel like, yeah, we are moving toward that point. I do think
it is good for the women's game to grow that there are more rivalries and
there are more players that have familiar faces around the country and it's
kind of about everybody and that people are looking forward to seeing some
upsets in the NCAA tournament because they just don't happen as frequently on
the women's side as there is on the men's side.  
  
Q. To that end, again, comparing to the men's tournament, everybody is
talking this year, who is the next George Mason, the double-digit seed that
might come out of nowhere to make the Final Four? Do you want to be in that
category of a program that's trying to improve? Do you want your players to
dream of that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah.  
  
Q. Making it to Tampa? Do you talk about it? Do you focus on it? Obviously,
Syracuse is a big first-round game you have to win the first one. Do you want
them to dream that way?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I don't want them to sell themselves short and think they're
not capable of beating somebody. We take one game at a time no matter what and
certainly one weekend at a time.  
But, you know, the kids are at a point now where they're confident enough to
know that we've -- like I said, we've played some of the best teams in the
country and sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we're putting ourselves
in a position to learn what we have to do to compete at that level.  
And it's much more rare to see a double-digit seed advance to the Sweet
Sixteen on the women's side. It is. But I think certainly Marist and I think
maybe Bowling Green last year -- I am not sure what seed this were -- they
proved there are some mid-major programs out there that deserve to have
respect and deserve to continuing to play in the post-season regardless if
they get an automatic bid or not.  
So I do think that the time is coming where there is more double-digit teams
upsetting first round and maybe second round opponents, but I'm not so sure
that we can get carried away at this point that they're going to be able to go
through four teams probably two of the top-ranked teams in the country and get
to a Final Four.  
But I certainly wouldn't want our kids to ever think that that wasn't possible
if we played the perfect game on the perfect night.  
  
Q. Katie, did you catch an elbow here?  
KATIE KELLEY: Yeah, I got a cut on my chin.  
  
Q. Did that happen in practice getting ready for this game?  
KATIE KELLEY: Yeah, practice.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: We've been bruising each other up, so....  
  
Q. You also understand the significance of your number in Syracuse. How did
that -- 44 is probably the most famous number at Syracuse in football. How did
that happen? How did you come to get that number?  
KATIE KELLEY: I had it in high school. I just -- it just kind of happened in
high school and I get reminded daily 44, football, all that stuff. And then
when I came to college, Liz Stitch (phonetic), she was a senior -- when I was
coming as a freshman, she graduated and I got it because I had it in high
school. I was just lucky enough to get it. So ...  
COACH RIZZOTTI: If Katie doesn't have a bruise on her face somewhere, then
that means she hasn't been playing or practicing. So we like it when she is
beat up a little bit.  
Thanks for being here and covering the team. We're looking forward to a great
weekend.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. Let's talk about the matchup with A &M, Coach and players.   
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Sure. A&M I really think they're one of the hottest
things coming into the NCAA tournament. They've had a great Big 12 tournament.
The championship, I've watched them on T.V., watched a lot of game tape.  
They are very, very talented. I think their main strength is their defense.
They make you do a lot of things that you don't want to do. I think you have
to handle the ball. I know with turnovers, a lot of teams they are scoring by
35, 25, 37 points off of people's turnovers.  
That's one thing we've stressed to our team, that we got to take care of the
ball. I feel like we've got some very talented ladies in the guard position. I
think we match up there, but we will have to take it to them and handle their
full-court man.  
The other thing that I think A&M does very well is they rebound. They're a
great rebounding team. We'll have to really keep them off the boards.  
  
Q. This is for Terrie. Can you talk as a senior making it to the NCAA
tournament, especially coming from a state that's so rich in women's
basketball history, did you feel like -- was this one of your goals when you
signed with UTSA?  
TERRIE DAVIS: Yeah, of course. It was my biggest goal when I signed with UTSA.
The experience and making it is just great. It is a great experience. I'm
enjoying the moment right now and everything. So I am just ready to play
against A&M.  
  
Q. Rae, I wanted to ask you about your relationship with Gary Blair.
Obviously a Blair versus a Blair matchup is interesting. People ask you if you
are his granddaughter?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: They do ask if I am his granddaughter.  
  
Q. For someone who coaches at a school -- I won't say a small school but a
school in a Southland Conference and he has a tradition at Steven F. Austin,
can you talk about his reputation in Texas as far as basketball coaching?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Coach Blair has a great reputation. I have known him for
a long, long time. When I was at Oklahoma State and, you know, being at Steven
F., he did a great job at getting that program going, what you can do in the
Southland. He has ultimate respect. I think he is probably one of the hardest-
working coaches in the NCAA right now.  
And I really think that's why they are where they are. He's done a tremendous
job with the recruiting process and just getting them into the NCAA tournament
every year.  
We definitely have ultimate respect for him and Lynn Hickey, our A.D., came
from A&M and our associate athletic director sitting down here played soccer
at A&M. So we definitely have some ties with A&M.  
  
Q. Maybe one drawback is you said he had a lot of respect for your team and
that he wasn't going to overlook you guys. Maybe an element of surprise
tomorrow on your part?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, I hope so. I know if Belmont would have one last
night against Duke, it would have ruined everybody's bracket. But, no, our
team -- I think we're very prepared.  
Like I said, we know what we've got to do. Now it is just a matter of us
stepping on the court and going out and doing it. I know that first five
minutes is going to be very, very important tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. Amanda, your coach mentioned the Duke-Belmont game last night. I don't
know if y'all saw it. Does that show that the little guys -- in your case, the
little girls, I guess, can beat the big guys? What do you take from that?  
AMANDA FOSTER: That gives us even more hope. I don't think anybody should
overlook us or underestimate our team going into this tournament. We match up
really well with Texas A&M. They're a really good team, but I think we can get
the job done if we go in there and stick to the game plan.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Blair had mentioned that you guys have a couple of lefty
point guards and how difficult that is to practice and prepare for. Have you
noticed it being an advantage during the year?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Not really. I think people when they scout you, when you
get to this point, there's so much tape out there in scouting. I know you are
talking about Monica Gibbs and Whitney York, and Whitney is from that area,
Bryan-College Station.  
Both tremendous at getting to the hole. I think they're capable of getting --
people had a hard time guarding them. When they do come over to help, Amanda
has been able to step up and score, as well as Terrie has done a super job of
shooting a 3. She has done a great job of doing that. I think that's the one
thing that they do both a great job of, is getting to the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, I apologize if you have already been asked this, but just
wondering what kind of challenge Atunrase presents as a sixth person coming
off the bench bringing offense for A &M?   
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: She's tough. I mean, she can definitely sit in that
starting lineup for them. The one thing we will have to do is we're going to
have to guard her. We are going to have to get out. She is shooting the ball
very well. I noticed in the Big 12 championship she really stepped up.  
I think they're all playing well. I think their guards -- the strength of
their team is definitely their guards and their defense.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what has to happen for you team to pull off the
upset? We see it all the time in March Madness. What has to happen tomorrow?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, just a little bit like I said, I think those first
five minutes are going to be crucial. We've not been here before. We've got to
stay focused and stay under control and then immediately we've got to handle
their pressure.  
I anticipate a full-court press. We've not had problems with that all year,
but that's kind of what they like to do. So we'll be prepared for that. And
that's what we've got to handle. We cannot have 20, 25 turnovers. We've got to
have less than 10 turnovers and then we've got to rebound.  
I know they have been outrebounding people. We've done a lot better job on the
boards lately from the beginning of the year to now. And so those are the two
things that I think we have to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Going into a first tournament appearance for your school, what do you
tell your players? You want them to be excited, but you don't want them to be
overwhelmed. How do you handle that, I guess?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, you know, we've talked about it and one thing that
-- I noticed Amanda said after we won the Southland, we don't want it to end.
We want to come into this. We want to enjoy the moment.  
I think we've had our opportunities to enjoy those moments and we have enjoyed
them and now it is down to business. And we want to take advantage of this and
we want to come in and be very focused. And the main thing, stick with our
game plan. Not come out there and one person try to do it all. We've been very
team-oriented and that's what you worry about as a coach, one person trying to
take over the game. And we don't want to do that. We want to play as a team
defensively, especially on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, did Lynn Hickey give you any advice going back to where she was
at? Did she give you any tips at all for the game tomorrow?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Just told me to win. That's all. Beat the Aggies is all
she told me (laughter).  
Appreciate everybody. It is a great opportunity. We feel very fortunate and we
are just glad to be in Baton Rouge.

### [Meg Dahlman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18377)

### [Rachele Fitz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18376)

### [Brian Giorgis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18375)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start by introducing the three student athletes from
Marist: Meg Dahlman, Rachel Fitz and Nikki Flores and the head coach, Brian
Giorgis.  
Coach, would you like to open it up? And then we'll open it up for questions.  
COACH GIORGIS: Sure. It is great to be in warm weather in Baton Rouge. I hope
we're as good as the food. We're ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, the past few years you have been there, the program you built at
Marist, what does something like this mean not just for the athletic
department but for the Marist community to have the school in the national
spotlight like this?  
COACH GIORGIS: Well, it's obviously a dream of any coach to be able to have a
team that can get to the tournament more than once and to be three years in a
row and to get the highest seed we ever had is, you know -- you feel a
tremendous amount of pride and confidence in your players and your staff, you
know, for what they've accomplished.  
You know, we have a tremendous following with our school. It's kind of like
Little Hoosiers in Poughkeepsie, New York. And to treat them to something like
this, you know, is why you do it.  
  
Q. Just the past week of practice, how has it been, especially for the new
players, the freshmen? How have they done with the hoopla of being here?  
COACH GIORGIS: They've enjoyed it. The one thing that has been our motto, no
matter what happens, we are going to have fun doing it. We've had a lot of
fun.  
We have been serious. You know, DePaul does a lot of great things so we've had
a lot to focus on in practice. But in all our down time and stuff, I think our
kids are really enjoying themselves.  
And it is a great atmosphere here at LSU. They are still waiting to see Mike,
the Tiger, but we'll get that in at some point (laughter).  
  
Q. Speaking of the players, I was reading a story that you describe your
coach as "tough but fair." Can you give me an example of that, of the "tough"
part?   
MEG DAHLMAN: He expects a lot out of us. I don't really have an example per
se. But he expects to us do certain things; and when we're not doing our job,
he's going to yell at you. You're going to hear it because he knows your
potential.  
NIKKI FLORES: He treats everybody the same, no matter if you are one of the
starting five or you are the 12th or 13th girl coming off the bench.  
RACHELE FITZ: I just feel he is one person when you are on the court. When
you're off the court, it is a different story. I feel like on the court he is
our coach and that's what he is doing. He is coaching us and trying to make us
the best we can be.  
Off the court, he is our friend and he is there for us if we need him for
anything else outside of basketball.  
  
Q. Nikki and Meg, just being seniors, what does this whole experience mean
to you?  
NIKKI FLORES: It's great. I don't think anybody thought we could get back to
the tournament after losing Elise last year. So to be able to win max our
senior year and to be able to travel for the first round of the NCAA
tournament our senior year is a great way to start the beginning to the end, I
guess. Sorry, had to say it. (Laughter).  
MEG DAHLMAN: I know like going undefeated in our conference is -- it means a
lot to us and being able to finish it out by winning our conference
championship and then traveling, obviously, to Louisiana. It would have been
nice to go to Connecticut, have our fans there, but warm is always the better
way to go (laughter).  
So traveling down here and, you know, being a No. 7 seed means a lot. It is a
great way, as you said, beginning to the end, yeah.  
  
Q. Your last loss was to Hartford, and you're playing a Big East school.
They're playing a Big East school. Do you feel a certain kinship with schools
like that?  
COACH GIORGIS: I know myself I do because I'm good friends with Jen Rizzotti
and her assistant coach, Brian, and her husband. We talk all the time.  
A couple years they won their first tournament game against Temple and last
year we got to the Sweet 16. So we compare things in terms of the matchups. It
is kind of like this game, we get DePaul, which is great shooting team. They
get the more physical, rebounding, athletic group.  
Either way it is a Big East school that can play. And we know that, you know,
we've got to be at our best to be successful.  
  
Q. Leading up to the past week, what have you seen about DePaul? How do you
feel you are going to match up against them?  
RACHELE FITZ: They have great shooters, obviously, and they have really
physical post-players, too. So I think it will be a good matchup, and it will
give our defense a run for our money. But we're preparing for them. We're
watching film. We're doing scouts and practicing what we do and what we have
to do to win the game tomorrow.  
NIKKI FLORES: I think by film and stuff, they're a team that also likes to
run. Like us, they get the pass out real quick after you make a shot, so we've
been, like Meg said, practicing for that and preparing to maintain their speed
and work with that full court.  
  
Q. Brian, it wouldn't be a total shock in the men's tournament if a No. 7
seed made it to the Final Four. But in the women's tournament, it seems much
more difficult for anyone but the so-called top group, upper echelon teams to
make it there. Do you think for the women's to really grow, you need to see
more teams? Maybe the talent spread out a little more? And companion question
to that, do you want your team to dream to making it all the way to Tampa or
is that too much to focus on at this point?  
COACH GIORGIS: Our whole position, you know, we've been fortunate to be in
four out of the last five years. And our position has been always been the
same. We look at DePaul and that's what we look at.  
We don't talk about the next game or the game after that. You know the old
cliche "one game at a time" becomes old; but for us to be successful,
especially as a midmajor and you are going up against a BCS school, we know we
have our hands full with DePaul. They are a great program.  
Anybody that can, you know -- we can't say that we've led UConn with three
seconds to go. So when you are going up against somebody who has done that,
you know you are going up against a quality opponent. We've just focused on
DePaul. If we can get there, great. If we don't, I mean, it's been wonderful.
But we've focused solely on DePaul, and we don't think about the Final Four or
the Elite 8 or the Sweet 16 unless we're in that position to do it.  
  
Q. What about the game in general?  
COACH GIORGIS: The game in general -- in other words, is there parity as a 7
seed? I think it is a lot harder. And I think part of -- you know, it just
always seems to be that way. Is it getting closer? Personally, I don't think
so.  
You know, until women's start leaving after their sophomore year -- when
Candace Parker came in, she was going to be there for four years. If it was
like the men's side, she would be gone after a year and you would say phew. It
is a whole different recruiting school because when the big schools get a
quality, top-notch player like that, they have got her for four years.  
Until that starts to change or -- I don't know what else you can do, you know,
to change it. I have been at the high school level. I have been at the college
level and stuff, and there's just been that disparity for so long. It is
getting closer. But how soon, I don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Is there anything, Coach, you would like to add or any of your
student athletes?  
COACH GIORGIS: Like I say, we're excited to be here. We know that we have an
extremely formidable opponent in DePaul and if you're lucky to get by that,
then you get, you know, more than likely LSU at home, not the easiest of
tasks; but we like those type of things.  
We've always been a group that talks about firsts. This group has had, you
know, a 30-win season, which was a first; to go undefeated in your conference,
which was a first.  
And, you know, last year I think we kind of shocked the world in Palo Alto. If
we can do that one more time here in Baton Rouge -- I know the Baton Rouge
people won't be happy but if we could do that, that just helps our school, you
know, and I've got a lot of confidence in these kids.

### [Erica Trahan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18392)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to welcome to Baton Rouge to the Maravich Center
and to the NCAA tournament Jackson State. We have three student athletes with
us today and, of course, the head coach. Student athletes are LaSharee
Christian, Carena Easley and Erica Trahan.  
And the head coach of Jackson State for an opening statement, and then we'll
throw it to the press for questions for head coach Denise Taylor.  
Coach Taylor, welcome.  
COACH TAYLOR: Thank you. I would like to say I am so proud of these young
ladies. They really deserve the credit. They persevered this year to get to
this point and I'm just very excited to get this opportunity to come and
represent our university and the state of Mississippi. Again, I'm just proud
of these young ladies because they have really persevered to get to this
point.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, you win your conference tournament. You know you're
going to the Dance. What happens then when you say, great, LSU in Baton Rouge,
does that take the bloom off the rose a little bit or does it get you more
psyched? How do you react?  
COACH TAYLOR: We're excited because this is only 64 teams that's still playing
and we played USC and we played Arkansas, so we have played SEC schools this
season. And we're just excited to get an opportunity to play. We know LSU is
great basketball team, but as I told the young ladies, there is one thing
about it: We have to play the game.  
So we have all the respect for LSU and, of course, Van Chancellor, who I've
known for a long time and coached against in the WNBA.  
But, again, I think these young ladies -- after we watched the Selection, they
was like, hey, let's go to practice because we had Monday off. We had arrived
back in town from our tournament and they were ready to go practice on Monday
night.  
  
Q. Do you guys, like Connecticut, the men just got beat, do you look at
things like that and say, "anything's possible right now"?   
CARENA EASLEY: I guess as any college athlete or basketball player, anything's
possible on any given day. Every game you have to play for that game and not
for the games ahead. So at the tip-off, the game is 0-0. Anybody can win the
game at the end, so ...  
ERICA TRAHAN: I would like to say personally I am excited because Baton Rouge
is my hometown. I didn't expect us to play here, but when they announced it, I
was like, okay, we are going to treat this game like any other game. Not
taking credit from LSU, they are a great team.  
But, like any given day, any team can get beat. We have to go out and play
this game like any game we have played this season.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the matchup problems, a lot of other coaches have
said Sylvia Fowles, maybe she doesn't average as many points as some other
players or as many rebounds, but she changes so many things. Is what she done
kind of unseen sometimes in terms of the stat sheet?  
COACH TAYLOR: Absolutely. She's a great player. It's going to be a total team
effort. You know, we know we won't stop her, but we certainly are going to
have a team effort and try to contain her. But she's a great player. First-
round WNBA pick. I've enjoyed watching her play and now getting an opportunity
to play against her, we look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have been on the doorstep of getting to the NCAA
tournament for so long. What is it finally like to be here? And what's this
week -- did you always imagine what it would be like and also kind of the
reality also?  
COACH TAYLOR: As a coach, that's why we get up every morning and spend 18, 20
hours in this job, is the opportunity to have this opportunity to play in the
NCAA tournament. So it is a great feeling to get this opportunity to play and
we're just excited and ready to go out on the hardwood to play.  
It has been a lot of hard work, a lot of sacrifices, a lot of dedication to
get to this point. But as a coach and as a player, that was our team goal from
the beginning of the season. It wasn't like, hey, we're going to win the SWAC.
Our goal from day one was we're going to the NCAA tournament. And that was our
goal.  
  
Q. Coach, do you want your players to visualize or dream about winning this
game? I mean, how important is that to try to make it happen? Two 7s beaten by
15 before. And in the women's tournament a 1 has lost to a 16. Those things
have happened.  
COACH TAYLOR: That's kind of been the personality of this team all year.
Nobody expected us to win, so we kind of been the underdog all season. So this
is just another step, and that's one thing we have talked about, being
mentally visualizing it, seeing it. Every game we go out and we have them
write down their goals. We put it in a cup and that's what we've done all
season.  
So absolutely, you know, we ask them to see themselves. As you say, we've seen
on television, there have been different games and 15s and 3s and 1s and 16s.
So all things are possible.  
I mean, we believe that this group has a lot of faith. They have a really
strong faith and they believe in themselves. They believe in their coaches.
And that's been the thing -- this team has been resilient all year long and
that has been the thing that has brought us to this point because they
believe, they see it. They trust. And they persevere.  
  
Q. I was wondering from the players' standpoint, like Coach said, your goal
was not to win the SWAC; it was to get here. Now you are at the NCAA
tournament. Do you find yourself reacting? Are you more nervous than you
thought you would be or do you think you would go out say, hey, we got nothing
to prove here, we can just go nuts? I'm wondering how mentally you guys are
reacting now that you are here like you always wanted?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: I think with this being my last year and how every year
we've tried to make it here and we failed, that from looking at my teammates,
I don't think we are nervous. We have played SEC teams before. We've had
packed-out gyms, two people at our crowd.  
It is probably going to be like a repeat for us, another chance to get out
there and be the SEC team. We really have -- I don't think it was more
nervousness of the team. I think we're all excited, because this is a new
experience for all of us. None of us have ever been here before. So I wouldn't
say we're nervous. I would just say we're excited about it.  
  
Q. LaSharee, have you been in the NIT before. What is different in preparing
for a NCAA tournament game? Anything Xs and Os or is it emotions? What's the
difference?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: Well, coming to the NCAA, it is more of a reward for us
because we got to win our tournament in order to get here. It is way more
emotional because, you know, we're glad to be here. It is an opportunity some
of us never experienced this before. And the WNIT was more -- we came off a
loss of parity last year, so it was kind of like a downward slide for us.  
And I would say the NCAA is ten times better than the WNIT. But, yeah, I mean,
both games, you know -- it's both playing basketball either way, but NCAA is
way more rewarding and fulfilling as for an athlete's standpoint.  
  
Q. When you look at your record, it seemed like you got off to kind of a
rocky start and then really sort of flicked a switch or you turned it around
or something after January 2nd. And when the new year came, did you think
you'd be sitting here right now tonight? What did you do to turn it around and
get here?  
ERICA TRAHAN: Well, we lost three starters last year. We lost player of the
year and we had seven new players coming in. So we knew we had to -- the new
players we had coming in had to buy into our philosophy and so we had to go
through those growing pains. As every year, we play a tough preseason schedule
and we do that to prepare this team.  
One of the things in the tournament, we play early games. We play, like, four
games in eight days and then we go to the tournament. So in scheduling, it was
a strategic plan to put this team in that situation. We played in a tournament
in California, two games. And then we traveled to Atlanta and we played. Also,
we played a tournament at Marshall; it was a 12 o'clock game, which those are
the times that we played in the tournament.  
So a part of our preseason schedule was to prepare us for this point in the
season.  
  
Q. Coach, what jumps out at you on film about Quianna Chaney?  
COACH TAYLOR: She shoots the 3-point very well. She is 42 percent free throw
shooter. She is quick, very athletic. She is a great guard.  
I just wanted to finish answering the question about the team and how it
changed from December to January to February. Each year we -- each month we
improved and we bought into it defensively that defense wins championships.
When we went on that winning streak, we were holding teams 50, 52, 53 points.
And so this team really bought into our system and bought into our philosophy.
And then they gelled and grew as a team. I think that was the difference,
like, each month we got better and that was the reason why.  
Again, we are just excited to be here. The NCAA is a first-class operation. We
had a great welcome coming to the hotel, and we're hoping to go out and
represent Jackson State and represent the state of Mississippi and we just ask
our young ladies to go out and give their best and leave it all out on the
floor. We wanted to congratulate everybody who has made it to this point.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have from LSU student athletes Erica White, Quianna Chaney
and Sylvia Fowles and the head coach of the LSU Tigers, Coach Van Chancellor.  
Coach, would you like to open the press conference and then we'll go to
questions.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We are thrilled to be hosting these eight teams.  
Take the questions for the players. That's what we're all about.  
  
Q. For the girls, I guess, try not to be as brief as your coach, talk about
your thoughts heading into the start of play here. Are you excited to be here?
Are you happy to see these other teams come in and know you have the home-
court advantage?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I know from me personally, I am happy to be here. I can speak
for the same for the teammates, just to be hosting these two games -- these
last two games our last time here at LSU, I think is a thrill. I will get a
kick out of it.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Sylvia. It is exciting. I can't wait for it to
get kicked off.  
ERICA WHITE: I am excited as well, and just happy for the area, the fact that
we get to host these games is good for our fans. It is good for this area to
see such good basketball and I'm really happy that we can be a part of it and
be the host.  
I think everyone is doing a great job. You know, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Coach, you don't have any pull to get this game tipped off a little
earlier? What's up with 9:30? Does that make things more difficult to plan
for?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I said since I came to LSU I have not let age be in my
thought process. But when I was 44 years old, 9:30 at night was late. And at
64 years old, it is real late. I will probably come to the arena at halftime
of the first game to take a little nap so I can get ready to play in the
second game.  
I would like to have played at 11:00 tomorrow and get it over with and I don't
have to worry with it all day. I will say this, I did T.V. last year, I had
this team in Austin, Texas. T.V. is just like taking candy away from a baby.
It's easy. There is no pressure on you.  
Coaching, at LSU, they don't want you to win but all the games. They are with
you win or tie on the other ones. Just remember that.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It is a big adjustment for us because it is kind of late. We
just got to keep ourself occupied throughout the day. But the time, I don't
think it's going to be that big of an issue.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: 9:30 at night is perfect for players. That's when they go
out when they are not playing ball. Are you kidding me? Let's get serious. It
takes them all of that time to get ready to go out.  
You didn't know I knew that, did you, Q? I coached pro players. You forgot,
that didn't you?  
  
Q. How do you structure the day with the game being so late?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't know yet. I guess I will see tomorrow. But just try to
keep myself occupied. I mean, I know me, personally, I like to think a lot
about the game and that's not always a good thing for me. So I will probably
do something that I like doing, just to relax me for a while.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: For me, it would be the normal game-day routine, just extend
it a little bit longer.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You got a thought, Erica? You had a thought about everything
else all year; you ought to have a thought about this.  
ERICA WHITE: Thanks, Coach. We will have early-morning shoot-around. Probably
get lunch together as a team. For me, personally, just get back to my room and
probably watch some basketball, get some rest, get off my feet. You know,
probably take a little nap, like Coach said, and get up about 7:00 -- no, no,
no. I will probably head over here and watch some basketball all day. So I
will be in the stands all day. Just be ready to play at 9:00.  
  
Q. Quianna, there was a lot of talk about this when you played your last
regular season home season. But this really is coming down to the end, this is
the last weekend. Your thoughts are a lot on the NCAA tournament and trying to
advance, but are there some thoughts about this is really the last couple of
games here at LSU for you?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I guess -- I mean, I am not trying to think about it like
that. I am just going to go out there and enjoy myself. If you look at it, it
is going to be the last couple games we have here. So, I mean, just going to
go out there and have fun and play the game of basketball like it is supposed
to be played.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Q is not thinking about any of that, Scott. She is thinking
about where her next shot's coming from. You don't know Q that well. She ain't
thought about any of that.  
You know that's true, Sylvia, too.  
  
Q. You're seniors, you've been 1 or 2 seed every time, you've won these
opening round games pretty easily. You just come off an intense SEC conference
and tournament. You look ahead to the tournament. How do you get yourself
focused and so forth for a game that from the outside would look like you are
supposed to win by 30 or 40 points?  
ERICA WHITE: You get focused, because this team knows it is not about our
opponent and it is usually about us and how we play. You want to come out and
play good basketball tomorrow regardless as to who the opponent is because you
want to build that momentum throughout the tournament. That's the focus
tomorrow, to come out and play hard, play smart and play good basketball so it
will carry over game to game.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I kind of agree with Erica, too. Then you got to think about
our opponent. They are going to come out and play hard, they ain't going to
give up without a fight. So we looking forward to them coming out with a lot
of energy and be ready to play. So it is not like you overlooked the opponent,
but you got to be ready for everything that they throw at you.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with both of these ladies. Everybody is going to come
out and try to play their best, so you just got to be focused and go out there
and play.  
  
Q. Obviously in practice you are doing game awareness, clock management-type
drills, and that's been important in the bigger games you've played. Talk
about the focus on that and maybe not tore tomorrow but for the rest of the
tournament. Did you see it pay off?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: When we came back from the SEC tournament, we thought we'd
have ten practices, days off and different things. We've had game situations
every day. I think practice at this time of year, when you have off that much
can become monotonous, and especially with eight seniors. They've been down
here, done that. There's not one drill they ain't run 1,336 times. So they get
tired of it.  
So we tried to put in a lot of -- be up one with two minutes to go or be down
three with 17 seconds to go and see who could win the game. I thought that has
gone really, really well for us. I've really -- I think our team has learned
-- if I had anything, I probably would have -- I did some of it before. I
should have done more of it before. I thought during this time it worked out
really well.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Coach. Several times, couple games I had a chance
to either do a couple things at the end of the game and either shot the ball
too early and just wasn't -- decision-making was poorly. It was a good chance
to really see -- practice on it and see what the clock difference and just
work on the things like that. It was a pretty good idea.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, Coach, what you do -- like Ted was saying, these guys have
been so good for so long. Now right when you are about to play, ESPN says on
Selection night that they think LSU should be No. 1. And I go home, there's my
"Sports Illustrated" and there is a huge color page photo of Sylvia and a
picture of Q. Wouldn't it be easy for them to skate this weekend and look to
New Orleans?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: You know, the great advantage of playing at home -- I think
there is an advantage. The great advantage is your fans won't let you do that.
These fans are so rabid and interested in this team.  
And this team is not -- you go back and look at it, they played 14 times in
the SEC, it beat one team 50. It beat one team 41. It beat three teams more
than 30. And in those games we played everybody.  
The last problem that LSU women's basketball team is -- is to overlook
somebody. This is the most serious-minded team I've ever seen. I don't think
they'll overlook anyone. We've not had a game that I thought overlooking them
was a problem all year. We beat some teams really bad. We beat Ole Miss in the
SEC tournament after beating them here pretty good in the tournament. And
usually that doesn't happen.  
They are going to play Saturday night. They're going to play -- if they win
that game, they'll play again. They're just going to play. Just that mind-set.
They have the greatest mind-set of any team I have ever been around.  
I would like for them to have a little more fun, but I've tried all year and
that's not -- it's working to a degree, but it's a great team to be around
every day. They're going to practice today like it was the first day of
practice. They will practice for 50 minutes today. I guarantee you that.
They're going to practice hard. They will going to shoot around hard tomorrow
for 20 minutes. They don't do anything they don't do pretty hard.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the time off of the SEC game and this tournament.
You were out of the college game for so long, are there things that you are
still learning, having to come back as memory from the past experience this
year? Something like that, along that line?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It don't seem like it was as long as you seem to think it
was, okay? I don't mean that bad. It seems like it was yesterday.  
As far as the college experience, that kind of come back like if you hadn't
ridden a bike in ten years. I just jumped on the bike and started riding. The
only thing I had any trouble with was just learning this team offensively. I
left it alone defensively. I just experimented with some things, and I think
that cost us the Rutgers game, in my mind, I really do. I went with some
things that I should not have changed, I went back and rechanged.  
But as far as coming in here and being all -- I thought the best thing that
had ever happened to me at Ole Miss was the two weeks off. We had to just
struggle so hard to make it, to get in the tournament. We weren't like LSU. We
didn't have these three players all the time.  
So when we got in, we would take days off and I thought this time off just
regenerated my energy. I just loved this two weeks off. A lot of coaches gripe
about not playing. I think it is the greatest thing I could do.  
By tomorrow night, these players will have practiced so much, they will be
ready tomorrow night. Don't worry about that. I like it. It rests you. You get
to study the other teams. You get to feel better. The season -- coaching in
the SEC just drags on you. Night after night you got to go to Knoxville, you
got to play there. You got to go to Georgia, you got to play Vandy. That will
wear on you. So the two weeks off where you can prepare and don't have to play
a game is really good.  
  
Q. Girls, can you talk about this, and then, Van, I want your thoughts, your
senior season, the eight of you have been together for so long. You have been
through so much, had so much success. Along comes a 64-year-old guy, kind of
ruining --  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I was 63 at the time. I thought I would tell you.  
  
Q. Just talk about him fitting in and how did he find his way in, because
obviously with the eight of you all going through so much, you are pretty
tight. You said the year has been special because of the closeness you have
found. Talk about letting him in. And then, Van, talk about finding your way
through the waters?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You don't have to lie much, much.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It wasn't hard adjusting to him and the things that he wanted
within this program. I can remember the first time I came back from New York,
just during the tryout thing with the USA team and my first time meeting him
and everything. He explained to us what he wanted to do.  
But for the most part, I don't adjusting to him. He adjusted to us. He is not
all that kind of lame. He is a good dude. He is funny. He keep us rolling.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Like she said, he fits right in, us adjusting to him. I think
he is a good thing that has happened to this program to have Coach Chancellor
here. It has been wonderful thus far. This is a good team.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You better say something good with as much shots as I've got
you this year. Those other two, I could have understood it if they would have
held back. But I've got you every shot you could humanly get. You are firing
electrically from anywhere.  
ERICA WHITE: Coach Chancellor is a genuine guy from the day he got here. He
met with all of us individually and told us where he wanted to take the
program and what he thought we needed to do to better ourselves and to take
this program to another level. That's what he keeps saying, he wants to take
this program to another level.  
He fit right in because he was so genuine. He knew about us from day one. He
watched a lot of film on us and he is just a real caring guy. So he was great
for our group from day one.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Going back, one of the reasons I didn't have as much
adjustment to the college game -- to your question -- I did T.V. for two
people for Fox and ESPN at this time. So I was around the college game all the
time, and I did the SEC tournament. Then I was doing this team in Austin,
Texas, at this time last year, never dreaming I would be here today. I thought
I would be on a golf course.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you said on media day, though, you guys sometimes couldn't
understand him and that he once lost his temper and made you guys run
suicides. You were all looking at each other and going, we don't even know
what you said.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: This was at camp. We did camp in the summer. He told us to
demonstrate and get up to the campus. We didn't understand or react too
quickly and he did make us run in front of the campus. It has gotten better.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Sylvia, you might not be telling them in front of the NCAA
person. I'm not sure about that.  
  
Q. Erica, I was wondering about your toe and RaShonta's ankle seems a little
tweaked. How are you guys physically going into the tournament?  
ERICA WHITE: I'm fine. The injury I got in the tournament was this injury that
I needed a rest and I got a lot of rest last week. This week was testing a lot
of different things out in my shoe to make sure my toe was comfortable. I am
at about 90 percent. I am feeling good and happy that I was able to get that
rest last week and I feel better now.  
I am definitely ready to play, and I'm sure our trainer, Mickey, is doing a
great job of taking care of RaShonta's as well. I think we are both fine right
now.  
  
Q. Q, talk about what Coach was saying about the number of shots you've
gotten this year. How fun has that been and how much has that improved your
game?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I'm going to start with the confidence Coach gave me. When
first got here, he was, like, you know, you need to have the confidence you
are the best shooter in the SEC and all that type of stuff.  
Once I got the confidence thing down pat and got in the gym and try to shot
some shoots pretty early before practice and after practice, it came pretty
easily.  
With the changes he changed in the motion offense, I was able to get shots.
It's cool, I guess.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: That's the thing about Coach Chancellor, his energy level is
outrageous. He will tell you everything you want to hear to make you think you
are that thang. I think that's what he did with Q. That's why she takes as
many shots as she does.  
  
Q. Q., how did you feel about the break you y'all had?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: It was wonderful. Like Erica said, get a chance to relax with
her toe and take care of the minor things, minor aches and pains our team had.  
It was a good chance to sit back and work on the things we needed to work on
and watch a couple tapes and watch film and see what we need to work on. It
was pretty good. It was nice.  
  
Q. Do you ever just stop and, I can't believe she is shooting from there?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: No. I remember my first time meeting Q. We was at McDonald's
All-American. She got in the bleachers and she went, like, five rows up and
she was like, I bet I can make this shot. I was like, Q, you cannot shoot that
far. That was our first time meeting each other. And she shot the ball and I
ran out of the gym. I said this girl did not just shoot this ball.  
But that's Q. She does it all the time and she challenges herself. It is not a
surprise to us.  
  
Q. Did it go in?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yes.  
ERICA WHITE: It is no surprise Q pull it from long range. Usually I miss it, I
am throwing the pass. She shoots the ball so quick, I just see it going
through the net. I never really get to check where her feet are. I get to the
bench and my teammates are like, did you see what she shot?  
It is no surprise to me. She just puts it up and it usually goes in.  
  
Q. Didn't y'all practice cutting down the nets for the Final Four coming up
this year? Didn't y'all do that? It leads to my question, how long has it been
a mind-set of trying to get there and get forward, not just with this first
game, a lot of teams focus on the first game. You guys have won first games,
second, third, fourth game. How much is it part of the mind-set of getting
into the tournament and getting all the way this time?  
ERICA WHITE: Coach is a winner, he's proven that, WNBA and USA Basketball. I
think the first day he got here, like I said, he has been focused on us taking
us to the next level. Championship is the next level he is talking about.  
Like he said, from day one, he got here we cut down the nets as a team. He
said, we won't do that again unless we are cutting down the nets for the
national championship.  
In that moment he was trying to instill in us a mentality that we're here to
win this from day one. And every year, we win the regional -- we win our
regional game and we cut down the nets and we celebrate. And I pray that we
win this year. But we probably won't cut down that net. We're looking for a
national championship net this time around.  
So I think he is just trying to change our mentality about winning.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Thank you very much.

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Caprice Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18384)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's welcome our representatives from DePaul University. Our
student athletes are Allie Quigley, Missy Mitidiero, and Caprice Smith. And
the head coach for Marist, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the NCAA tournament,
Doug Bruno.  
Coach, would you like to open up and we'll go from there?  
COACH BRUNO: Somebody asked me the other day where's Marist? In Chicago,
somebody told me that. And I said, "115th and Pulaski." And I said -- That's
where Marist High School is.  
I knew it was in New York, but I wasn't sure where Poughkeepsie was. But I am
very sure that Marist is a great basketball team. The players that return --
very rarely when you prepare for a NCAA tournament can you prepare by starting
with last year's tournament games. And, yet, the experience in which this
Marist team didn't just beat Ohio State but they really kick's Ohio State's
butt pretty good last year and they kicked Middle Tennessee's butt pretty good
last year and all those players are back with that experience.  
This is just an excellent Marist basketball team. We are excited to be in the
NCAA. We are fired up to have the opportunity to play. But, boy, we really
understand just how good this Marist team is.  
  
Q. Rachele Fitz has given MAAC teams literally fits all season long. What
have you seen on her on tape and what are your thoughts on what you've seen?  
COACH BRUNO: She is an excellent basketball layer, well-deserving of her MAAC
player of the year status. She is a classic example of don't be deceived by
the looks because she's got those long arms. She's just got an uncanny ability
to get the ball to the basket and into the basket and just an excellent
player.  
We coached a player that was a three-time All-American a couple years ago
named Kyra Smith. Kyra didn't exactly look great in an airport, but she just
did it on the floor. And that's exactly what Rachele Fitz does. She is an
unbelievably productive, inside basketball player. She is not the only inside
one they got either. Dahlman and Smrdel are also excellent inside players.  
  
Q. Allie, when you were a freshman, DePaul was in its last season in
Conference USA. How much of an upgrade in the competition level have you seen
being in the Big East?  
ALLIE QUIGLEY: It was definitely, like you said, an upgrade in competition.
Every single game is you got to bring your game no matter what. From the
bottom to the top, you never know what's going to happen in the Big East. If
anything, it made us better and I think it made all the teams in the Big East
better just to have the better competition. So ...  
  
Q. Coach, your team coming in here -- the great game y'all had against UConn
at home towards the end of the year where you came up just a little bit short
playing a team like UConn, number one in the country, the No. 1 overall seed,
what have you taken from that game that maybe has helped you build, even
though you are in the Big East conference with them but a close call against
them in that type of game towards the end of the year? How does your team
build on that coming into the tournament?  
COACH BRUNO: I believe that game did give our team confidence. I think our
very tough end-of-season conference schedule was -- we looked at it coming
down the stretch. We had six games to play regular season, and those six games
included at No. 11 West Virginia, at Georgetown -- and Georgetown would be in
the NIT if they had made our tournament. That's how good Georgetown is playing
right now.  
At Rutgers -- Notre Dame was No. 14 at home. At Rutgers in the game in which
Coach Stringer was playing for Number 800; UConn at home; and at Seton Hall.
And we approached the team and said we can look at this as a death march or an
opportunity march. There aren't going to be six games in the NCAA tournament
that are going to be a lot tougher than that.  
So I think the West Virginia win at West Virginia kicked it off, and I think
all six of those games have given us confidence. One of the big criteria about
the NCAA which you see people write -- and I think the committee says they
look at -- is how you finish at the end of the year.  
If you look at our record at the end of the year, we didn't finish with a
glowing record from a numbers point of view. But just to the point of your
question, I think we did play our best ball down the stretch of the season and
the beast that is the Big East didn't let that exactly be a great record. But
I think the confidence gained by the UConn game in that stretch should have us
prepared.  
Then we went to the Big East tournament and had to play a very good Marquette
team and beat them to get into the tournament and another UConn again a week
later. So you talk about those eight games, and I just really think they
should have us prepared. Every game has a life of its own, however. Just
because we did that, played that, Marist is -- the Marist game is going to
have its own life here tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, there seems to be certainly more parity in the men's game, the
men's tournament, than the women's tournament. Do you think for the women's
game to grow, as I'm sure people like you who have been it in a long time
would like to see in grow in terms of popularity, you have to get away from it
being Tennessee or UConn all the time? Or maybe those people get more
attention than they should? What are your thoughts on that?  
COACH BRUNO: I believe we are reaching parity; and at the same time, this
season, you know, it really didn't -- UConn just did have a great year and
that's after losing two players.  
But I think the game is reaching -- is becoming a much more equal game. It is
-- there are more players and all the players can't go to just a couple
schools. The game itself is improving from top to bottom. So I just really do
think that they're -- the parity is coming into the game, and I think it will
continue to just get better as the game continues to grow. As the young women
start playing, it grows exponentially every single year.  
I can't deny the fact that there is a couple dominant teams here this year,
but at the same time I think everybody -- look at this opponent of ours, this
Marist team. I mean, it is just an unbelievably great job they're doing at
Marist. They're just an example of a team that's put themselves in the top 16
just one year ago. These three players here went to the Sweet 16 two years
ago; and, you know, I think that speaks to the parity right there.  
  
Q. Caprice, Coach kidded a little bit about not knowing where Marist is.
When you do play in a major conference like that and your opponent here in the
tournament is one school that you don't know much about, how long does it take
you to familiarize -- put it the other way, do you forget about all that once
you get into the preparation and so forth for the team and respect what
they're doing out on the court and what they can do?  
CAPRICE SMITH: The first thing that popped into my head when I heard we were
playing Marist was watching the game they play last year in the NCAA
tournament. They were a Cinderella team. I think they took their momentum from
last season and stepped it up this year and went on a great 22-game winning
streak.  
So we can't take for granted anybody's conference. We just know that they're a
great basketball team and they're ranked and we're not. We just got to go into
the game with a chip on our shoulder because we're the lower seed.  
COACH BRUNO: If they can dominate Jessica Davenport the way -- Marist
dominated Jessica Davenport a year ago. That's a State Farm All-American --
still getting used to Kodak not being here -- a State Farm All-American top
ten player in the country and Marist dominated her. It wasn't a lucky game
plan. They dominated her.  
  
Q. Coach, do you allow your team to visualize or talk about making it to the
Final Four or is this something you try to stay away from? Having that dream
of making that run that everybody wants to make?  
COACH BRUNO: You can't achieve what you don't see. But once you get here, it's
a one-in-a-row, six-time tournament. You can't get there without the focus of
one in a row. I mean, there's no way we can be sitting -- we have not even
looked at, none of us, no coach, has even looked at an LSU tape.  
Again, please forgive me, Denise Taylor, Jackson State, all right? I don't
want to assume that.  
But, again, none of us have even looked at one tape. That's how important the
one-in-a-row factor is here in this tournament. All's we've looked at is this
great team. Marist is a great -- it is a quintessential basketball team. They
play basketball the way basketball is supposed to be played; the way they
share, the way they -- they just make the extra pass; the way they have
inside-outside balance.  
And the other aspect of Marist is they don't -- when you don't have a player
as dominant as Sylvia Fowles or Candace Parker, at first glance -- or Mya
Moore or some of the great players in our league, at first glance, they might
appear not to look at that level. But when you study and continue to study,
this is an excellent basketball team and they're just -- they just play so
well together.  
I want to thank everybody, thank the committee members who are here, for all
the hard work you do to put this tournament together and just thank the media
for covering women's basketball. The question about parity and getting more
people -- getting the game covered is great.  
Ted, it is great to see you again even though we don't come down here to play
Tulane every year. It is still nice to see you down here.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our head coach of Texas A&M, welcome to Baton Rouge, Coach Gary
Blair.  
Do you have any opening comments about your team and your visit here to the
NCAA?  
COACH BLAIR: First, it is great to be back in Baton Rouge. It's been 03' since
I coached Arkansas and used to come back to play Coach Gardner. And we had a
great, great ten-year rivalry. And then eight years of Stephen F., when I
coached there.  
And Coach Gardner said, Gary, you need to come bash to Steven F. Austin. Coach
Gardner has meant so much to me being a mentor in my program. She coached my
first all-American at Steven F. Austin, Barbara Brown played for me in high
school, so Coach Gardner has meant the world to me.  
It is great to be back here. The weather is good. These three young ladies up
here, they're very, very special to me. And this is the Texas girl, the little
one that would remind you of your Erica White or Temeka Johnson that played
here at LSU. She is 5' 3", a pistol. A very, very good point guard that knows
what leadership and running a team is all about.  
LaToya, Micheaux, I believe your dad was born in Louisiana, or your mom?  
LATOYA MICHEAUX: My mom.  
COACH BLAIR: She's gonna have a lot of relatives. She is from Houston, her dad
played for Phi Slama Jama, the great teams at University of Houston back in
the day. And she is one of the best defensive players in the country, and I'm
just proud to have her.  
The next young lady is from Shreveport, Morenike Atunrase. Played for
Southwood High School. Won a number of championships there. She is a kid
that's been injured for about the last year, but she is back full strength now
and is playing very well down the stretch.  
We're happy to be here. We're a 2 seed. The highest Texas A&M has ever been,
the highest I've ever been as a coach, I believe. I haven't checked the
records. We feel like we got a fair -- very, very fair seeding. And we're
happy that we're only five hours away from College Station-Bryan area driving-
wise, and then five hours away from Oklahoma City if we could advance to the
next round.  
So we're excited to be here. I think the field is good. I think the committee
did one of their best jobs at getting the right 64 teams in, and they've
spread them out geographically, I think, very well.  
So we are hoping to win a few ball games here, and we'll be eating at Mike
Anderson's tonight. So I know where the restaurants are. We were at TJ Ribs
last night.  
  
Q. Coach Blair, I would like you and A'Quonesia to answer this. You have
momentum going in. That's all we're hearing on the national media. What are we
going to see out there on the court? Can we keep that 13 out of 14 going?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Yes. We have a lot of momentum coming into this game,
coming off a tournament championship. Before that, winning our last four
conference games, which were huge games for us.  
We have a lot of momentum coming into our first game against UTSA, and we are
just going to keep what we have been doing, basically playing intense defense
and creating offense off of our defense.  
COACH BLAIR: Momentum is a beautiful word. I cannot think of a word momentum
whether I am in a golf match or you're a NASCAR racer or basketball or
football or whatever, it's a beautiful word. And we have tremendous momentum
going right now, but I think we have tremendous leadership and chemistry and a
hunger right now.  
The first year that we went to Trenton, New Jersey, I think we were just happy
to be there, looking at the skyscrapers of New York City and going to ESPN
Zone and Times Square and all of that type of stuff.  
I didn't do a good enough job as a coach on having my team ready.  
When we went to Los Angeles last year, we faced a team that was equally as
good as us in the second round, and that was George Washington, and they
outplayed us.  
This year our team realizes the significance, the importance first of being a
No. 2 seed and living up to that, that the committee said the Big 12 should
have that No. 2 seed.  
And we feel, one, it's an honor. Two, we want to represent that 2 seed for our
whole conference. In years to come, if you've had a run like us, you should be
rewarded at the end, even if you were not round-robin conference champions but
you were tournament champions.  
I love my basketball team right now. We want to play our way through. We are
not Cinderella where we've been in years past. We're just a good, hard-working
basketball team that we're going to face some very, very good teams here. We
want to use that word, "momentum," and just keep going.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any comments from any of the student athletes that came
with you? Question here.  
  
Q. Coach, and I guess for the players, go ahead and break down UTSA for us
and what can we expect to see tomorrow?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, I love the coach's last name, Blair. That's first. We go
back a long way. Rae Rippetoe-Blair, when I was at Arkansas and she was at
Oklahoma State, she had done a tremendous job.  
I think we're intertwined so much because Lynn Hickey is the former coach at
Texas A&M when I was at Steven F. Austin, that more or less is really the
architect of the Texas A&M program.  
I mean, there's been other coaches since, but she's the one that's really
built the program and took it to a Sweet 16, I believe, in '96. You are
looking at a point guard, Whitney York, that has been to our camps a number of
time. She would go in there and do an excellent job against us.  
But last year, we had already had our mind made up on Sydney Colson and we
didn't need an extra point guard. Amber Gregg is another young lady that has
been to a number of our camps. Amanda Foster is a kid we played against. She
was at Oklahoma State and then transferred to get a little bit more playing
time.  
Coach Luby, the assistant coach, used to be at A&M with Coach Hickey. I am not
sure if she was with Coach Harvey or not. The schools are very close.  
I am a product of the Southland Conference. Ms. Donahoe right over there is a
product of the Southland Conference. We're very proud of our roots, but we
will never, never underestimate a Southland Conference school. Because when we
coach there, some teams underestimated us and we would beat their butts, okay?
And it's not going to happen here.  
UT-San Antonio is has an excellent school. They have earned their way. They
won 23 ball games. I liked their style. They are very similar to the UTA team
we faced last year. They might not be as good defensively as UTA was last
year, but they're better offensively because they have a lot more balance.  
They have two left-handed guards, and we are going to have to get used to that
because we can't simulate that in practice. The only left-hander we have has
an ACL injury and can't play. We're not used to going against two lefties out
there.  
  
Q. For Coach, for Morenike, can you just talk about Morenike's role, the
come-back and especially the boost she's given you now in the second half of
the season.  
COACH BLAIR: Chuck, I would like for you to send this to your managing editor
there at the Dallas Morning News. There is no reason that the Dallas Morning
News should not be delivered in College Station-Bryan anymore. I'm serious
about that. I read five a day, and I don't know how to use a computer to pull
you up online. So we need it delivered back.  
Okay. Work on that. I mean -- I'm serious as can be. It is just a small piece
of heaven that I like. I want my Dallas Morning News, since I used to throw
the Dallas Times Herald as a kid growing up.  
Morenike, she was the face of the basketball team her freshman and her
sophomore years. First, once everybody learned how to pronounce her name, it
just sort of flowed like she did. She was like a deer running through a
basketball court. She's the most well-conditioned athlete that I've ever had a
chance to coach.  
The game came easy to her as far as the conditioning part and running and just
being able to make plays. The fundamentals of the game, we're still teaching
her, even sometimes now as a senior. She's getting better and better.  
At the junior year and now as a senior, how many athletes could come back and
accept the role of coming off the bench? Accept the role of saying, hey, our
starting five's pretty good even though you were freshman of the year and you
were All-Big 12 First Team and you won the John Wooten list.  
The other player I can think of that accepted that role is a couple years ago
when Cappie Pondexter did that from Rutgers. But her role wasn't like hers
coming off injuries. This kid has had three different significant injuries in
a period of 12 months. And she's come back from them like a champion. She's
playing as good as she was when she was a sophomore. She's going to get better
and better.  
But no one in the country has a sixth man that can come off like she can and
produce.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Following Coach Blair, I would just like to say, it has
been -- well, last season was different for me. I had to go about it a
different way, and being a basketball player, but this season I have learned
how to do that with the help of Coach Blair and the rest of our coaching
staff.  
But I think that injuries do help you in the long run. Everyone doesn't go
injury-free throughout their season. I think it's something that I have had to
adjust to. I have learned how to accept my role. I have no problem coming off
the bench and just playing my part. Everyone on the team has a different part,
so I look at my role on, I guess, the defense is just rebounding, getting the
little boards and blocking shots like I've always done in my career.  
  
Q. Morenike, can you talk about the significance of playing back in
Louisiana? Does that hold anything for you?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: It is nice to finally come back home after four years. I
have a lot of family here. New Orleans and Shreveport and I look forward to
that. I have also played here my senior year in the all-star game. So it's fun
to be back home.  
  
Q. LaToya, how much of your family will be here for the game? Second of all,
you look at the No. 2 seeds in the tournament, LSU have been to four straight
Final Fours, Rutgers won the National Title game last year, Stanford has won a
couple of national titles, and Texas A &M. Do you have to make yourselves
believe that you belong in that group and have the confidence to advance like
the other teams expect you to advance? Or is that already instilled from the
Big 12 tournament or from what you did last year? Where does the confidence
come from and how important is that?   
LATOYA MICHEAUX: I don't think that we necessarily believe. We already do
believe. We're here. We made that step by coming -- we won the championship
last year and we just won our tournament championship. I think that the
confidence of this team with the momentum is sky high.  
And you just have to take the game by game and hopefully we'll get to that
Final Four and get to that championship. I think right now the focus is on
UTSA and then we can look forward after we get a victory with that.  
To answer your question on the family, I'm looking at about 25 right now
coming through. A lot from Franklin and New Orleans. It is just my mom's side,
her family.  
  
Q. Ladies, this run has been really -- your defense has been out there.
Obviously Coach Schaefer handles the defense. Coach Blair handles the offense.
I wonder if you ladies could tell me how is it playing for each of them?
What's the difference between Coach Blair and Coach Schaefer? Give me your
synopsis, please.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Yes. Like Coach said, it is like night and day. Coach
Blair, he's soft. He's a sweet guy. Coach Schaefer is just -- he's hard-nosed.
He's so adamant about everything that he does, especially on defense. And he
wants things perfect and try to play perfect.  
Coach Blair will go ahead and let us slip away with little mistakes here and
there. He is the one that will pat you on your back. If you can just pay
attention when you come out of the game and look at Coach Schaefer and see his
actions, there's nothing negative about it. He loves the game and he wears his
passion on his shoulders. That's one thing I like about him.  
And Coach Blair, he is the head coach. He is over everything. And I just think
that they play a good role. Like I said, night and day.  
COACH BLAIR: I think a good comparison would be Chancellor and Bob Starkey.
I'm probably closer to Chancellor, not just because of our age but because of
how we talk. I mean, I think we both went to the Dale Brown school of BS, but
we're very similar. We've got a story to tell. We've got kids to coach. We've
got kids to love. And that's what we do.  
I'm looking forward to next year -- correct me if I'm wrong -- seeing that the
tournament will be held a week later. Is it next year? I think for the growth
of women's basketball, particularly in the media, I was reading an article in
there yesterday that they wanted us in the same dog-gone city. We're not a
stepchild of the men's game. We are -- we can carry ourselves.  
I'm looking forward to going back to the 16 sites while we're still in the
growth stages of building fans and attendance even though it is a huge
advantage for the team that does host.  
But I am looking forward to going to the weekend afterwards. People say, well,
how can you compete against the Masters? The last time I played golf, I played
golf in the daytime. So we can compete against the Masters. We can compete
against anything because women's basketball is the fastest growing big sport.
You had over 110 schools that had crowds of -- not 110 schools, 110 games that
had crowds of over 9,000 at their game this we are. Wisconsin does that. You
can pull it up on the Web.  
But that's mind boggling. Compared to when I coached at Louisiana Tech, there
might have been three crowds in the '80s over 9,000 in a regular season. And
we had over 110. It is going to continue to grow.  
I am just glad to be a part of it. Our product is in good hands, but we need
to tweak it a little to make sure it grows in the right way and the stories
need to be about the student athletes, not about us coaches when we screw up.
It needs to be about the student athletes and all the great human-interest
stories there are out there, including these three up here.  
So hopefully we'll continue to grow the right way and the media will report
the story instead of looking for the negative.  
Thank you, y'all.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 8, 2008

  

### [Jayne Appel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18464)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Candice Wiggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18463)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined up here on the podium by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, as well as student-athletes Candice Wiggins and Jayne Appel.  
Following a brief opening statement, we'll entertain questions for the
student-athletes for probably about eight minutes, and at that point we'll let
them go back to the locker room and take questions for Coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First I want to compliment and congratulate Tennessee on a
national championship. And I thought they came out, they were extremely
aggressive, and they were a very physical team.  
And, secondly, I'd like to compliment and congratulate Stanford and Jayne and
Candice for a fabulous season, playing their hearts out. Doing the very best
they could and taking us to the Final Four and this championship game.  
The game itself was I don't think indicative of the great season we've had. We
did not play well. We did not handle the pressure well. Obviously the
turnovers absolutely killed us.  
But I'm so proud of Candice and so proud of Jayne and just really enjoyed
working with this team all year. And it doesn't change tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice and Jayne, how did you guys feel going into the game? Tennessee
came out really aggressive. Did you guys feel like energy-wise you were in
good shape and they just really came at you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, we knew they were going to be pressuring us and
that's their style of play. They really rely a lot on their defense to get
them going. And they're big. They're in passing lanes. So you can't have any
sloppy passes. And I think that's what happened in the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Candice, no matter what you guys tried, you didn't seem to have an
answer. You had trouble getting the ball in bounds. Had trouble -- back on
your heels against the press. Is that as ferocious as a defensive effort as
anybody has thrown at you this season?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: They were just as aggressive when we played them in December.
But I think the national championship is at stake. Of course, they're going to
be, go really hard and go all out. You have Nicky in the top and she's just
really big at the top of the press and really aggressive.  
  
Q. Candice, can you talk about it's over, your career's over and how you
feel emotionally?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I don't think it maybe has set in yet. But I just know that I
told the guys in the locker room that I couldn't be any prouder of them. I
wouldn't want to be on any other team in the country, any other team. And it
happens that we ended our season with a loss and that hurts. Because we wanted
it. And this team is a special team. And just beautiful people. And I've been
so honored just to be on this team.  
So I think it maybe hasn't quite hit me yet. But I think we should celebrate
our season. I think to win the way we did, we did it right, and I'm so proud
of this group.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk a little bit about the pressure and what was going on
in the post and how you think you guys responded offensively things weren't
clicking like they had been clicking like in games coming into this?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we just had a tough time matching up with their size and
the back court with Nicky, like Candice said up front is really tough.  
They're a really very athletic team and I thought we hung with them until they
made a little run. They got up 9 or 10 on us. We stuck with them I think with
that 9 or 10 gap for pretty much the rest of the game until the end. So I
think we were just kind of playing catch-up since that run.  
  
Q. This is for both of you ladies. I know this is a fresh, tough loss.
Candice, you mentioned it was a little bit -- you were seeing turnovers and
sloppy passes. Where do you think the breakdown happened in this game? It
doesn't seem indicative of your last 23 wins. What do you think was the
breakdown?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think just really aggressive. They were jumping, they were
in passing lanes. You have to credit their defense. And usually when people
are pressuring you you have to be able to get by them. I think we didn't
really start attacking the pressure until later in the game. I think it would
have really helped us if we started attacking maybe a little bit earlier.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you follow up on that?  
JAYNE APPEL: I feel the same way in the sense that we needed to attack them a
little bit more and take it to the basket. And obviously break their press,
first of all. And I think that was just -- they were very aggressive coming
out and we didn't have much to counter it.  
  
Q. Candice, to what degree do you think there were missed shots, missed
opportunities?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think looking at shooting percentage, it was not a terrible
shooting night, but I just think we were not really -- we didn't really have
-- our tempo wasn't in our favor. It wasn't at our pace. And for whatever
reason, you know, we just -- I think we could have controlled it better.  
  
Q. For both of you, did they show you anything that surprised you or did you
expect them to try to choke off the high post, low post and do the trap? Were
you expecting all that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: We were very well prepared for this game. I think our coaches
did an excellent job in scouting them. Nothing was really new. You just get in
the game and you've got to play. And I think you can't second-guess your
passes. You can't second-guess yourselves and they just did a great job on
defense.  
  
Q. Candice, were you trying to get to the free throw line at all? You never
-- you didn't take any shouts from the free throw line tonight. That's got to
be pretty unusual for you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.  
  
Q. Were you thinking strategically aggressively --  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Oh, I mean, yeah. I was thinking to attack, I wanted to
attack off the dribble. They were really pressuring me, just trying to find
gaps and make contact, yes, absolutely.  
  
Q. Candice, I just want to ask you about this sway of emotions losing this
game and maybe just in a few hours a dream of yours will come true with the
WNBA draft and possibly being taken pretty high?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Sorry, what's the question?  
  
Q. Just the swing of emotions from this game and another dream of yours
coming true in a few hours?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think I'm just trying to cope with just what
transpired. So I haven't really thought about that yet. Obviously it's a new
start for me and a new career.  
  
Q. For either of you, you came back in December, you were down 11, and did
you keep that in the back of your head? Did this game feel at all like the
December game or did it just from the start feel like Tennessee was playing at
a different level?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that we came out and, you know, like what I said before,
they made that 9-, 10-point run on us. I remember Candace Parker hit the layup
and then she got another steal. We kept reminding ourselves we were down 11
last time. At halftime we said we just played a really horrible half, let's
start the second half and get it going and kind of fight back the second half.  
So we definitely kept that in mind. Like I said, we had to weather the storm a
little bit better.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had success against them earlier in the season. Did
you notice them do anything different offensively and defensively on the
court?  
JAYNE APPEL: You know, I think they did the same thing. I think we just
handled it a little bit better in the first game. We played a lot better. It's
kind of tough having a bad night on a night like this.  
But I think they played a great game and they played a great game in December,
also.  
  
Q. Candice, before the game, from across the way it was fun to kind of watch
you guys sit around on the floor there and huddle. Were you guys kind of
sharing some memories and talking about the special season or what was going
on?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, you know, it kind of became a ritual since the Maryland
game. We just gathered together and really just reflected on such a great
season and, more importantly, it's like we wanted to just enjoy the moment.
And, just like I said, I'm just crying and things like that, it's because I'm
so happy -- I'm sad it's over because of how much I love this program, this
institution, this team and my coaches and teammates. It's that amazing.  
This season, I could not ever have dreamed of this. So it's more than I could
ever ask for. I think everyone kind of felt the same way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how prepared your team looked for the pressure to
start the game. You said they came out really aggressive. I asked the girls
how you felt they came out. What was your impression?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, we know -- we know what to expect. We can't
simulate that in practice. They were extremely aggressive. It was a much more
physical game than the game in December.  
I mean, bodies were all over the floor the whole night. And I think just a lot
of our -- I thought we made a lot of uncharacteristic turnovers and some very
bad decisions.  
I mean, defensively, you know, I thought we actually did a decent job. Scoring
64 points was good, but we just had -- we were not able to run anything
offensively. People could not get open, whether it was against their press or
whether it was against their half court defense. You know, just the ability to
put the ball on the floor and go by someone. There were times I thought we got
it into Jayne. I thought we did miss some shots, and we missed some free
throws.  
In order for us to win this game, we had to play a lot better. And we didn't
play well enough to win and I thought they did the things that give us
trouble. And they have the bodies and they have the experience to do that. And
a lot of teams don't.  
  
Q. The last few minutes of the game, it seemed like the team wasn't really
fouling on purpose, but then when they did it was when the shot clock was
almost down.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, that was a bad one.  
  
Q. What was going on there?  
COACH VANDERVEER: The whole game was not one where there was -- we struggled
in basically every facet of the game. I mean, we wanted to foul sooner. And
then when we didn't, we didn't want to foul late. Candice's foul, I think
you're talking about.  
I think their pressure and their aggressiveness, the number of turnovers that
we had, really took us out of everything we were trying to do.  
  
Q. Did you feel like Tennessee was playing any differently this game than
earlier in the season, and if so, how?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm sorry, can you rephrase that for me?  
  
Q. You had success earlier in the season against the Vols. So I'm wondering
if you felt like their game was different, if they were able to capitalize on
their play a little bit different in this game versus earlier in the season,
or if it was the same type of play. Just wondered what your feelings were on
that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Like we just -- their pressure was much more intense this
time. They pressed and trapped basically the whole game this time, which they
didn't do at all. We didn't have trouble with -- their full court press was
minimal last time. Their three-quarter trap was pretty minimal.  
I think that in a way what really hurt us was how we finished the Connecticut
game. And it was like Tennessee just picked up where Connecticut left off. The
clock ran out in the Connecticut game, but Tennessee is actually bigger and
more athletic and could get hands on balls. And we just really -- we just made
too many mistakes to give ourselves a chance. Our turnovers were -- just too
many of them.  
And I just think that if you want to know, a lot of the difference, this was a
much more physical game than the December game, just in terms of how the game
was played.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of kids back. How valuable is this experience you've had
through this weekend all ends of the spectrum?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think this is really hard. It will hit our team and I know
it will hit Candice and it will hit me probably more tomorrow. I mean, to have
a chance to win a national championship and you just feel like, well, we
wasted an opportunity.  
But there's 300 and how many other teams, coaches that would like to be
sitting here. And I have thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of working
with this team, including tonight, when we were not playing well, when
everything was going wrong, people really worked hard to just kind of stay
together and not get upset with themselves or their teammates or their
coaches. And it was very frustrating. But I'm really proud.  
And for our young players, you know, we needed to play better. We needed to
handle the ball better. We needed to rebound better. We needed to make our
free throws. We needed to be able to execute offensively. We didn't do all
those things.  
But for Jayne -- I looked out there and I saw a lot of seniors for Tennessee.
We have one senior that plays a lot. We have basically freshmen and sophomores
who can only look back and say wow. It was awesome. And they learned how to do
things. And to get to the Final Four and play in this game, I'm thrilled for
our team.  
  
Q. In that vein, do you think their experience of knowing how to win a
national championship, the intensity level it takes to win, do you think that
might have been the difference tonight that they've been here before?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I definitely think that Tennessee has more experience, and
they have seniors that this is their last game too. We have one senior that
this is her last game and multiply that times five. Bobbitt is a senior.
Hornbuckle. Anosike. Parker. They played really well.  
And I think defensively I thought we played well. Offensively, it was
extremely frustrating. But a credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. I'm going to do a quick introduction, and then we'll
start with an opening statement. We're joined up on the dais by Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt as well as student-athletes Shannon Bobbitt, who will be
here momentarily, and Candace Parker and Nicky Anosike.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously this is a very special night for our program and for
our basketball team. Extremely excited for what these seniors left. They put
obviously up another championship win, back to back, which is certainly no
easy task.  
And I particularly like the way they committed to each other on the defensive
end. I thought our defense, this is one of our best defensive efforts, which
gave us a chance, obviously, to beat an outstanding Stanford team.  
I'm just really proud, and obviously it's a happy but sad time with the
seniors leaving. But I will always have tremendous respect for the mark they
left on our basketball program.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, it seems like your intensity level, your team's intensity level
picked up another notch. And they just weren't prepared for that. Was your
experience in a game like this a key here, and did you guys actually turn it
up a notch tonight?  
CANDACE PARKER: I believe it was experience, but I also believe that a lot of
people underestimate our defense. And when you get on the court with us it's a
little bit different than what you see on TV or anything like that. So I think
we did a good job collectively defensively, just making them work for shots.  
And then we knew that our full court press really would bother them and take
some time off the clock. So they had to rush into their sets.  
  
Q. Candace, can you just sum it all up, now that two national championships,
two most outstanding player awards, this is your last game unless you change
your mind between now and tomorrow, sort of sum up what you're feeling, what
the whole experience has been like?  
CANDACE PARKER: My experience here at Tennessee has been great. I look back at
my growth, not only as a player but also just as a person. And I feel like
it's been the best four years of my life. I wouldn't change anything about it.
I love my teammates, and I'm just very, very fortunate to have won two
national championships. But we worked hard for it. And we deserved it.  
  
Q. Candace, early in the second half you missed a shot. You thought you were
probably fouled. Felt you were probably fouled but your team got the rebound
you went out to the free throw line, got the ball, went to the basket, made a
3-point play. It almost seemed like you were imposing your will on the game at
that point; that you really wanted the ball and nothing was going to stop you.
Did you have that feeling that you really wanted to do something to make a
statement at that point?  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I feel like, you know, our team does a good job moving
the ball and getting in sets and all of that, but when the girl to my right
whispers in my ear I need to take over, that's what I do. I just try to get my
team -- bring energy offensively, whether I'm scoring or whatever. But it's
just making the defense take me away or -- and I kick out and my teammates hit
a nice shot. So that's just what I try to do.  
  
Q. Nicky, can you talk about particularly the early going for you in the
first half, the six steals and just your thought process coming into the game,
with defense, you talked about yesterday how that was going to be so critical.
And, Shannon, can you also talk about a big girl taking, getting those steals
the way she was doing it in that game?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I just know for me my mind-set coming into the game, I wasn't
going home without a championship. If we lost, I was going to live here,
because I wasn't going back home. (Laughter). No one was going to deny me a
national championship. And I did whatever I needed to do to make sure that we
won.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I thought you forgot about me.  
Nicky did a great job, and she's one of our best defensive players. And like
she said, nothing was going to stop her. Nothing was going to prevent her from
winning this national title. And she showed it tonight. And got after it and
got six steals. I'm proud of her.  
  
Q. Nicky, did you think right away they were just unnerved because they
couldn't get into their triangle? I mean, you pushed them out so far beyond
mid-court that they could never -- did you feel they were unnerved from the
beginning?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think our defense takes a lot of people out of their sets
when we decide to play. And tonight we had no choice but to decide to play
defense. So we took them out of everything they wanted to do and they just
didn't know what to do against our defense.  
  
Q. Candace, you guys are the defending national champions and seemed like a
lot of people today were picking Stanford to win. How did you take that and
was that an extra motivation?  
CANDACE PARKER: It's been our motivation all year to be honest with you. All
year, somehow as defending national champions we've flown under the radar, not
lived up to expectations and been criticized for not playing a 40-minute game.
But all of that stuff doesn't matter as long as you pull it together at the
end and we did that, and I think that we used our criticism as motivation and
it fueled our fire and I think the reason why we're here today is because of
that criticism.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the scoring from your teammates early, get the two 3s
from Shannon and the points from Nicky and what that did? This is a game where
you only had to take 10 shots.  
CANDACE PARKER: I feel like Shannon did a great job of stretching the defense
early and just looking for her shot. And obviously Nicky, you know, she's a
capable scorer. She had one-on-one defense, and she's capable of scoring all
the time from the high post, from the block. And just getting her to do that
and getting her to be confident in that, and I feel like she came out ready to
play and she was the reason why we won the national championship, because we
looked at her eyes and we knew we weren't going to lose after that.  
  
Q. Candace, now that it's over, how much was your shoulder bothering you?
Was there any point where you wondered about getting through this and were you
more comfortable tonight than you were Sunday night, because you looked that
way?  
CANDACE PARKER: You know, obviously my shoulder is a little sore. But winning
the national championship is making it better. So obviously I've been
rehabbing, had a lot of time in between the games to rehab. Spent a lot of
time with Jenny Moshak. She's the healer, and I'm just happy. From here I just
wanted to get past these two games and deal with my shoulder later.  
  
Q. Nicky, Candace said that when you whisper in her ear she has to take
over. What exactly do you say? Was that what you said?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think Candace has a lot of respect for me because she knows I
want the best for her. And I'm not going to tell you exactly what I said. But
whatever I said it worked. And we just try to inspire each other throughout
the game and I think it's worked.  
  
Q. Shannon, why is that corner so comfortable for you to shoot the 3?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I have no idea. I have no idea. My teammates think it's the
hardest shot to make. I actually think the top of the key is the hardest for
me. But I master it. In practice I shoot it. And I don't know, I just got
comfortable with it. I have a lot of confidence in my shot so every time I
release it --  
COACH SUMMITT: Go hide in the corner.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I try to hide in the corner so the opponent can't see me, but
I just master the shot and been good at it ever since.  
  
Q. Candace, when you were taken out of the game with a minute to go, you
were yelling eight, eight, eight (titles), holding up your fingers and sharing
a long hug with Pat Summit. What's the moment like that like and can you just
describe the joy that you feel kind of capping your career with a moment like
that?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think all of us put our trust in Pat Summit when we came to
the University of Tennessee, and she's been obviously more than a coach to us
and she'll be more than a coach to me for the rest of my life.  
And I think it just -- you play for her, you know what I mean? Because she's
been such an inspiration and just for the game of women's basketball. She's
been there for the growth. And I just feel like it summed it all up. We got
two championships together. And it's a remarkable feeling to walk off the
court for the last time and hug your coach. I'm completely different than I
was when I came in. And I feel like she's a real big part of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Congratulations.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Nicky brings a lot of energy to the court almost every time now. But
tonight she never seemed more energetic than that. Do you think the game plan,
knowing the role she would play and how much you would press got her all
psyched up?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think this game inspired her. She's one of the most fierce
competitors I've ever coached. She works hard on every possession. Probably
takes very few possessions off. And tonight I don't know that she took more
than one.  
But she inspires this team. And she's the one that gets them together. She's
the one that comes up with our plan of attack a lot. And I know they meet a
lot. And she's the one that's always calling the meetings and really holding
people accountable. I think that's what she does. I don't care if it's Alexis
or Candace. If she thinks we're jump shooting too much, she's going to express
it.  
I just have so much respect for Nicky because of just the commitment she makes
every day to getting better and she is one of the most fierce competitors, as
I said, that I've ever coached.  
She's going to be very successful in life because that's who she is.  
  
Q. Shannon Bobbitt was obviously the smallest player on the court by a large
margin. What was your plan for her defensively tonight to make sure she didn't
become a defensive liability due to her lack of height?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, one thing we wanted to do, we wanted to switch a lot on
their screening action, and I was a little concerned that Shannon might get
caught in a mismatch. But I never thought it was really a factor.  
We used a lot of our switches, and there were times when she was on Wiggins.
The one thing I said is you're going to have to hard hedge on the post action,
because I didn't want her to obviously guard Jayne Appel.  
But she really did a nice job, I thought, of putting pressure on the
basketball. And while she's small, that seemed to be effective for her. I
don't think there was really a situation that she was taken advantage of, just
because of the pressure that she applied. Even if she had a height
disadvantage.  
  
Q. Pat, watching the end of the UConn-Stanford game when Stanford struggled
against that press, did that make you more confident coming into this game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. You know, I thought as soon as Connecticut went to
the press, it really bothered them. And, you know, I felt like that our size
and just having Nicky on the ball and being able to extend our defense would
be a good option for us. Not only when we pressed in the full court, we went a
little bit more -- we gambled a little bit more.  
When we dropped it back to a half court or three-quarter, we really just
wanted to take time off the clock because they are such a pattern-oriented
team and they do a great job. They've got a lot of great sets, and obviously a
lot of people that can make shots.  
But I thought we did a nice job of taking some time off the shot clock, which
I thought was effective for us. I'll have to watch the tape. But that was the
feeling I had throughout the game.  
  
Q. Over the last three games you haven't given up 50 points, but tonight you
went over -- your defense went over seven minutes with only giving up four
points over the last second half of the game. Just talk about what rotations
and all worked for you as far as finishing?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think the big thing was changing our defense. And
obviously we all talk about playing in four-minute segments, and we had a
four-minute segment right at the beginning of the second half, I think it was,
and they only maybe scored only two points.  
But we're always talking in our huddle about what we did in that segment and
what we have to do that might be a change-up in the next four minutes.  
And I thought that we did a pretty good job of keeping them off balance by
changing, switching up our defenses. But our man defense was the best thing we
had going for us.  
And I anticipated playing a lot of zone. But it was quite the opposite.  
  
Q. Did you press them the first time?  
COACH SUMMITT: We pressed them at their place, yes.  
  
Q. It wasn't effective, though?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was not as effective. I think probably our defense was not
as strong that night. That was the night we didn't defend the high-low. You
know, we gambled a lot, even in our press. And they got inside of us. They got
inside of our defense. I thought their post game played really, really well.  
They had a sell-out crowd. Great environment. You know, we had been on the
road, played at UCLA. Went in -- I'm not making any excuses -- they were a
better team than we were that night. They definitely executed better on the
offensive end than we did. And we didn't close out the first half. That's why
I was just -- I was so concerned that we close out the first half, and we did
that in the game tonight. Because that really wound up costing us in the end.  
  
Q. I'm not sure how often you've been able to use the underdog speech lately
in your career, but when everybody picked Stanford, did you use that as
motivation for your team? Did they take that to heart?  
COACH SUMMITT: I'm telling you, they took it -- it was a personal thing for
them. The fact that all of the ESPN talent, we got Kara Lawson who played at
Tennessee, not giving us a chance, really. I mean, that just really -- that
fired them up. And it was probably the best thing that could happen to us, if
you think about it. Because it wasn't like they felt pressure to win. They
just had a little chip on their shoulder and they said we're not leaving out
here without a championship.  
And I just sensed that that took the pressure off of, oh, we gotta win back to
back. No, we gotta show everybody that didn't pick us that they should have
picked us. So from a psychological standpoint, it worked well in our favor.  
  
Q. After Sunday's game, you mentioned that Candace was emotionally
exhausted. What's the difference between the emotional exhaustion and physical
exhaustion for her?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she was really worried. That was the emotional part,
and I think that that drained her emotionally. Worried if I could play,
worried what if it goes back out. You know, she's like, I finally get here and
now I'm dealing with this.  
And I think she just was worried about that as opposed to physical exhaustion
or emotion. You know, she can fight through that. She can fight through that
because she mentally is very tough. But when you're dealing with something
that's emotional, sometimes that really zaps your energy. And it did. At
halftime she said, Coach, I gotta have your help. I'm really -- I just need
help. Emotionally, I'm just really drained.  
And I knew it. And Dean was great with her. Dean Lockwood, who coaches our
post, he stayed in her ear the whole time and we just kept encouraging her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Vicki Baugh's game and also her status?  
COACH SUMMITT: She was terrific for us tonight. I mean, she was the player
that came off the bench and gave us the biggest spark and was very efficient
in what she did. I loved her aggressiveness. And, obviously, if you look at
her stat line, she's 3-for-4, 2-for-2 from the line, has four rebounds. Eight
points. That's a matter of 13 minutes. She made the very best and got the most
out of her minutes.  
Don't know the status right now on Vicki's injury. Did not look good. But I
just hope and pray that she's healthy and doesn't have to deal with anything
serious.  
  
Q. Do you think there's girls who watch this game tonight that have been
told they're too small to play and they see Shannon Bobbitt not only playing
but playing for Tennessee in a national championship game and five-foot-two or
whatever and playing so well?  
COACH SUMMITT: I'll tell you, Shannon has changed my mind. I'm sure she
probably has changed some kids out there watching that may only be five-two or
five-three or -four. I've got a freshman coming in that's five-two. Reminds me
a lot of Shannon. And one thing I've learned from Shannon, size is not really
that much of a factor.  
I don't know of anyone in any of our games in the last two years that have
taken advantage of her size, which has surprised me. But they haven't gone in
and tried to post her up. It's been amazing. But she's so tough-minded. She
thinks she's about six-five the way she plays.  
And she's been a joy to coach. She and Alberta. We don't beat LSU if we don't
have those two junior college players. And what they did to come into our
program and be willing to learn and compete and the team embrace them, they've
really been significant in this championship run.  
  
Q. You've obviously coached a lot of great players at Tennessee. Can you
talk a little bit about Candace Parker and what she brought to the program?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Candace, she's the best all-around offensive player I've
coached. She makes everyone else on the floor better because of all the double
teams that she's had to play out of. She's become a better passer. More
composure. Worked on her face-up game. The versatility -- and I've said she's
got the best skill set of any six-four player out there.  
And I think that makes her much more effective in being able to play off the
dribble, shoot the hook shot. And she was limited here in going left. But I
was just really proud of her for not getting frustrated with the injury and
just really staying focused and getting other players involved as well.  
The balance that we had tonight was key to our victory.  
  
Q. Coach, you now have eight national championships, congratulations. That's
only two away from tying John Wooden's record of 10 with UCLA. Does that
milestone ever reach your thoughts? Could you talk about your thoughts on
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I hadn't really thought that much about it. People
will say all the time -- it is so hard to win a championship. Last year was
hard. This year it was hard. I just feel I've been so blessed to have an
opportunity to coach at a university that really cares about our program, all
the programs. Dr. Petersen is here, Joan Cronan, our athletics director, Mike
Hamilton, the men's athletic director, the commitment they make and the
resources in place has allowed us to obviously recruit nationally and to build
a great program.  
Our fan support is awesome. I think about things like that and how that has
allowed so many of these student-athletes come here because of the environment
they know they can play in at Tennessee and Thompson-Boling Arena.  
I guess I'm along for the ride. They took me on a great one this time. And as
long as I love the game, I'll stay in it. Do I have a desire to try to beat
Coach Wooden's record? No. I just want to help the next team, next year, get
back to the Final Four. That's always our goal every year.  
And as long as I can be effective as a teacher and coach, that's what I want
to do. The day I walk in the gym and I don't have the passion is the day I
give it up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2008

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Judy Southard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16910)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up here by Judy Southard, the chair of the NCAA Division
I Women's Basketball Committee, as well as Sue Donohoe who is with the NCAA
staff and her title is vice president for Division I Women's Basketball.  
Judy, when you're ready, I'll let you give your opening thoughts while people
are coming in.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Thank you very much. If I was worried about being awake during
this, I'm not anymore because of these lights. And, first of all, I'll
apologize for Sue and I being a few seconds late, but we were upstairs on the
upper level with an executive women's luncheon, very, very fine group of women
that have been very involved and very instrumental in the process of hosting
this event this year.  
In my real life I'm senior associate athletic director at LSU, and this time
of year I work for Sue, our vice president.  
I would say to you, to open up, that we are extremely excited about the state
of our game at this particular juncture and its history. We are watching a
tremendous growth in the skill level of our young women, the number of
participants who are taking part in our game and the excitement that is being
generated on our campuses for the women's game.  
We had several things this past year that were extremely exciting to all of
us. First of all, of course, our "Think Pink" initiative was a resounding
success this year.  
Our "Pack the House" challenges, which were directly related to trying to
improve attendance on our college campuses, was a tremendous success.  
And then we also, of course, announced our first-ever "Grow the Game"
marketing grant program that the recipients of those grants have been
announced for next year. And those monies will be used by the recipients to
help find a way to market and promote the women's game at even a greater
level.  
As always I would be remiss if I didn't speak to the importance of our
student-athletes. Our women in college basketball are tremendous role models
for the young people in our society, not only with the way they behave and
conduct themselves on the court, but in the classroom, and certainly what they
contribute to our communities in their community services.  
Academically the news is very good in women's basketball. We are graduating 81
percent of our women student-athletes in the sport of women's basketball,
which compares most favorably with a rate of 77 percent for the general
student body, the women in the general student body.  
Finally, I would say to you, this year's championship has just been a
tremendous event. We have watched our attendance grow at every level as we've
moved through the first, second rounds and into the regional semifinals and
finals. And we'll be very excited to see what has happened with our attendance
figures when we get all the final totals in at the end of this event. And hand
in hand with that, our TV ratings have gone up tremendously over the TV
ratings of 2007.  
And so we are extremely excited about where we are right now. We know that we
still have a long ways to go in some regard. But certainly our game is very
healthy, and it is improving daily and annually. And we're very, very excited
about our championship game tomorrow evening.  
At this point in time, I will open it up if there are any questions.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll give you the opportunity to ask both Judy questions as
well as Sue.  
  
Q. I know some people were surprised to see Tina Napier officiating
yesterday. Can you go over how the officials are chosen for the Final Four,
what the criteria are.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: I think the most important thing I would say to you up front is
there's a great need to understand that the regular season competition is
governed by conferences. Our conferences train and put together their own core
of officials. They all have their own conference coordinators of officials who
do the assignments for their conference events. And, in most cases, and I
would say it may be unanimous in cases, they also control the assignment for
officials for nonconference games for their membership.  
As far as the championship is concerned, we have a national coordinator of
officials who reaches down at the conference level to conference coordinators
and she requests recommendations for those individuals who should be advanced
forward to post-season competition.  
There are 31 conferences, so we receive a recommended slate of candidates for
officiating in the national championship from each of those conference
coordinators. We have a number of officials, a great deal of our officials
call for multiple conferences. They're not affiliated with one conference or
only two conferences and in many cases they'll officiate three, four, five
different conferences across the board.  
Our national coordinator received a slate from each conference coordinator.
That list was pared down. It was brought forward to our officiating
subcommittee for the committee, and then a slate was advanced for the
officiating. I would tell you that we considered Tina Napier, along with all
the individuals who came into our championship, to be outstanding officials.  
They are advanced based on their merit as they move through the tournament.
And, again, I would tell you that both the Big East and the SEC had an
opportunity to move forward a slate of candidates.  
The other thing I would say to you, and I'm sure the reference as it relates
to the question, would go back to the issues that happened in the Tennessee-
Rutgers game. I don't think there's any secret we can read between the lines
there. The one thing I would tell you is the officials that were involved in
that basketball game continued to call both Big East and SEC games throughout
the regular season and throughout their conference championship season before
many of them and, in the case of the ones that have been moved forward, were
moved forward by various conference commissions for consideration for
championship play.  
  
Q. I know you just love it, but I want to follow up on that, and if both of
you want to comment on this. The SEC did not give a satisfactory explanation
for what happened with that clock. Everybody was watching. Something happened.
Sue, did you feel like the NCAA -- were you powerless to step in and say
here's what happened? Because Rutgers and Rutgers fans and other fans still
just want to know what happened there.  
SUE DONOHOE: Yeah, thanks for the question. When the situation occurred as it
did, certainly within 24 hours our office and myself had an opportunity to
visit with both Commissioner Slive and Commissioner Trangese. As Judy
mentioned a few minutes ago, regular season officiating is -- the oversight of
that lies within our Conference Commissioners Association. So we felt like
from an NCAA perspective that our responsibility was to communicate with those
two commissioners to ensure that we were there to assist and support in any
way that we could.  
Also, we felt like our responsibility was to respond to any and all inquiries
that we received. And I have to tell you I had a great time doing that. I
spent a couple of days just responding to emails and explaining the position
of the NCAA in this regard.  
I think the thing that I would tell you that our most important role in this,
and what should be our primary role, is to take a situation that we certainly
know was unfortunate and turn it into a teaching tool.  
And from our national officiating program perspective, that's exactly what
we're doing. We did it immediately, within just a few hours of the game we had
a clip posted.  
We talked about how it was managed. We gave recommendations about ways that it
may be could be managed in a better way. So our primary responsibility from an
NCAA perspective was, one, being in communication with the conferences, being
in communication with the commissioners who have oversight for regular season
officiating, but our primary role was to take this and turn it into an
educational tool.  
In regard to how the committee looked at it during the selection process, I
know that's been a question that we've received a lot of, and I think Judy can
speak to it from a committee perspective. But within our principles and
procedures, we talk about unusual game circumstances. We talk about injured or
unavailable players and certainly during the process the committee took note
of that game and the results and it was a part of their dialogue as they were
deliberating on the selection seeding and bracketing process.  
And, Judy, you may want to touch on that.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: And I think probably, Michelle, you were at the mock selections
with us in February, so you were probably aware of this, but just to follow up
or just to kind of put a punctuation mark to what Sue said, there are 10
members of our committee, and we each one have different ways of analyzing the
information. We had lengthy dialogue about the situation that occurred.  
As we would and as we did with some situations with teams that had injured or
unavailable players and what would the roles of those players be when they
came back and were available for post season play, how it might affect
seeding, how it might affect placements of teams in the bracket.  
So we analyze all of that information and at the end of the day it's 10 people
casting 10 votes, so each individual on our committee had to take and balance
what that situation personally meant to them and the process of trying to
determine how they were going to vote as it related to the seeding of Rutgers.  
I think the selection of Rutgers was a no-brainer. So we were basically
dealing with where to seed them and then at that point our principles and
procedures kick in as it relates to placing them in the bracket.  
  
Q. One thing I want to follow up, I don't mean to belabor the point, but I
guess to get to the heart of the matter: Was this human error, technological
error, a combination of both, and why wasn't there an announcement explaining
here's what happened last night. Because I still think people want to know why
did the clock stop and then start again and what happened?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that's a fair question. And, again, I'd go back to the
conference level. It's not about passing the buck. That's their oversight
responsibility. I think all of us know something happened. I think that if you
went and asked the officiating crew what happened, I think that there was
information that they had and didn't have at the time and they were living in
the moment.  
And they were in an arena with 20,000 people there on top of them. I think
that they managed the situation to the best of their knowledge at the time.  
Now, in hindsight, probably would they go back and take a little bit more time
to review and to assess, I think they would say, yeah, we would do that. And I
think that's the message that from a national officiating perspective that
we've tried to deliver is in a situation like that, take the time that you
need to make it right.  
And I think the officials, if they were sitting here with us today, would say:
If they did anything, if they could do anything differently, it would be
making sure and taking the time to do it. Did they miss a play or rule?
Absolutely not. Did they go through protocol? They absolutely did. Could they
have taken more time? I think they would say yes.  
And you're talking about three individuals that quite candidly are some of the
best of the best in the officiating world. You've got individuals that have
given and contributed to this game in a very positive manner. We all have
moments in time where we wish that we could do things a little bit
differently. But you had three individuals there that have served this game
well. They've served the student-athletes well. And it was an unfortunate
situation.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Oklahoma City, they lost what was the regional draw,
and still had, I believe, 10,000 and 9,000, what your thoughts were. I think
that was the best drawing region. And I guess a little beyond that, you gave
Greensboro two regionals in a row. Do you see that trend continuing especially
for someplace like Oklahoma City that performed so well?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Yes, and I had an opportunity to be in Oklahoma City. I was in
a lot of places, as a matter of fact, but I was very delighted to have an
opportunity to be in Oklahoma City. The first thing I would do I would really
credit their local organizing community with what they did to really get out
and push that event.  
The bracket was set such that had Oklahoma advanced, they would have been in
that particular regional championship. As it worked out, they were -- if you
want to call it an upset, they were a 4 seed beat by a 5 seed in the second
round.  
But the thing that was very, very -- and I have to take my hat off to Sherri
Coale and the other coaches in the Big 12. They really got out and promoted
that event from a Big 12 perspective and then tied themselves to the Oklahoma
City community and really got out and pushed for the people to come out and
support that event.  
I was sitting in the arena for the first -- for the semifinal games that
evening, and it was absolutely unbelievable to me to look around and see the
number of head coaches from the Big 12 that came to Oklahoma City to support
their conference affiliation, which was of course Texas A&M.  
The people from Oklahoma State, the people from Oklahoma, who put on their
orange and put on their crimson and came out and filled the stands with their
university colors on but supported the Big 12, their Big 12 colleague in that
tournament.  
I think it's a real testament to the Oklahoma City community. I believe I'm
correct, Sue, Oklahoma City is hosting again next year.  
To answer the second part of your question, we have as a committee tried to
identify strong basketball supporting communities and give them opportunities
to host two years in a row. I know myself as a former athletic director on the
Division II level hosting a major event, I always wanted the opportunity for
the second year around because I knew once I built the base of support that it
would be a very successful event. And I think you're going to see Oklahoma
City will do that with the event next year also.  
So my hat's off to them. And this is just another quick example of how it
goes. I was interviewed in New Orleans, because I was also at the New Orleans
regional. I was interviewed there from a gentleman from the local newspaper.
He asked me if I was disappointed that the LSU people didn't come out to
support the event in New Orleans. My answer was to them was, well, the LSU
people came out, those were the 5,000 people that were in the arena.  
The problem was that we -- in some communities we do a tremendous job with the
local organizing committee, and that I would use as the example to go back to
what happened at Oklahoma City. Their local organizing committee just did an
absolutely magnificent job supporting that event.  
  
Q. Sue, there was a little bit of a clock issue last night with one of the
clocks. They had to stop the Connecticut game. And can you explain what
happened there and how it's been resolved?  
SUE DONOHOE: Absolutely, I think that's a great question. We had a couple of
issues last night. And let me just give credit to the St. Pete Times Forum.
Here's what I know. You're going to have issues along the way. What's
important is do you solve the issues before they become problems. And
certainly the St. Pete Times Forum and their staff did that last night.  
On the clock issue, when we went to tip in the first game, we had some sort of
short in the clock. And it impacted the way it was running down. And so we
were in communication with the officials on the floor, with our standby
officials, and those officials were in communication with the two head coaches
ensuring that they know which was the real clock to work on, to view and play
off of.  
When we got between the two games last night, we had an opportunity where we
could have brought that clock down, powered it down and put two temporary
clocks up on the sideline. And we went to our officiating crew for the second
game and talked to them about that.  
That crew went to the two head coaches in the second game and told them what
the situation was and they told them if we do that, we're going to bring down
the clock. You're going to lose the 30-second clock that's up above the back
board, but we'll have two game clocks down on the floor.  
And the coaches said we'd rather maintain and have the opportunity to have the
30-second clock up there, understanding that the timing may be off. And they
always knew throughout the game that they should refer to the one clock that
we knew was in good functional order.  
Every time we went to a media timeout last night, in both games, at the 16,
12, 8 and 4 mark, our officials went back to the huddle, said, coaches, let us
remind you, here's the clock that we're looking at. Student-athletes, here's
the clock that we're looking at.  
Coaches felt more comfortable managing it that way than they did with taking
down that clock and losing the 30-second shot clock.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both for being with us.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: So we're joined up here on the dais by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Candice Wiggins, Kayla Pedersen, Jayne
Appel, JJ Hones and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Obviously, we're really just ecstatic to be here this
morning. And we're really excited about how our team played last night. We
felt it was a total team effort. Obviously, we were led by Candice with her 25
points and 13 rebounds. Our whole team really stepped up. Kayla making big
plays, JJ, Ros, Jayne. I thought it was a great game for Jillian Harmon and
Jeanette Pohlen came in and made some big plays for us.  
But at this point we couldn't be happier and we know we have a lot of work to
get ready to play tomorrow night. But we're really excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, there's been a lot of sort of we want to play a few more games,
there's one more game. How are you feeling?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, this is the biggest game of my entire life so far.
So I'm just so excited I get to share this experience with my teammates and my
coaches. And it is one game, and that's sad. But I think it's such a great
game that I can't even tell you how much it means.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players that want to answer. I hope a couple of
them will. You've already played Tennessee and you've had this story line
about being the underdog, being the underdog, we haven't beat Connecticut, we
haven't beat this or that. You've beaten Tennessee. Is that going to be a
disadvantage or an advantage?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I would say at this point in the season it's the last
game. We're playing for a national championship. And, of course, there is that
sort of probably for them they want to avenge a loss. But at this point it's
the national championship game. So I think that a lot is on the line there.
And I think both teams are going to be playing hard because of that, and it's
not really necessarily about -- it's not like middle of the season. This is
it.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, going along with what Candice said, once the ball is
thrown up, it's just the championship game. Of course, they're going to be
motivated that we beat them before. But I also think we know them and we know
that we can beat them.  
But I think both teams are just going to play their hardest and realize it's
going to be for a championship.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we've gone off the thing where the pressure has been on
the other team to perform the best, and we kind of just had a mentality of
going out and relaxing, having fun.  
And I think that still stands true for this game. I think the pressure is more
on them again since they have to come out and try and defend their national
title against a team that I think is playing very well.  
JJ HONES: I agree with what Jayne said. I feel like people still look at us as
the underdog, we're the 2 seed where they're the 1 seed. I mean, maybe that
will give us a little extra motivation. But, I mean, we did beat them. And
it's a national championship game. So I feel like everything is even.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Yeah, I agree with JJ and the rest of my teammates in
that it is a championship game and we'll look for motivation. Everybody is
going to be trying to find motivation wherever they can. Tennessee's been here
before. They won a national championship last year. And they have theirs.
There's going to be one game left. Why shouldn't we win? Just go for it. It's
our turn.  
  
Q. Candice, Tara has expressed over the last week how happy she is and she
said she's in such a good place right now and that you've been a big part of
that and she's happier than she's been in about a decade. Can you speak to
that and maybe what you've seen from Tara and maybe a couple other players,
talk about that also?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Tara has been great for us this season. She's believed in us
from day one, and is really the force that has made us the team we are.
Because she never accepted us being less than the best. And she's been our
main supporter, and I think that to see her happy, see her proud of us, I
think that makes us all proud because we worked really hard for her and I
think this is a special team. And I think with a special team, special
coaching staff. You can just tell. They're a tight-knit group, and we love all
of them.  
  
Q. Candice, you've had a long history with Candace Parker, do you find it
appropriate that your careers are coming down to the last game against each
other?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I mean, she's a great player and a great, great team. And I'm
just excited to be able to play in a national championship game as my last
game. And I'm sure she is, too.  
The thing is, we both realize we've got great support around us, and I think
that's really what it comes down to. And so it's not me versus her; it's
Stanford versus Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma made a point that he thinks your strong play during this
tournament is a function of you guys becoming more of a team where every
player has to be defended. Have you noticed a difference in how defenses
approach you and handle you since maybe what they did in November or
December?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. I think, even Connecticut, they might have like
went a box and 1 even in November. This time they can't do that. And I think a
lot of teams are realizing we've had great talent. You can't count on one
person on this team or not one player on a team at all. That's helped us. It's
been great because we've all been at each other's backs, we've supported each
other. It's not like the pressure is on one person.  
  
Q. Candice, can you kind of reflect back on when you first met Candace
Parker and how great players can sort of maintain a friendly respect for each
other even though you guys are competing for the same thing, you still can be
friends with somebody like that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, the first time I guess I saw Candace, it was at -- we
were in 13 and under AAU tournament in Florida, actually. And she was like
six-two at 12. And our team -- and so I didn't get a chance, we didn't play
against her because her team was like third place and we were playing the
championship game. I remember being like just wow, because she was different
then. Then I got a chance to play with her on a lot of teams, or the U.S.A.
team, and kind of got to know her.  
She's really a nice person. What can you say? There's nobody in the game like
her. And I think she's carrying all the pressure and all of that really well
and I really respect her for that.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. Because it's been such a while --
Stanford's tradition is there, but it's been a long time since they've been to
a national championship game. Have you all heard from any of the alumnus and
what have they said, what have they said to you all about getting Stanford
back to this level?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Yeah, we've heard from them. We actually had an ice cream
social with them the day before the UConn game, and it was -- we've seen a
couple of them around. But to see maybe 10 or 12 of the past players from
Stanford meeting with us to talk with us and give us words of wisdom and
support and that was a really amazing feeling. We got some great words of
advice.  
I think I'll just talk on words of advice from Jennifer Azzi. She won a
national championship here. These were some of the best players that Stanford
ever had coming back talking to us. She said we're part of a Stanford family,
Stanford tradition. It's not something that we have to feel that we have to --
like something looming over us, rather it's something that should be with us,
beside us, and that we are all together. And they're just bringing that
positive energy for us and have pride in our uniform and our jersey.  
JJ HONES: Going along the same lines as Ros, talking about Jennifer Azzi, she
told us, yeah, she may have been extremely nervous before some games, but then
once she stepped out on the court, that was her home. She was comfortable
there, felt like everyone on the team was comfortable.  
I can take that to heart. I've been kind of extremely nervous before a game
and then go onto the court, and I just know my teammates had my back, and kind
of what all the alumni were talking about.  
And it's very exciting to see their support and knowing like Jamila Wideman
and Vanessa Nygaard are watching, from Portland Fire, and they're watching our
game, I don't know, it's just kind of weird.  
JAYNE APPEL: I was going to quote Jennifer Azzi but I think I'll move on.  
We also, I think, read -- Heather gave us some good advice. We call her red.
But she told us she's been watching us all year, told us how we've developed
as a team and pointing out some good characteristics to us that we might not
have known about or have been stated to us directly.  
And we also had -- it was kind of a weird feeling but we had Charmin come back
and having her coach against us, you know, I think we got some points from
her, how tough we were on the court from the second we stepped out.  
I think they really just gave us a lot more confidence and just really helped
us relax before the game and they told us to go out there and have fun.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think the thing I remember from that meeting was Vanessa
Nygaard saying sit back and take a couple minutes before the game, soak it all
in. Study the whole gym. See all the people in the rafters. I did that before
the UConn game. I think that really helped me loosen up.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I don't want to misquote anyone so I'm not going to say -- I
forget who it was, but what I remembered most from what the alum told us was
that just that you're going to remember more than anything, a lot of them,
what they took from their Stanford experience wasn't necessarily the wins or
the scores all that stuff, it was just about how they felt when they played
with each other.  
And I think I'm starting to realize like what they mean by that and how that
is Stanford basketball. It's not winning the game, but it's how you win the
game.  
And I think hearing that from them is really what touched me the most, because
I completely can understand where they're coming from.  
  
Q. You guys have traveled the farthest of all the teams, obviously the
schedule is different here at the tournament. Yet your energy seems very high.
What have you guys done to maintain your endurance at this point?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, we've worked all season for this moment. So we're not
letting a single day pass by. And I think preseason -- our conditioning has
been great the whole entire year. But more than anything it's look where we
are. We know the stage is the biggest. And we just give each other energy with
how excited we are to play with each other.  
JJ HONES: Going along those lines, how can we not be excited. We're playing in
the Final Four. I feel like if anyone is tired, you just have to think like
we're in Tampa Bay, we're in the Final Four. We might be a little tired from
the game yesterday. We're playing in the national championship game; don't be
tired yet. You can be tired on Wednesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, all of you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you, Tara, to have all these former players coming
back for this and to see these old faces coming together and what does that
say about your program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, it's really fun to see everyone, and we did -- I think
we'll actually do probably something again. But just listening to Jamila
Wideman talk and the things like Jennifer said, all these different players,
they're so happy for our team and our program. They're so proud of this group
and it is very meaningful. And, I mean, it's just kind of -- it feels a little
surreal.  
I'm looking at people that I coached like 17, 18 years ago and 20 years ago,
and they really appreciate and they really have great memories of playing at
Stanford. And that's what I want them to have as a coach.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk during this tournament about even from other
coaches about how they've seen your personality change over the years and more
mellow, smiling more. Do you think your personality has changed that much in
recent years and if so why?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that we all probably change. We're affected by
our experiences. I think that I probably have changed. But a lot of it may be
also I maybe haven't changed as much as people might say because a lot of
people maybe don't know me.  
But I think for me personally I've always had a lot of interests, and, I mean,
basketball has always been a passion of mine, but different -- and I think
that different groups allow you to be certain ways with them. This particular
team allows me to be very relaxed. There's not an undercurrent or drama about
this team. Kind of what you see is what you get.  
I can be very direct and I don't have to sugar coat things when I talk to the
players. And we have -- I have great rapport with basically everyone on our
team. And I love that. And it's a really great place to be.  
And I think that any coach would really love to coach this team. It's that
much fun.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask you about the scoring balance you have on your team
now and how much that's helped just from a game planning standpoint. Have you
had a team with this much scoring balance in recent years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, in the beginning of the year you wouldn't really
be saying that about our team. We kind of had the big three and no one else.
It was always about Jayne and Kayla and Candice. But probably the reason that
we're here is because we do have that balance and the improvement of Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude, the improvement of JJ Hones, the contributions that Jillian
Harmon is able to make and Jeanette Pohlen.  
So that is -- I think that has been really key to our team's improvement and
development. We have had that in past years. That hasn't -- some of the things
that we haven't had, we have had that. But we haven't had some other things
that we have on this team.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Parker and Wiggins beyond their playing ability, how
they've led their teams here?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I can speak about Candice with an "i" because I really
know Candice. Candice Wiggins really loves to play. I think she's a really
humble person and she really -- she'll do anything for our team, whether like
last night rebounding, there have been games where if we're up, she will sit.
And she just will do anything for her team and she really as a player that
just has total confidence in me as her coach.  
And it's mutual. So I couldn't ask any more from our Candice. And obviously
Candace Parker does great things for their team. But I think they do come from
kind of different places, you know, in that a lot of this stuff is brand new
for Candice Wiggins. And she almost acts so surprised about everything, to be
U.S.A. Basketball player of the year. And if anyone saw her when she got her
Wade, she was shocked. She just -- she really is just very real and down to
earth and it's really fun to see someone with that kind of demeanor to have
all these great things happen to them.  
  
Q. Back in '90 and '92 in the early '90s your program was on such a roll and
such a high. Can you think back then if at that time what your thoughts were
about how this was going to continue, and then when it took so long to get
back to this game, did you think it was going to take this long and was there
ever a time where you thought, well, maybe this isn't going to happen for my
program again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: When I first went to Stanford, it was in a different time in
women's basketball. And I felt really -- it was really fortunate to be able to
build a program that like Jennifer Azzi, when she was a freshman, she was in
the first recruiting class with Katy Steding. When Jennifer Azzi was a
freshman, we were a .500 team. We won a national championship.  
And when you are kind of in the Final Four and win a national championship,
and we were able to recruit I think some really quality players, and since
then a lot of other schools have made commitments to having great women's
basketball teams.  
And the competition is much different than it was in 1990 and 1992. Also I
think that for our team, the three years we went to the Elite Eight, we could
just as easily have been here as this year. Comes down to a couple of plays, a
foul here or a basket here.  
So I never felt that we were -- I didn't feel like we, like, dropped off the
map. I felt we were right there.  
But it did take some special things in terms of just little things that maybe
really made a difference for us this year. I think some of it, too, I really
felt fortunate to have gone to five Final Fours before. And Stanford I just
felt we just would continue to work to recruit the type of player that could
play at Stanford and that we would have a shot to be here.  
And we have had to play very, very well to be here. And obviously once you get
here you just have to enjoy it. You never know if you're ever coming back. I
hope I do, but who knows.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, you played Tennessee once already. We talked to the
kids about sort of being in that underdog role. Do you feel like you guys sort
of maybe -- the tables are turned a bit and how hard is it to beat Tennessee
twice in a year when you beat them once in 11 years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Takes us 11 years to beat them, and now we have to play them
again. They're a great team and a great program. Obviously, it was hard like
last night. Who do you want to play? You're watching LSU and you're watching
Tennessee. And I guess I like familiarity. I like the fact -- we had played
LSU two years ago. But I like the fact that we kind of had -- I've seen our
players against Tennessee. I've seen them matched up.  
So I'm excited that we're playing Tennessee. And for us, honestly, I think the
fact that we did beat them earlier is for our -- it's to our team's advantage
in that confidence that our players know that that's possible. With the
Connecticut situation, you know, things changed a lot for Connecticut, with
their two players being hurt. They're a totally different team.  
This is the same Tennessee team. And for our team, I think it works for us
better that we have been successful, that it's not like, oh, God, we haven't
beaten them in 11 or 12 years.  
For them it might be to their advantage, also, that we beat them and this is a
payback game. But I think as our players kind of said for the most part, once
that ball goes up, we're going to give it our absolute best shot. They're
going to give it their absolute best shot and let's just see what happens.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the game, the strategy, the matchups,
what you guys need to do to beat a team that you did get by in Maples but now
you're on the national stage?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There are certain things you have to do against Tennessee
whether you're playing in Maples, Knoxville or Tampa. You have to rebound.
They're a great rebounding team. You have to take care of the ball.  
I asked Kate Paye, who scouts them, she scouts Connecticut, what do we have to
do against Tennessee? She goes, it's the same stuff you have to do against
Connecticut. To beat great teams, you have to execute offensively, you have to
rebound and you have to defend. Those are things we'll have to do tomorrow
night.  
And they give you a challenge because they're big. They're athletic, they're
very experienced, and they're confident coming into this game.  
  
Q. Have you approached this weekend any differently than you did 15 years
ago when you won a Final Four and is that because of your change and the way
you want the kids to remember?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We are doing some things different. Actually the last time I
was coaching in Final Four you played back to back. Today would be the game.
So that does change your strategy a little bit.  
We're just trying to -- we're keeping kind of our group tight and we just --
we're not out doing a whole lot of stuff. We're just together and we watch
video. We're just trying to make things fun and have it be great memories for
them.  
Coming into the Final Four, we also -- we just said, hey, we're in it to win
it. We came here on a mission and we just want to keep it going.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No, not here, just in Spokane.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the other day about how some of these
freshmen and sophomores aren't playing like freshmen and sophomores, they're a
little fearless. Can you touch on that going into the national championship
game and how they've stepped up into this tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We are a young team in a lot of ways. Candice is a senior,
obviously, but in our starting lineup we have one freshman and three
sophomores. And we bring in a junior. We bring in a freshman, basically,
that's our top seven player rotation.  
And these are just kids that have grown up playing basketball. And like
Jeanette Pohlen comes in. She's played against Maya Moore in All-Star games or
in AAU. They go playing against each other since they were 13 years old.  
At this point it's not about the age of players, it's more about their
maturity and their poise and their ability just to relax and play on the big
stage. And that's so far -- I mean, I think like last night's game, I think
you saw a team that was for the most part very poised.  
We kind of got flustered for a little bit when we got pressed and we were
throwing the ball in the popcorn stand. But for the most part I think we did
show good poise and got the shots that we wanted and made the plays we needed
to defensively and rebounded the ball well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes first. After
about 15 minutes we'll let them head to their breakout rooms, and then we'll
entertain questions for the coach.  
We're joined up here by Tennessee head coach Pat Summitt as well as student-
athletes Candace Parker, Alberta Auguste, Nicky Anosike, Shannon Bobbitt and
Alexis Hornbuckle.  
When you're ready, Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, we're excited to be in the position to play in a
national championship game. This group has -- they've been there before and we
know it's going to be against a great Stanford team. Obviously a team we lost
to earlier in the year at Stanford, and I thought that was probably a defining
moment for us in terms of making a commitment to our scouting report defense
and stepping up and making plays.  
And I think it's going to be two great teams going at it. Hopefully we'll be a
little better on the offensive end. But I'll let you hear from the players and
I'll talk to you afterwards.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, I'll start with you. As efficient as Stanford has been
offensively, Coach just said you need to be better offensively. Do you feel
like you need to put some more points to keep up with the way Stanford has
been playing offensively?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think it's definitely important to be efficient on
offense and put up more points. But at the same time it comes down to defense
and boards. So we just have to step up our defense in case our shots are not
falling in.  
  
Q. Candace, did you ever in the past year have, for better or worse, a Matt
Leinart moment where you thought maybe I'll stay at Tennessee, take a couple
of grad courses and finish out my final year of eligibility?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously I've talked about living in the moment and just
staying day-to-day. That's what I'm trying to do now. I'm focusing on that. I
haven't had time to really think about it.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about your relationship with Candice Wiggins. I
know you guys have spent a lot of time together with U.S.A. teams. And I had
heard that somebody showed you a box score from when she put up the 44 against
UTEP, you smiled and shook your head. Have you smiled and shook your head at
what Candice has done through this whole tournament?  
CANDACE PARKER: Candice is a great player. I remember watching her play when
we were in eighth grade and we were watching the championship national game.
Nicky Anosike was playing her team in Orlando, Florida, and she was a ball of
energy, always moving.  
She's progressed and gotten better every year. I think she's a great leader
for her team and she really inspires by her play. She inspires her teammates.
Obviously we're great friends. We've played on a lot of the same U.S.A. teams
and things like that. She's a great person as well.  
  
Q. Shannon, that first meeting with Stanford, I think Wiggins only took 12
shots in that game. I want to ask you about the supporting cast and the other
players at Stanford and maybe what the toughest aspects of defending the rest
of their players will be tomorrow night.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Yeah, she only took 12 shots and Tennessee players did a
great job limiting her touches and making all her shots tough. And she has a
great supporting cast and they can all shoot the 3 ball as well. Stanford is a
great team. So we all have to compete and guard all of them.  
  
Q. Alexis, JJ Hones wasn't in the rotation when you played them the first
time. From what you've seen of them since then, what has she added to the
dynamic, particularly with her size and particularly as a defensive player?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: She's stepping up, hitting big shots, whether it's going to
the basket, hitting pullups, knocking down the 3 ball. She's adding a new
dynamic to their offense. So we have to be ready to defend not only Candice
and Jayne Appel but the other three as well. It's going to be 1 through 5 is
good, and they're playing together, so we've got to defend 1 through 5.  
  
Q. Alexis, Candice Wiggins singled you out as one of the better defensive
players she's gone up against. I wondered what your feelings were going into
that matchup against her?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I know I have a tough defensive assignment. Like Candace
said, she's a big ball of energy, never stops moving, she hunts for her shot.
They do a great job of getting her open, running off screen. She's going to
get handoffs, so I know I have a tough defensive assignment. I can't rest and
I can't take a possession off.  
  
Q. Nicky, you're wearing a T-shirt that says "Touching Third Base," I don't
think that's a softball shirt. Can you tell us what that means?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We all just kind of made promises to each other we would touch
third base, which basically means you don't make it to the finish line unless
you do what's necessary beforehand to be successful at the end. So just
focusing on the little things. You can't get a home run unless you touch third
base, which is what we've been focusing on the whole season.  
So our strength and conditioning coach made these shirts up for us and we wear
them to bed every night just to remind us that it's the little things that
count and we can't get to our ultimate goal without doing those little things.
So it's really helped us just reiterate what we want to do.  
  
Q. Candace, what do you remember from Kayla Pedersen from that first game?
And, secondly, she says that their plan is to force you to your left tomorrow
because your left-handed shots appear to be short. Do you think that's a
dangerous tactic for them to attempt?  
CANDACE PARKER: (Laughter) obviously I remember the Stanford game in my mind
like it was yesterday. We talk about how it ruined our Christmas and ending
the year on a loss. Obviously Kayla has really stepped up her play throughout
the NCAA tournament. Glad I got some insight on what they're planning on
doing. And obviously I'm just going to continue to try to play my game, and
obviously if I step out on the court, then all's fair.  
  
Q. Candace, I'm sure you're getting really tired about talking about this,
but how is your shoulder feeling now and what have you done between the time
the game ended last night as far as rehab and getting rest?  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in America. She obviously has
me on rehab programs, just do going strengthening exercising, stim, ice,
getting circulation back. Obviously the stiffness from yesterday was tough
this morning, but it feels great. One more game. Just get through it and worry
about it later.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. They've played two beautiful basketball games the last two games, that
two good teams made runs at them, they never got rattled. How much better do
you think they are from what you've seen in these last two games and what you
saw on December 22nd? And the other question would be: They played you man to
man pretty much straight up. A lot of teams don't dare do that because of
Candace. What do you think is it about them that allows them to do that?  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, I think Stanford is a much better basketball
team. They're running their offense with great efficiency and getting great
looks. And I think the question about the defensive part of it, I think they
have the size to match up with us. And I think that's what allows them to be
able to defend us in man to man.  
And Jayne Appel has got a great presence inside. But if you just look at our
two teams, it's not like we have a distinct advantage from the standpoint of
our size.  
  
Q. Pat, I know earlier in the year out of frustration at times you compared
this team maybe to the '99 team, not playing 40 minutes. Have you changed your
opinion somewhat of this team now that you're at the Final Four?  
COACH SUMMITT: This team has changed my opinion of them. And this started
after our loss to LSU. When the wheels came off in Knoxville and the next day
we went into our conference room and had a board meeting, coaches and players,
and just pretty much laid out what they would have to do and expressed to them
how mad I was. I was mad at them, real mad, and disappointed in how they -- I
thought they quit in that game. And that's the first time I really felt that
about this team.  
But once the coaches expressed how we felt, we left the room and they had
their own meeting. We got to Nashville. We went to play Vanderbilt. I was
really concerned about what might happen. And that's when Alex Fuller dropped
a note in my lap when she got off the bus. When I read it, she said: Coach,
everything is going to be okay. We've had a meeting, we're ready to play. This
won't happen again.  
I felt better. I knew when it's their idea it works a lot better. And I knew
that they were embarrassed and I think from that moment on we've been a
different basketball team.  
  
Q. Pat, could you comment a little bit on the contrasting styles between
Candace Parker and Wiggins, but also their similarity in being great leaders
and getting their teams to this point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, with Candice Wiggins, I mean, she's got great skill set.
Obviously a player that can shoot the 3, that can create off the dribble,
makes everybody else on the floor better. She's a big play person. She steps
up and provides great energy.  
I think she brings a lot of energy to her team. She's very positive, a very
positive leader. And she just -- she's one of the best players in the country,
there's no doubt about it. And what she brings to her team, I think, gives
them a lot of confidence and keeps them motivated.  
When you have a player with that kind of energy, it filters throughout your
team. We get that from Alexis. But I think Candice is such a skilled offensive
player and a player that makes good decisions on the floor, she makes everyone
else better.  
Candace Parker, obviously very similar in what she brings as far as the
points, the contributions, her passing skills. Much like Candice Wiggins,
Candace Parker is very unselfish.  
Even last night when she came down the floor and hit Nicky Anosike, when I
anticipated Candace would take that shot, she saw the opening and made the
great pass. But with Candace, I think that Candace Parker is just a great all-
around offensive player because she has been in the gym and expanding what she
can do with the basketball, meaning going left, going right. Unfortunately,
the shoulder's preventing her from going left as much as I wish she could go
left, because she is very strong in that regard.  
Hook shot, left, right. Pull up, 3 ball. Just the versatility of a six-four
player in this game, you don't see that very often.  
And I have great respect for what Candace has done in terms of getting in the
gym to expand her game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your history with Tara. You've known her
for a long time. She hasn't been here for 11 years. Did you think the game had
passed her by?  
COACH SUMMITT: I didn't know it had been 11 years. No, I never think the game
will pass Tara by. Tara VanDerveer, she's a great teacher. Great coach.
Obviously she's showing more emotion than I've seen her show in post season.  
And I think that's been a good thing for her team. Typically she doesn't get
up. It's good to see her get out of her chair and encourage her team. When you
talk about the great coaches in the game, I mean, she is someone that I have
felt was one of the very best at her teaching of the game and just game
management. And doesn't surprise me that she's back here. It surprises me that
it's been that long.  
  
Q. A lot of the talk has been about Wiggins. I wanted to talk about their
front court, Appel and Pedersen. Having two six-four players like that, is
there another front court you guys have seen this season that has that kind of
size from two players and how would you compare those two with the front
courts you've faced this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously Appel and Pedersen, they've got great size, and we
typically have faced teams that have one six-four post player. We haven't
really had to face two as skilled, as talented as they are. They're
aggressive, play well together.  
Their high-low game is one of the best in the country. It beat us when we went
to Palo Alto and played them. There's no doubt in my mind the high-low game
beat us. Because we did not defend it well. They can stretch you out.  
Their spacing on offense is obviously very, very good but particularly in the
high-low action with those two.  
  
Q. Just to continue that a little bit, can you talk about Pedersen,
specifically your impressions of her, and if indeed they do try to force
Candace to her left, what are the dangers of spending so much energy trying to
force a player to go one particular way?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I recruited Kayla. Went out and watched her
practice and loved her game. And I thought that she was very, very skilled as
a high school player and just had a great stroke, which she obviously has
demonstrated and fit in extremely well with the Stanford team.  
But what was the second part of --  
  
Q. If they do really try to force Candace to her left, what are the risks of
doing that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I mean, we've been in situations where we've tried to
force players left, not because of an injury, but because they didn't have a
good left hand. I think Candace can -- I think she can go left. I don't think
that's a problem as far as taking the ball off the dribble.  
Will she shoot the ball left-handed? Probably not. But with her size and
obviously she's going against size, I still think she can make shots going
either way.  
And I've had situations where I thought we had to do that. You know, even in
national championship playoffs, and if that's what it takes, that's what you
do. I guess I go back to our first championship, and I thought our scouting
defense of forcing them left, we went and played Long Beach State, I think
that was key to our victory. So it can be effective.  
  
Q. Do you think that you've ever had a player that's come to Tennessee and
really fully understood the expectations there? Because realistically you
never find too many coaches who say I found a fault with a team going a 34-2
season, a Final Four season. At what point do they start really understanding
what it means to play for your program?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I try to explain it in the recruiting process. And I
start by saying: If you're not a great competitor and you're not committed to
hard work, and there's a reason they call it hard work, don't come here.
Because you'll be miserable and I'll be miserable. And when I ain't happy,
ain't nobody in the camp happy.  
And, I mean, I've had a lot of one-on-one conversations. And even with the
parents. I've had players that I've said: I like your game in terms of how
skilled you are. But I don't like the way that you take possessions off, you
don't bring the intensity all the time. I like to watch them practice more
than watch them in the game because you learn so much more about players when
you watch them practice every day. I mean, you see who they really are and
what they're willing to bring, to get better.  
And I've made some mistakes, obviously, in players. And it was a long four
years. And they didn't play a whole lot.  
  
Q. This team's confidence obviously has served it well in the last couple of
games. Do you think earlier in the year, when you weren't so happy with them,
that overconfidence might have been an issue with this team?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, definitely. I mean, they thought they were going to win
every game. They thought they were real good. I'm not sure they thought they
had to work as hard as they worked the previous year. I think that goes with
winning a championship. It's tough. That's one reason I want to go back to
touching third base. I asked Larry Pratt when we donated or dedicated the
Pratt Pavilion, which he obviously committed to significantly.  
I asked him if he would speak to my team before we played. And he came in and
he talked about touching third base and there being no shortcuts to success.
Of course, I spent a lot of time with him telling him how this team was
driving me nuts and that they really needed to understand attention to details
matter.  
And he did a phenomenal job. And I think that had a great impact on them, just
knowing there's obviously -- always say there's no shortcuts to success, and
we took a lot of them. But I think that was also something that helped us be
more attentive, and also realize that we're not as good as we really thought
we were.  
  
Q. When did he talk to them?  
COACH SUMMITT: The day after the dedication.  
  
Q. If my short memory doesn't let me down here, you were talking a lot about
paint points in Oklahoma City. Looking at the stat sheet from last night, you
guys only went to the line seven times. Are those two numbers related, and
what's the focus? Maybe is there a focus on getting both of those up Tuesday
night?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, we win in the paint. We win in the paint over and over
and over. I thought Candace settled for too many jumpers early and shied away
from the contact. And once she started going inside, and obviously I thought
Alexis and Alberta, if you look at what Alberta and Shannon brought to our
team last night, without those two, we don't win.  
I just go back and thank my staff for bringing those two in. But we win in the
paint, we couldn't, for whatever reason, could not get to the line very often.
And then we didn't make free throws.  
  
Q. Is it just a little bit of you that's happy that this whole press
conference is not Pat and Geno and the whole feud?  
COACH SUMMITT: I would say I didn't want any -- I wouldn't want any of that as
far as being a distraction. It's not about the coaches. This is all about
players. And unfortunately I think some of the media folks out there wanted to
make it about Pat and Geno. And it's all about the players.  
  
Q. You talked about Stanford being an even better team now than when you
originally played them earlier in the season around Christmas. What is it
going to take to beat them now at this point? Can you talk about the play of
the game?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's going to take a tremendous defensive effort. It's going to
take control in the boards better than we have. They're such a great passing
team. They run the triangle offense with great efficiency, because they're so
skilled and they pass and they read and they make shots.  
And they've got people, obviously, that can make plays. Create. So we've got
our hands full. We have a great challenge. But I have a lot of confidence in
this team. They've been on this stage. They understand what it's going to take
and they just have to bring it. It's not a time to do anything other than step
up and bring your A game, individually and collectively we have to be on.  
  
Q. Along that line, do you guys have to score more tomorrow night than you
have been to win this game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. We've got to make shots. Alexis Hornbuckle has got
to score for us. I challenged both those guards last night. Alberta made
shots, made plays. Shannon. I gave Shannon the green light. I was in her ear
constantly telling her get in the corner, look for the 3 ball. I thought she
and Alberta responded really, really well.  
For whatever reason, Alexis just couldn't make shots. I don't know if she put
too much pressure on herself. Hopefully we get in the national championship
game and we can be a little relaxed, a little more relaxed with certain
players.  
I thought Vicki Baugh played with a lot of freedom last night. We had Alex
Fuller come in, she's been shooting the ball great. Rushed. I would have said
that she would be a player that would come in and help settle us down.  
So we were overanxious. We were really overanxious offensively. And after
watching the tape, I'm even more convinced of that. So we've got to have some
composure and be more relaxed offensively.  
  
Q. What do you remember about recruiting Shannon and Nicky?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, with Nicky, obviously I just remember going up and going
to school with her and going and just sitting on a bench with Nikki Caldwell
and just getting to know her a lot better.  
We went over to visit with Nicky and her coaches and her mom came, Ngozi.
She's about five-foot-four. That may be stretching it a little bit. Ngozi came
in and sat down and she goes, oh, Pat Summitt -- she said, I just want you to
know that my daughter's going to play for you. And Nicky was sitting between
us and she punched her mother, like, Mom, because she already set up visits to
go to Georgia and Duke, and come to Tennessee and her mother was a big reason
she came here.  
And I asked her mother why. And she just said, I have watched you coach for
many years. I think you're a strong role model for women and I want my
daughter to be in that setting.  
And even when Nicky came on a visit and she called her mother, she said, put
Pat on the phone, and she goes: She's coming there, don't worry. (Laughter).
So Ngozi, I don't know if you know the story, but when she came from Africa to
New York, and they lived in the Projects. She had Nicky and some of the older
children help raise the younger son. And she went back to get her degree and
she -- her first classroom she walked in was in the sixth grade. And she went
on to graduate from high school and go to nursing school. She's a self-made
woman and a woman I have tremendous respect for.  
And Shannon, I never actually went to New York and visited with her family.
They came on an official visit. Her mom and dad were very supportive. Rutgers
got involved late. I thought there was a good possibility there that we might
lose out in the end. But I think the fact that they had so many guards, and I
said: Shannon, look, just look around. It's not a matter of will you play,
it's a matter of you've got to come and play a lot of minutes here at
Tennessee. And I think in the end I think her parents and her high school
coach, they were very instrumental in helping us seal the deal in the end.  
  
Q. Do you remember sitting on a bench with Nicky?  
COACH SUMMITT: Yeah, it was out on Staten Island overlooking the water.  
  
Q. I know you have family here, Mom's here, and others who helped teach you
basketball. Everyone knows it's competitive. Where does that drive come in
you, the drive that makes you swing at a raccoon and try to put your own
shoulder back in place?  
COACH SUMMITT: I grew up on a dairy farm and cows don't take a day off. You
milk twice a day. Fortunately we were in school. I didn't have to milk in the
morning. But I went and helped my mother and my dad. My parents are the
hardest working people I've ever known in my life.  
And I just remember my dad taking me out to a hay field and leaving me there
and saying, you need to bale this hay. And I said, Dad, I've never done that.
Or actually rake it. I said, I've never done that. He said, well, you're going
to do it today.  
So I got on the tractor. He drove off. And I got it done. And he came back in
about four hours. And I said, how does it look? He said, it's fine. Got in the
truck, took off. And we raised tobacco. I was in the tobacco fields early and
stayed there late. Typically if I was going to plow tobacco, I would take a
sack lunch with me. And I did that for hours upon hours.  
And as far as the basketball part of it, at night, after we finished all of
our chores, we went and played in a hay loft. We had lights. And we had the
neighborhood kids come over and we had some knock-down, drag-out, one-on-one,
two-on-two. My brother Tommy, who played at Austin Peay, I'm still mad at him
because he didn't go to Tennessee, because he was recruited to play at the
University of Tennessee. He chose a different route.  
But he was just tough and they didn't take it easy on me. They just would run
over me. But that was okay. So that's just a little bit of background on how I
grew up and I just -- I admire my parents so much. My mother, she's here.
She's 84 years old. She's had seven ankle operations. She's had all kinds of
-- she had to have her knee fixed, her shoulders. She just keeps going. She's
my inspiration.  
  
Q. In your time, in all the NCAA tournaments, can you remember anybody
having a tournament like Candice Wiggins has had carrying her team, scoring
over 40 points twice, putting up the 25 last night? Anyone you can remember
coming close to that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Sheryl Swoopes. Texas Tech. I don't know how many points she
put up. I know in that championship game she dominated when they played Ohio
State, I believe it was, in Atlanta.  
That would be the only person that comes to my mind right off. And I don't
know her stat line. But what Candice did in the regionals and what she did
here, it's just so impressive. And obviously just the confidence that she's
playing with and the efficiency.  
  
Q. I'm not trying to be antagonistic and I hope you don't take it this way,
but is it fair to blame the media for the feud angle when you and Geno have
been going tit-for-tat back at that end. When the series got cancelled, you've
been around long enough to know that this was going to be a story, and when
there's been no definitive definition before, can you really say it's unfair
that this story is still around?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I think it's fair to say that because of all the unknown,
that people are still digging and interested and writing about it. I can
respect that from the media. It doesn't mean that I'm going to reveal
anything. But that's just -- when I make my mind up, I'm as stubborn as my
father was.  
  
Q. You say your mom's your inspiration. How does it feel to have her here at
the games? And then also how important is the role of the fans at these games?
How do those two things tie together? One, your mom, how do you feel about
that, and how important are the fans?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it's great to have my mom with me. She's spent a lot of
time with me in the last couple of years after the death of my dad. Everyone
else lives at home. She's got 18 grandkids and great grandkids combined. So I
brought my whole family here. My brothers, their wives, kids, everybody. I
said, I hope I get a good bonus. But my family is just -- they're just so
important.  
And our fans are amazing. It's like senior night, I'm standing out there with
those seniors and there's probably 22,000 people in the gym, and, I mean, we
had the best attendance we've ever had this year.  
And just seeing all the orange when I walked out last night, it was amazing. I
had no idea that we'd have as many people here. I know we had about six
charter flights come in on private planes, which was great. Bruce Pearl was
here. I didn't get to see him. But I just appreciate the relationship I have
with Bruce and obviously Dr. Petersen and his wife Carol. And our
administration is there to support us in a huge way. But our fans, a lot of
these fans come are from all over the country.  
Nashville I had a lady walk up and say that she was from Montana. And I'm
like: What are you doing here? And she said: I've just been a Tennessee fan
forever. So I just appreciate all of our fans.  
  
Q. I wanted to get you to talk a little bit about your starting five,
because it seems like the more you talk about the way they come through for
you, it seems like -- that last play in the game last night, it's like they do
exactly what you need them to do in those crucial situations. Kind of like an
autopilot situation for you almost.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, just like what we did last night, we flattened out, and
we've practiced this, late-game situations. Probably not as much as I should.
Because we haven't had the close games in the regular season at times that
you're going to have when you get into post season play.  
But I think that the composure comes from the experience and the confidence
that they have. They're a team that -- I don't think people like appreciate
how they play defense. And you really -- it's hard to explain it until you go
against it. And like our practice guys have made us so much better. They go
against our practice guys, it's brutal. It's like we got in post season, I
tell the practice guys, don't foul anyone, don't touch anyone.  
They were I'm sure they felt like little sissies out there standing around.
Because of how our team, they know one way to play on the defensive end when
they're in their man to man, and that's just to go after it. And coming down
the stretch last night, the composure they had I think is because they've been
there. They've been there. They were there a year ago. And I think the fact
that they've been to Final Fours and they have a lot of confidence in each
other, I think that really helps us.  
  
Q. How do they rate against past teams?  
COACH SUMMITT: The Holdsclaw, Catchings, Jolly, Randall group, that group was
a great starting five.  
I think if you compare, the Holdsclaw group was -- that they were a better
offensive team. Not necessarily a better defensive team. But they were a
better offensive team from all spots.  
  
Q. To follow up on the comment about Coach Auriemma, did you anticipate if
the game had come to play that you were going to have to answer the questions
about the series, what was your tact going to be? And, secondly, can you give
us an indication of what it's going to take to mend the fences from your point
of view, if in fact there's a rift that needs to be mended?  
COACH SUMMITT: I hadn't really thought about the questions that I might get
asked, because I wasn't going to really talk about anything, other than
players. I have tremendous respect for Geno's coaching skills and abilities
and I think he made us better. They beat us enough that it made us better.  
And the fact that we're not both here today, it's not going to change what I
want to say or talk or what it takes to mend it. I haven't even gone there. My
mind right now is on trying to figure out how we can win one more game against
a great basketball team. And that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. A moment ago you talked about the composure your team has shown. Can you
talk about Stanford's composure, especially since, aside from Wiggins, they're
a pretty young roster and what they've done in this tournament to this
point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Great composure. Well-oiled machine. They are clicking on all
cylinders. They have great composure. They answer runs. They make plays. I'm
just totally impressed with their team and how they all fit together and play
together.  
  
Q. Candace Parker has been through a lot. Are you worried about how much she
has left?  
COACH SUMMITT: Her tank was just about empty last night emotionally. I think
it's more the emotional part of it than anything. I'm hopeful that she can get
some rest. That's a key thing. I think she's spent a lot of time with Jenny in
rehabbing, but I think her shoulder responded and hopefully that time won't be
as extensive now that she is in a better place.  
But she needs rest. She needs rest. I mean, Candace Parker was not Candace
Parker last night, in terms of offensively. And I think she'll be much better
on Tuesday night.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Candace. To what extent
was there any conversation in terms of maybe allowing her to stay another year
or did she just come in and say: Coach, I've made up my mind, I'm going even
though I've got eligibility left?  
COACH SUMMITT: Candace, I didn't know what she was going to do. There's always
rumors flying all around, until she said she was going to go through senior
night, and she did ask me, why haven't you asked me to stay? And I said, well,
Candace, I would love for you to stay, but it's strictly your decision. She's
a very bright student. If she stayed she'd be in grad school.  
But I think Candace has mapped out everything from wanting to win a national
championship to then playing in the Olympics and the WNBA. She kind of mapped
out her path or the path she wanted to take for the next couple of years at
least.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you to look back a little bit and forward a little bit,
if you don't mind. You talked about Tara changing as a coach. Can you think
about the coach you were in your formative years and how you might have
changed? And then looking forward a little bit, have you thought about how
much more time you want to give to this crazy sport, how many more titles you
want to win?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've changed so much, I don't even know myself at times. I
think when I started out coaching I think I was so tough on players and so
demanding and I think I've come to realize that they really don't care how
much you know until they know how much you care.  
And it wasn't that I didn't care about them, I just don't think -- probably
this is how I grew up -- that I had the skills of sitting down and
communicating and knowing when to raise my voice and when to be soft, and I
think I treated every player about the same.  
And that was just my inexperience. I took the job when I was 22 years old. I
had four players 21. I thought I was going to be a graduate assistant. Well, I
made a stipend of $250 a month. And not having ever coached a day in my life,
I was just trying to get through it. I was reading books. I was calling
people. Coach Moore, who is my Olympic coach, my mentor, helped me
tremendously. My brother, Tommy, who also coached high school basketball. I
went home. I met with him about what are we going to do here, what am I going
to run on offense, what am I going to run on defense.  
I remember I coached my first game. I call home and my mother, my sweet
mother, answers the phone. She didn't even ask me if we won. And all she
wanted to do: How are you doing? Are you enjoying it? How's your team? I was
like, oh, just put Dad on the phone, let's get this over with.  
So my father, who never has said hello in his life, he goes: All right. And I
was waiting for it. And he goes: Did you win? I said, no, sir, we got beat.
And he goes: By how much? And I go: One point. Long pause. I knew he was going
to blame me. Long, long pause. And he goes: Well, let me just tell you one
thing, Trisha. Don't take donkeys to the Kentucky Derby.  
And I knew what he was telling me. You gotta get players. I thought I had a
pretty good team. But that stuck with me.  
And it's all about recruiting great players and having the talent. And I think
I learned so much in those first years about myself and I've changed because I
want these student-athletes to know they are family to me and they're
daughters to me and they will to be for the rest of their lives.  
How long am I going to do this? I don't know. When I walk on the court for
practice, I love practice. I mean, I love practice. I can't wait to go to
practice. It's like the highlight of my day.  
When I go to practice and I step on the court and I don't have that in my
heart, I'm not going to cheat the players. I'll walk away. I don't think I'll
do it in the middle of the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Quianna Chaney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18071)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined at the podium by LSU head coach Van Chancellor,
Quianna Chaney and Erica white.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Tough way to lose a basketball game. I really feel for our
seniors. They have done everything I've asked them to do since I was appointed
LSU coach. And they've done so much and overcome so much and I'm really proud
of them graduating. They do such a great job. And I am sorry I couldn't help
them win.  
Ask the players questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Erica and Q, if you could just sort of say what was going on on that last
play?  
ERICA WHITE: Candace Parker took the ball, drove it the length of the floor,
and I think someone came over to double. She ditched the ball to a teammate,
missed an open layup. They got the rebound and got a second chance at it.
That's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Can you tell me what was going through your mind as it happened and as it
unfolded?  
ERICA WHITE: Personally I was thinking just trying to keep the ball in front
of us, try to stop the ball. That's something that we didn't do. We let
Candace Parker drive the ball the length of the floor. And I was just thinking
just block out, try to get a rebound. And that's something else that we didn't
do.  
  
Q. After you made the two free throws, Erica, to put you all up, did you
feel pretty good about your chances if you all could play some defense
there?  
ERICA WHITE: Yeah, I definitely felt good about our chances. I knew I'd knock
it down. And I felt confident in our defense. But we just didn't make a play.
We failed to make a play at the end and I think with seven seconds to go, we
turned Tennessee one time, if we made Candace Parker just cross the ball over
one time, I think we'd win. But we failed to do that and so we lost.  
  
Q. Could both of you talk about the game that Sylvia played today and what
that says about her?  
ERICA WHITE: I think that it says that Sylvia's a competitor and that she's
not going to back down from any challenge. She's been hearing about Candace
Parker all week, and she knew that she was going to go up against a tough
player. But at the same time she knows what she brings to the game, and 20
rebounds and 24 points is a heck of a game for anyone to have one time, but
Sylvia's done that many times in her career.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree. She came out. She did the best she can do. Like Erica
said, 20 points and got a lot of rebounds, 24 points and 20 rebounds, what
more could you ask for?  
  
Q. I realize it's fresh, but I'm not going to get a chance to ask you
tomorrow, can you reflect a little bit on your careers and how you're seniors
and this was your last game for LSU?  
ERICA WHITE: I think we've had an awesome career here. For any team to make it
to the Final Four one time, I don't care what anyone says, is an
accomplishment. For us to get here every year is definitely something that no
one can discredit. We have done some amazing things here.  
I think that one thing, we just lacked in confidence on the offensive end. And
Coach Van has done an excellent job in helping us with that this year, but for
whatever reason we just weren't confident tonight.  
But I think our legacy will be one that definitely did the job in building up
the LSU program and giving it -- putting the LSU program on the national
stage.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree. As a senior, the things that we've done -- we've done
some great things that a lot of teams haven't done, five straight Final Fours,
who wouldn't love to be here.  
So I will say that I enjoy my years here at LSU.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is this the toughest loss you've experienced in your career?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, especially when I thought we had it won, and I had it
won, but had a great shot. Up 1, they've got to go the full length of the
court. And it's really a tough loss when I think about these kids and what all
they have gone through for four years. I really feel for them.  
  
Q. Did you see where Sylvia was when the last bucket was made? Could you see
where she was?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, she had gone over to help double-team Parker. That
wasn't Sylvia's fault.  
  
Q. Just on that play, was that a problem that Candace was able to get that
far down court that quickly, did you see that?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought the problem was we were wanting to turn her, never
did turn her one time. She got down to the other end on the basket. In seven
seconds she had time to get the ball to the other end, missed a shot and pass
it, miss a shot and get a rebound. That's a lot of time.  
  
Q. This might be too fresh, but where does LSU go from here?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That would be about the least concern that I have in the
whole world. I don't mean that bad, it's just how I see it.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at the game as a whole, you guys really battled
back, especially at the end. Do you feel like this is a game that you deserve
to win?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Not the way we played. I thought it was a game we could have
won. I think when you shoot 30-something percent, 11 percent and 38 percent
from the free throw line, you have a chance to win it at the end. You're lucky
you had a shot.  
Offensively, all the things I've been trying to instill in this team and I
thought I had, they all came back tonight. We didn't play with the confidence
offensively. We played with it defensively.  
  
Q. Sylvia looked like she was playing hurt. At the end was she hurt?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: The reason she's not here. She's bad cramping, it was all we
could do to keep her in the game at the end.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team in the locker room after the game?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I felt bad for them. I told them, I feel bad in some way,
somehow, I was unable to help them win. I can't explain to you what all this
team has gone through in the last year and a half. And I just wanted them to
experience winning a game at the Final Four, and I just felt bad because some
way, somehow, I couldn't help them get there.  
  
Q. Did you feel they were doing -- you've played them twice this year
before, did you feel they were doing something different against Sylvia,
trying to keep her off her spots early in the game anyway?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: If you want my honest opinion, we got her 24 shots. We
haven't got her 24 shots all year. We were getting the ball to Sylvia right
where we wanted it. That was not our problem. Then they doubled us because we
couldn't make a shot from anywhere else.  
  
Q. Coach, can you describe who was supposed to be on that side with
Hornbuckle? Seemed like everybody went to Parker.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I don't think it's fair to the player. I won't describe
that. You want to describe it, you can. I'm not one of those who is going to
blame players. I should have done something different to help my players to
not have been in that position. I was trying to turn Parker and I couldn't get
that done and that cost a mismatch.  
  
Q. How affected by the harness do you think that Parker was?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: How what?  
  
Q. How affected by the apparatus, by the --  
COACH CHANCELLOR: No question, she ain't never been 6 for 27 in her life. She
had a gutted performance tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll do some opening statements, and questions for the
student-athletes. We're joined up here by Tennessee head coach Pat Summitt, as
well as student-athletes Candace Parker, Shannon Bobbitt and Alexis
Hornbuckle.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously I'm very proud of our basketball team, because we
fought through a lot of adversity tonight. Did not shoot the ball particularly
well, and that really at times I thought could have affected our defense.  
But I thought our defense, for the most part, had some great stops and stands,
and that's what you have to have when you're shooting the ball poorly. And
obviously we couldn't figure out how to get to the free throw line. When I
look at those two things, just thinking that it was difficult for us. I mean,
we were 2 for 7 from the line. Obviously they got to the line a lot more than
we did.  
But I'm just proud of our team for fighting through some adversity, when
things wouldn't go our way, for whatever reason. I thought our defense did
step up and also I thought we had different players step up and help us out
tonight, and that was huge for us.  
A little bit more balance, at least in terms of trying to get people involved.
Obviously, Alberta did a great job for us in that regard. I just thought we
hung tough. Shannon had some big plays for us, and obviously Candace was a
target and had a target on her back all night. But she stood tough as well.  
So a good win for us, just proud of this team. We're back where we wanted to
be and it's because they fought through adversity and never quit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you kind of go over that last shot and did you realize you
hadn't made a shot all night before the last few seconds?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I mean, of course I realized I didn't make a shot all
night. It was frustrating, but at the same time I knew I couldn't give up on
myself and my team. It's bigger than yourself when you come to the Final Four.
I just wanted to stay positive and I crashed the boards and I looked up and I
said, I don't want to pull this down; with my luck, I might as well try to tip
it in. And luckily it went in.  
  
Q. Can you describe what your limitations were? Seemed like you weren't
running the court with the same ferocity but you went to the boards after an
initial hesitation. Can you talk about that?  
CANDACE PARKER: First, I want to say how proud I am of my team. They really
stepped up and gutted it out and were great teammates. And, secondly, I feel
like early on I was a little hesitant. I feel like in the game I was a little
hesitant to go to my counter and be able to go to my left hand. But Coach got
in my ear about rebounding midway through the first half, and I just went in
there and just wanted to give it everything I had.  
  
Q. Could you guys just talk about the defensive effort tonight on your side
of -- both sides, for that matter?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously LSU is a very defensive team, as are we. And we just
knew that we couldn't let them get easy looks. Coach talked about the high-
low. And we really looked at the North Carolina game that they played in and
we realized that they did a good job of working the high-low. So we knew we
had to take that away.  
And obviously get out on Quianna Chaney, she's a great 3-point shooter. Those
are the two things we looked at. I think we did a really good job of -- we
held them to 18 points in the first half.  
  
Q. Candace, could you talk about the last play, what was going through your
mind? Were you told to pass, because you've had a tough shooting night or what
was your strategy on that last play?  
CANDACE PARKER: No, I really want to say I'm happy my team still had
confidence in me after this game, shooting as poorly as I did, to put the ball
in my hands at the end of the game. That's what I wanted. I knew I wanted to
just come down and create, whether it was a shot or a pass, whatever it was. I
just wanted to come down. We've worked on that in practice a number of times
and been in those situations. So I was just going to take what the defense
gave me.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about your shoulder, how it might have affected you
throughout the game? I saw you wince a couple of times. And if you changed
anything from the last round until tonight's game, knowing that it might be a
different game for you?  
CANDACE PARKER: I made the decision to step out on the court. I'm not going to
make any excuses about my shoulder or anything like that. It's fine. I'm going
to continue with the same rehab process. And just go from there. I'm really
excited that we're in Tuesday's game.  
  
Q. Shannon, don't look shocked that someone's asking you a question. I saw
that. Several times during the night Pat would pull you aside and talk to you
by yourself. What would she say to you and how would you assess how you ran
your team tonight?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: At times when we were in the clutch times, she would tell me
keep my composure and be the great point guard that I am and make sure I get
my teammates involved and stay positive throughout the whole game.  
COACH SUMMITT: And hunt shots (laughter).  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about Sylvia Fowles today and the effort she gave?
Obviously she doesn't want to go out with a loss.  
CANDACE PARKER: She's a great player. She's really improved every year and I
think that's what makes her special. Obviously having led her team to the
Final Four four times that she's been on here. And I really just think that
she's going to do great things at the next level and obviously, you know, we
were competitors when we step on the court. But off the court she's a great
person and I'm really excited about what she's done in her career.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Pat, did you get the sense that running the floor hard was bothering
Candace's arm, because the last couple of games she's been flying down to the
low post and she wasn't doing that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I really thought tonight just watching Candace, I thought
Candace's emotionally struggling. Just what she's been through and also I
don't think Candace has had a lot of sleep. She's spent a tremendous amount of
hours in her rehab.  
First thing I ask her pregame today is did you sleep. She said -- I guess she
had taken about a two-hour nap. But I think just what she went through
emotionally, can I play? Is my shoulder going to come out again? And I think
she was a little emotionally spent.  
But I just kept trying to be positive with her. And encourage her. But I think
there were times early on she took some possessions off on the defensive end
because of fatigue. And she needs a lot of rest between now and Tuesday night.  
  
Q. Seemed though in spite of all that her ferocity as a competitor still
came out?  
COACH SUMMITT: It did. I mean, I was probably a little demanding on her in the
first half. I knew at halftime I needed to switch my approach and just really
be positive with her, because I realized that she was a little emotionally
whipped, and that she was a little frustrated, too.  
We weren't getting any opportunities to go to the free throw line, and she was
taking it hard to the basket. And obviously Sylvia, she's a tough defender,
and so I think Candace got a little frustrated.  
In the second half I realized for the whole team that my role was one of a
cheerleader. And I compliment my assistants, they gave me a lot of good
suggestions, what to run offensively and defensively. And for the most part I
was really just trying to be very engaged with the emotional level of our team
and keep things positive.  
  
Q. Pat, still with everything that was going on with Candace, you still put
it in her hands for the last play. What was your strategy? What did you tell
your team right before then? What did you want her to do?  
COACH SUMMITT: I mean, the first thing that Nikki Caldwell says is we gotta
get the ball to Candace. I didn't disagree with her. I think when you have the
best player in the game, the best player needs to have the ball in her hands
when the game's on the line.  
And I trusted Candace to make the play for us, and I thought it might also
draw attention and we might be able to get someone else an open look if they
decided to double. But as things turned out, obviously you gotta give Alexis a
lot of credit. She's come up with some big plays for us in late seconds.  
But I still -- I'd do it over and over and over. You give your best player,
your best offensive player the ball.  
  
Q. Pat, could you just kind of go over from your viewpoint, watching that
last few seconds on that last possession, what you saw and did you think it
was over with when Anosike missed the first shot?  
COACH SUMMITT: I was fearful it was over with just because of the clock. And
then Alexis comes up and makes a tremendous play. If you look at Alexis, and
I've said this, she's one of the most athletic guards I've ever coached. She
struggled tonight. I just really felt like it would be hard for us to win if
Alexis didn't play well offensively.  
But at that time when she went up, I went straight to the clock, and I
realized then that we had time to get the shot off when I saw her go up. I
looked up at the time and the next thing I know it's going in.  
  
Q. Pat, you mentioned that Candace was tired there in the second half. You
took her out for a while, maybe a couple minutes or so there. Decent stretch.
What's the risk and reward to keeping her out or putting her back in?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I mean, it's really kind of a guessing game. But I think
just knowing Candace as well as I do, I thought, you know, Candace just needs
a little breather, because she was fatigued.  
But I really -- I firmly believe it was more emotional than anything. She
wanted to help her team. She was willing to lay things on the line. But I just
-- as I said, she's been through a lot emotionally in the last couple of days.
And I just -- I felt like if I could get her just a little bit of rest, it
might give her two or three quality possessions after she went back in the
game. And she did some good things.  
  
Q. Pat, could you just give your impressions of Stanford?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, we lost to Stanford earlier in the year. And they're
a great basketball team. They're a team that plays very well together. I just
-- I didn't get to watch all the game tonight. But what I saw, I just think
that they have a lot of offensive weapons. They have more offensive weapons
than we've shown we have. We're going to have to have a little more balance.  
And having played them at Stanford -- and I know they're a much better team
now -- but I think I'm glad that we've played them, because we at least know
their personnel. We know some of just some of their tendencies.  
But they're a great basketball team. And Candice Wiggins is playing terrific
for them and providing the kind of leadership by example and vocally that you
need if you're going to be a championship team. We've got our work cut out for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, knowing your history with Connecticut and the big rivalry you've
had for years with them, is there any love loss that you won't be able to play
them in the final game?  
COACH SUMMITT: I haven't even thought about it. All I did was watched to see
who was going to win that game. And my mind was on LSU the whole way. I have a
tremendous amount of respect for Tara VanDerveer and what she's done. And
right now I think her basketball team, they definitely showed they could play
at this level and be a championship level team. So we just gotta get ready.  
  
Q. Anything you're going to specifically try to overcome and work on before
Tuesday?  
COACH SUMMITT: We will. I'll go back and meet with our staff. And they've done
a lot of scouting. At this time of the year, I'm more into letting them do the
scouting and trying to get our team prepared in what sets we want to run and
they tell me what action we have to defend.  
But I will definitely, in the next 24 hours, learn a lot more about the action
that Stanford runs. But bottom line, they just -- they're a skilled basketball
team that shares the ball very well. They're tough on the defensive end and on
the boards.  
So it's going to be a big challenge for us, but I'm just excited that we put
ourselves in the position to be in the national championship game.  
  
Q. What did you tell Van after the game after a game like that and how do
you think LSU played late?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I told Van that obviously they played a great game and
it's a tough way to lose a game like that. And he had done a great job. I just
wanted to compliment him and get a chance to say something to Sylvia and what
a great game she had and what a great player she is.  
And I had some tough losses. I don't remember having one quite like the way
the game ended tonight. I'm sure I did, as long as I've been in the game. But
I knew when it came down to the wire that whatever happened, it was going to
be tough.  
And I'm just thankful that Alexis came up and made a big play and we hung in
there and found a way to win. I'm not sure how, by looking at this stat sheet.
It's confusing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2008

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

### [Ketia Swanier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18486)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined up here by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma,
as well as student-athletes Ketia Swanier and Renee Montgomery.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement. We'll take questions for the
student-athletes, and then back to you.  
COACH AURIEMMA: At this time of the year, especially in this environment,
unless you win, there's really not a lot that you can say that's going to make
any of the players up here, any of the players in the locker room feel any
better.  
There's no words to describe what it means to put everything, your heart and
soul into something and come up short.  
The one thing I will say is it's unfortunate that the season comes down to one
weekend and if it doesn't go your way, the other five months seem to have no
meaning. And that's why this is such a difficult game to lose, or the next
game if you lose that one, because all you remember now, today, at this point,
is what happened in those 40 minutes. You don't remember all the things that
led to getting here.  
So I want them to remember the things that they did to get here and what our
seniors accomplished. And life's thrown a lot of things at us this particular
season. Took away two of our players. Limited one of them. And now the
fairytale didn't have a happy ending. But that's life.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ketia, you got into foul trouble early in this one on Candice, how much
do you think that played a role in not being able to come back there at the
end?  
KETIA SWANIER: I mean, I thought Lorin came in and did what she had to do.
Stanford just executed their offense very well and we didn't hit shots. We
lost to a really good team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, you broke with tradition this year cutting down the
nets at the regional finals, getting the seniors here. Do you think you were
too focused on getting to the Final Four and not winning the national
championship?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: No, our ultimate goal was to win a national championship. I
think the Final Four was just a hurdle that we had to overcome.  
  
Q. How much better was Stanford this time around?  
KETIA SWANIER: They were a lot better. They just didn't have a key focus on
one or two players. Everybody on our team stepped up and instead of having to
guard only two players, you have to guard all five players on the floor. And
they executed their offense really well. They move around a lot. And that's
the big difference, just everybody pretty much stepping up on their team than
at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. Stanford was able to contain Maya it seemed like a lot in the first half
but in the second half she really started going. How much confidence did you
have in her and your team and thinking you were going to be able to come back
when she started hitting the 3s and everything else she did in the second
half?  
KETIA SWANIER: I don't think our team just relies on Maya Moore. The whole
time I never doubted everybody on the floor thought we were going to lose,
even when Maya was missing shots. There was never a point in time we thought
we were going to lose. We played hard the whole way through and you can't
depend on one player hitting shots. Everybody has to do their part, especially
this time of the year.  
  
Q. Obviously the first time you played them you had Mel and Kalana and
Kalana is such a great defensive player, how much did you miss them this time
around?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: A lot. I think we missed them all year, but this game it
really showed. We had to have shorter people guarding Candice a lot. She was
able to get her shot off pretty much any time she wanted. In the beginning in
the Virgin Islands when we had Kalana and Mel, it was tougher for her to get
shots off. We missed them all year, but yeah, definitely it showed up tonight.  
  
Q. Can you pinpoint just a couple of areas where you think if maybe we could
have done this or done that, you might have been able win?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: If we could have executed better on offense, I think really
if we could have made some more shots. We really got a lot of open looks and
pretty much throughout the season we've made the majority of those shots and
it's gotten us momentum, then we continue to make more shots. But I think when
we were getting wide open looks and we were missing them, it was just tough
because it's shots that we usually make and it's part of our offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both of you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Do you think they beat you the way you beat a lot of teams by being
really smart? You've been on the other end of that a lot.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, yeah. Yeah. They didn't make too many mistakes today. And
I think the first ten minutes of the game kind of set the tone for the game.
And one of the things that happened during that first ten minutes was, you
know, the way we play that got us here and just really would kind of stun
people, you know, with the runs that we would go on, bad coaching. We
shouldn't have played like that today.  
Now, you hate to say you want to change the way you play when you get to the
Final Four, but as Renee said, this is the one team we can't match up with
without the two guys that were hurt. Like any other team, you don't
necessarily have to guard all five of them. And they don't guard you. So we
were caught in a situation where they were able to do things to us that we
couldn't do to them. And we needed them to miss some shots and they didn't,
which is what they did in the Virgin Islands.  
Every shot they missed in the Virgin Islands they made it today. Every one.
And that first ten minutes, I'll bet you we spent nine minutes on defense that
first ten minutes. They would come down, run their stuff for about 25 seconds,
get the shot they wanted. We run down, make a pass, sometimes we'd stall and
make two passes. Every once in a while it would be a full-blown delay and we'd
get three passes and somebody would take an open shot. Now, if those go in
like they did for the majority of the season, then it's a different ball game.
But they didn't.  
In retrospect, we didn't do enough to make them play more defense than they
had to. And the thing that got us here hurt us in the end. And when we cut it
to 47-46, I think it was, Wiggins made two straight 3s. Then Pedersen makes
one. They didn't make those in November.  
Stanford played a lot better today. They're a lot better team than they were
back in November and they played the game today the way we usually play it. We
got done in by our own stuff.  
As Tara said, they changed some things after they played us. They added a
couple of things that we did to them and they did them better than we did
today.  
  
Q. When you say bad coaching, what would you have done differently?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I would have used up all five of my timeouts in the first half
to slow our guys down. We couldn't slow them down. They just want to go.
That's the kind of team we are. That's the kind of people we have. They just
want to go.  
They get an open shot, they want to take it. And you can't -- at this time of
the year, you don't want to be tentative. You never want to be tentative. You
never want to be second-guessing yourself, should I shoot it, should I not
shoot it.  
So the way we play the game, when we're open, we shoot it. Well, they weren't
going in. And it was one and done and it was a constant struggle on the
defensive end, because we were down, it seemed like, the majority of the game.  
If we could have stayed on offense a little bit longer, we could have caught
our breath a little bit. Renee's probably a little bit worn out right now
since Mel got hurt. It caught up to her, the 40 minutes, 40 minutes, 40
minutes.  
And we couldn't press. I had this grand strategy. At the 10-minute mark we're
going to press the hell out of these guys. Well, got us to within 1, but we
couldn't.  
And we talked about it at halftime. The way you play Stanford you have to play
them full court. You can't play them half court. It's too much of a mismatch
for us.  
  
Q. You talked about what you had built all season and to have something kind
of just blow up in one game. Could you talk about the hurt of that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't think there's any way that you can explain the
feeling that you have when you lose this game or the national championship
game for that matter.  
Just sitting right here listening to the kids talk, you say to yourself: Man,
when we go back, you know -- somebody asked me, what are you going to tell
your players? I'm going to tell them we'll be back here next year, you can
count on that. Then you sit here and it hits you that's 365 days from now.
That's a lot of practices. That's a lot of drills. That's a lot of games.
That's a lot of travel. That's a lot of injuries, no injuries, good luck, bad
luck.  
The incredible effort that it takes to get here and in a span of 40 minutes
it's gone. And for a player -- I think that's a good word, you're walking
along great and it just blows up and it's gone. It's gone. And it's a stunned
feeling that you have to be there to experience it. You have to have been in
that situation to experience it.  
And all year long, you know, we were holding out hope that it wouldn't catch
up to us. Don't worry about it, we can do it. I heard coaches talk about it on
scouting reports. You have to get to Connecticut's guards, they don't have any
depth in the guard spot, nobody's ever tried to do that to them, gotta get
them, gotta get them, get them in foul trouble, wear them out.  
I thought they better hurry up. We only have two games left. And they got us
today.  
  
Q. Will you watch Tuesday's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I have to, I'm on the WBCA's board of directors. So I
was told I have to be here for that game. But I would watch it anyway. I would
watch it anyway. And I'm sure my players will watch it. It's part of who you
are. It's part of what you do. It's our game.  
  
Q. The people back home might have been sitting there asking: Well, why
didn't they play the pressure defense the whole game. I think I know the
answer. But you gotta say it.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. When the game started, the plan was that we would
alternate between some pressure. And if we had some success with it, we would
do more. The problem was, you don't make enough shots, so you can't get into
your pressure. You don't get to the free throw line, so you can't set up your
pressure. Your starting point guard goes down with two fouls. So now you're
really short on bodies. And I think we would have lost worse if we would have
played like that from the beginning.  
But I'm sure there's a lot of coaches out there right now that watched the
game, real and imaginary coaches, that have a lot of ideas that we could have
done differently.  
  
Q. Is it possible that you guys just ran into a team that's on a magical
run?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's always possible. And that's always the case when a team
has a really hot player. I think Candice Wiggins has been the best player in
this tournament from the very first game. And I said this yesterday, or the
day before, actually, when we had a press conference about the game, that when
the other players are making shots like they are right now for Stanford, it
gives Candice a lot more room to maneuver and a lot more room to do what she
wants to do. And then she's a really tough matchup.  
Those kids knocked in shots today that didn't even come close to going in in
November. But now they're going in. I watched the Maryland game, and they went
in in the Maryland game. And I talked to a couple friends of mine, and they
said you know what the key to beating Stanford is? I said, all right, what?
Well, Kayla Pedersen has to go one for something and Hones has to go one for
something and the other perimeter player has to go one for something and then
Wiggins and Jayne Appel can have whatever they want.  
Well, that didn't happen. And that's what makes them the team that they are
right now. They're a very difficult team to play right now. Very difficult.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined at the podium by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel, Candice Wiggins and Kayla
Pedersen.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement and we'll get started.  
COACH VANDERVEER: This is a great win for our team, our program. I'm just so
proud of all of our team. Everyone really worked hard. Connecticut is a great
team, and obviously with their success, Geno is a great coach, so we knew we
would have to play our absolute A game.  
And I think what we were able to do was we were able to keep them off the O
boards. We boxed out pretty well. We took care of the ball, especially in the
first half, not turning it over. And we didn't take -- our shot selection was
good. And I think people worked really, really hard on defense. And we had to,
because they have great talent.  
And I'm just really excited to see the improvement in our team, and I just --
we want to keep it going, obviously just one more game.  
But this is thrilling for me, personally, and for our team.  
  
Q. Candice, it was such a hurdle to get back to the Final Four, can you just
talk about the team's focus and sort of coming into this game, you know, what
everybody's mind-set was?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think, first of all, we were just -- the thing that's
driving this team is the fact we don't want to stop playing with each other.
Me especially, this is my last time I'll be able to play with this group. And
everyone, they just don't want it to end. We don't want the season to end. I
think that's what's driving this team.  
And especially you look at we lost to Connecticut. We got killed by
Connecticut back in November, just absolutely killed. And, you know, they
changed the whole dynamic of our team. And so we grouped before the game and
we said: Let's see how much better we've gotten. This is a test for ourselves
to see, you know, we're not the same team we were in November. I think that's
what we really wanted to prove to ourselves and then the country, too.  
  
Q. Jayne, about six -- I think I wrote it down in my notes -- I don't have
it here -- 6:33 left, looked like you got a little tired. Were you feeling a
little bit down and UConn seemed to have energy, but then you guys came
back?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think going into the game, UConn is a good team. They're going
to make their runs and it's a lot easier to run when you have a lot of
momentum and everything. It's how you counter those runs, I think.  
I think that we did pretty well, when they went on a run we kind of picked it
up on our end and countered that back.  
  
Q. Candice, they got within one there early in the second half and you hit
the two 3s on the wing there. What did that do to help the momentum for you
guys to never let them get the lead back?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I was kind of struggling in the beginning of the second half.
And they went to a zone. And just caught it and just made a few 3s, I think
that really helped our team's confidence, where the pressure wasn't really on
us.  
And I think just our drive and our will not to let them come back. And we
stuck together. They had runs. They're going to -- teams are going to make
runs, but I think what our team is best at is not letting that discourage us
and pulling ourselves together and saying, okay, let's stop it.  
  
Q. Kayla, at least two or three different people had part of the time on
Maya Moore, and everybody did a pretty effective job. Can you just talk about
the rotating defense that you used on her?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well, I think that our guards did a great job switching. At
the end there we switched 1 through 4, so just whoever was guarding. I think
we did a great job contesting all of her 3s and a great job, like, Jayne
helping making our layups.  
  
Q. Candice and Jayne, Kayla was so consistent, probably the most consistent
player on the floor tonight until you two got going. Freshman coming out here
playing like that in a national semifinals, what did that mean to you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: First of all, Kayla is not a freshman. She hasn't played like
that since the first game she played in a Stanford uniform. I think it gives
us so much confidence as teammates to look at Kayla and know that every single
game she's going to go her hardest and she's got this focus and this will to
win. And Kayla might be quiet. You know inside she's so fierce and just not
going to let up for anything.  
And I think the best thing about Kayla, personally, is that, you know, she
does something, she makes any kind of mistake, you look at her, she's like:
All right, all right, I got it. She doesn't get down and hang her head. Which
I think is a rare quality, I think, to have in a freshman.  
  
Q. Candice, you guys, there was so much talk about Geno and Pat and what the
Final was going to be like. Did you feel like you guys were a little bit of a
stealth candidate here, and are you happy to disrupt the story line?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, I think we were probably slept on a little bit. A lot
of people didn't have us coming to the Final Four in the first place. I think
we've being on the West Coast we haven't been in the Final Four in a while and
we understand that maybe our names aren't as big. But that just -- that feeds
us and we have a lot of motivation behind that.  
  
Q. I haven't seen the final box scores, so I don't know your total tally,
but how important, I guess, for any of you ladies, were your rebounds,
Candice, especially with how you were able to get your defensive rebounds?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think I was sort of not necessarily a helper. But I wasn't
really focused on Maya Moore, so kind of able to let me go in there and help
the posts box out and rebound. I think rebounding in general is important. And
I think we won the rebounding margin. I think that really helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about the minute you guys got off the bench from
Jillian tonight?  
JAYNE APPEL: Tara called it. She said she was -- Jill's game in the beginning.
Jill I think has been due for a really good game. And Jill's, if you sleep --
we felt like our team was slept on, but Jill kind of had a feeling they were
sleeping on her, you know. But I think she really came off the bench and she
really got us going and had some really key plays for us and rebounds. And
Jill's just a tougher player and she's the kind of player that's really hard
to scout on her.  
  
Q. For any of the players, there's been talk of a Big East kind of bias.
Obviously, all people East Coast in general, Maryland getting the No. 1 seed,
I know you were a little disappointed with that. How much does this disrupt
the bias about East Coast women's basketball?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that from the very beginning everyone saw our faces
plastered all over ESPN at the seeding show when we got the No. 2 seed. But I
think it almost drives us more to prove not only to ourselves but to everyone
else that we can play out with the East Coast teams and just because we're on
the West Coast we have a lot of talent out there. And I think it will be a lot
more to come in the years.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: And just to add to that, I think the biggest thing is winning
games and winning games like this to show in the past maybe in these kind of
games we lose, but just I think it was important for us to show through our
play instead of through words. So that's really also another thing.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I think that them giving us a No. 2 seed they could have
done for us, because that just motivated us and gave us that extra push to
show the East Coast what we're all about.  
  
Q. Candice, what's the magic behind this year's team that has made you guys
be able to get to the Final Four and now a championship game?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, it's the type of chemistry that you cannot fake.
You can't try to create. It just happens. And I just think it just happened
from day one. We knew this group was special. We went out to the East Coast.
We played Rutgers in our second game.  
And just those moments, we knew that this was the team. And we had two losses
to UCLA and USC earlier, and I think the biggest thing that showed me that
this team was special after the UCLA and USC losses nothing changed. We didn't
say we're not a good team anymore. We knew we were still a good team and we
just had two bad games and I think that's the best thing that happened to us
this season, too. We kept it going. We didn't let that make us crumble.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, student-athletes.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jumping forward here, who would you like to play in two days?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I have no choice. I mean, we are so excited to be playing in
the championship game. We play Tennessee -- we've played Tennessee the last
two years and we played LSU in the regional final two years ago. So we're
semi-familiar with both teams, and I'm just more concerned about our team and
us playing well.  
And our team is really excited.  
  
Q. Is there any particular way that you're going to change your game plan
heading into the next ball game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No way. We're just going to come out and do what we've been
doing all year and just absolutely -- just do the best that we can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the advantage from playing the earlier game and maybe
having a chance to go out at least in the second half and look at both teams
and seeing which ones you might be facing in the next round?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I love playing the first game. Just such a long day anyway.
And to sit there and just to play the first game is great. And as soon as I
can, I'll be out there watching the tip-off and try to just figure out who
we're going to play and what we need to do.  
  
Q. I asked them about Kayla and just to see what she did until Candice and
Jayne found their touch a little bit. How important was that in her
performance?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought it was huge. I think that was the real key for us.
I thought we were working hard defensively, but Kayla hitting her outside
shot, Kayla hitting her high post shot, it didn't allow them to stay in that
extended two-three defense.  
I think actually the fact that they had -- Swanier was in foul trouble in the
first half, might have been really the thing that hurt them the most.  
But with the two fouls, they were out of their rhythm a little bit. But Kayla
made big plays. Obviously then Jayne and Candice had huge plays.  
  
Q. Couple of questions. One, Connecticut is known for their come-backs and
having big runs, but your team looked very confident. What did you tell your
girls to keep them confident the whole time and not rattled? And, two,
Stanford has obviously had the longest wait to get back to the Final Four
stage. Is a championship going to mean more to your program than any of the
other teams here?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, as far as I really didn't tell our team anything
special. I just said these are things we need to do. And our team really takes
a game plan to heart. And they really worked hard at not allowing Connecticut
to do the things that Connecticut does so well and is so good at. They love to
run. They love to get on the O glass.  
So we really worked hard at that. The fact that we played Connecticut earlier
in the season helped us and helped people's confidence. And I think people
were upset with how we played the first time and we learned a lot from
Connecticut. They have been both Tennessee and Connecticut have been the gold
standard for women's basketball. And so they both have helped us get here.  
As far as the second question was what?  
  
Q. Is it going to mean more to your program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Will it mean more to us? A national championship would mean
-- I mean, it would just be awesome for any team. I think that you look at
LSU. They've been here five times and haven't won. I know it would mean a lot
to them.  
With Tennessee, I'm sure it would mean a lot to them. But, you know, we're
just going to give it our absolute best effort. And it would be very
meaningful to our team and to me personally.  
  
Q. Was there a point in the season where you knew that your team was capable
of making it to the Final Four and even advancing to the championship game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I never thought about it. I never looked forward.
I just focused on what we were doing in practice every day, and I think that I
really focused on enjoying the journey with a special player like Candice. Not
wanting any day to be a bad day in practice. Tried to just keep it fun. Have
people relaxed and enjoying playing. And identifying things that we need to
improve on.  
And I think our perimeter shooting, our guard play, trying to keep people
healthy. I think Jill coming back was huge for us, the fact -- she was out for
basically seven weeks. But we never talked about it with our team. We never
talked to our team going to the Final Four, winning a national championship,
but when it happened, we've enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Jayne's vision and how that affected the outcome
tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think Jayne started a little bit slow, but she made
some amazing shots in there, I mean, finishing. And I think our team has great
confidence in Jayne, and she's a big target for us. She gets in deep and
scores. And I think she's an absolute franchise player. And I am just really
proud of her development. She's come a long way from her freshman year. In her
development and along with other player's development is the reason we're
here.  
Our team has improved. I made the point I think when we were -- I can't
remember what press conference it was, but we do a lot of video presentations
with our team. And this is a team that's gone from a caterpillar to a
butterfly. We have totally transformed how we've played.  
And Jayne is part of that transformation.  
  
Q. Have you had any time to sit back and reflect on what your team's been
able to accomplish, or is it just moving at lightning pace at this point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know how sometimes baseball players or basketball
players, they see the game in slow motion? To me, I'm seeing it in slow
motion. I'm thoroughly enjoying the journey.  
I think that for me personally the experiences of whether it's coaching the
Olympics or being in the Final Four before, I feel very comfortable being here
with this team and kind of helping them along, saying this is what's coming
next. And it's very different than the regular season with the press
obligations, the practices, all the excitement.  
But our team has really kept a very level head, and I think our coaching staff
has done a fabulous job. And honestly when you have leadership like Candice
Wiggins, Kayla Pedersen, very low maintenance kids, it's a fabulous
opportunity and fabulous job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Quianna Chaney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18071)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have LSU head coach Van Chancellor as well as student-
athletes Quianna Chaney, Erica White and Sylvia Fowles.  
Coach, we're going to take an opening statement from you when you're ready,
questions for the student-athletes only, and then following those we'll resume
questions for you.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's been an amazing deal for me. I'm amazed that a team
that's been to five Final Fours in a row has very little respect for its team.  
I get here, I turn on the television and I see you outside the lines with ESPN
and I see a guy saying it's going to be -- welcome to Monday's press
conference between Pat Summitt and Geno. Like LSU's not playing. I pick up
today's paper and I see where a coach says it's going to be a great game
between LSU and -- between Tennessee and Connecticut Tuesday.  
So I hope all of you enjoy the game. But our team's pretty good. Our team has
done some pretty nice things and I'm proud of them for what they've
accomplished. They beat a fine Oklahoma State basketball team and a great
North Carolina team.  
And so we're excited to be here. I just think this team deserves a little more
respect than what it's getting.  
Fire away at these players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Any of the players, it's being billed as the Sylvia versus Candace
matchup. When you played them both times this year, the first game it was
Quianna, Erica stepped up, scored 41 points combined. Second game in the NCAA
finals you only scored 27. How important is it going to be for the other
players besides Sylvia to step up and score on tomorrow night?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I think it's going to be very important. We don't want Sylvia
carrying the load by herself. I can say it's very important for everybody else
to step up and give us some help.  
ERICA WHITE: I agree with Quianna. It's important for us to step up. In our
program we never key in on one certain matchup. We're not looking at it as
Sylvia Fowles versus Parker. It's LSU versus Tennessee. We'll go out, compete
as a team and win as a team.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It will be extremely important. And I don't think that comes
down to a problem. My teammates have stepped up throughout the whole season
when I wasn't getting shots or things weren't going my way. So I'm pretty sure
they will step up when time needs it.  
  
Q. Sylvia, LSU has a very unusual advantage of knowing that one of their
opponents' stars is injured, which is something most teams go to great length
to prevent going into games like this. How do you think the knowledge that
Candace is injured and what the nature of her injury is will affect the
game?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't know how badly she's hurt or what hurts her at this
point. But I'm pretty sure she's going to come out. She's going to be fired
and be motivated and she's going to play her game. We're looking at it as if
she's 100 percent and she's going to play well that's how we are taking
things.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the experience that you now have coming into
this weekend and if you're able to draw on experience from the past three
years?  
ERICA WHITE: Well, I definitely will say our experience is a factor, both good
and bad. Coach is talking about this. We faced elimination many times
throughout this NCAA tournament and every year we've been able to fight and
get to this point.  
And at the same time we've gotten here and kind of had a let-down, but I don't
necessarily see that happening this year because we're still a very hungry
team and our goal wasn't just to get to the Final Four again. Our goal was to
win a national championship. So we're still not satisfied. It gives us a lot
of motivation and hunger.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It has been different, but we have prepared ourselves in a
different way this year. And it has been great having Coach Chancellor on our
side, letting us see the big picture. In previous years we always had
something to play for or play against. This year we've just been free. So I'll
say it's been different coming into the tournament this year.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I have to agree with both of these ladies. We have a new
coach, we just have new things this year.  
  
Q. Erica, to elaborate on that idea that you had so many things happen over
a four-year period: A coach with cancer and another coach who was asked to
leave, interim coach and then a new coach. How hard has it been to go through
that and how great is the stability then this season?  
ERICA WHITE: The stability has been great. But looking at all those things
we've gone through, that's really just -- that's how life is. Everyone goes
through different things. And I think what made us unique was that us being so
young, we just knew that in order to make it we were going to need to stick
together. So we're just a very resilient group.  
But Coach Gunter leaving, Hurricane Katrina, Coach Chatman leaving, Coach
Starkey being the head coach for a short period of time, then Coach Van in
here. It's a lot of different things, but that's how life is. You're going to
go through things and you just have to be able to adapt, and I think that's
what my teammates and I have been able to do.  
  
Q. Quianna, Coach Chancellor was teasing you about defense after you guys
beat North Carolina. But he's been very complimentary about you as a shooter
and how important it is for you to be able to shoot well and it seems like
your confidence has gained a lot this season. Can you talk about how he's
helped with that and how confident you are now as a shooter?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: When he first took the job he kept telling me I'm going to be
the best shooter in the SEC, the country, the world, and it made me feel good.
He would come in say I'm the best shooter. And so I start acting like I'm the
best shooter. That's how I end up getting the confidence, give me the ball I'm
going to shoot it.  
  
Q. What have you all been doing to stay relaxed this weekend? Is that a
focus? I know Coach Chancellor stresses the importance of having fun. He's
called you all the most serious-minded team I think that he's seen before. Can
you elaborate a little bit on what kind of mental focus there has been this
weekend?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Mental focus? It's there. Our mental focus is there and we're
ready to play. But outside of that, Coach Van has seen a different team since
he first got here. Yes, he said we're the up tightest team he's ever seen, but
I think yesterday we showed him a little side that he's never seen before
which was always there but we never acted that way around him. Our mental
focus has always been there and it's been there since we entered the
tournament.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate what you showed him yesterday?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Showed him a little dance moves and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Did you teach him a few pointers?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Nah.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You're not supposed to tell everything that goes on down
there. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Erica, can you talk about the other two senior starters that aren't on
the podium with you, Ashley and RaShonta and how they've been role players and
doing what they needed to do during all these Final Four runs for all of you
guys?  
ERICA WHITE: I think Ashley does a tremendous job for us because she's so
smart. She's an undersized post player, but every game we usually stick her on
the best post player on the other team and she always holds her own. And I
think that's because she's so smart.  
RaShonta is an excellent defender, and so we're one of the best defenses in
the country, but that's definitely because she's on the floor as much as she
is. And I think that all five starters play a certain role. But for years
we've all accepted it and played together. I think that's why we all play so
well together and have been able to have so much success and get to the Final
Fours.  
So Ashley and RaShonta are huge for us, as well as our bench who may not play
a lot but they do a great job of encouraging us. I don't want to leave them
out.  
  
Q. Sylvia, can you talk a little bit more about competing against the likes
of Candace Parker. Obviously even this morning you guys are both up for the
Wade Trophy. It went to Stanford's fine player. Talk about being very familiar
with Candace Parker over the years and competing on and off the court.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: First and foremost, I think we're both blessed with tremendous
talent. But going up against her, she only make you better. I'm pretty sure
it's the same way for me. But just to have to challenge her on the floor make
you step the game up somewhat. You just have to go at her and do all the
things that you're capable of doing. On the defensive end you've got to do
everything that's possible to slow her down.  
So it will be a great challenge.  
  
Q. Sylvia, a male player with your combination of size and ability probably
would have been gone after a year. Certainly at most after two years. How is
the experience of staying and playing your entire college career helped you
develop not only as an athlete but also as an individual?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's helped me just because academic-wise, just staying in
school, getting as much education as possible, and then all the stuff that we
went through, it made me a better player and made me stronger. And with that
going through all that stuff that we went through, I think it helped me grow
for the real world once I leave college.  
  
Q. Sylvia and Erica, you're both Florida natives. Can you tell us about the
cheering sections you'll have in the arena tomorrow and who is coming, any
family coming up?  
ERICA WHITE: You know, playing the Final Four here is great that it's so close
to home. But it's also just a little bit of a burden. Everyone is calling you
and texting you saying, I only need about four tickets, I just need four
tickets. And in actuality I only got eight. I ended up with eight tickets. I
have my mother and all my sisters coming and a couple of uncles. That was the
best I could do.  
So the section will be pretty small. But I just told the rest of my family to
go catch a sports bar or something.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: For me, it will be great. It will feel good to come back home,
your last year. And to let people see what you've been doing over the past
four years at college while you were away from home. It feels good to see
where it actually started from.  
And I have my mom, my brothers, uncles and cousins coming up so I have a
little fan club.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Van, each one of these teams has a really great player. You've got Moore,
Fowles, Wiggins, Parker. Can you recall a Final Four with so many outstanding
players on each team?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I was thinking about that the other day. I think this is the
greatest star power we've had in our game. I think if you went out and asked
the average fan to name four players, they could name all four players. And I
think that's great for our game. It's truly outstanding. And I think it's very
good for the Final Four. You're going to see some players do some exceptional
things in this tournament.  
  
Q. Van, since you have now operated at the top level, Olympic-wise, NBA-
wise, and now here, can you compare your experience here now that you finally
got here with your first WNBAs and your Olympics?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Well, first of all, this has been like a kid at
Christmastime, Mel, for me, to finally make it to a Final Four with a great
group of kids to beat a great North Carolina team.  
The WNBA experiences were great but they were different. And the Olympic goal
is just unbelievable when you coach that team. But for me right now it can't
get any better than this. To have this opportunity, to finally arrive here as
a coach. But to arrive here with players you truly, really like.  
Sometimes you coach players that you can't wait until the season gets over
with. This has been a special, special year, and I've really enjoyed every
minute. So that makes that moment special.  
  
Q. Someone mentioned earlier that -- well, Pat Summitt actually mentioned
that it took her teams I believe seven Final Fours to get a national title.
You guys have been to five in a row. You obviously split the two meetings
between the teams this year. I was wondering if you can just talk about do you
find irony in that, that you have to get over Tennessee in the Final Four now
to get over that hump?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought this was ironic that everybody said the SEC was
down this year, but I didn't agree with them. I think you measure the strength
of a conference by how many teams is in the Final Four and how many teams are
in the final eight. And then I look up and LSU's trying to win their first
game at the Final Four, and you gotta beat Tennessee to do it, that's pretty
ironic, in my mind.  
I didn't sleep a wink Monday night because we qualified for the Final Four.
And I slept very little Tuesday night because I thought I was going to have to
play Pat Summitt.  
  
Q. When a team has not been to the Final Four and the coach has, the coach
can kind of let them know what to expect. But this is a unique situation where
they've been and you haven't. Have they told you what to expect?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Bob Starkey has told me what to do. I tried to coach this
team just like we were playing Tennessee in Knoxville. I've not tried to make
a big deal that we're at the Final Four. We're just playing a game.  
I think I have enough experience in other situations. I don't think my
experience at the Final Four will be a factor whatsoever. I'm more worried
about getting our players to relax and really play. We're trying to get them
to relax and play as good as they're capable of playing. I don't think LSU's
played its best games in Final Fours in the past.  
  
Q. I look at all four teams in this Final Four and I see the front courts
are excellent. I mean, the post players in this Final Four are really, really
good. Do you see rebounding and just overall post play as the key to any team
winning in this Final Four?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think you've hit up on the key. The team that rebounds the
best probably wins the national championship. But not many shots that you miss
when Parker shoots and Wiggins shoots or Maya Moore shoots or fouls for that
matter.  
I think it comes down to making shots. But there's a lot of good power
players. But there's also a lot of good guards.  
  
Q. Van, I'm sure you watched the A &M-Tennessee game and saw Tennessee
struggling without Candace Parker. As a coach do you ever think about, like,
if you would have to play without Fowles for an extended period of time, how
you would handle that situation?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: I never thought about that because I didn't want to go over
there to that bridge that comes in on I-10 and jump off of it, if you want to
know the truth. If I would have thought that very much, I would have been
driving over in the car. Somebody said, What if she would have graduated and
come out early? I told them it wouldn't have been my problem. Judy Southard
could not have hired me. That's not a big deal. I'm not going to think about
that because I want to be able to sleep tonight, eat a little bite.  
I did think this, I did think the coaching staff at Tennessee did a marvelous
job to lose a player before the game is one thing, to lose a player during the
game and to be able to adjust. And that's what separates Pat from a lot of
coaches, great job of being down five and Parker in the locker room and
finding a way to win.  
Of course, let's understand something. Pat deserves a lot of credit, but they
don't recruit anything but All-Americans at Tennessee, so the other players
are pretty nice too. They've got pretty good players to fall back on when
Parker gets hurt.  
I could have told you Amy from our student newspaper is always going to be --
when you think there's a last question, she has a knack at that. The last time
she used the wrong end of the microphone. I'll tell you that. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Pat Summitt was asked earlier today if she expects LSU to throw any
intentionally hard screens on Parker or what she expects the nature of the
game to be like. She said: Maybe I'm not naive, but I don't expect to see any
intentional hard screens. How do you react knowing a lot of people are going
to be looking closely at the type of screens that LSU will be running on
Parker?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We're not mentioning that, that's not the way I coach. I
don't want to win a championship by hurting a athlete. I'd rather lose. I
don't believe in that. That's not our coaching style. That's not the way LSU
will ever play. We'll play a good hard game and we'll play it to the end.  
  
Q. You said during the season that you got thrown a wrinkle here, wrinkle
there, that the team hasn't seen. In this situation, there probably isn't much
the other hasn't seen. You can't change much at this point to surprise them.
What will it take to win for both teams?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We won't change anything. We would not dare think about
changing anything, not at this stage of the game. You run what you run and try
to work it. I don't think there's any doubt. Tennessee has built a national
reputation of being over a period of years -- I said this when I worked for
TV, the best offensive rebounding team to ever play the women's game. I think
you have to keep Tennessee off the offensive boards. If you don't, you can't
beat them.  
  
Q. Since the players brought it up earlier, tell us about the yacht last
night and what went on. I heard there was some dancing going on?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Amy, everything I've done is try to help our team relax and
have fun. I've been wearing shades around the lobby. I don't normally wear sun
shades and all different kinds of things. I was just -- anything -- I want
them to come here and enjoy it and get all this pressure off their back.
That's my job as their coach. Let them enjoy it. When the game gets here,
let's play. Let's get serious and let's play.  
All this worrying and listening to how many times we failed here is not
healthy for us. I told them what went on before I got to LSU does not count.
That's how I see it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2008

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up on the dais by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma
as well as Ketia Swanier and Renee Montgomery. Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. If you're not careful when you get out to this
place, it's easy to get caught up in all the things that you have to do and
all the obligations that you have and it becomes about everything except
basketball.  
And we're all anxious to get through today and finish this part of it and
start worrying about actually playing the game tomorrow. And it's been a long
time for us to get back here, and for these players it's been something that
they've wanted to do. Ketia, since she was a freshman and obviously Renee for
the last three years.  
I think tomorrow night can't come soon enough for all of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Renee, it was written in the paper how there were six minutes to go in
the Rutgers game she looked and saw a look in your eye that said this team is
not going to lose. Is that the first time that someone has made a comment
similar about that about you, and is there something that clicks in your head
and you say I'm going to put the team on my back now and is that how you've
always been?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's realizing how the game is on the line, think
back how hard you've worked in the past and everything you've been through and
you look at the clock and you realize you've got this much time to get it
right and win the game. I think that's what clicks in my head. I don't think
anyone wants to lose. I think as a clique as a whole, we realize now is the
time.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this first Final Four experience, what it's been
like so far and what you want to get from it?  
KETIA SWANIER: It's great. It took all my years in college to get here and
just to know what this team has been through, the adversity we've came through
and the ups and downs and how hard we've worked.  
It's exciting to be here and I can't wait to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Renee, can you talk about being an All-American this morning and what
that meant to you?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It's a tremendous honor. You grow up working hard to try to
be all these things, and when you actually get chosen for something of that --
something that prestigious, it's overwhelming. It's hard to realize -- it's
surreal. It's a blessing. I'm very honored to be put in that category.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've seen a lot of film on Candice at this point, what have
you seen that you can do to stop her, slow her down a little bit?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: Somebody of her caliber you're not really going to stop
them. You want to try to contain them. I think as long as we can limit her
open looks and make her have to work for everything she's going to get, that
would be the best we could do. She's a tremendous player and she goes hard all
the time. And I think there's no stopping Candice Wiggins, but we want to try
to contain her and limit her touches.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much different the Stanford team you see on film
now is from the team you played back in November?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think they're different because they're more mature.
They've gotten more patient in their offense. I think in the beginning of the
year they really focused a lot on Jayne Appel and Candice Wiggins, getting the
majority of their points. Now they have a lot of other players that are
contributing, people are stepping up and making big shots in the games now. I
think throughout the year everyone's gotten confidence. And now everyone's
playing at the same level instead of just depending on two people to carry the
team.  
  
Q. Renee, you're a very underrated defender. Coach talked about it in the
conference call that you're usually assigned to the star player in the back
court which is really hard because you are also responsible for a lot of the
offense. So you're kind of on both ends working very, very hard every single
game. Can you talk about how comfortable you feel with that role and how it's
brought you here?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I feel very comfortable because I know it's not just me
against another player. I know even if I am guarding their best offensive
player that my teammates, if I get beat, are going to be there. I don't feel
like it's just me against her.  
And on offense, we're so balanced that they don't depend on me for a lot of
scoring. I wouldn't even have to score a point, we can still maybe win the
game. I don't think it's that much pressure on me on either end because I know
I have my teammates.  
  
Q. They talked about how Stanford was different from last time you played.
You guys have obviously lost two players since then. Can you talk about how
your team is different and are you better? Have you matured since then?  
KETIA SWANIER: I think we're a whole different team. Like you said, we lost
two key players. And we pretty much had to become a different team and people
had to step into different roles. And I think we've gotten smarter and more
comfortable with each other, and we feed off of each other.  
At this point in time it's just whoever is on the floor, I think we feed off
of each other well and just mesh well with each other.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all very much.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Having had the full week to look at tape and sort of break everything
down, what are the keys to this matchup, what do you guys need to do, what do
you need to avoid doing?  
COACH AURIEMMA: At this point in the season, when you get down to the last
weekend, the only teams that are left are teams that are really, really hard
to play against. So to be able to sit there and watch a lot of film and say,
okay, we can exploit this weakness, this weakness and this weakness and we can
take advantage of these areas that are strengths, that's not easy to do at
this point in the year, because if a team had a lot of weaknesses, they
wouldn't be here.  
So what you have to hope to do is play to your strengths, and that's what
we've always done when we've been in this situation. And obviously Stanford's
team is a reflection of Candice and the energy level that she brings and the
fact that she can single-handedly keep them in the game when everyone else may
be playing poorly. But if it was just the one-man operation, then it would be
a lot easier.  
But I think that beyond Candice, I think the keys to Stanford are how much
balance they have now and how much they've grown since November when I saw
them.  
It's funny to say this, but the reason why Candice is scoring so much is
because the other guys are better. And back in November, I don't think she was
able to score a lot of points against us because we didn't have to guard the
other guys as well as we're going to have to guard them tomorrow.  
  
Q. When Baylor and Maryland won in consecutive years, there was reason to
believe that parity had come finally to women's college basketball. I'm sure
you're going to tell me or likely to tell me the fact it took you four years
to get back here, that it's harder than ever to get here. But Moore, Parker,
Wiggins and Fowles are probably four of the top six or seven players, are all
here right now on perennial powerhouses. So are the best players still coming
to the same powerhouses?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. The best players are still going to similar
schools that they went to five, six, seven, ten years ago. But I don't think
we're that much different over the long haul. Other than Memphis, there's
three schools in the Final Four this year on the men's side that are no
strangers to the Final Four. This is UCLA's, what, third in a row. Carolina
won it a couple of years ago.  
And I'll bet you of the 20 kids that are starting for those guys, I'll bet you
15 of them were First Team All-Americans coming out of high school. So it's
like that in just about every sport.  
The problem that we have in women's basketball is that there isn't a big
enough group to choose from for more teams on a regular basis to put
themselves in this situation. And that may take a little more time.  
But certainly, given where it was 10 years ago, 10 years ago you wouldn't have
had the run that a Maryland or a Baylor or North Carolina or Duke has had in
the last five, six, seven years. That wouldn't have been possible. And now it
is. But just because that's possible for them, that doesn't mean that
Connecticut and Tennessee are all of a sudden going to be worse.  
We're still going to be who we are; it's just that other people now are
catching up. How much are they catching up? That depends right now.  
  
Q. It's been a long time since you've been to a Final Four with players that
haven't already been to a Final Four. What kind of things have you done to try
and prepare them and keep them from getting distracted from, like you said,
all the peripheral events, all the other things besides the game you have
tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Can you give me a little bit of that question again? Just a
little bit of it.  
  
Q. Since this is the first time in a long time you've been here with players
that haven't been to a Final Four, what you can do to keep them from getting
distracted by all the other things than the game you have tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I got distracted. (Laughter).  
It's virtually impossible. It's impossible not to be distracted. And we've
been here since Thursday -- we got here Thursday night and I'll bet you since
all that time we've spent three, four hours actually working on the game of
basketball to prepare for tomorrow. It's neither here nor there. We're outside
in the sunshine today for 40 minutes signing autographs and kids are sweating
and getting sunburned. And you have to do it. And went to a dinner last night.
We got there at 6:00 and left at 10:00.  
So there's a lot of things that go on as part of this that you have to be able
to handle it -- I think we're a little more fortunate because the kind of
three-ring circus atmosphere surrounds our program on a daily basis. So this
is not that far removed from what we deal with on a regular basis.  
So all you can hope for is that your team is mature enough and you'll know
that, unfortunately, after the fact. But I think the 37 games that we've
played up to this point, or 36, whatever we've played, if they're any
indication, I think we'll handle it pretty well.  
  
Q. Have you ever had to put together or kind of reconfigure a team in the
middle of a season with losing a couple of key players the way you had to do
it with this team? And how do you prevent the kids from getting the "woe is
us" look on their face when they lose two players like you lost?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Never had to do it in this scenario. In 2001, I thought we had
the best team ever to play college basketball. Our guards were so good, Diana
Taurasi was coming off the bench, she couldn't crack the starting lineup, and
neither could Tamika Williams or Asjha Jones, Kelly Schumacher, the guys that
went in the top 15 in the draft the following year or two years later.
Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea Ralph both went down, one in January and one in
March, and we got to the Final Four and we're up 15 against Notre Dame and we
lose the game.  
There's just some things you can't overcome. There's just some things that
they hit your team so hard that you can mask it and camouflage it and put some
makeup on it, but sometimes you just can't get over that hump.  
This year it happened early enough that it did allow us a chance to regroup.
But we've been hiding it and we've been masking it and we've been covering it
up. Hoping that it would never catch up to us.  
So far it hasn't. But, no, I don't like any of my players, so when a couple of
them can't play, they don't necessarily feel like, wow, we just lost two of
Coach Auriemma's favorites, now they're going to pout. They know I don't like
any of them during the season. So when those two kids got hurt, I went up to
the guys already playing. Well, I said, by the way, the way you've been
playing is lousy; you need to play a lot better.  
Fortunately Renee, Ketia, Tina, Maya, all the kids that were already playing
really, really well, we just somehow or another got them to play a little bit
better.  
  
Q. In the story about Maya Moore, I saw a, quote, tribute to you saying that
in some ways "I've met my match in her." And I was wondering what you meant by
that.   
COACH AURIEMMA: She's just so different that it's hard to pinpoint what it is
that you have to do on a regular basis to keep the motor running. And I don't
ever let kids drive their own car, you know what I mean. I feel like I have to
be there to kind of kick the tires once in a while most every day and fool
around with the car.  
And with people like Diana and Svetlana and some of those guys, I knew what I
had to do to get them, because I knew that they would want to punch me and it
was really cool. It was a lot of fun. It was a great way to get through the
season. But with Maya, she just kind of looks at you and just gives you that
smile and nods her head a little bit and I just keep going. I'm waiting for a
reaction. I'm trying to get something. Because once I get a little bit of a
reaction it will give me something to go on.  
Just smile and nod her head. And it bothers me because I'm thinking: This kid
is so smart. In the back of her head she's thinking: This idiot actually
thinks he has anything to do with what I'm going to do. I'm just going to do
what I'm going to do and I'm going to let him think that he does. And she just
(smiling) goes (smiling) uh-huh, uh-huh. And today I even tried -- what's this
world coming to that a kid has to stand out there, become First Team All-
American as a freshman WBCA and she can't put two dribbles together with her
head up. She has to constantly look down at the ball and she turned around and
looked at me and said, That's not true, and just like walked away. What are
you supposed to say to that? You're supposed to get an argument. She won't
argue with you. I can't stand her. (Laughter).  
  
Q. When Michael Jordan was a freshman, Dean Smith wouldn't let him pose with
his teammates for the cover of Sports Illustrated. I can't help but notice
that Maya Moore is not up there right now. Why is that? Do you find yourself
nurturing her along in terms of that or do you think she has to earn something
in terms of publicity? How do you handle that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never liked the idea of freshmen being exposed to having
to represent your program in a public forum without them having complete
understanding of what your program really is.  
And I think Maya probably understands and grasps it and can articulate it like
she did today at the All-American press conference as well if not better than
anybody else.  
But I guarantee if Maya Moore was right here right now with Ketia and Renee,
there wouldn't be anybody in our locker room. So part of me thinks that she
needs to be like all the other kids on the team, because that's what she
wants. Otherwise she wouldn't have come to Connecticut. She would have gone to
someplace else.  
She wants to be treated like everybody else and at some day, some point,
she'll be up here representing us but right now the two guys that I brought up
here are the ones that know what it's like to not be here. So it's fitting
that they come and answer the questions as to what it means to be here.  
  
Q. As the previous two questions have shown, the second Rutgers game you
said has been Maya, Maya, Maya, all year, referring to Lorin and how she did
in that game. But Renee is so much of your floor general, she kind of steers
the car, if you will. She kind of -- you've said that all year long and Chris
Dailey has said that, too. Could you talk about what she brings to this team
and how you've seen that, how that's led you to the Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never been in a Final Four situation or had a team that
was capable of winning the national championship where you didn't have the
best guard in the country. I think that's almost impossible to do, unless you
get lucky.  
But at some point if you want a legitimate chance to win this thing, in my
mind, the way we play anyway, when you're getting great, great guard play and
great leadership from that position, I think everything and anything is
possible.  
And the last three years, 2005, 2006, 2007 after Diana left, we didn't have
that. It's no coincidence we're here and I think Renee is as good if not
better than any guard in America in every area. And maybe what she needed to
prove herself was one more player that could take some of the pressure off of
her.  
It's not unlike when we had Jen Rizzotti, who I thought was the best guard in
America. But once we added -- once we surrounded her with Rebecca and Jamelle
and Kara Woelters and Carla Berube and Nykesha Sales, once we put these people
around her, it came together.  
But without that person there, it's not going to happen. And not for us,
anyway. It might happen for other people. So we're here because Renee
Montgomery got us here with a lot of help.  
  
Q. Because of your exalted position as vice president of the WBCA, you would
have had to come here even if Rutgers had beaten you. I'm wondering what
you're going to miss the most about your administrative duties. Would you
rather do that or coach in the Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I used to come to the Final Four all the time and always
dreamed of what it would be like to coach at the Final Four. Then when we came
here I thought, wow, I never saw this side of it. And then you come five years
in a row and seven out of like nine or ten, whatever it was, you forget what
the other half is like. And then last three years I was with the other guys
and not playing.  
And it just felt weird. It felt like you had nothing to do. You didn't want to
talk to anybody. You had no friends. You had no direction. You were just here
wandering around the place.  
And then you get involved in this WBCA and now all of a sudden it's one
meeting, one press conference, one dinner, one luncheon, one thing, one thing,
one thing, and I thought, you know, the only thing worse than not playing in
the Final Four is having to be on these committees at the Final Four.  
So I'm excited about being a vice president. I'm excited about becoming
president next year. And it's a two-year run. But I hope in the next two years
I miss every single solitary thing that they have going on this weekend and
that I'm playing. I will physically threaten my players in that final eight
game if they force me to go to those meetings at the Final Four.  
  
Q. Can you tell us about recruiting Maya and how you think you got her and
what made her decide to come to UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: See, all that time at Philadelphia served you well. Don't ask
the rest of the question.  
Recruiting Maya Moore. I think the number one reason why Maya Moore came to
Connecticut is beyond a shadow of a doubt, and she'll tell you this, Maya
Moore came to Connecticut because she's smarter than the average kid. And she
doesn't buy into the recruiting nonsense. She doesn't buy into recruiting
pitches. She doesn't buy into the flash and the glitz and the glitter and she
doesn't allow you to recruit her mother, her coach, her boyfriend. She doesn't
get into all that.  
Maya Moore came to Connecticut because I got to know one person during the
recruiting process, and that was Maya Moore. And that's all I ever wanted to
know and that's all I ever wanted to show her. All I ever wanted to let her
know is what Connecticut had to offer her and what her four years at
Connecticut would reward her with.  
And I told her that nothing else was ever going to matter. It doesn't. It
won't, and it never will.  
  
Q. You saw her in high school, was it the same level of excitement with
Taurasi or anybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, because she wasn't like that. As a matter of fact, this is
how ironic this is. I went down to the Georgia State championships to see
Ketia Swanier play in the state championship game, after we had already signed
her. And as I'm in the building I'm watching one of the other games and I said
to somebody sitting, I said, Who is that kid? Her kneepads were bigger than
her legs and she looked like this gangly ninth grader. I said, Who is that
kid? They said that's Maya Moore. Is she any good? She's unbelievable. Do you
know her? Ninth grader. I'm not one of these guys that goes to seventh grade
and rates the top seventh graders in America.  
And so I got back home and I said you're allowed to send a thing as long as
you don't -- I don't think we started cheating then. I think that was after
that. (Laughter). Probably get in trouble for sending a letter when we were in
ninth grade. But I remember contacting the school and before you even know it,
a newspaper article in an envelope arrived on my desk and it was from Maya's
mom with two pictures of Maya inside talking about the state championship and
all that and said, Coach, just want you to be aware there's a great player
down here; her name is Maya Moore and you might want to keep an eye on her in
the next couple of years.  
Maya doesn't know this. I have that in my desk a picture of her in ninth grade
like (grinning) like you get in ninth grade. At some point in time when she
thinks she's really hot stuff, I'm going to pull it out and show it to her.
But no more complicated than that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement and then entertain questions
for student-athletes first. Once all the questions for the student-athletes
are answered, then we'll excuse them and take questions for Coach.  
So I am joined up here on the podium by Stanford University's head coach,
Coach Tara VanDerveer, as well as student athletes Candice Wiggins, Jayne
Appel and Kayla Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our team is very excited to be here. It's been a great
season, and we just really want to keep it going for two more games. We're
working very hard and we just, I feel like we're playing well and we played
great opponents to get here.  
And I'm really proud of our team to this point, and we just want to continue
enjoying this wonderful opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the first matchup with Connecticut. You
said you're a different team, how you're different.  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Jayne, will you talk about the first matchup with Connecticut and how you
guys are different?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we're playing a lot different, different pace than the
beginning of the year. I think our game against them at the beginning of the
year helped us to really realize how much work we needed to do. And it should
be a good game.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about how Candice's game has blossomed? Tara said on
the conference call you've gone from caterpillars to butterflies. Can you talk
about how Candice's game has gone to the next level.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that Candice is really -- through experience, I think
especially this summer when she played with older players on the national
team, I think that she really took a lot from that and she's told us that
playing with those elite players gave her a lot of experience. And I think
that she's taken that and brought it to our team and I think it's what's
helped us improve a lot.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I feel the same way. I think that Candice has become
more of a leader, as the season goes on. Right now she really drives our team.
And of course it comes from experience. But I think she has a natural ability
to lead us. I think that's the main way she's helped us.  
  
Q. Candice, I understand you got a little award this morning. Can you talk
about the reaction and what it means to be bestowed with this?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, the Wade Trophy. This morning, I was very shocked and
elated and so honored to receive this award. I've been, you know, at this
presentation for three past years and great phenomenal players have received
it. I think Simone got it twice and Candace last year. And I was not expecting
to -- I was just going to sit back and just -- but to get the award it's so
amazing.  
I think just to have it this year, my last year with this team, that I just so
desperately love, and a coach that I just absolutely love playing for. I think
that's what makes it the most special, is because I can share it with the team
and with that experience and I'll never forget this this season.  
  
Q. Candice, you just talked about, your teammates talked about how you
blossomed as a player. Could you talk about your other starters. You're the
lone senior in that starting group. Talk about the younger players and how
they've blossomed.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Okay. So this group is amazing. I think the best thing I love
about Jayne and Kayla and the team is that they're so young but they're not,
you know, afraid of anything. I think the biggest thing I've seen they've
always had that just sort of fierce mentality. When you look at Kayla and her
game against Rutgers, she was not even fazed by the situation.  
And Jayne has improved even from her freshman year and to this year, she's
become a leader on the court. And she's getting everybody together. Technical
things like their actual game have improved. But I just really love their
mind-set and how that's maintained the same throughout the whole entire year.
And they just have the biggest, brightest futures. You're going to be seeing
them for the next years to come. I'm so excited to them when they're seniors.  
  
Q. A lot's been made in Connecticut about the fact that their senior class
had not been to a Final Four and this is going to be their first. Stanford's
wait has been much longer than this Connecticut drought. Can you talk about
how playing in this Final Four is going to fill that void for you and in your
career?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: It's going to do wonders. This is, like you said, my first
Final Four. I'm really soaking in the experience. And we're here to play.
We're here to win, here to compete. But it's also a wonderful celebration of
women's basketball.  
And I think I would have been happy with the end of the season whether we went
to the Final Four or not because I love this team so much. But to have this as
my last memory of Stanford is astounding.  
  
Q. Candice, along those lines, earlier in the week you were saying "what do
I do, what do I do, this is so new to me," and to be in uniform here, I guess
what does that feel like and how are you sharing that with your teammates?   
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, we're all kind of -- you experience the new experience
together. I think the craziest part is just even looking at those signs up
there and seeing the Stanford S.  
I've come to Final Fours, but I've been on the outside looking in. Now to be
on the inside, know, that is what is different and is so much fun, because
you're able to showcase -- like people are going to see our team play. That's
the best part of it, because even if you come here alone, you have your team
with you; it's cool.  
  
Q. If you were a guy playing men's basketball, you in all likelihood would
have been long gone by now with never having the chance to see your game and
your team blossom to this extent in your senior year. Could you address a
little bit what that means and how the experience of playing for four years
with this team, with this coach has helped you as a player and an
individual?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, being here four years, I think, it's just -- it seems
like a long time. But it really goes by really fast. And I think the biggest
thing is the person that I've been able to become. I think that I owe a lot to
Tara. She's never allowed me to not be the best I can be. And I just thank her
for that, for not letting me settle, to be the best person I can be, the best
teammate I can be. The best anything I can be.  
So it's just to be able to look back at my career and just see the progress
that I've made as a person and as a player, it's great.  
  
Q. Candice, I know that Tara said she wants to tell you each game or each
day how special a player you are. What has that meant to you along the way,
and will you tell us a few things that she's shared with you each game like
that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, it means a lot, because it makes me so happy that she
wants to appreciate every moment. I think it allows me to appreciate every
moment, too.  
Over the course of the year, I can just remember, you know -- I think after
maybe it was the Utah game I struggled shooting and before the next game she
was like, I still have confidence -- just basically putting me up, don't worry
about it, I still have confidence in you. I remember before the Baylor game, I
think I was also going through like maybe a bad shooting slump. We were about
to play Baylor. Before the game she's like: Listen, you're allowed to take
three bad shots, so don't worry about it. Just take three bad shots, that's
fine, you're allowed that. That really helped because I was like: Okay, I can
take three bad shots. And it kind of got me back -- got my confidence back.  
Then the Pac-10 tournament, she just said nice things about over the course of
the years of that.  
  
Q. Kayla, if I'm not mistaken you spent the last two years playing with Maya
on the national teams. Talk about your relationship, if you had a chance to
bond with her, and if her success this year being Big East player of the year
has surprised you?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Maya is a great player and a great person, especially the
first year. I think we got to bond a little bit and we hung out with each
other a lot. I'm not surprised by her success this season. She's a great
player. She's a great leader, and she's extremely talented. But I think it
comes mostly from her work ethic. That's what I respect about her, is how hard
she works.  
  
Q. Candice, could you talk about the quality of this Final Four field with
four First Team All-Americans appearing and obviously a lot of great story
lines, how attractive an event you think this could be?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think this is a great Final Four. I've seen a lot of them.
And I'm just so honored to be a part of this, our whole school is.  
And I think you look at the history behind Tennessee and Connecticut and that
says enough. And then LSU coming for the fourth consecutive Final Four and us
coming back, I think it's great.  
And the players, I know Sylvia and Candace, they are just the top, the highest
at our level. And we've got great players here, too.  
So I just hope the country can see that, can see how much the women's game has
advanced and what's to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the matchup with Connecticut, how you're a
different team, what you anticipate tomorrow to be some of the keys for the
game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, Connecticut has a great team and a great
program, and they have -- as Candice and Kayla and Jayne talked about, they
have terrific players and they really play with a purpose.  
I think they're fun to watch because they run. They really play up tempo. They
shoot the ball really well. They have an inside and outside game. They
rebound. There's really not anything they don't do.  
I think, unfortunately for them, and unfortunately for us, with the two ACLs,
that affects their depth and I think it affects our depth, too, although our
injuries were earlier than theirs.  
But there are certain things I think that you have to do and you have to
really try. You have to rebound well. They get a lot of second and third
shots. I think you have to do kind of what Rutgers did and get out on key
players.  
You can't let whether it's Renee Montgomery or Swanier or obviously Maya Moore
knock down open shots.  
For our team, when we played them for the first time, we did not make open
shots. And Connecticut, in November, to me was a November machine. They played
like an incredible pace and they were way ahead of us.  
And I'm really thankful for that game and our team is, too, that by playing
them I think we've really improved. We actually made some significant changes
in our offense since then and I think that our team, we could always look at
that game and just say, you know, this is how we have to practice in order to
ever play them again.  
  
Q. I think Connecticut has won their last four national championships since
Stanford had the last opportunity to be in the Final Four. What's that time
been like for you? Your program is so well established, nationally known.
Before Connecticut's roll started, what's the last 10 years been like?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that Geno talked a little bit about this at
the salute dinner, the fact that maybe in the early '90s for both Stanford and
Connecticut and Tennessee, that maybe players thought they were getting a full
scholarship that included a trip to the Final Four.  
And it's been hard to be as close as we have been, being at the Elite Eight
through the last four years before this year.  
And to be that close. But in some ways, when you have something taken away
from you, you really -- maybe it makes you appreciate it more. So maybe for
both ourselves maybe, Connecticut hasn't been here, and you call it a drought.
I mean, that's because the standard is so high. And for Stanford, we haven't
been here in 11 years.  
And I think we as coaches and our players truly are -- we're thrilled to be
here and are thoroughly enjoying the experience and we want to keep it going.
A lot of it also, I think Geno referred too, is just sometimes with certain
teams, you really -- teams allow you to enjoy it more. And both our teams are
allowing us as coaches to really enjoy it.  
  
Q. Tara, with an NCAA tournament, you would think that Candice would be more
of a priority for defense than ever before. So how do you explain those
40-point games she's managed?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, honestly, there's sometimes where players get in a
zone. And I think she definitely got into one of those zones at Maples with 44
points. Easily she could have had 50, missed some layups and some free throws.
We had the lead and I took her out. And the basket got big for her.  
But she is the focus of defenses. I know she'll be the focus in Connecticut's
defense, but we also have other players stepped up for her. JJ Hones shooting
well, playing well against Maryland. Ros Gold-Onwude against Pittsburgh, and
Kayla and Jayne have been really steady inside.  
And I think we have some other people that will be ready for this semifinal
game with Connecticut. It's not all about Candice. Candice is happy to not
score a point and have her team win. That's what I think is really special
about her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Candice winning the Wade Trophy?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, for everyone, I think everyone in that room,
including Candice, it was a shock I think that in some ways I just kind of
thought it was going to be Candace Parker. And I was kind of given a tip
before the announcement and so I was watching Candice Wiggins. She was kind of
chitchatting with Kristi Toliver next to her and she heard Stanford. And she
was in shock. She heard her name and she was, "oh, my God." It was hysterical
to watch her. But we're so excited for Candice.  
Not because -- I mean, she's a four-time All-American. She has really put her
team on her back to get here. But she's just really a special person. And I'm
really excited for her. I think she's -- we probably don't like using this
word, but she's a great role model for young women and she's so honest with
her emotions.  
That seems to be a big part of what makes basketball so special, is that she
shows her emotion and she shows it so honestly. So I'm really happy for her.
And, I don't know, our team was giving me a hard time. I was standing up
clapping. It's like I'm so proud of her.  
  
Q. Could you talk specifically how your offense has changed since that game
in November?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Specifically, for the past -- I want to say we've run our
triangle offense for four years. And over the first three years, we basically
ran it as a four-round-one, where basically we put Jayne Appel on the block
and had four people doing the same things in the same positions around her.  
And after playing Connecticut, we changed it to a three-around-two. It changed
significantly. I think we're running it a lot better. And it made me a little
mad because I think we should have made the change probably two years ago. But
it allows us to put players maybe in positions where they're more comfortable.  
Some of my ideas about basketball, I want players sometimes to do things maybe
that they can't do. I want them all to be versatile facing up, shooting 3s, a
little bit of an international way of looking at the game when in reality a
lot of our post players are comfortable in two places: high and low.  
So we've pretty much moved our post players back into those traditional
places.  
  
Q. I'm curious what you think it's going to take for there to be more parity
in the sport of women's college basketball from top to bottom? Because you
look at this year where it's all 1s and 2s in the Elite Eight and the
Tennessees and UConns that are always kind of the top level?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, it's -- maybe a couple of things. There are some 2s at
our Final Four and the men's is all 1s. But I think it is happening. But a lot
of it will be institutionally. When institutions throughout the country
prioritize women's basketball and put the resources and higher-experienced
coaches for positions and say we want to be a player in this game.  
I don't think it's honestly that hard to do. I mean, it does cost some money
and you have to have it a priority. But Stanford made the commitment to
women's basketball I think 20 years ago in hiring me from Ohio State.
Connecticut made the commitment in hiring Geno. He's done a fabulous job. Pat
Summitt has obviously been there a long time but she's really grown to go to
18 Final Fours is incredible.  
Different places throughout the country are saying women's basketball is a
priority and we're going to -- as they put more resources then I think that
they'll work harder to win. And there's more pressure on coaches, which
personally I think is a good thing.  
Also I think the woman's game is like this way with talent and we need it to
be this way (demonstrating), more opportunities for young girls to play.
Better coaching, better out of season growth. And I think as that happens I
think you will see more and more parity.  
Although, I think we are seeing it with first teams first getting into their
first Sweet 16s, more teams going to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of the focus on Connecticut has been on Maya Moore but
you mentioned the guards. Could you talk about Renee Montgomery what she
brings to that team and what you have to do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Maybe Sheryl Swoopes and her team, I can't name any other of
the teammates on her team. She was a phenomenal player.  
Maya Moore is going to be a four-time All-American. I believe she'll be a Wade
Trophy winner. She's a phenomenal player. But she has a great cast. And Renee
Montgomery, I think, has probably been a real key for their team because when
Mel Thomas went down, Renee's role has changed.  
And she is extremely talented. She plays at both ends of the floor
defensively, offensively, she's obviously a leader for them on the court. She
has exceptional skills. And personally I'm really impressed with just the
development of all their guards. I think Swanier has improved a lot since we
played them the last time. Renee Montgomery has helped her. Looks like they
have great competition in practice. They really push each other.  
But she's a real key to their team. And obviously being an upper classman and
being a guard, she passes well. She shoots well. She defends well. I think she
has a great future. And she'll be a very tough matchup for us.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up here at the podium by Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt as well as student-athletes Candace Parker, Nicky Anosike and Alexis
Hornbuckle. Coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, really excited about what our basketball team
accomplished in a tough regional final to get us to the Final Four. It was a
courageous effort by our basketball team, through a lot of adversity.
Obviously with Candace dealing with her shoulder, and just really proud of how
the team stepped up. And certainly Nicky and Alexis provided tremendous
leadership and obviously some big plays for us at both ends of the floor.  
So looking forward to getting started in this tournament. LSU, we're very,
very familiar with them. They're very familiar with us, have tremendous
respect for their basketball team and obviously the personnel and the coaches
and I'll just turn it over to the players now.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, what do you and Sylvia have going, do you take the competition
more seriously if it's LSU? Are you and Sylvia friends off the court or is it
only on the court and you always look at each other as going after the same
thing?  
CANDACE PARKER: We've played against Sylvia for a long time going back to
obviously high school. And we played on various U.S.A. basketball teams and
things like that.  
But I think it's really just about LSU and Tennessee. I think we bring a lot
to our teams, both of us, and I think we know each other very well being in
the same conference and things like that. So we played them two times already
this year and it's going to be a third. So I think we're just familiar with
one another.  
  
Q. Candace, could you just update us on your physical condition, how
effective you expect to be tonight?  
CANDACE PARKER: I have all the confidence in the world in the medical staff.
Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in the world. We've been doing rehab around
the clock. My shoulder feels strong. It's getting better every day. And I'm
happy we played the late game on Sunday because it gives us more time to
rehab.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about what you mean by 24-hour rehab? What's the
process been like for you? How often are you icing it or putting stim on it?  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak's philosophy is the more the better. She works
around our schedule. Obviously we have commitments being at the Final Four
with different events we have to go to. But any 15-minute segment we get, we
do stim, ice, shoulder exercises, strengthening, things like that.  
  
Q. Candace, you had mentioned yesterday that you were about 80 percent, your
shoulder was about 80 percent. What percentage is it today, do you think? Has
it gone up? Is it about the same?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously I feel confident in my shoulder. I don't know
percentage-wise, but I feel confident that I'm going to go tomorrow and just
play as hard as I can. So obviously it's gone up. It's getting better every
day, more rest, more stim.  
  
Q. Alexis and Nicky, obviously you're very familiar with LSU being in the
same conference. Could you talk about the dynamics of that when you play at
this level, playing a team that you're that familiar with or the advantages or
things you have to guard against when you're playing with a team you're so
familiar with?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Obviously when you're familiar with the team it gives --
it's a little bit easier when you go over the scouting report. But at the same
time, when it comes down to the game, you have to execute. And it's the team
that's going to execute their offense the best and who is going to play the
most defense and control the boards.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We don't really plan on changing up the game plan. Obviously we
know them and they know us. But we know from being here, three times since
I've been here, that defense and rebounding is something that stays constant
no matter who you play in the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I have to ask you about Angie Bjorklund and her progress?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Angie has had a really strong freshman year. Obviously
we've relied on her to stretch the defense and make some shots for us. I
thought in our A&M game, that was probably the best defensive segment that she
has played for us. And I know that they ran -- as soon as Angie went in the
game, they started running isolations and clearing out.  
And I think that probably inspired her more than anything I've said to her all
year. At least that's what she shared with me. I think she took that as a
challenge.  
But obviously we are a better basketball team when Angie's knocking down
shots, because of what it does to open up our inside game. And, again, forces
us to put a little more pressure on the defense and stretch the defense to
open up opportunities for our post game.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about just the strength of the individual
players in this Final Four with Wiggins, Moore, Parker and Fowles? In terms of
individual stories, it seems like it's one of the best Final Fours ever.  
COACH SUMMITT: I would agree with you. As you look at each team, as you look
at obviously what Candice Wiggins did in the regional finals and how she
played in both of those games and what she brought to the team and I think you
have a player like that, other players respond around you.  
And I thought her team responded very well to her play and it gave them a lot
of confidence. Certainly when you look at Maya Moore and what she's meant to
Connecticut and just the explosiveness of her game and obviously the toughness
and the ability to stretch the defense and make really a lot of big plays, you
know, that certainly has been a tremendous asset for them.  
And Sylvia Fowles, seems like she and Candace have been going at it for a
long, long time but her presence inside, and obviously all of these teams have
great supporting casts. But with Sylvia, just her ability to block shots and
also to get position, they do a tremendous job of getting her great looks in
the paint and at the rim, which is it's hard to defend just one-on-one.  
And so I think with that said, you take Candace Parker for Tennessee and you
have a player that obviously is playing a big role for us offensively. I think
Candace's offensive package has expanded throughout her career at Tennessee.
And I think that's been an advantage for us. But certainly we expect her to
get paint points for us as well.  
  
Q. Considering an injury like Candace's it can become more chronic the more
it happens. And all the basketball she has in front of her. Is there a
scenario tomorrow night where you can envision saying to her you're not going
out there again or would you be afraid she might go after your shoulder if you
try to take her out?  
COACH SUMMITT: (Chuckling) she'd probably come after me. I've told her, I've
made it very clear, unless the orthopedic doctor and the trainers are
comfortable, I don't want her to play. But they have assured me that she is
doing great and her shoulder has responded.  
I'll be anxious to see today -- and I'm assuming that she's going to go
through a shoot-around with us. I told Jenny she didn't have to. If she wanted
to rehab her during that time, I'm fine with it. I haven't spoken with her
because she's been with Candace here in the training room pretty much all
morning.  
So, no, I don't want to do anything that -- if there's a question mark there,
obviously with the support, the brace she has on, that's going to limit a lot
of what she can do with her left shoulder. But with one hand she's better than
a lot of players. So we'll let the doctor and the trainers make that decision,
and I trust their judgment and their professionalism.  
  
Q. When Maryland and Baylor won in successive years, there was a lot of
reason to believe that parity had really come to women's basketball. Now you
again, UConn again, LSU has been here five straight years. Stanford's back and
two-time champion. Plus with Moore, Parker, Wiggins, Fowles, probably four of
the top seven or eight players all on the four teams are here. What does that
say about parity? Has there been a setback for that?  
COACH SUMMITT: It says a lot of the powerhouses managed to recruit some of the
best players in the game, because that's what this is all relative to is
success in recruiting. And certainly I don't expect these programs to go away.  
I do think there's more -- the numbers of recruits are greater now of better
high school recruiting opportunities are out there. So I think that has
allowed some teams to step up and improve their programs. I think that will
continue to happen because of the state of women's basketball and because of
our AAU programs and we have a lot of kids that are playing year-round. Not
that I'm crazy about that idea.  
But I think that just because of the stage of women's basketball has been on
in the last few years, it's inspired a lot of young people to want to be a
part of it. And you only have so many spots to fill. But I think what you have
here this weekend, you understand that the people that have been in this game
for a long time may have missed a few opportunities to get back to a Final
Four, but it didn't mean that they didn't have a great program or a Final Four
caliber team.  
Sometimes you've just got to get some breaks along the way. So we're just
excited to be here. I said last night at the salute dinner, I never want to
take for granted -- that's our 18th team to make it to a Final Four. But every
year it seems so hard and it's getting harder all the time, because of the
parity in the game.  
  
Q. Probably nobody in this sport understands and appreciates the concept of
competition better than you do. That being the case, what is acceptable in
your opinion in the way LSU will approach Candace tomorrow? Are hard screens
acceptable? Are hard fouls acceptable? What goes over the line of
sportsmanship at that point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously I expect to see hard screens out of LSU because in
their motion offense, they are athletic, they're aggressive. But I don't
expect to see a hard foul from LSU intentionally. I just don't see as that as
who they are. I think they'll come and play a very aggressive, competitive
game. But that's the only way that I've seen them play over the years and
certainly Van coming in is -- to me he's going to have his team ready to play.  
But I would -- that thought has never crossed my mind. Maybe I'm naive, but
the only thing Van told me when I got here yesterday is that he had never
cheered so hard in his life for Texas A&M. So I had to laugh. I said only Van
would tell me that. I said, Van I cheered for you.  
But we won't be cheering for each other, trust me. It will be intense. It
should be a great matchup, and obviously a hard-fought game on the part of
both teams.  
  
Q. Pat, I guess at some point either Thursday or Friday Candace was doing
left-handed layups and you were trying to discourage her from that?  
COACH SUMMITT: We go to practice, first time Candace has been back out on the
floor, and she comes in shooting left-handed layups. I said, Candace, stick
with the right hand for now.  
But that's Candace. I'm sure she just wanted to test it out and see how she
felt. And she did go through most of our practice that day.  
  
Q. Thursday or Friday?  
COACH SUMMITT: That would have been on Thursday. And then she finished out
practice shooting right-handed, fortunately.  
  
Q. What do you think of the Wade Trophy not going to Candace Parker?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously you had a lot of great players on that stage. Candice
Wiggins has had a great run at Stanford and obviously did a tremendous job in
helping get her teammates, her coaches right here to the Final Four.  
And, you know, I'm obviously partial to Candace. And I hated it for Candace. I
think she missed out on being the player of the year in the SEC, as voted on
by the coaches, and also by Associated Press.  
And that's part of the game. I think for Candace it's more about the team and
trying to win here, and that's our focus as well. And I congratulate,
obviously, Candice Wiggins and the Stanford program. Tremendous honor for
both.  
  
Q. Van has said from time to time during the season that they'll have thrown
in a new play or this or that, some new wrinkle the other team hasn't seen.
Aside from that, you guys again know each other so well. Teams have
tendencies. Aside from maybe one or two new wrinkles, can there be much that
either team doesn't know what to anticipate from the other?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I don't think there will be a lot of surprises. I think
that we know them and they know us. One thing Van has brought to this LSU team
is just a variety of sets that allows for Chaney, getting Chaney more involved
offensively. Looks to me like he's running a couple of the pro sets that he
ran for Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper in terms of the baseline action and
coming off the screens.  
And I think this team plays with a little more freedom, which has given them a
chance to be a little bit more creative, if you will. And I think that's
really enhanced their play. So less predictable. And I think that's been a
good thing for LSU and it's also a challenge for us.  
We have to defend the high-low. We have to defend the dribble drives, and we
have to do a better job of really denying and contesting the 3 ball.  
  
Q. First off, really been enjoying the spot with you and Kenny Mayne on the
SportsCenter spot, one of the funnier ones I've seen?  
COACH SUMMITT: Such a goober. Hard for me to look at it.  
  
Q. Most people look at this as you guys have dominated SEC for all of these
years. LSU's been good and gotten here but not quite been able to get over the
hump. How would you look at it against the irony of you're the team that they
have to beat to finally do that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, considering we went to seven Final Fours and played in
four national championship games before we won one, I know how they feel. It
was like: Are we ever going to get there?  
But I think if you get there enough times, eventually you're going to be able
to get a break or make your own breaks, if you will. And the fact that they've
had this consistency, you know, it speaks volumes for who they are, how
competitive they are and how driven they are to get back and give themselves
an opportunity to perhaps win a championship.  
And I think from my experiences, for me, it was -- I almost felt like will it
ever happen. And I can tell you that the year that it happened, it was
probably the year that I finally relaxed and thought, well, you know what, one
of these days Tennessee's going to win a national championship. And we just
happened to do it in '87. And I think you never know.  
It may be their turn. It may be someone else's turn. But you just have to keep
going there and playing your game and not putting the pressure on yourselves
or your players. I think that's key. I think Van keeps them loose. He makes me
laugh all the time. I'm sure they laugh, too.  
  
Q. If Candace were to go out in this game because of her injury, do you
think your players would respond better this time because they've been through
a situation where they were without her?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think so. I think they gained a lot of confidence from what
they did in the A&M game. And obviously Candace came back in that game.  
But I think we -- in particular, I thought Alexis really stepped up. We
struggled there. We struggled to make shots for a while. And, as I said,
Alexis couldn't make a layup but she could hit a 40-footer. Go figure that one
out.  
But I think that they were really pressing when Alexis missed those layups. I
think she was like: Oh, I can't make a shot. And just trying to get them to
calm down and relax. You've got to be relaxed on offense. That's not where you
tense up. I think when Candace came back in they relaxed even more.  
But I think having gone through that, hopefully, if we're faced with that
situation, that they will be a little more relaxed offensively and a little
more focused on the execution part of it.  
  
Q. How will you and your staff monitor Candace's shoulder throughout the
game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Jenny Moshak will monitor the shoulder. That's our right-hand
person and obviously she's had a lot of experience in dealing with injuries
and unfortunately shoulder injuries have been a part of the game for us that
we've had to deal with.  
And I think Jenny has to listen to Candace and Candace has to listen to Jenny.
And I think their communication is such that we're going to get the right
results in the end, whether that's play her or sit her.  
I think that between the two of them, they will determine what is best.  
  
Q. Just because you're a better story-teller than you are a coach, please
tell us the raccoon story. And was it like a Wade Trophy winning raccoon or
was it a walk-on raccoon?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it wasn't a Wade Trophy winner. Actually, I just went out
on the back deck. Had my two labs with me, took some trash out. I was going to
take the dogs out. And when I turned around to get the two dogs, my oldest lab
was almost about -- I'd say about that far (indicating) from the raccoon, who
was sitting -- the raccoon was sitting up on the deck and she was on the
bottom. He was actually up on the top. All I knew -- I heard raccoons go
obviously for the eyes, they're vicious.  
I didn't know they carried rabies until someone told me after I hit it. But I
just reacted. Fortunately I've never done this with a player; I wouldn't be
here. I just reacted the raccoon was looking at Sally and they were there and
I just came from the side and I hit it and then I opened my arm up to push it
off the top deck, and when I did I dislocated my shoulder.  
So when I saw Candace dislocated her shoulder, I knew her pain. Fortunately
Dr. Becky Morgan came over to the house and she and Tyler put it back in at
about 1:30 in the morning.  
  
Q. How long did you have it out?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was out -- because this is my personality, I thought I could
get it back in myself. I went and sat in the recliner and sat there and moved
my arm. I probably sat there, I don't know, 30, 45 minutes. I decided, well,
go take a hot shower and maybe that will help.  
So I took a shower. And that didn't help. So I went in and I decided I'll just
lay down and see if I could get it back in by putting a pillow under it. That
didn't work. So finally I called Dr. Morgan, I don't know, an hour and a half,
hour 45 minutes later. And I wish I would have called her right away. But she
came over and she -- between Tyler and Dr. Morgan, it went back in.  
  
Q. How was the raccoon?  
COACH SUMMITT: Never saw the raccoon again. He's probably thinking that's the
craziest woman I've ever met. I'm out of here (laughter).  
  
Q. There's six girls that played New York City high school basketball that
are at the Final Four. And Nicky Anosike said there's a reason those six
girls: Because of the way they played. You've had some experience with them.
Could you explain what it is about them?  
COACH SUMMITT: One thing is a lot of them just grew up on the play grounds and
went to the park and played with the guys and played up and down and played
for hours. I know Shannon Bobbitt had to bring me a videotape of when she was
playing in New York and playing with all the guys. And it was amazing, just to
see the talent level.  
And obviously Nicky is -- that's what they did. I mean, they went to school
and they played basketball and they liked to compete and they liked to hang
out and play against the best players and a lot of times it would be the guys
that would go to the park. We've got some special players out of New York.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The student-athletes have arrived. We'll take questions for the
student-athletes first.  
Coach, your thoughts on this evening's game.  
COACH BLAIR: For the die-hard out there, you might have wanted offense. But
for the basketball purists out there, it was great defense from both teams.
Their perimeter defense was a lot better than we expected, and they -- Bobbitt
in the first half controlled their defense.  
The second half we did a better job of sometimes running our stuff, but we
couldn't score! We scored six baskets, they scored five. Is that good for
women's basketball? Damn straight, if you can appreciate defense, but you have
to appreciate that.  
But we did some things to take them deep into the shot clock; I thought we did
a great job of backgrounding the ball, except for two or three offensive
possessions, but other than that, they were one and out. I thought there was a
couple of times in the second half where we had the right play called, we
didn't execute or we had Bobbitt isolated on Gant and we quit shooting the
15-footer over her, which was open.  
It would be just like Alexis Hornbuckle shooting a 15-footer over her on the
mismatch. You've got to take what the defense gives, and you when the defense
gives you something, you've got to exploit it.  
There is not much more that I can say. I'm just so proud of this basketball
team. The score was 42-39 or something like that. We missed the front-end of a
1-1, that was huge. But we missed so many shots in the second half, which one
did you want to look at that was more important?  
We turned the ball over than we normally did, and that was because of our
passing skills and our ball handling, and Tennessee is a very good perimeter
defense. I thought the post players neutralized themselves very well. I
thought La Toya Micheaux played a very good second half, and I thought she
neutralized Anosike very well.  
Parker is Parker, and we did as well as we could. And I thought she showed a
lot of effort playing with that shoulder of hers, because I know she was in a
lot of pain, but we were in a lot of pain trying to guard her, too.  
This basketball team, you look at the eight scorers that were left, the 2 seed
won the first two and almost won this one. This is the way it should be. You
shouldn't predetermine before the year starts who is going to be the national
champion.  
There's clairity out there, and it's coming. We need more Texas A&M's out
there that's going to pay the price and move up their product to get the job
done. I'm proud of our conference. I'm proud of the Big 12 for hosting the
best and most well-attended regional of all four of 'em. That's what we do
here in the Big 12, we did it right.  
This is a great basketball country, and I'm hoping the recruits all over the
country will say, hey, I want to play for a Big 12 school, preferably somebody
in maroon. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. A'Quo, if you and Mo could address this. How difficult were the shots
down the stretch? You guys only got 3 points in the last six minutes. While
the defense was there, it ultimately comes down on making shots, doesn't it?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: You've got to give credit to Tennessee. They did a
tremendous job guarding us on the perimeter.  
Yes, Tennessee, the defending national champs, holding them to five buckets in
the second half. Like Coach said, it was a great defensive game, and Alexis
Hornbuckle stepped up and had a big shot for them down the stretch.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think whenever you play the style of defense like we
play, it's going to be hard day in and day out to create shots and get open
plays, and that's what we saw tonight.  
  
Q. A'quonesia, can you talk about before you arrived from when you guys came
in as freshman to running all the way to the Elite Eight?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Coming here as a freshman -- the year before I got there,
Texas A&M was losing close, and once I got there, we were winning, you know,
big games, advanced to the NIT. The next two years we advanced to the NCAA and
this year making it to the Elite Eight is showing that the program has turned
around. Texas A&M is back on the map!  
  
Q. Takia, when Parker goes out, did anybody have to remind you guys not to
think, now we're going to run them off the floor? We timely got her out of
there? Is there a tendency to think, now we've got them where we want them?  
TAKIA STARKS: Kind of sort of. We were paying attention to when she was in and
out of the game. And when she was out, we wanted to push the tempo more and
attack the basket more with her absence.  
  
Q. Takia and A'Quo, the first half, talk about the outside pressure for
them, you were 5 of 10 on three-pointers, and what changed from the first half
to the second half, do you feel?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: In the first half, like Coach said, Bobbitt did a great
job of mixing up our offense, getting our timing off, putting more pressure on
me. And in the first half, we were moving. And the next time we went down the
shot clock was running down and it was one-on-one.  
In the second half they were switching from man to zone and doing a tremendous
job of keep us away from the three-point line and keeping us away from the
perimeter. And they did a tremendous job of stepping up their perimeter
defense.  
TAKIA STARKS: Their defense got better in the second half. And I know they
were with me whenever I went and didn't have too many open shots, and our
passes got sloppy and we were kind of throwing it around all over the place.  
  
Q. Okay, ladies, we're going to let you return to the locker room.
Congratulations on a great season.  
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, were you disappointed not to be able to stretch that lead while
Parker was out of the game? Is that something that you thought was a good
opportunity?  
And second, what went through your mind when she hit that shot from, you know,
mid-court?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, it felt like it was Andrea Reilly all over hitting one, but
that shot was further out than Andrea's at the end of the game, but that
didn't beat us. I think it made it a 5-point game, and we still had shots.  
We missed layups and outside shots and didn't hit it, but great players make
great plays at the end of the game. You've got to want the ball. She was the
only starter, really, besides Parker, that was doing anything on the offensive
end.  
Bobbitt was doing a good job of running her team, but she was turning it over
just like my guards were turning it over. So though I believe that was the
only field goal for her in the second half, that was a dagger that hurt.  
We were taking them deep into the shot clock, and I think that's good defense.
That's not poor offense, that's good defense first, but they were doing the
same thing to us.  
We were not doing a good job when the ball stopped. I don't know if I answered
that or not, but just make up a couple things. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: We went to a press. When she came back into the ballgame, Reado
fouled her once on the open court thing, and we told her to back off of that.
We felt like we could pressure the rest of them like we press everybody else
in the country.  
Our job is to turn the ball over and get easy transition baskets. I think one
of those six baskets was a wide-open layup by us. Other than that, we didn't
run the offense well enough.  
It's all about execution, but if the defense takes away your options, then
you've got to be creative enough to score off of the dribble, and that's where
we were turning the ball over. We were not creating off of the dribble when
the shot clock went down. Good defense, bad ball handling.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your senior class, what they meant not only during
their four years, but what they will mean to the future of this program?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope seniors all over the country realize, go to the school
that best fits your talent and your opportunity.  
There is a lot of schools that you can live your dream out; Texas A&M is just
one of them. But these seniors have been so special. They believed in us
first. They said, hey, we'll only come to a program that's not winning, and
I'm going to believe in the coaching staff and I'm going to believe in the
quality of education. We can get it at Texas A&M. They're special.  
I hope a couple of them get next-level opportunities. But if not, I want them
to be successful in life. Use this as a learning experience. Sometimes you
have to fail before you can succeed. I think that's what we did tonight. But
we had every intention of winning this basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a five-point lead with six minutes to go; crowd is into
it, everything seems to be working. Do you feel like at that point it was your
game to win? That was the way you wanted everything to go at that point?  
COACH BLAIR: I'm glad you reminded me of that, Robert; I didn't realize it was
five with six, but that hurts, yeah. Give credit to Tennessee for winning it.  
I don't think we lost it, I think Tennessee won it down the stretch. They made
the plays, the defensive plays and the offensive plays and knocked down a
couple of free-throws and that was it.  
Neither team can look back at one particular play that just made it, because
even if Hornbuckle would have missed that shot from 40 feet, Batman could have
come in and got the rebound and dunked on us. We never know, because she can
make that many plays, but we were doing a pretty good job on her.  
  
Q. Gary, when you go back home, will you -- how -- what will you think about
how this team came here, and after all this program has been and where it's
been, y'all are one or two breaks away from getting to the Final Four, and
just how much growth of the program is it until y'all get to that point?  
COACH BLAIR: The last two years we didn't leave our best game on the floor. In
the first round or the second round. I think we left our best game on the
floor. We didn't leave our best execution, but we gave people all across the
country a new team to root for. Okay? A new team to root for. I mean, it's
great.  
I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan, as you know, but sometimes it's time for other teams
to win in football besides the Cowboys all the time. And maybe it's time for
other teams in women's basketball besides, what, Tennessee and Connecticut and
the Dukes of the world have done. It's time to spread it around, but to do
that, we've got to spread around the recruiting a little, too.  
  
Q. Gary, I think you said the other day you weren't playing unless Danielle
played. She played tonight. Can you talk about her and the kids you have
coming back next year?  
COACH BLAIR: This was not Danielle's best game, but defensively she was as
solid as she ever was. On offense, she missed some opportunities that she
normally knocks down and she's got to shoot the mid-range game against this
team because they're not going to let you get to the basket.  
We ran a couple of set plays where we had her matched up with Bobbitt, and
those are her plays and she's got to shoot over her, just like she would shoot
over A'Quo, you can't get to the rim on those.  
I don't know if there's a 5'10" player in the country that plays harder than
her on both ends of the floor. Somebody might play better than her on a
consistent basis on the offensive end, but nobody plays harder than her.  
And when you play harder, you work on your skills over the summer, there is no
telling how good she's going to become. She's a special player, comes from a
great state and we're just lucky to have her for one more year.  
  
Q. I wonder if you watched last night's LSU game?  
COACH BLAIR: Sure did.  
  
Q. And you know what it's like to coach for a long time, and your thoughts
on Van getting his first Final Four and the LSU/Tennessee rematch?  
COACH BLAIR: First on the rematches and opponents playing each other, I think
all of us need to realize that the Big East has 8 teams in and the Big 12 has
8 teams in. You're going to see somebody in a regional final or first round,
so get over it.  
I think that's what the coaches need to do. We should be rewarded because both
of us have 8 teams. I just think, be happy where you are right now, because I
think the quality of the teams, particularly these schools at the top eight or
through the top 16, that's the heart and the soul of women's basketball right
now.  
I'm just glad to be a part of it right now, glad to have the Big 12 be part of
it. That was the first -- give me that first part again, Michelle.  
  
Q. Van?  
COACH BLAIR: Van, I wanted so bad to get to the Final Four and play Van,
because he would have been the oldest coach to coach in the Final Four, not
me. And he was a lot older than me! (Chuckles.)  
But I'm happy for Van because you're sort of in a no-win situation. You take
somebody else's kids, particularly older kids that are set in their ways, but
he was smart enough to keep Bob Starkey and bring in Travis and Yolanda.  
He's got a great staff and he's a defensive-minded coach, just like I am, and
I think it will be a great match-up. I think we were probably able to show a
lot of people some things that might hurt Tennessee, but some of the things we
did might hurt a Connecticut or an LSU, too.  
But some of the things they did to us hurt us. We've got to get better on both
ends of the court. But LSU getting there, I think that's special. Those are my
old buddies from the SEC, and I'm happy to see both of them there.  
Pat has meant so much to this game, okay? She has meant so much -- she
deserves everything that she is getting. I just wish she would give me a few
of her recruits sometimes, but I'm not going to give up any of mine, though. I
love what I have.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments and best of luck.  
COACH BLAIR: Last thing, it was my wife's birthday today, and I did get her a
pretty doggone good present back there, and my grandson right there is pretty
special. That's Logan, he's 4 years old. Give 'em a wave there, Logan.  
Thanks to Big 12 for running a great tournament.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Lady Vols and Head Coach Pat Summitt, along
with the student-athletes.  
Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've got a lot of thoughts on the team. It was a hard-fought
game, and basically when Candace's shoulder went out, it was something you're
not ready for, and we faced adversity, but I thought our basketball team came
through.  
I thought Alexis and Nicky, they were key for us, and we didn't shoot the ball
well, and when you struggle offensively, as in our first game here, sometimes
it affects your defense. But I'm proud of this team for just the grit and the
determination that they had on the defensive end when things were not going
well for us offensively, and with Candace obviously on the court, and just the
extent of her injury unknown at the time, and pleased with how we fought
through.  
And certainly down the stretch we did a much better job with controlling the
defensive boards; I thought that was key for us. Our basketball team, it's
something we talked about, when you're not shooting the ball particularly well
you've got to get to the glass, and obviously on the defensive end it's got to
be a one-and-done mentality.  
I'm really proud that we didn't give up. We fought through and found a way to
win, and Alexis couldn't make a layup, but she made a shot from, I don't know,
seemed to be almost half-court. So that wasn't planned but it certainly -- it
was huge at the time because that put us up by five and, again, I think that
took a little pressure off of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for our student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about that three. Have you hit one that big in your
career, and did you know it was going in when you let go of it?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I haven't hit a shot that big in my career yet. When I let
it go, honestly, I didn't think I was going to miss it, but I'm not going to
sit here and say I knew it was in. I was going to give it a chance to go in. I
stayed with my follow-through and just stayed with the ball.  
  
Q. Alexis, as you took that shot, were you aware there was no time on the
shot clock, too? Or did you figure it was an open shot, you should take it?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: When the ball was kicked out, if I tried to put the ball on
the ground it was a contested jumper.  
  
Q. Alexis, did you feel like it was the dagger it seemed to be?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I don't know. Ask my teammates. It relieved a lot of
pressure. I knew if we came down and gave them a three, it would have been
void.  
  
Q. Could you take us through the sequence when you hurt the shoulder going
back, hurting it again, your thoughts, getting it wrapped up. What was going
through your mind and how much pain you were?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, when my shoulder went out the first time, it was the
-- I couldn't get it back in myself, and that's the first time that has ever
happened, so I was just trying to find somebody to give the ball to.  
Alexis is running after me trying to get it, and I was trying to find somebody
to give it to. Then I kinda rushed the recovery and came back in and reinjured
it, and it came out again, so the second time she put it back in, and they
found a sleeve, and I was able to find my muscle and things like that, but I
just want to reiterate how proud I am of my team. They held it down, and
obviously our shots weren't falling, but defensively that's something that we
brought to this tournament and that's something we need and that's the reason
why we won.  
  
Q. Candace, 10:39 to go you were sort of reluctant to kind of mix it up, and
all of a sudden you just sort of let it hang out; were you in pain? Did you
decide, "I've got to go for it now because we're getting down here and we may
lose"? What was your thinking?   
CANDACE PARKER: Our starting lineup is obviously filled with five seniors, and
I just remember sitting on the bench, watching them play and just thinking to
myself that I was just -- if I got out there again, then I was going to play
as hard as I could and not think about, you know, my shoulder and my
situation, because I didn't want this to be the last time that we played
together.  
So that was just -- and then my teammates, we just kept talking and kept just
getting energy, and I think I just fed off of that.  
  
Q. Nicky, the team huddled up to start the second half when you were going
to have to start with Candace in the locker room.  
Can you talk about what you guys were saying in the huddle?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: When what?  
  
Q. Before the second half started, you guys huddled up. Candace was still in
the locker room. What were you guys saying to each other in that huddle?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Nicky was doing all the talking, I don't know how she
doesn't remember. Basically she looked all of us in the eyes and said, you
know, "We're not going home. And the only way we can do this is with defense,
and we have to stay positive," and everyone responded well.  
  
Q. You guys, as Candace said, held things together when she was out, but how
much of a relief was it to see her on the side lines? You guys as a class are
so close.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: It's always a relief when you have a teammate go out; it's
like one of your sisters, so when she came out of the locker room, we were
relieved that she was okay.  
And we know she is a tough soldier, so we knew she would be back. And she's
able to play through pain and we never doubted her return.  
  
Q. Nicky, how excited is this team to get to Tampa? I know it was your
season-long goal.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think we're definitely excited to get to Tampa, but we're not
satisfied yet, and we know we have a lot of work ahead of us.  
You know, we have to play a great team on Sunday. But we're definitely
excited; we just know that it's not the end and we have to keep pressing
forward.  
  
Q. Candace, I know you said before that your shoulder subluxes a lot, and I
can't imagine that being a normal thing. Were you freaked out by this, or is
this a normal course of action?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, when it subluxes, it's all right. I'm like,
whatever, but it actually went out and stayed out, so I was a little worried,
but Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in the world and, you know, so I wasn't
worried after that.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you sort of tell when -- you know, Texas A &M has never been
here before as a program, is that something that kicks in with you guys? Those
of us who followed Tennessee back when you were a baby watched Tennessee do
this to people, but did something kick in with you guys where you're not going
to lose the game and maybe a program that hasn't been there doubts themselves?
  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: If they were doubting themselves, they didn't show that at
all. They're a great team, and they showed no quit at all. And as far as being
there before, we had this attitude that we don't want to go home. I've fallen
short twice, I didn't want to do it again.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on tonight's game, best of luck.  
  
Q. In the back of your mind, are you worried about Candace, and trying to be
focused on the kids on the court? How focused were you?  
COACH SUMMITT: When it first happened, as soon as I saw it, it was like, this
is not good timing, and I did -- I did feel like at that time she would be
back, just knowing I dislocated my shoulder a couple weeks ago trying to knock
a raccoon off the back deck, and mine went right back in.  
So I thought, at my age if I can come back, she'll be back. It was
interesting, because that flashed through my head, she'll be back. I didn't
have Jenny Moshak there, but I did have a team physician come put mine in.  
So when I saw Jenny go right to Candace, I felt like she would be able to
return. What bothered me was when it went out the second time. That really
scared me and I thought, well, she may be finished for the game. I really
liked just the mentality of our team. I can't say enough about Nicky Anosike.
When you face adversity or when the game is tight, she's just got a warrior's
mentality. She just fights to the end, and she challenges everyone on the
court to step up.  
You know, she's the best coach we have in adversity, and I just saw her step
up and, you know, I felt much better just knowing that the message was being
delivered, that there's not going to be any quit in this group, and there
hasn't been.  
I mean, we've had some tough games, and even in our last with Stanford out
there, I thought we fought to the end. The only game we crumbled was against
LSU, and that was a valuable lesson for us. I was worried, but who is not
going to be when the best player in the country goes out and, you know, you've
got to get everyone else focused, and I tried to stay as positive as I could.  
My coaching staff did a great job, because in the back of my mind I kept
thinking about it. But between Nicky, Holly and Dean, they were so positive it
was good for our bench.  
  
Q. Pat, with your experience with the raccoon, can you kinda go through what
level of pain Candace might have been going through tonight? And second
question, with all of the stuff that she does, is her toughness maybe one of
those things that gets overlooked in her game?  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, let me tell you, it is very, very painful! I
can't imagine the fact that, you know, she went through that twice tonight.
But obviously she's a lot stronger than Coach Summitt, and so she's got
something to protect her a little bit better, I'm sure, just from all the
weight-lifting that she does.  
But it was hard to, you know, just move forward, and I didn't want to do
anything that was going to be detrimental to Candace, but at the same time I
trust Jenny Moshak. I think she's the best in her profession, and I had a lot
of confidence and I felt like once she got the sleeve, which was another
interesting story.  
I think they were under the bus, going through laundry to find the sleeve, and
I'm like, about to have a fit as to why we don't have it right there, but at
any rate when I saw the sleeve on her I felt like she would have the
protection she needed.  
Then she shoots that air ball, and I'm a little doubtful about what's going
on. But she goes to the free-throw line and makes a free-throw so, yes, people
sometimes they see Candace as more of a finesse player but I think sometimes
when you see finesse players, you don't realize just how mentally tough they
are until you see them fight through the adversity that she fought through
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, your players mentioned that they thought A &M fought to the very
end, and Gary said he thought your team won the game tonight rather than his
team losing the game. Would you agree with that?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we closed out the game, and I think when Candace
came back, I thought we made some big shots and big plays. But, of course, I
do think when Candace returned, we were more confident and had more composure
offensively and made some shots to win the game. Take nothing away from Texas
A&M.  
I'm very impressed with their team. I've known Gary for years, I respect him,
I respect how he can -- no matter where he goes, where he coaches, he always
assembles a very strong program and a team that can fight you to the end. What
he's done here in the amount of time is very, very impressive.  
I knew it was going to be a really tough game for us to win. We came in with
tremendous respect for their basketball team, and I think that helped us in
the end.  
  
Q. Coach, you said that you were a little worried after the second time it
dislocated. Were you at all reluctant to put her back in, perhaps, with the
risk of something else happening? At that point what was your game plan going
forward? Were you trying to formulate something without Parker in the game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, my first response was when I saw -- when I saw the
sleeve, I felt better, but I had to hear from Jenny. Candace, I knew the
answer she would give me, but I asked Jenny, and she felt like that she could
go. What was the last part of your question?  
  
Q. Just if your mind maybe was spinning.  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely!  
  
Q. Trying to find a game plan --  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely because, you know, Vicki Baugh came in and couldn't
seem to get on track. I went with Alex for the beginning of the second half,
and we were struggling, struggling offensively, and at that point in time I
was thinking probably more about what we wanted to do defensively.  
And that's when we put our heads together as a coaching staff and decided that
we would extend our defense a little bit more and try and take a little more
time off the clock, more of a delay-and-disrupt type of pressure in the three-
quarter, because I was thinking, I'm not sure we can open up man-to-man and go
at 'em the way we want to. We need a different presence on the inside.  
So probably just more what we wanted to do defensively. Offensively I thought
we would -- we would have to get paint points, and we would have to get our
guards to penetrate more, and that's where I challenged Alexis and she had
gone -- she went to the paint but didn't score in the paint. I think of the
layups that we missed there, and she got frustrated, so I felt more like a
cheerleader tonight at times than a coach, but that's okay, if that works,
that works.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little more about Alexis' shot? She released that
in front of you, dunk it was good?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was interesting, no, I had no idea that shot was going to go
in. I was just hoping it would hit the rim so it would have a chance to
rebound and put it back. She released it in my view of it, I thought, you
know, it could go in, but it wasn't the shot that I was counting on.  
  
Q. You're about to go play in the Final Four in a city that's never hosted
it before. How good is the diversity of the local for the women's game and
after being here in Oklahoma City, do you think Oklahoma City could host a
Final Four?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, to answer your second question first I definitely think
Oklahoma City could host a Final Four. I'm impressed with the people that came
out and supported this. With Oklahoma not coming back, and like I said, I've
been in that situation when we were hosting the Final Four, and our fans came
out, Oklahoma fans came out as well.  
I just think when you can find locations, where they support women's
basketball, it's a place that can, having been to Tampa and played earlier in
the year, what a great place, and it's a great venue, and obviously the Final
Four is the biggest stage for women's basketball, and I'm really excited.  
I was excited when Tampa became the host for our Final Four, and I think the
people that go there, they're going to have a great time, it's a great area
and I think there will be a lot of excitement for women's basketball there. I
appreciate what the fans did here.  
THE MODERATOR: Pat Summitt congratulations to you and best of luck to you in
the Final Four.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas A&M University Aggies, and Head Coach
Gary Blair. Comments, Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: First it's great to be playing March 30th, you're going to play
your next ballgame April 1st. It's away it's been a long season but in another
way it's been the most rewarding season that I've been a part of. These kids
have played their hearts out. The kids have overcome diversities, due to
injuries during the year, and when the injuries happen, we don't dwell on
them, we just put another person in place and we go on.  
And this is what this team is about. If Starks is having a bad game, then
Morenike Atunrase picks her up. If A'Quo is having a bad game, the freshman,
Sidney Colson comes in. If we need to move Gant to the 4 position because
Morenike is hot, Reado comes out. If we have Micheaux in foul trouble, Reado
goes to the 5 and we play "small ball."  
It's been fun coaching this team because we have interchangeable parts. Our
egos are all in check, we're on the same page, and these kids really like each
other off the court. I think that's a whole lot easier to coach. I've got a
tremendous staff, I've got a tremendous support staff, and when you're all on
the same page, that's why you're playing late in the season. The game last
night, I thought we just hooked up and we played as hard as we could.  
We had great defense, great transition in the first half, in the second half I
thought our half-court offense and our press-breaking was excellent. That's
why we won the game, and we're still going. Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. A'Quo, how do you put that game behind? It's so vivid, the biggest win in
school history, how do you go about putting that go game behind and focus on
Tennessee?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Just that we got the "W" and we have to look forward to
our next opponent. We did a tremendous job of pressuring the ball and causing
tremendous defense and making them uncomfortable, and we're going to go into
the next game and keep our same game plan and pressure up on defense.  
  
Q. La Toya, Tennessee has seems like 6-3 after 6-3, you guys are going to be
busy. How are you going to stop 'em inside?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: We faced that in this whole conference, Courtney Parish and
Oklahoma and Colorado, we did that last night. We have to keep battling and we
fight and don't stop, so that will continue on for tomorrow.  
  
Q. T.K., Patrice, could you answer this? Could y'all talk about Vic and what
has your defensive coordinator meant to this team and how much does he ride
you when things aren't going good, and how much does he praise you, which
doesn't seem to be very often, unless the game is over and you win by 30 or
40. Is there ever a perfect defensive game for coach Schafer?  
PATRICE READO: I don't know. It doesn't matter if you're up by 20 or down by
20, he's going to be the same. He's a defensive coordinator, he wants us to
play his style of defense. He wants us in the passing lanes and covering the
post and defending and everything else. So we just have to give him our best
and try to play the type of defense that he wants us to play every game.  
TAKIA STARKS: You know, just to echo what Reado said. He just wants us to get
out and deny, do all the fundamentals of his style of defense. He did praise
me in the shootaround today. He said he did a great job of defense and also
the team last night in the game. He's always going to push us to do better and
be the best that we can be.  
  
Q. Explain to me why is y'all's defense so different than everyone else's?
Why is it different than what everyone in the Big 12 does, and why is it
different than what everybody in the country does?  
TAKIA STARKS: Everybody plays hard, as Coach says all the time, but you've got
to play hard and smart and I think that's where we've really gotten better
this year, being smart and making smart plays and making game-changing plays
at that.  
PATRICE READO: I think we play very hard, we pressure-up on the defensive end,
and we stay in the passing lanes.  
  
Q. A'Quo, you're sitting next to him, but I wonder, you get the intensity
from Coach Schaefer, but do you ever see that from Coach Blair or is he always
Mr. Nice Guy for you guys?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: He's the soft one, but he has his days where he's very
tough on us, but he's a little teddy bear.  
(Coach hugged player.)  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, are you supposed to do that?  
COACH BLAIR: Probably not; it's an NCAA violation. I'm sure it is! Hopefully
the recruits will notice that I do hug and kiss my players.  
  
Q. Takia, can you talk about the challenges -- you guys obviously relish the
defensive -- playing defense and getting in people's face, pressure, trapping.
Talk about the challenges Tennessee presents to doing that kinda thing.  
TAKIA STARKS: We are just going to go into it like we went into the game
yesterday, just playing our game on defense and playing our game on offense,
just making smart plays, and I think we did a great job last night with Reado
not getting into foul trouble as much as she usually does. That was big for
us, and, Micheaux, she was out for a minute but came in and was productive,
staying out of foul trouble and making smart plays and playing with pressure
as we usually do.  
  
Q. For A'Quo and Takia, Takia, you talked yesterday about there not being so
much pressure or more of a chip on the shoulders for the bigger names. You
guys are a No. 2 seed. I wonder where the disrespect or the lack of
acknowledgment comes from considering you're a No. 2 seed.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Just coming out of high school, most of those Duke and
Tennessee girls were Parade All-Americans. Here at A&M there's no Parade All-
Americans, I think we have one All-American, which is Tyra White, the
freshman, but we just come out and play hard day in and day out. The other
girls with the names, the Duke's and Tennessee's with the names, they are
expected to play that way every game.  
So I feel like they have the chip on their shoulder simply because they have
the -- their names are out there, and we're making names for ourselves.  
  
Q. Morenike, if you look at the starting lineups for tomorrow night's game,
it's all juniors and seniors, a lot of experience. What do you expect out of a
game like that?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think the same thing with both of us, because we are --
they've been to the big games, and we're headed there, so there will be a lot
of competition and a lot of just scratching and clawing out there. We know
what to expect, and you'll see a lot of hustle plays and playing hard and
making spectacular plays.  
  
Q. Morenike, you've been known lately as instant offense, but last night you
had four key offensive rebounds. Do you see your role changing? Talk about
your role on this team.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: My role hasn't changed since before my surgery. I don't
think it has changed much. I've gotten back to -- into an offensive state of
mind and that has come with me feeling better physically and mentally on the
court, but I don't think my role has changed that much. When Danielle or Reado
are out of the game, I stick to the game plan, go in and get rebounds or
blocked shots and that's been my game plan since I've been at A&M.  
  
Q. For the three seniors, can you talk about how much this is -- you guys
aren't ready to quit playing college basketball and what that does to keep you
going in these games? And a shot at Tennessee! I mean, what you guys have
built this program up from to where you are now, and what this game means to
you?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I think that's one of the reasons why we came to Texas
A&M, you know, is to be able to be at a program that's on the rise and not a
program that already had a name for itself. And just to play against
Tennessee, being in the Elite Eight is an honor to us, and we're really
excited to be here. We made it this far, why stop now?  
PATRICE READO: Like A'Quo said, that's one of the reasons we came to A&M to
bring the program up. I think we're excited to be here in the Elite Eight, and
we're going to continue with the pace and right now we just are one of the
best right now.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: We've worked hard for it. Coming to A&M, there was no doubt
in my mind that we can't reach the highs that we are at right now. The
coaching staff that Coach Blair had, I knew coming here he knew how to coach
and what type of players to go after, so there was no doubt in my mind that we
wouldn't reach the goals we have reached.  
  
Q. A'Quo, Coach Blair mentioned last night the second half of you showing
what you can do for the WNBA and trying to get invited to the Combine. How big
is that for you, trying to show what you can do and go to the next level?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I did what I could for my team. First half Coach brought me
to the sidelines and said, "I need a couple of shots out of you and I need you
to lead this team." I think I was 0 for something in the first half and had
two back-to-back turnovers on Duke's press, so in the second half I wanted to
do what I had to do for my team, hit the open shots, break the press and lead
the team to a "W!"  
Q. La Toya, can you talk about the challenge of playing an all-around talent
such as Candace Parker?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: It's a challenge every time you step out on the court, no
matter who you're playing, but, of course, her name is everywhere, and it's an
honor to play against her and honor to play against Tennessee. They've won 7
National Championships, so what can you say. It is a challenge for our team.
Like Coach said, against Duke, we were on a high, and if we get the win over
Tennessee, it's just something that we have been asking our Coach, give us a
nice schedule. Well, we made our own schedule this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, athletes. Good luck, ladies. Okay, questions for
Coach Blair. What did you see out of Sam Houston in the early 90s, and what is
it you learned about Vic on the golf course that made you like this guy, and
think you've got to get him on your staff and the bond you have formed?  
COACH BLAIR: To be honest, the first time I met him, Gary Wideman was our
Converse rep, and he said I want you to meet the new coach at Steven F., so we
went over to Water Wood, the golf course, met him at about high noon. It's
about 100 degrees, here I am in shorts and looking good as usual, and here
comes Vic out there in polyester long pants, with sunglasses hanging down, you
know the guys that have the straps over 'em, his hair slicked back like that,
and I thought he was salesman or something like that.  
And all of the sudden we started playing, and we developed a very good bond of
a friendship, because our program was at the top of the Southland conference,
and his was at the bottom.  
I would try to share a lot of recruiting ideas or knowledge with him, because
they didn't have the budget to get out to some of the places, and if I could
see a kid that we couldn't use that he could use, I would give him that
information and just try to help him along. Then, you know, it's funny, he was
too proud to take any strokes from me. And at the time I was about a 7, 8, 9,
handicapper, and he was probably about a 12, 13, 14, but all of the sudden as
time went on, his basketball teams started getting better and better.  
His golf game started getting better and better. Then he met Holly, his wife
who was the women's assistant coach at UTA; they never could beat UTA until he
married Holly.  
He married Holly, she gave up coaching and that's the only way -- Vic never
beat UTA when Holly was the assistant over there. But a lot of things changed.
He started dressing better, his golf game got a whole lot better, and we
became friends. When I had the chance -- when Tom Collin got the head job at
Colorado State, Vic was the only person I wanted. Not just because of our
friendship, because he could do a lot with nothing. He could sit there and
take the two twins, Amy and Andi Sheridan, who was his guards out there, and
he could take a lot of cast-offs from other programs, develop them, and he
could find the sleepers and develop kids.  
That was the type of coach I was looking for, somebody that was passionate
about the game of basketball and passionate about life.  
The only bad thing is now I can beat him in golf 1 out of 10 now, because I'm
still the 7, 8, 9, and he's a 3 handicapper now.  
  
Q. What's the secret to his defense?  
COACH BLAIR: Because he's the 12th man, if you go by Aggie terms. He's the
12th man, because it's his passion for the game than when they're playing
defense, they're either hearing him or feeling him out there as part of that
defense. And that's a little bit of an Aggie thing but that's how there's
always somebody there to step in and help. Defense is about trust. You've got
to trust the people behind you, because we're fronting the post. You've got to
trust the people that's guarding the ball because we're going to be in your
shorts, and you're going to beat us by dribble penetration. And that's what
happened last night with Duke, and as soon as they beat us on dribble
penetration, we were there to take three charges.  
We work a lot of the same drills we've been working on for years. We tweak
'em, they get better and better, the personnel gets better, and I've told
people before this team is better than the '98 team I took to the Final Four,
and a lot of that is because our system is better. I'm a better offensive
coach, and he's a better defensive coach, and our personnel seems to be
executing better right now.  
  
Q. Coach, Daniel Gant's condition and whether you expect her to be full
strength tomorrow? Second, like a lot of coaches and fans, you've seen plenty
of Candace Parker on TV. Is it a dream come true or a nightmare come true to
stop her?  
COACH BLAIR: First, on Danielle Gant, she was able to walk through our stuff
today. She had stomach problems again this morning after breakfast, but if I'm
going to be there, she's going to be there. And I plan on playing, and she's
going to play; somehow, some way.  
There is no tomorrow, okay? If you've got the flu, you play. If you've got
stomach problems or something, you play. And she will find a way. Our trainer
will make sure she's ready to go. If not, I'll be looking for a new trainer.
But other than that, she will find a way. The kid's got a lot of heart. It was
pretty scary yesterday when that trainer comes down and says, "Danielle Gant
cannot go." You don't understand, that's like saying Candace Parker can't go.
It's not going to happen, because Gant goes every day, and nobody plays harder
in practice or in games than Gant, but she will be out there.  
Now on Candace Parker. You know, right now what's going on in the hotel;
they're showing all the games of the National Championships and semifinals for
25, 27 years. I'm a part of every one of those. Every game you see on TV, I've
either been a part of it or been to -- I've been to every Final Four, I've
played against every one of those kids, and this is the best. This is the
best, and she's proving it. She doesn't have to wait until her career is over.  
I've seen Liebermann, I've sheen Cheryl Miller, played against her, she cost
us a couple of National Championships when she beat us in '83, '84; we won the
two before that. Tamika Catchings, Holsclaw was a genuine talent that could
change the game, Lynette Woodard, Kansas; Janice Lawrence, Louisiana Tech, who
we helped coach and everything like that.  
I didn't get a chance to go against Ann Meyers; it was right after that I got
into the college game, and she was a great one. Carol Blaskowski was a little
bit before my time, but Candace Parker is the best one I've seen. She can play
all five positions, she is 6-4 or -5, and she's exactly what the WNBA needs
right now, because she's going to go to a media capital.  
And I know you would love to have her in Chicago, but LA would be awfully
stupid not to take her because of what she can bring back to the league. But
Candace Parker's just special.  
  
Q. How are you going to neutralize Candace Parker?  
COACH BLAIR: I think you got to give help -- we cannot play like Notre Dame
did. That's their style. Notre Dame had a tremendous game plan. They ran a
three-quarter press to take time off the court, see if they would throw it
away or see if they would disrupt them a little.  
You've got to take those backdoor lobs when she goes flying in the area;
hopefully she will be under the charge, or whatever, you're going to have to
keep her off the free-throw line, like we tried to with Chante Black and make
sure if Chante Black is going to beat us, it's going to be with a two-point
play not a three-point play. Try to limit her touches, because she can jump
over everybody. And the key is keeping her off the offensive boards, but at
the same time you've got to do the same thick with Nicky as well.  
We're going to have our work cutout for us. So a lot of times we might be able
to front her and get backside help, and she still might be able to jump over
and catch and finish at the same time. Sometimes you pat her on the back and
try to shutdown the others, but the "others" are pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Summitt said she missed you at the conferences, and she gave
us her best imitation of you. I was curious about your relationship with her
and maybe give us your best impression of her.  
COACH BLAIR: Pat is special. I met her in 1977 working a basketball camp at
North Texas. Sara Rappe was the coach there, one of her teammates in the Pan
American Games and Pat and Billy Moore came down to work, and I was a high
school coach, just won my first state championship, and I thought I was
somebody until I met Pat. And Pat was young, just really getting started
there. I played pick-up with her one day and she tore me another one, okay?  
In my eyes, she was Candace Parker! (Laughter.) And she would throw the elbow,
she'd do this, behind the back passes, the whole nine yards, and I thought,
golly, who is this? It was funny. We developed a friendship, and later on I
went to LA Tech, and as an assistant we played Tennessee every year in the
regular season game, or we would play them in the NCAA Tournament.  
So you would just get used to it. Then when I got to the SEC, she was -- Pat
can walk into this room here and make every person in this room feel
important, and not too many people can do that. She can walk into a reception,
and whether you're a junior high coach or college coach, whether you're Nancy
Lieberman or Debbie Antonelli, she gives time to everybody, it's a special
trait that she has. Our families I wouldn't say were real close, because we've
been competitors, but we were at Sandestin together, always at the SEC
tournaments and her son, Tyler, when I was at Arkansas, I sent him a "Hog" hat
and Pat said, "My God, the kid wears it all around the house."  
So two days ago I saw him over at the marble slab creamery, and my wife was
over there, and he's a junior in high school looking like a great young man.
Pat is special because of what she's meant to the game. Because she has
mentored a lot of young coaches that are now out there coaching. She's doing
it the right way, she recruits the right way, she coaches hard, and she
prepares well, and she always has a good staff.  
To me that's someone you should look up to, both on and off the court. I tell
you one thing, she is not going to me out there singing "Rocky Top" in some
little short skirt like she had to do there. I don't know who sounded worse,
her singing or Bruce Pearl with no shirt on. That's not going to happen for me
either way.  
  
Q. Any memorable games between you and her in the SEC, and are you hoping
for the most memorable tomorrow?  
COACH BLAIR: 77-75 we beat her for the only time at Arkansas, December 29th.
My two little guards, Christy Smith, my point guard, and Kim Wilson, my sixth-
footer, had 42 points against Tennessee, and we won 77-75. And that was the
year they had 10 losses and still won the National Championship. That one
meant a whole lot. The next year we go to the Final Four, we beat Duke. We
lose to her in the semifinal game. '98, in my estimation, was the best team
she ever had. The chemistry, she didn't just have one Candace Parker. She had
Holsclaw, she had Jolly, she had Catchings in her rookie year, and that team
was just very good. Probably the biggest thing I think a year later or two
years later, we're playing at Knoxville, I'm up by 13 at half.  
Normally I have a halftime speech when we're down by 13, if you're getting
blown out, hey, get ready for the next game, which was usually LSU, and they
weren't quite as good as they are right now, or they were close. But I didn't
have the speech ready to be up by 13. She kicked me in the second half. I
think we lost by 10, but I learned a lesson there; I better have that speech
ready in case we were up, and we were up.  
We played well, but Tennessee did sort of like what they did to Notre Dame in
the second half. And at their place, it's hard to win. They have great crowds
and just a tremendous following there.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you have a load of experience playing against Coach
Summitt and Tennessee, but your players don't. What do you say to them to
overcome maybe the intimidation factor or just to get them motivated -- to get
them geared up for it?  
COACH BLAIR: This is one thing about these kids right here. They watch ESPN
Monday night games, all the television games. This one right next to me, a
junky, she's going to be a great coach, A'Quonesia is. Right now our kids are
not household names like they are. There's not much you can do about that. I'm
sure Candace probably didn't know all the names of Davidson when they were
playing 'em, but the difference between Davidson and us, we're not David and
Tennessee is Goliath. We're a No. 2 seed that has earned our way up there, and
right now all the 1's and the 2's have advanced.  
Maybe that's good for women's basketball, maybe that's bad, but we're not the
Cinderella team we were in '98, when we were just happy to be here. We're
getting a chance to play against -- she's the legend, she's the best. When you
start looking at her and Geno and Leon Barmore and Tara VanDerveer and Vivian
and Theresa Grentz, there has been a lot of great ones out there, but our kids
do not get caught up in that.  
That's what is good about this team; most of them cannot pronounce Nicky's
last name. They know who she is, they know that she's very good. Bobbitt, the
kid winked at me when we were going off the court, because she's from Trintity
Valley; that's right down the road. That was one of the first junior college
kids that Pat has ever signed, and they made a recruit in her finding somebody
that can direct an offense and still score for her as well.  
I'm familiar with all their kids. Most of them didn't answer my recruiting
letters or my phone calls, but I'm familiar with them. But our kids play for
what's on our jersey at Texas A&M. They don't play for the headlines or who
they can be. In years to come, hopefully, they'll remember our names, but
right now we're having the time of our life right now. We're playing and
having fun, and that's just so important right now. Can you have fun when
you're still winning and losing? And that's what we're doing.  
  
Q. I wonder if you would talk about the team's effort and just how big
that's been in terms of what you've been able to accomplish this season.  
COACH BLAIR: Dan, you've seen my ball clubs over the years, and it's -- this
team is a lot more physical than my Arkansas teams, a lot more physical, but
what we're not is what I've seen in the paper a couple times, "bully"! I mean,
why do you get that term? We're not a bully out there how we play defense.
I've never heard Vivian's team be called bullies, okay? I've seen that in a
couple of newspaper columns, and that's called "defense"! It's called great
dense! When Parker slaps one of our shots down, that's not her intimidating,
that's just good defense.  
And that's how we have to play, because we do have some limitations out there.
We try to hide our weaknesses, we try to use our weaknesses to become
strengths. La Toya Micheaux sets better screens than anybody in the college
game, I believe, and she's very proud of that, because she might not be as
efficient on the offensive end as some of those kids that are still left
playing in the tournament, but she's getting the job done. Little A'Quonesia
-- you could have given me Bobbitt and you could have given Tennessee
A'Quonesia, and Pat would have been just as happy with A'Quonesia, and I
probably would have been just as happy with Shannon, but it's working for both
of us.  
A girl like Morenike should have been recruited by the top 10 teams in the
country. She might not have been on the right AAU teams to get noticed.
Danielle Gant, she's the hardest working kid I've ever had, and that goes all
the way back to Louisiana Tech when I was the assistant coach. That is the
hardest working kid, and she has to find ways to score because of her size.
She's 5-10, and she just keeps coming at ya and coming at ya, and most kids
will not play that hard. A guy asked a while ago on our defensive style, why
doesn't everybody else play our defensive style? Because they won't commit to
it.  
They want to get back on offense as quick as they can. Our style means we want
to keep you on offense for 25 to 28 seconds. We want to take you deep into the
count to wear you out a little bit, and most kids don't want to do that.
Remember what Rick Pitino went to the Celtics, and he says, boys, we're going
to press, we're going to get all over the court. Those pros weren't going to
commit to that, and he's back in the college game where they will commit to
that.  
We play a little bit sort of like what Billy Gillespie did at A&M when he was
coaching there with his defensive style. I think defense wins when you do not
have the Candace Parker's, the Courtney Paris's, you can win by putting four
to five people in double figures, and in case some kid is having a bad night,
somebody else will step up.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are being joined by the University of Tennessee Volunteers.
We're glad to have you here, Coach, congratulations on your win yesterday.  
PAT SUMMITT: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about last night's game?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was two different halves for us. I thought the first half we
really didn't step up with our defensive game plan and execute the way that we
had hoped going into the game, which obviously put us in a tough situation.  
I thought the second half was a much better game. Obviously a much stronger
commitment to our defense, our board play, and I just think our basketball
team knows what they have to do, and you just leave that behind and move
forward, and that's exactly what we're going to do and then get prepared for
Texas A&M in the next couple of days.  
  
Q. Shannon, when you were playing in the JUCO ranks and understood that
Tennessee was thinking you're a good fit, did you ever think you would be
sitting here talking to us about this kinda run in the NCAA Tournament?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: No. I did not think I was going to play for Ms. Pat Summit,
but I'm so happy that I made this decision. I'm happy I'm here, and if I
wasn't at this program, I was cheering for Tennessee. I'm just glad I'm here
and playing for Ms. Pat Summit.  
  
Q. If anybody wants to weigh in on the documented stare of the coach to your
immediate left, that would be wonderful, because she sure as heck was giving
it to you last night, until that second half, of course.  
COACH SUMMITT: I want to hear.  
CANDACE PARKER: It's not so fun now that she's sitting here. Obviously she had
a reason to stare at us, stare through us yesterday. In the first half we
didn't come out ready to play, but we regrouped because of the stare, and came
back in the second half and played a lot better as a team.  
  
Q. Nicky, you have played so many teams, but this team has never played
Texas A &M; I think the last time was 1997. Are you looking forward to seeing
a new opponent?   
NICKY ANOSIKE: Yes, it's fun when we get to play a different team. Sometimes
during the season you play a team two and three times, and it's harder because
you pick up each other's habits. But we're definitely ready for a challenge.
They're a great team. It will be fun to play someone new.  
  
Q. Candace and Alexis, the Texas A &M players yesterday felt like Duke
didn't take them serious at all. They thought that Duke thought they would
roll through them. What do you think of A&M, a team that's not on TV very
much, a team that isn't shown on the east coast hardly at all, really. What do
you think about the Aggies?   
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think that they're a team that gets up and down the court,
they're aggressive, they get into the passing lanes, and you have to respect
every opponent, and that's what we try to do here at Tennessee, because we
realize we have a target on our back. We have to respect them; they didn't get
here by luck.  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously you can't overlook a 2-seed. They were a 2-seed for
a reason. They finished up the season very well, the regular season. We're not
going to overlook them, and we know that they play with a lot of energy, and
we have to match that.  
  
Q. Candace, you've played with Alexis for quite a while. What does having a
guard like that mean for a player who predominantly played on the inside?  
CANDACE PARKER: It means a lot. Playing with Alexis, she is obviously a great
penetrating guard. She stepped out and hit the three this year. She is just an
energizer, she is always going to bring a lot of energy to our team, and I've
enjoyed playing with her for three years.  
  
Q. Alberta, you moved into the starting lineup for the postseason. Can you
talk about your role and how you're approaching that this time?  
ALBERTA AUGUSTE: I think my role is the same as when I'm coming off the bench,
bring the defensive intensity, contribute to the ball pressure and also on the
offensive end, getting offensive rebounds and driving into the paint.  
  
Q. Shannon, have you had a chance to look at the play of their guard, A'Quo,
No. 10? You guys have similar styles. She is very aggressive and spirited out
there. Have you had a chance to see any film on her?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I have not watched film with the team, but I have seen her
play, and she is very aggressive, quick, and their emotional leader. And she
definitely can step out and shoot the three-ball. It's going to be a great
game plan against them, and I just look forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for COACH SUMMIT?  
  
Q. Pat, Big 12 teams always do much better the second time around against
each other in conference play, because they've seen it and they know what to
expect with their defense. As you look at Texas A &M film, what is so special
about Vic Schaefer's defense? They do a good job of harassing people and
making them uncomfortable.   
COACH SUMMITT: It all starts with their defense, and they're high-energy
players, obviously athletic, they're committed to playing hard. They're
committed to supporting each other. To me, you know, they -- they just bring a
type of defense that makes a lot of teams uncomfortable, and obviously they
score off of their turnovers.  
They play a lot faster defensively than they do offensively. What happens is
their defensive pressure generates opportunities for them in the open court.  
You know, I think Franklin is obviously a key. Not only is she super quick,
but she's the player that I think just leads by example and what they want to
do. She's the one that makes them go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Gant? She sat out the whole second half last
night, but talk about her and the challenges she presents.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously she can post up, she's a catch-and-shoot player, she
can do a lot of things; she can bring the ball up. When you talk about
versatility, I think you're talking about a player -- there is more than one
dimension to her game. For that, obviously, just her ability to lead a team --
you know, you look at the board play, she contributes in a lot of different
ways.  
Some players you can count on to score, but are they going to do the other
aspects of the game, and obviously she's very, very committed. I think that
brings some stability to their team.  
  
Q. Pat, Candace suffered 12 fouls last night, which is among the high --
among the highs that she's had this year. Was that kind of a "hack-a-Shaq"
mentality, you think? And how has the opponent sort of defended her over the
past three years?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think last night Candace recognized that we were not
executing as well offensively, and I think the team recognized that. And when
I got so upset was when I just thought we were just jump-shooting the
basketball, and we were careless. We let our offense affect our defense. That
was the worst half of defense I've had to sit and watch in a long time. It was
ugly.  
Yet, at the same time, I thought the team recognized the fact that we were
struggling, and they got the ball inside to Candace. I say, we want "paint
points," whether you get there off the dribble or off of Candace getting
touches, but we've got to get paint points. And that allowed us to go in at
halftime not feeling like we had dug ourselves a deep hole.  
You know, we were supposed to trap ball screens, and I think it was 16 times
maybe that they set ball screens or maybe 13 times, but we just went over this
in our scouting report, because it was 13 possessions in the first half, that
we were supposed to trap, and we only trapped twice.  
That's a glaring lack of discipline to your system, and we pointed that out
because that can't happen against Texas A&M, no matter what our scheme is. If
we're hedging, if we run a Velcro, whatever our action is, we've got to be
very disciplined on the defensive end and not let our offense affect our
offense. Because this Texas A&M team is going to turn you over and get into
you, and we've got to be really efficient offensively and be mindful of taking
care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your experience, will it be a factor tomorrow?
You've been here so many times and Texas A &M is playing in their first Elite
8 game.   
COACH SUMMITT: I've never scored a basket in postseason. Gary Blair is a great
coach, I played against him in the league and now we're meeting in this
setting, but I do feel like we have a veteran team. I'll be disappointed if
our seniors are not on top of their game and the leadership is not in place. I
expect us to play a much better game, because I think we learned from our
first half last night.  
We're always learning, continuing to try and get better and be more efficient.
But I don't know that me being on the bench is going to make a difference at
all. I feel like sometimes I'm more of a cheerleader at this point. You want
them to feel good, you want to keep them focused, and that's my job.  
I can get their attention when I need to; it seems to happen at times that you
need to. But I told them today, I've got three great assistants, and we're
going to work hard and we're going to prepare them for this game, but
ultimately the players have to play the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I watched Duke and A &M play yesterday. It was interesting to me
because Duke came out with an enormous amount of pressure. They both, did but
Duke seemed to have more to me, and throughout the game A&M seemed to wear
them down. At the end they seemed to be completely fatigued. At this stage of
the game, how concerning is that for you and how do you balance that out?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think you -- there will be spurts, Lisa, that's part of
the game. That's what happens with the changes and who has the momentum. I
always believe the way to put the brakes on is with your defense and your
board play, to influence. Fatigue does not concern me with this team. I think
we're one of the most well-conditioned teams in the country. You look how many
minutes that a lot of our players play, and the one thing that I have learned
throughout my career is, you know, what you do in preparation now is -- we
won't spend much time in practice today doing anything other than walking
through.  
Between our Purdue game and coming here, we never went full court. Everything
was half-court, most everything was walk-through. We kept our offense sharp in
that regard. Same thing will happen here, because we will meet our legs
against Texas A&M, and I think last night was a good indication that we had
our legs. We were sharp in the second half, and typically we are a second half
team.  
  
Q. You mentioned Gary Blair. I wonder if you would comment on his unique
personality and any experiences you have had with him.  
COACH SUMMITT: Gary is always whining, they're not a very good team, not sure
how he got here! That's how he was in the conference, you know, he was always,
"I don't know about this team," but you know you can't believe a word he says
in that regard, because he knows he's got a great team, he really does. This
team is -- it's fun to watch just the energy level that they play with.  
And, you know, I have tremendous respect for Gary. I consider him a friend in
this profession, and you don't have a lot of 'em. So Gary certainly is someone
that I consider a friend. I miss him being in the conference because of all
the meetings that -- he was always one to speak up, and it took him quite a
while to get everything said, but that was okay.  
  
Q. Talk about Candace and the fact that she has so many, I guess, pressures
of being a face and name for this game right now, and yet when the clock is
running, she plays like those things don't even matter. Can you talk about the
balance she strikes that way?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first thing I want to say is Candace Parker is the best
player in the women's game, and there has been a lot of questions or
suggestions who is the best player. My comment on that is, the big question
should be who is the best player in the world? Is it Candace Parker or is it
Lauren Jackson?  
I don't think in the college game, if you watch Candace play and what she
brings, and to get to what she does bring, obviously she brings a game of
being able to post up, being able to score in transition by running the floor,
being able to score off the dribble. I think, you know, her skill set is so
strong, and how many 6-5 players have you seen ever in the women's game play
the way Candace Parker plays?  
She brought a whole different dimension and package. So what she does for us
is -- you know, it's so significant because I think she brings so much
attention that her teammates benefit from that, but she also is unselfish and
wants to be a great teammate, sometimes to a fault. Is there anything else in
that question you want to know?  
  
Q. Just how she balances the off court, questions, autographs, all of this,
being the face of the game right now?  
COACH SUMMITT: We try to protect our players, and certainly with Candace after
games, you know, she'll have an autograph night, as every player does at our
home contest, but aside from that, just trying to protect her. We have open
practices -- sometimes we may have 100 people come watch practice. After
practice, I just let 'em know that the players have class, so they're not
going to be able to sign.  
I've been really sensitive to the demands on Candace, and Shannon has been a
very popular player, Alexis is a popular player. So that's something we're
mindful of -- not being disrespectful to our fans. We love our fans. I think a
lot of times I try to step up and help out in that regard.  
  
Q. Notre Dame said yesterday that your transition is one of the things that
shut them down. How are you guys going to address that coming against an
aggressive A &M defense?   
COACH SUMMITT: I don't think we'll change what we do in our transition. I
think identifying the ball is a priority, always, for us. Doing what we can do
to slow the ball down -- it's slowing the ball down and always use the concept
of our team, it's all about what the ball can see in transition. If we do a
great job of matching up and not letting them see someone sprinting to the
paint, not allowing the long passes.  
It takes a the lot longer to dribble the ball the length of floor than it does
to pass it, so we have to be mindful of pressuring the basketball and
extending our defense and taking away long passes.  
  
Q. A lots been made of preparing for A &M's defense and trying to simulate
that in practice. I think Coach McCallie mentioned it was tough to simulate
that. Have you prepared for that style of defense this year, and how do you
intend to simulate it going into tomorrow?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we're a decent defensive team, and the one way we
prepared before we caught our plane to come here was with our practice guys,
just overplaying us. And as I said, we didn't go full court, just worked in
the half-court. I think our schedule has been such that we've gone against a
lot of athletic teams. Obviously playing LSU twice was good preparation
because they have size and they also get after you, not only in the half-court
game but the full court game.  
Looking at our schedule overall and the number of athletic teams we have faced
-- now, have we faced someone that is as relentless on defense as A&M?
Probably not.  
But, you know, I think that, again, there's similarities in the two teams.
Just taking care of the basketball is going to be very important for us.  
  
Q. Speaking of defense, I wonder if you would talk about the impact Alexis
has on your defense, the number of steals she had in the previous round game
and then a couple more last night?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Alexis, I think her game starts with defense, and just
her commitment to get in the passing lanes. She's great on the ball. She is
even more dangerous off the ball because she does have great awareness, great
anticipation, and she is a risk taker. I think she's constantly look and
she'll gamble, but for the most part, she's so heady in making those reads and
one of the best all-around guards I've coached at Tennessee.  
She obviously, you know, just gets out and gambles and gets after it and she's
passionate about defense. Last night she didn't shoot the ball well, of
course, she is wanting to settle for three-balls, and she needs to get paint
points, so she'll do that tomorrow. At the same time you look at her, I think
she had nine boards, she was all over the glass, so the thing about Alexis is
she's going to do the dirty work, and it's hard to get sometimes great
athletes, high-profile players that say, "Hey, Coach, let me guard the best
player," or "I'll get to the glass. I'll get to the boards!"  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. Your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, actually I thought we opened up the game and just missed
a lot of easy shots. I thought we let our offense affect our defense.  
I want to give a lot of credit to Notre Dame. I thought that they did a great
job, as they did in their first game that we played them, playing off the
dribble. I thought that was really part of our game that we were not as
committed to.  
We didn't force them into the weak end enough, and that may be my fault for
not making that a point of emphasis. But I thought at halftime we regrouped
and talked about what we had to do and came out and played much better on the
defensive end, also just changing up our defense and extending our full court
and our three-quarter court. I thought we managed to get them a little bit
later in the clock and managed to do a little bit better job with coverage
overall out of our match-up defense.  
I'm proud of our team overall. Notre Dame played us tough. They obviously --
from the time we played them before until now, they've improved tremendously,
and I was very impressed with what I saw and how tough they played us tonight.  
We're excited to move on and play in the regional finals. That's exactly where
you want to be because the ultimate goal is a Final Four and a National
Championship, but you can't do it unless you win that game. So that's going to
be a big test for us and obviously against a really tough opponent.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, this game kind of felt a little bit like the Oral Roberts game,
a little bit maybe of a slow start and then Coach kind of laid the law at the
half asking for the defense and intensity to pick up. Just wondering how you
felt about that, if that was kind of the case here?  
CANDACE PARKER: I felt like in the first half we were just -- like Coach said,
letting our offense affect our defense, and we had a slow start, and you can't
do that in postseason. I don't know what it is, but we need to fix it.  
We regrouped at halftime, and I guess that's why there's two halves in
basketball.  
  
Q. Shannon or Candace, either one, talking about that lull that you had in
the first half, I never saw anybody panic or even seem concerned like you felt
like eventually things were going to come around. Is that how you all felt
collectively out there, that this is just a lull and this is going to end
quickly, because it did pretty fast, midway through the first half.  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, this team is full of seniors, and we've been in the
same position that we've been in before. North Carolina we were down by 12
with eight minutes to go, so there's no panic. I mean, we just come together
and we figure out what's broken and we fix it.  
  
Q. Candace, you had a career high matching 34, plus 13 rebounds, four
blocks, three assists, three steals. Is this as good a game as you've
played?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, I think defensively I did have lapses, and Coach
reminded me of those lapses several times. I mean, honestly in postseason
you've got to come through. That's what great players do.  
  
Q. Candace, I saw Coach pull you over, kind of you were sitting there on the
bench by yourself at halftime. What did she say to you at that point about the
second half?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, she just told me that I need to come through on both
ends for my team and that I can't let my offense affect my defense and that I
need to own the paint and just control the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let our student athletes go back to the locker room.
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Would you mind talking about what Candace did? Actually she seemed
happiest sitting on the bench watching her teammates cut that eight-point lead
down to two when she was high-fiving and hip-bumping. She basically was your
whole offense in the first half. Is this as good a game as she's played given
the circumstances?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think this is certainly one of her better games in the
paint. Candace is obviously -- she's scored a lot in a lot of different
positions, but tonight I really wanted to see her get paint points. I did not
feel like she could be stopped unless say they wanted to double-team her.  
She did a great job of establishing position and finishing shots. She missed
some early, but the good thing is she didn't let that affect her.  
When we talked at halftime I thought Candace really took to heart the fact
that she could not let her offense affect her defense, and she has to have a
great presence for us on defense in order for us to survive and advance.  
I think she's the best that she's been defensively, but I think we put so much
responsibility on her shoulders offensively that somewhere she's trying to
catch a break. So I do understand it. But I just hope we get to the free-throw
line and she'll get some rest there.  
  
Q. You haven't talked about it yet, but what will you say to your team about
the disruptive type of defense you're getting ready to face in A & M?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think Texas A & M, they do a great job of turning it
over and they're just relentless on the defensive end. I think we'll have to
have a lot of composure. We definitely have to be aggressive and attack. I
haven't seen them in person, so I haven't really talked to my staff to know if
we're going to be able to go inside and establish our post game. That's always
a priority for us.  
But it's our type of schedule that's allowed us to go against a lot of great
teams. North Carolina is one of the best aggressive defensive teams, which we
faced obviously earlier in the year; LSU, it's not like we haven't seen a lot
of great defensive teams. But I think the fact that this A & M team, it looks
like to me they just get after it and they'll take chances, and we just have
to take care of the basketball so we can be efficient offensively.  
  
Q. Candace said great players have to do this in the postseason. Did you
sense that she felt she had to produce more because her teammates weren't
early on?  
COACH SUMMITT: I just think she knows what her role is on our team. She is our
best offensive player. She has the size, she has the skills, she has the
mindset to take over a game. You know, as a coach you don't always have that
on your basketball team, and when you do have it, you just hope that they have
Candace's mentality. She wants it. I mean, she's willing to step up and make
the plays for us, and she's obviously talented enough and has the size inside
to be able to make the type of plays that obviously you have to have at
certain moments.  
When we've gone on a long dry spell then we usually run something to Candace.  
Other players -- I was pleased with what Nicky Anosike did and just -- I
didn't have to tell her to shoot that high shot, and her guard play was not
great. And I think we need to get more out of Alexis Hornbuckle, but instead
of really settling for the three ball, she's got to play off the dribble.
That's when she's at her best.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the atmosphere tonight, over 10,000 attendance,
and the biggest of all the regional semifinals out there this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I do think it speaks volumes to this area and the fact that the
people in Oklahoma came out, obviously the Texas A & M fans, there were a lot
of Tennessee fans here. It's a type of environment that's good for the game.
Obviously for us it was exciting when we walked out and I saw the amount of
people that came to watch our game.  
I don't know who promoted that. I'm sure Gary Blair. I've been around him long
enough to know he can sell an Eskimo ice. He's quite an interesting guy.  
But the fact that they came is good, and I'm sure they had something to do
with it and Oklahoma fans just appreciating women's basketball and what the
Oklahoma team has meant to this area of the country. And when you have
basketball fans, I mean, it's really -- it's good to see that even though the
team that they're prepared to root for is not here, they're still supporting
women's basketball. That's something that's huge for our game because the men
have had that for years, and we're trying to establish that.  
  
Q. Going back to the confidence factor, you guys really seemed to have a lot
of that out there today, and I think it showed more when you weren't playing
well than when you were playing well. Can you just talk about that, the
seniors and the amount of confidence that you all are carrying right now?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we do have great senior leadership. We have
obviously a team that is very confident. But also they know when they're not
playing well, and our first time-out -- we talked about it, and as time went
on there was a greater sense of urgency, and at halftime I thought we really
managed to get some important information to them about what we have to do. I
don't think they went out there really focused -- with the type of defensive
intensity that they should have.  
I told them, maybe it's because the first time we played Notre Dame we
obviously played very, very well and we were up in that game in a big way
early. It's a different game. I told them postseason is entirely different,
and you have to be aware of that and you have to answer runs. We did a good
job of that in the first half but a lot better in the second half, and I give
the senior leadership a lot of credit for how we responded at halftime.  
  
End of FastScripts  
  
  
  
  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on tonight's game, Coach.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm disappointed for the seniors. They got us here. They
got us to the Sweet 16. I thought they had a tremendous effort all year, and
it's disappointing to end on a game like this. We played really well in the
first half. I thought we played well for a lot of the game.  
We had a couple stretches defensively, I think they hit a couple threes, we
missed some easy shots, a couple of lay-ups, and it went from close to ten. I
thought that was the difference. I thought Bobbitt's threes were really kind
of like daggers for us.  
Great career for Charel Allen. She did just a great job for four years. It's
been such a pleasure to coach her. I thought Becca Bruszewski had an
outstanding game, tied her career high. She'll be great for the future.  
Lindsay Schrader played well. I think we've got a lot of good players coming
back. I think we'll be back. I'm just disappointed for the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. This is for either of you guys. It seemed like on the offensive end it
seemed like things were going fairly slowly for a good portion of the game,
but when you guys were on defense they proved to be pretty powerful. What was
the main difference when you guys were on defense? What was so difficult to
stop for them?  
CHAREL ALLEN: Well, I mean, Candace was a big presence inside. She's so long
and athletic, we just gave up too many points to her. For the most part I felt
like we played well on defense. We had a couple mental lapses that we couldn't
fix.  
  
Q. Charel, could you talk about how you guys felt going into halftime, going
up ahead on Tennessee and where you felt coming into that second half?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We felt great. We felt we could play with them. We believed in
each other, we believed in ourselves, and we just fought to the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student athletes go. We'll take
questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the game Candace had tonight and to run into
that and trying to stop her?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought she played well. 11 for 18, she scored a lot
around the basket. I thought we were probably -- probably should have looked
at doubling her a little bit more, especially when she was dribbling. I
thought we could have trapped her a little bit more. She's a difficult match-
up for us. And I thought we did a little better in the zone than we did man-
to-man.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dynamic they had working with Candace down in the
low post? What problems did that present for you on defense?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, when we went to the 1-3-1, we could go to the high post
but then we need a smaller person in the back line. But I didn't think that
was as big a problem as Anosike at the high post making the jumpers. We were
giving them to her at the beginning of the game and she started hitting them,
and I thought, we're going to have to change defenses to be able to guard her
at the high post, so we went to the 1-3-1 for that.  
And Parker, she's going to score no matter what defense you're in when she's
on the block. She's a tough match-up inside with her size, and with Erica
getting into quick foul trouble, we really didn't have the size to combat her.  
  
Q. Despite the night that she was having, you guys obviously were ahead of
them for the most part. Did you have a different plan this time than last
time? Did you want to let her do her damage and prevent everybody else?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we were trying to guard the three-point line this time. We
didn't really think that she would get that many because we did want to guard
her inside. We did a really good job the first half guarding the three-point
line. I was really pleased with that. I think they were 1 for 5. That was the
key to our game was really getting out in the zone on the wings and I thought
we did that for the most part.  
Overall, considering the last game we had with them, we've come a long way
since January 5th. We definitely got a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go. Congratulations on a great
season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on this evening's game.  
COACH McCALLIE: I thought it was a well-fought game. I thought both teams
played hard. It was a very physical game. You know, our nemesis crept up
again, which has done so in the past when I look at the assist-to-turnover
ratio. We've been problematic in terms of where we need to get the ball at
times, as well.  
I thought we fought hard. I was proud of our team's effort. I thought that we
started to come back in the second half, but I thought there were some serious
losses of poise and composure at critical junctures, which you cannot afford
in this environment against a team like Texas A & M.  
I give a lot of credit to them. They had some players do some things that were
outstanding, in particular 51 scoring seven points in six minutes. That's not
something she normally does, but obviously she rose to the occasion there. And
I thought 24 really hurt us, a player who played above her averages and did a
nice job for them.  
I would have liked to see us play more from the inside out, the physical
nature of the game block to block. We did some nice things in rebounding,
seeing some of our guards like Abby rebound and Jasmine rebound, those were
things that we needed to occur, as well.  
But I think basically we had some free throw misses that would have been
helpful, but at the same time it was more a creation situation of assist-to-
turnovers, too many turnovers in a game like this against a very good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your thoughts. We'll take the student athlete
questions first.  
  
Q. Wanisha, how much in the first half was it their defense that caused the
turnovers, or was there something else at work there?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think a lot of our turnovers came from trying to make a tough
pass inside the lane or -- their defense was really good. They pressured the
ball, they pressured the lane, but a lot of it just came from us trying to
make the big play.  
  
Q. Abby, were you guys surprised or taken off guard by the pressure at the
beginning of the game?  
ABBY WANER: We expected pressure like that, I just don't think we handled it
well. Our coaches covered that in the scouting and we were prepared for that
kind of pressure, we just didn't handle it the way we should.  
  
Q. Abby, was it frustrating when the three-pointers just wouldn't go down
for you until the later stages when you were already behind by double
digits?  
ABBY WANER: You're never happy when your shot doesn't fall, so yeah, it gets
frustrating. I think Coach was right that we needed to go inside out more.
Yeah, it does get frustrating when they don't fall.  
  
Q. Abby and Wanisha, when your shots just weren't falling, was that
something to do with Texas A & M's defense or just one of those nights?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think a lot of my shots came from just rushing, not taking my
time going up. They weren't falling like I wanted them to.  
ABBY WANER: They're a good defensive team, so I'm not going to take credit
away from them, but I'm also not going to place blame on their defense for a
lot of the shots that I should normally hit.  
  
Q. For Wanisha, how would you characterize this team your senior year? What
were the high points of the season for you?  
WANISHA SMITH: One of the highlights talking in the locker room was just our
ability to fight through adversity. I think that was one of the biggest things
that brought us together, and unfortunately this loss, it doesn't characterize
our season, how we've become a team and bonded with each other, my teammates
and coaches, also. Hopefully next year they'll pull together and have more
success.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to the locker room. We'll
take Coach McCallie's questions.  
  
Q. Joanne, was there something going on with their defense, or why do you
think there was not a whole lot of offense going on in the perimeter or the
mid-range jumpers? It seemed like everything was going through the paint
early.  
COACH McCALLIE: Yeah, I think early on I thought we did -- to be down four
with the turnovers that we had was very outstanding.  
The second half I think we got away from what we had been doing, which was to
get the ball inside out. We had to work a little bit harder tonight to get the
ball inside out because they were fronting on the low block, and when they do
that you can't enter directly from the lane, you have to enter from the top
and you have to create ball screen situations. We needed a little bit more
patience overall in handling that pressure.  
We give credit to Texas A & M. They had a great year and they did a great job
with their defensive pressure. At the same time this was a lesson, freshman
point guard versus senior point guard, five seniors versus one senior.
Sometimes there's experience out there, but there's a lot of things. It's not
a simple answer.  
But shooting 66 percent from the line at this level, that's not going to help
you as much. The turnovers, those are the team points you give up, and that's
huge. That's a 20-point turnaround if you look at the fact that we had 19
turnovers number of turnovers. We had eight more turnovers than they did in
the game. That's an enormous turnaround in offensive possibilities. So it's a
combination of all those things. It's not only one thing.  
'Te showed that she was ready to play. 'Te had a strong game and she did some
really nice things. We just have to continue to show patience in getting the
ball inside and then attacking, and it just -- it's an easy thing to talk
about. It's a lot harder to do when there's a lot of pressure out there.  
  
Q. Everybody would love to win a national championship and there are about
300 teams to didn't get to this point. Is Sweet 16 a pretty fair assessment of
where your team is at this point?  
COACH McCALLIE: It's hard to say on this night, but I really believe in our
team's ability to beat any team, I really do. I'm very proud of this team.
They've worked very hard. For a first-year situation, I don't know how many
first-year situations have gone to the Sweet 16. I'd have to look that up.  
But I will say that -- I can't really agree with you totally because I really
believe that we could beat these teams, A & M or Notre Dame or Tennessee or
whomever. We did not pull it all together tonight, that's true, but I have a
great belief in this team. It leaves you very sad, it also leaves you very
motivated for the lessons we can take from this experience.  
  
Q. Danielle Gant goes out at halftime and doesn't play again. They almost
seemed to draw on that really. And then talk about Franklin. She almost goes
against what you think she should do, going to the corner. Talk about her,
too.  
COACH McCALLIE: Well, she's a senior point guard who's started practically
every game, I think, at Texas A & M. She plays with a great deal of
confidence. She plays low to the ground. We're a guard short of having the
ability to handle somebody like her, as small as she is. She's very effective,
she's very mature on the floor. She plays 35 minutes. When you see her assist-
to-turnover ratio -- we had Wanisha with 42, but that's all we had there.  
I think we're a growing team; that's a seasoned team. We are a growing team
trying to win championships. First year, coaches, changes, one senior, all
those things. That's a fifth-year team, and I think you saw some fifth-year
experience on the floor, and it would be very unfair to talk about that
because I've been a fifth-year before, too, and a fifth-year is a lot better
than a first-year in terms of philosophy and trying to be all together.  
Getting back to your question, she's outstanding and makes the most of her
size. She's very creative and she's smart, and she plays an excellent game.  
  
Q. Back to free throws, typically when you guys are able to limit your
opponent's chances and take 30 yourself, you guys have success. At one point
in the second half you guys were 5 of 12 from the line. What did you attribute
those struggles to?  
COACH McCALLIE: As a coach you can't really attribute. We've had great games
and not-so-good games. You know your team is getting to the line 30 times, but
at that point there's nothing you can be concerned about, you just have to
coach in the moment and worry about what the whole team concept is. We have to
become a better shooting team just generally speaking in the off-season.
Again, there are tremendous lessons here for us.  
  
Q. Chante Black this season kind of proved she's a big-time player. How
confident are you knowing she's going to be back next year? And also Wanisha
Smith, what are you going to miss about her?  
COACH McCALLIE: Chante, she's had an incredible year. She's worked very, very
hard. She's been an incredible leader for us. She's demanded the ball, she's
made big plays, and without question she's a tremendous player. It's very
exciting to think of her as a senior with more strength and more timing and
all the things that she had to do with this year coming back from not playing
the year prior. The sky is the limit for 'Te. She's one of our better shooters
on the team, period.  
To go to Wanisha, we're going to miss an awful lot from Wanisha. She's the
energizer. Wanisha is the kid who's played hard and aggressive and demanding
intensity. She just is such a tough competitor, can pull off the balance and
do different things. You never replace people, and we won't replace Wanisha.
You sort of evolve as a new team. Every year is new, without question.  
I'm excited for Wanisha. I want her to have an opportunity to play
professionally if that's what she wants to do, and I think it is, and I think
she's somebody who can really continue to grow her game.  
  
Q. Are you surprised they didn't seem to miss Gant any more than they did in
the second half?  
COACH McCALLIE: You know, that can really trigger a team. I mean, she's a
great player, and I see that people were triggered. People played great.
There's a lot of balance on the team. I'm not surprised at all. When a
teammate goes down, usually -- it's one of these things. In the short-term
it's beneficial. In the long-term if she would be out it's not beneficial. But
in the moment I've found that players rally. She did pretty well before she
was out anyway. She still played a great game, and the other girls really
stepped it up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, and congratulations on a great season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, would you make some opening comments about tonight's
game, and congratulations.  
COACH BLAIR: I just got a bunch of warriors out there, a bunch of warriors.
You know, isn't it nice to be able to compliment the team that you play in
because those kids are all such all-Americans and AAU and all-conference
performers, but you want to compliment Duke for everything that they do.
Chante Black is a load. We had as much trouble with her as we did with
Courtney Parrish. But then we tightened it up in the second half and when we
went to a zone a little bit in the first half.  
But our program has dealt with Texas kids first. We might not be the national
power to be able to recruit nationally like Duke or Stanford or some of those
other teams right now. But we're built with kids right here that were good,
solid players, but I am so happy for my staff because the best thing we do in
coaching is we develop players. When you develop players, it's such a
satisfaction for the coaching staff and these players here to see how far
they've come.  
The defensive effort was outstanding. We got in a little bit of foul trouble
with Micheaux and we were able to play Reado and Buchanan and then we had to
go small when Buchanan got in foul trouble we were 5'11" and below but we held
on because we had a lot of good transition baskets.  
Gant was playing out of sight like she always does. At halftime she came out
and she felt dizzy on the bench. Radar, our trainer, came up and said, Coach,
I think you need to hold her out for a minute. And then I said, Radar, if
she's dizzy, I'm sick (laughter).  
But she had to come out of the ballgame. Mo came in and made a couple of great
baskets early because they had started taking control to start the second
half, but all of a sudden Radar came back. He said, we have to put a second IV
in. I said, all right, Radar, hurry. He came back in about five, six more
minutes. He said, we'll have to put a third IV in. I was about to fire my
trainer then. Finally he came back and said we're going to have to put a
fourth IV in, and I don't think you're going to have her.  
By then this little band right here did one heck of a job. I got on Reado at
halftime there. I can get on her more than any other kid on this team because
she's a Houston kid that can handle anything that I can give her or her mama
can give her, right, Reado? And she had zero points and zero rebounds at half,
and came out there and gave me the game of a lifetime for her at 5'11",
handling her business.  
I'm so happy for her and I'm so happy for these two guards here, my little
general and my scorer right there. They're excellent ball players.  
I'll open it for questions.  
  
Q. How much did -- I think it was a mid-range jumper and the two back-to-
back lay-ups, how much did your confidence go in and get you rolling?  
PATRICE READO: My confidence went way up, but it was my teammates who
contributed the ball. They set up the shots for me and gave me two easy
buckets to give me the confidence to have a decent game.  
  
Q. Takia, it seemed like Duke was kind of knocked back a little bit at the
beginning with y'all's pressure. Did you sense that? What were y'all able to
do with them early?  
TAKIA STARKS: I really just wanted to get after them early and put as much
pressure on them as we could. We started off with our defense and we pressed
them. We felt we had the momentum, and for a second the game was going back
and forth, score for score. But we basically just took control, we stepped up
and got stops on defense and scored on offense.  
  
Q. A'Qua, an advantage you think playing here in Oklahoma City? Did you
notice more of your fans here? Just talk about that.  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: Yes, sir. When we came out of the huddle -- when we came
out for warm-ups, he turned to the crowd once we came out. He said, we want to
thank the Oklahoma people that were behind us and our fans that came from
College Station to be with us and support us.  
TAKIA STARKS: Like A'Qua said, the fans supported us, they travelled with us.
Earlier this year it was hard to get any fans to travel with us, but we were
just amazed at how many showed today. We thank the state of Oklahoma and the
big 12 for supporting us, also.  
PATRICE READO: Same thing they just said.  
  
Q. For A'Qua, can you talk about what's going through your mind, just talk
about the second half when Danielle had such a big half and she doesn't come
out. Just talk about what's going through your mind at that point.  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: When Danielle came out she came over to the bench and he
said, I don't think that she can go right now. I wanted to fire myself
(laughter). She did a great job of stepping up, coming in. I think she buckled
down the court and scored a driving lay-up. She stepped up really big for us
in the second half, and Patrice stepped up hitting a couple of jump shots. We
just did a great job of scoring without Danielle.  
  
Q. Takia, Coach made a point of saying you're all Texas kids, you're playing
against these kids with these big national reputations. Do you sort of have a
chip on your shoulder a little bit that we couldn't get in with those big
names and big reps, but we can play with them, too?  
TAKIA STARKS: I think it's a chip on their shoulders for having big names and
being all-Americans. Us, we come out and play how we play our game. It's not
really pressure on us. There's a lot of doubters out there because we don't
have big names, but we're right here proving it right now.  
  
Q. A'Qua, can you talk about their full-court press the whole game? Why in
the first half did you want to get the ball inbounds and let the trap come as
opposed to just blowing right by them like a bit more the second half without
letting them get set up?  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: The first half -- I think the first shots I didn't
expect them to come up as quick, and it was hard for me to see being smaller
-- it was hard for me to see Morenike on the other side. So once we adjusted
to it before the trap got to me I got the ball out of my hands and made the
pass. In the second half we tried to get the ball in quicker. We were running
different press attacks to apply pressure.  
  
Q. Patrice, can you talk about the spark A'Qua provides when you see her
knocking down three-pointers and coming down, taking charge as her shoe falls
off?  
PATRICE READO: A'Qua is the leader of the team so we know once A'Qua was ready
to play she can come out on offense and we can go back on defense and we can
get the momentum. She's the scorer on the team.  
  
Q. Patrice, Takia was leading in rebounds by eight at half. You were leading
everything else. Coach talked to you about the rebounds. What was the
difference for this team rebounding in the second half?  
PATRICE READO: I just think we just went ahead and tried to take control of
the rebounding. At halftime Coach Blair kind of chewed me out because I had no
rebounds, so I felt like I had to come out and help my team because Danielle
Gant wasn't in the second half and she's usually the one in there getting the
rebounds. I just tried to take control and Micheaux got me in and got some
rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to dismiss our student athletes, and we'll ask
Coach Blair to take his questions.  
COACH BLAIR: On your stat sheet here they made a mistake. The ghost of
Danielle Gant did not play in the second half. They've got her for 25 minutes,
so if you will get that changed on the final book.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to think about this right now because y'all are still
going, but this tonight will go down as the biggest win in A & M women's
basketball history as of today. There could be another one two days from now,
but do you think about that? Are you too much in the moment to think about
what this team is doing right now?  
COACH BLAIR: My biggest win at Arkansas was against Duke in '98 to go to the
Final Four, and this has been our biggest win right now. But we didn't come
here to just win one ballgame. We came here because we've earned the right,
and I think our style of defense -- everybody plays good defense, but our
style bothers a lot of teams because it's hard to prepare for us because a lot
of times they cannot simulate it during practice. You think you can, but give
Coach Schaefer a lot of credit because he is passionate about that defense and
the different ways we disguise it a lot of times.  
But we're generally going to stop a team from shooting threes on us or at
least contested, and I think they started shooting threes a little bit too
quick for them because they were beating us in the first half by going inside
or dribble penetration, which they were doing a great job. We wanted them to
shoot threes because we just felt like they had been shooting 27 percent but
then Waner got hot and hit a couple of them. She's a great player, plays with
so much passion.  
  
Q. We know your seniors are a great group, but when you look at the stats,
three in double figures and a lot of rebounds. Do you recall a better group
performance that you've seen from them?  
COACH BLAIR: No, and I cannot remember a post player since I've been at A & M
that gave me 17 points and eight rebounds and a couple of steals like Reado
did.  
That's pressure because nobody has ever heard of Patrice Reado except the
people in Houston, and look what she did. She's the most unheralded out of my
five starters, but she took up for Danielle Gant and gave us that extra
scorer.  
But I'm so happy for those seniors who believed in me first to say I want to
come to Texas A & M, and this was after a lot of losing seasons in a row. It
was Reado, Purdue and us, and then Takia it was Auburn and us, and A'Qua it
was us and nobody. Nobody wanted A'Qua, and she just decided to come with us.  
  
Q. I'll ask you what I asked your players. Before you got started you said
we hope we can borrow some of those Oklahoma fans. Did you notice any
advantage with the fans here in this game?  
COACH BLAIR: I noticed there was a lot of crimson. A lot of them came over to
our pep rally over there at Sheraton. I invite them back on Tuesday night
because the pep rally will even be larger, and then we're going to import some
more Aggies in. They're not all going to come from Texas but we've got Aggies
all over that Big 12.  
That means so much, but this is Big 12 area because we were an Aggie and
Oklahoma was playing Oklahoma State, we would be here for our Big 12 team, and
it's very special. I think Kansas on the men's side and us on the women's side
and Colorado in the WNIT, I'm proud of all three of us, and we're going to
represent our conference very well.  
  
Q. After the first half ended, it was a pretty tight game and you really
couldn't tell which way it was going to go. What did you think were the main
differences for your team the second half that you were able to pull away and
win pretty big?  
COACH BLAIR: I think one thing, we were not ready to start the second half. I
was looking over there feeling sorry for myself because of Gant. Next they ran
an inbounds play and we were standing around and they scored over Gant real
quick and then you come away on a breakaway and miss the lay-up. That was
huge. That would have tied the ballgame, I believe, and then we got our second
wind, A'Qua started finding the right people, Morenike, we did a better job on
the boards, and A'Qua's three threes in the second half was huge, particularly
the one that went down on the shot clock.  
A lot of kids don't want that shot because their statistics go down when
they're taking that last-second shot, but she wants it, and that's what makes
her so special, all 5'3" of her.  
  
Q. Speaking of Danielle, do you have any kind of update on her? Is she going
to be available for Tuesday?  
COACH BLAIR: She'd better be available or I'm not going to be available
(laughter).  
She'll be fine. She's over there smiling and encouraging her teammates.
They're probably going to have to take her to the hospital now, and the same
thing, A'Qua, we're probably going to have to get an IV in her. She was
cramping during the ballgame. It was so hot in there. That second half lasted
forever, particularly the last eight minutes. For precautionary we'll get
A'Qua and DG a bag, but they'll be there Tuesday.  
  
Q. Just about your defense, it seemed like your girls were -- maybe they're
always that relentless, but it seemed like maybe they had a little extra fire
tonight, and why was it so effective?  
COACH BLAIR: Because of the respect we have for Duke. They are the best team
we play that put the ball on the floor, and you saw that in the first half.
They put the ball on the floor and they were going to the hole on us because
we were taking the three away. Black got four fouls real quick on both of my
five players, and I think that was the difference. But we had to hit the
transition in the first half to be able to separate ourselves.  
Then the second half I ran everything I had when they ran man, and almost
every set we kept executing and executing and executing. But Duke was also
playing very good defense, particularly I thought their man was a little bit
more effective than their zone. But then we made plays, and our defense is
just pretty special, but it's carried us all year, so that's nothing new for
us.  
  
Q. I almost hate to ask you this in the middle of a celebration, but your
thoughts on Tennessee for Tuesday night?  
COACH BLAIR: You want all of Notre Dame? Is that what you said? The luck of
the Irish are staying at our hotel and we've become good friends. I had
breakfast with Muffet over there. She was at the table next to me.  
We're just pulling for a good basketball game out there, one that will go into
five overtimes and wear somebody down.  
I can't give a lot of thoughts right now because we haven't watched one film
on -- maybe my assistant coaches have but I haven't, on either team. And we'll
get back to the drawing board tonight and we'll pull an all-nighter and we'll
break down a lot of film, but then film doesn't break down effort.  
Our game is all about effort. Effort, effort, effort. And when we can play
with that type of effort, it doesn't matter if it's Candace Parker or Charel
Allen or whoever we're trying to stop.  
You've got to play that effort and you've got to have trust in your teammates
because it's not one-on-one ball, it is a team coming over to help because if
you're 5'11" and you're fronting the post, you realize right quick you're
fixing your butt to get in there and there's somebody on that other side there
to help you, and we do a very good job of that.  
When you don't have tremendous egos it's easier to play team defense. That's
what we try to do.  
Before I leave here, I told my wife, her birthday is Tuesday. She's got to go
back and teach over there at Arkansas. We're doing a commuter marriage. So she
gets to be back here for her birthday on Tuesday and I'll get a chance to give
her a present on Tuesday.  
I have a whole lot of pressure on me because she said, hey, if you're good
enough, you'll be there on your birthday. So honey, I guess I'm good enough,
and we'll see you on Tuesday, and we're going to teach those Arkansas kids
over there a thing about nursing, all right? I'll see you on Tuesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, we appreciate that.

### [Charel Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18454)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on tonight's game, Coach.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm disappointed for the seniors. They got us here. They
got us to the Sweet 16. I thought they had a tremendous effort all year, and
it's disappointing to end on a game like this. We played really well in the
first half. I thought we played well for a lot of the game.  
We had a couple stretches defensively, I think they hit a couple threes, we
missed some easy shots, a couple of lay-ups, and it went from close to ten. I
thought that was the difference. I thought Bobbitt's threes were really kind
of like daggers for us.  
Great career for Charel Allen. She did just a great job for four years. It's
been such a pleasure to coach her. I thought Becca Bruszewski had an
outstanding game, tied her career high. She'll be great for the future.  
Lindsay Schrader played well. I think we've got a lot of good players coming
back. I think we'll be back. I'm just disappointed for the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. This is for either of you guys. It seemed like on the offensive end it
seemed like things were going fairly slowly for a good portion of the game,
but when you guys were on defense they proved to be pretty powerful. What was
the main difference when you guys were on defense? What was so difficult to
stop for them?  
CHAREL ALLEN: Well, I mean, Candace was a big presence inside. She's so long
and athletic, we just gave up too many points to her. For the most part I felt
like we played well on defense. We had a couple mental lapses that we couldn't
fix.  
  
Q. Charel, could you talk about how you guys felt going into halftime, going
up ahead on Tennessee and where you felt coming into that second half?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We felt great. We felt we could play with them. We believed in
each other, we believed in ourselves, and we just fought to the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student athletes go. We'll take
questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the game Candace had tonight and to run into
that and trying to stop her?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought she played well. 11 for 18, she scored a lot
around the basket. I thought we were probably -- probably should have looked
at doubling her a little bit more, especially when she was dribbling. I
thought we could have trapped her a little bit more. She's a difficult match-
up for us. And I thought we did a little better in the zone than we did man-
to-man.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dynamic they had working with Candace down in the
low post? What problems did that present for you on defense?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, when we went to the 1-3-1, we could go to the high post
but then we need a smaller person in the back line. But I didn't think that
was as big a problem as Anosike at the high post making the jumpers. We were
giving them to her at the beginning of the game and she started hitting them,
and I thought, we're going to have to change defenses to be able to guard her
at the high post, so we went to the 1-3-1 for that.  
And Parker, she's going to score no matter what defense you're in when she's
on the block. She's a tough match-up inside with her size, and with Erica
getting into quick foul trouble, we really didn't have the size to combat her.  
  
Q. Despite the night that she was having, you guys obviously were ahead of
them for the most part. Did you have a different plan this time than last
time? Did you want to let her do her damage and prevent everybody else?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we were trying to guard the three-point line this time. We
didn't really think that she would get that many because we did want to guard
her inside. We did a really good job the first half guarding the three-point
line. I was really pleased with that. I think they were 1 for 5. That was the
key to our game was really getting out in the zone on the wings and I thought
we did that for the most part.  
Overall, considering the last game we had with them, we've come a long way
since January 5th. We definitely got a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go. Congratulations on a great
season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. Your thoughts?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: We're still dancing. Good to be here. Good to see all the
media here and we just appreciate the coverage we've been getting. If your per
diem is good enough, go to Mickey Mantle's to eat. It was very good last
night.  
I had no idea, we couldn't figure who was playing minor league baseball, my
Rangers was playing there last night and it was a little too cold for me to
get over there to see 'em and Chicago beat 'em. That's not good.  
We're happy to be here. You look at the history of women's basketball and
that's Tennessee, that's Duke, and that's Notre Dame. And we're trying to
become part of history. We're not a Cinderella team. We're a good basketball
team that earned our No. 2 seed, but we have a lot of respect for the teams
that are here. I know 'em all, I've played 'em all in past years and they're
very well coached. I think you have one of the most balanced regions right
here. If you look by RPIs, I think the four of us RPI-wise is the highest of
the four regions.  
Back in 1998, as some of you know, we had to beat Kansas at San Jose and then
played Duke to get to the Final Four and then play Tennessee. And that was a
special time for us, and all of the sudden you look up, here is Duke again.
And all of the sudden you know who is waiting in the wings, either Notre Dame
or Tennessee. And we're just ready to play basketball. I'll open it up for
questions right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were here last year, for the Big 12 tournament and you
got to know the territory a little bit. Is that an advantage to you at all?
And Danielle is coming home this week and what kind of crowd support do you
think she's going to have?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think she's going to have tremendous crowd support because
she's an Oklahoma kid, there was a great story in The Oklahoman today and in
the Dallas Morning News today about Danielle Gant. Two very well written
stories.  
This is a kid, it's just a feel-good story. She was a great player in high
school, but look at the obstacles that she's overcome to get to where she is
today. I don't believe in all my years I've ever coached a kid that plays as
hard as her every possession, every time down the court. I could go back to
Arkansas and say Christy Smith, my point guard was similar to that, but this
is a kid that makes all of us push ourselves just a little bit harder, as
coaches and as players. And if somebody it is trying to guard her, if you're
guarding Danielle Gant you're going to get embarrassed in a heartbeat if you
don't go hard in practice.  
Is it an advantage being the only Big 12 school? Sure, I'd love to Sherri
Coale here, too, and we had have 12,000 fans here, but at the same time Texas
A&M is representing the Big 12. The Big 12 is putting on this regional. We
want to be able to put our best foot forward and show you everything about the
Big 12. We are disappointed that there are only two teams left out of the
eight, but I think we've had a very good year and we shouldn't be ashamed
about the six schools that did lose because all of 'em won over 20 games this
year. We're just ready to play ball and we hope to recruit the Oklahoma and
Oklahoma State fans that didn't go to New Orleans. And I think that's what
you're supposed to do is you cheer for your conference.  
  
Q. Coach, your initial thoughts on Duke, your opponent tomorrow.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: First, when you look at the ACC, it is the most high-octane,
offensive conference in the country, because of the style of ball they play.
When you look at North Carolina, Maryland and Duke and Virginia and Florida
State, go all the way down the line, it's the most offensive conference in the
country. You have teams loaded with All-Americans. You have kids who handle
the ball well, 4 and 5 players handle the ball as well on Duke as well as 2 or
3 players on other teams. They all are coming from McDonald's All-American
games. They've been everywhere. They're high-profile kids. What I like about
Duke is all of 'em can put the ball on the floor and score. They change up
their defenses, they're not afraid of turnovers, because they want you to play
their style of ball, a fast style. And they realize they're going to turn the
ball over as well as you're going to turn the ball over. They just believe
they have more offensive fire power than whoever they're playing.  
I think I heard once that North Carolina was trying to get 110 possessions a
ballgame. That's mind boggling to me. We like to take a team deep into the
shot clock if we're playing on the defensive end and that's going to be a
little bit different, because in the ACC I don't believe they need a shot
clock because that sucker is going up pretty quick.  
I like Chante Black. If she plays as well against us as she played against
Arizona State, we're going to have a long night. We've got to keep her away
from the offensive boards, keep her away from the free-throw lines. Waner,
I've been recruiting and watching for seems like eight years. She's always
been that great of a player, all the way when she was a seventh, and eighth-
grader. You knew about the Waners coming up.  
The point guard reminds me of Danielle Robinson. She is that quick and that's
just like Robinson for Oklahoma is what Thomas is doing for them. What we've
got to do is take her layups away because she can get by you so quick.  
Now, the Gay kid coming off the bench, she is an offensive firepower kid, she
comes up puts the ball in the hole, sort of like what we have with Morenike
coming off to give us instant offense. Very, very good offensive player.  
They came through a tremendous conference. When you have to play North
Carolina twice, and Maryland twice and the other teams up in their little pod
that they have to play twice, it's similar to us playing Baylor, Texas and
Oklahoma twice. I think our league is just as good, top to bottom. Theirs
might be a little stronger at the very, very top. I think ours 1 through 12 is
as good or better than anybody in the country right now.  
  
Q. You've spoken fondly of Oklahoma and the players. What is it that lures
you to this place and how important have their players been in your rebuilding
process and where you are right now?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: What lures me to Oklahoma is a name you haven't heard,
Hattie Colbert who played for me in high school at South Oak Cliff. Played I
believe for Wayne Merriman. Michelle Packer and Stephanie Bloomer, who I
inherited at Arkansas, two very good players who played six-on-six ball, that
developed into solid players. And then Wendi Willits and Kamara Stancle, who
took me to the Final Four. And Stancle from Muskogee, went to Connors and
here. And then you come back and throw in a Danielle Gant. And I'm missing
somebody, and I'll be hung if I forget her name. But I think I'm 7 for 7. How
about Tasha Brown at Louisiana Tech, first six-on-six player.  
This is one of the most underrated coaching states in the country. Whether it
was six or four-on-four or five-on-five, they know how to teach the game here.
That's why you saw Connecticut come down here and get Hansmeyer and Sauer.
Earnesia Williams goes to Texas. Liz Lay fixing to go out to Washington. It's
a very good state for basketball. And I will always recruit this state.  
  
Q. Do you see any difference in this team than in the way Gail's teams
played?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Yes. I think the personnel is the same, because most of the
personnel was recruited by Gail. Sometimes it's very hard, like we're going
through this with our men's team at A&M right now, going from the Gillespie
style to the Turgeon style, and both teams are already at the top. Usually
when a coach comes in, the team is at the bottom. Rarely does that happen that
Gillespie and Turgeon coming in and then the coaches coming in, you're never
in a win-win situation, it's somebody else's kids or this style or they were
recruited to play a different style.  
But one thing she has added is the match-up zone. The match-up zone is what
she was known for at Michigan State. The other thing is Al Brown. I've known
him since the Tennessee days when he was with Pat for so long. Great tactician
of the game and he's like having a Tex Winter on your bench to help you out as
the head coach. The personnel is very much Gail driven because she recruited
it. Now it's up to Joanne to blend her system in. You can win with a lot of
different systems. And she's doing very well with her system right there.  
  
Q. Gary, do you have any concern or fear that your team will think, you
know, oh my God, Duke, Tennessee, Notre Dame and wilt because they've never
been on this stage before? Or do you like that, that you are the underdog, out
of these four.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I can promise you one thing, they're not going to wilt,
okay? We're going to give it everything we have. We've been playing and
practicing so hard, and the kids just have so much confidence in themselves
right now, and maybe our kids haven't been on the grand stage before but this
isn't my first rodeo. And coach Schaefer, we've been there. So has Coach Bond.
The thing is I've got a basketball team, until it's proven different, is as
good as the team I took to the Final Four in '98. It is every bit as good
defensively and the only way you can prove that is to win, okay? If not,
you're yesterday's heroes or something like that, it doesn't work. We're going
to go out there and we're going to change out -- not change our, we're going
to be in a zone, we're going to man to man. We're going to pressure. We'll mix
in our full-court press with our half-court defense. And Joanne is not going
to change anything for me, either.  
You don't change at this stage, you have confidence and as a head coach you
have to wear that confidence into the locker room. You've got to get your kids
to believe that. Hey, we're not up here for the tee shirts that we're going to
get as we go, we're going to have to pay $25 for 'em, but (Chuckles.) Hey,
somebody's making money! What about tee shirts for our teams? We want to buy
the tee shirts in Tampa, okay?  
But this region is going to be very, very good because of how teams attack.
There's no slow-down team here at all. I mean, we're all going to get after
it. Duke is one of the highest-scoring teams in the country, and we're just
going to have to be ready for it. We need to keep the score in the 50s and us
in the 60s, and they probably want the score in the 80s and us in the 70s. If
that happens, that's to their advantage, if it stays in the 50s, 60s, it's to
our advantage.  
  
Q. Gary, obviously the other teams here all have great names, great
traditions, but in the Big 12 it's not like you guys go up against a bunch of
puds; you're playing Texas, Baylor, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. How well does
that prepare you in your regular season to get into something like that?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: You know, I was doing blogs, I'm just like everybody else I
try to write like you guys and do a column. I hadn't written one since the
middle of December when a good friend of mine in the media passed away, Joe
Smith. I wrote one on him, but my next one was going to be 60 long days and 60
short nights. That's what you go through in January and February. Now you add
30 more days to that in March. You try like this to get to April. And to keep
playing, and the Big 12 gets you ready for everything because of the different
styles of ball that you see. You can go play a Bill Fennelly in a match-up
zone, a Mulkey in-your-face defensive style like us, or you play Kansas State
where they're going to hold the ball to the last 5 seconds and see if you're
going to make a mistake, or then you've got to play Sherri Coale with the
twins inside and great personnel. It gets you ready.  
I think we have more different styles than the Big 12. Most of styles I've
seen in the ACC are very similar, because of their skill players. They have
some very, very well skilled players that can put the ball on the floor. I'm
trying two get to Tuesday. Why? Because it's my wife's birthday. April the
first. And she said she would like to see me on my birthday. And I'm doing a
commuter marriage and it's hard to get to Fayetteville and back, so that's
what I'm trying to do is be able to give a birthday present to her in person
instead of having to mail it. To do that, we need to be playing somehow, some
way, and you're at the point now, whatever it takes.  
I will have a talk with my players and make them realize that if there is
somebody that's hot and it's not Starks or Gant, we will go with that person
and everybody better be on the same page. If I've got a kid that's going to
come off the bench that might be better at guarding Chante Black, whatever it
takes at this stage, put your egos aside and put the team first. Put the team
first in whatever it is going to take, because they're doing the same thing
with us.  
Always, always give respect to your opponent. And Duke is a very good
basketball team. And the Black kid, we haven't faced anybody of that magnitude
at the post position since Courtney Paris and they're complete opposites. It's
like someone guarding Shaq and then guarding Tim Duncan; two different
preparations that you've got to do.  
So we're going to have a good time and, remember, if you've got per diem get
to Mickey Mantle's.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, you're back home, is that a distraction or is that a positive
thing this week?  
DANIELLE GANT: No, it's not a distraction at all. I think I play well in front
of my family and friends, so just coming back home and being able to play in
front of them is just a great feeling.  
  
Q. A'Quo and Takia, can you talk about the fact that y'all are here for the
first time, while these other programs are used to this. Do you like that
role, no one knows much about A &M, doesn't know what to expect?   
TAKIA STARKS: Yes, we like it. Being a freshman and become at the bottom of
the Big 12, we were out to get people and now in the Big 12 we were kinda like
the target. So now the target is off our back and we're out to get other
people, even though that Duke has the name and Texas A&M don't. But we're
going to try and go out and make a name for ourselves.  
DANIELLE GANT: Just to elaborate on what A'Quo said, personally I think we
play better when we're the go-getters and we're the underdog. That's a role we
play very well, but I promise you this year it hasn't been our role but we
expect great things in this next game.  
  
Q. Danielle, Coach Blair came up here and said until this team loses, this
team is every bit as good as the Final Four team he had before. That speaks
great to your tenacity out front. Just your thoughts that you may be the
hunter yet you have no loss of confidence against the big programs in women's
basketball.  
DANIELLE GANT: Our confidence, since we've been on this winning streak, our
confidence has been extremely well. We're not going to be, you know, just
because we're Texas A&M we're not going to go out and play -- because they
have Duke on their shirt doesn't mean we're not going to play our game. We're
going to play good defense.  
  
Q. A'Quo, can you talk about you mentioned your freshman year and where this
program has come and now to be on this stage, you know, with some of the elite
names in women's college basketball and what this experience is like for you
guys this week?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: It's been a great experience. One of the reasons why most
of the senior class now came to Texas is because it was a program that was on
the rise. So this is what eventually why people are going to be coming to
Texas A&M, and we're just really happy to be in the position that we are in.  
  
Q. A'Quo, can you talk about the match-ups tomorrow, what can we expect to
see?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: The match-ups we're going to have Takia Starks on Waner,
trying to pressure her, not let her get off great shots. We know she can shoot
from deep. Gant will probably be on Smith, she is an athletic kid and she can
stretch the defense. And basically we'll all match up with the same positions,
and just try to keep 'em in front and try to limit the touches.  
  
Q. A'Quo, do you guys watch much ACC ball during the regular season or are
you strictly focused on taking care of the next Big 12 opponent?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: We love basketball. We watch basketball no matter who it
is, guys, girls. So, yeah, we are aware of ACC-style basketball. We're just
going to treat it just like it's another game, and go out and play and try to
do what we do in the Big 12 basically and play pressure defense. We're not
going to change anything just because they're ACC.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on your season, best of luck.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONALS SEMIFINALS & FINALS: OKLAHOMA

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Joanne McCallie. Coach, thoughts about
the tournament?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Thank you. We're just working hard, excited to get
better. We did that in the first couple of games and just trying to grow
things a bit. Rebounding-wise and defensively and offensively, I guess all
those things and we're just real excited. A&M is a terrific team, and all the
teams to this point are absolutely excellent. And we're looking forward to the
opportunity and getting through this day. Looking forward to getting through
the playing day.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Chante's performance, her improvement from the
beginning of the season up until now.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Chante is a tremendous person, spectacular player and
she has gotten better every practice, every game. She's very steady, works
very, very hard, and I just think that she has, you know, a desire to compete.
And the most important thing for us is for her to be aggressive and dangerous
and working the ball. Regardless of whether it's her or somebody else who
benefits from that, that's the role she needs to play for us. She is
continuing to get better.  
For her we talked about it, it took a while timing-wise after sitting out a
year, what that was like to come back. It's taken her a while to feel as
though her timing was there, but there is no doubt that she feels better about
that now and is continuing to get better.  
  
Q. Nationally people are going to look at this regional and see Duke, Notre
Dame, Tennessee, and then Texas A &M as the different team here and this is
new for Texas A&M to come to this regional, but can you talk about you and
Michigan State and Duke as a program, you expect to be here and you expect to
go further and how much does that play into the mindset of the type of match-
ups tomorrow?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think every team is really hungry. I think this is a
hungry time of year. I don't think you can put all of these teams collectively
together. These are teams that represent this year and only this year. I know
for us we're extremely hungry because we've been getting better and now
getting to know each other still. Look at Texas A&M, they've got five seniors.
You know, this is where they should expect to be based on the fact that
they've spent a lot of time together.  
So I think each team is different. I'm just not one of those people that looks
to other teams, you know, you have to stay in the moment. So whatever has been
done in the past is not relevant to now, it's just not. What's relevant is
now, and what we can do together as a team. I think that we have a chance to
play a better game. We're for a little bit better game. Maybe we have two or
three guards that have seven rebounds for us, you know, or more balance across
the board. There are so many things that we still have yet to do. That's what
we're trying to work towards.  
So it's not about any kind of name or seed. Everybody here is very, very good.
None of that matters. It matters which team has their act together.  
  
Q. Joanne, what is it that you've seen the most growth in Abby? Her shooting
hasn't been quite there but she is learning so much. Is it her passing, her
leadership?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think it's a combination. I think Abby has grown, you
can look at statistically the rebounding and assists she creates, but I think
it's her leadership and poise, and her sense of calm and her ability to do so
many different parts of the game. You know, and go with the flow of the game.
I'm excited about her game because of all those developments, and that would
probably hold true for some of our other girls that are older, the poise,
leadership and calm that is so important to have at this time of year. I think
Abby has been working hard, and it's been fun to see her grow in all those
areas.  
  
Q. When you first saw Chante on the court did you anticipate she could be as
dominate as she's been lately? And is there anybody you've played that as a
similar style to Texas A &M?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yes, because of her athleticism and her pride. There is
an awful lot of pride in Tay. You've got this athletic post player with great
quickness and a shooting touch that most guards want to have. So that's pretty
exceptional for Tay. And then you've got that pride factor that she has in
wanting to be so very good. So it's been easy to watch Tay and doing so many
things because really from the beginning she's shown every sign of that.  
With A&M, I don't know, Virginia is a team that comes to mind because of the
athleticism. I felt Virginia was extremely athletic in the ACC. Of course we
played great teams. Carolina is pretty good. They're as athletic as anybody.
Maryland as well, Tennessee, all those teams, but I guess the thing is A&M is
a quick and athletic team, and Virginia comes to mind. But we played Rutgers
as well you know, and we feel like we've played everybody, and some teams
we've played many, many times, over and over and over again. So I feel like
there is a plethora of teams that we have played that would have us prepared
for a great team like A&M.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what this first year has been like for you at
Duke and some of the ways following in Gail's footsteps how you just kind of
worked your way through that?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Well, it's been very, very interesting and I think,
again, it's been an everyday process in trying to get to know the team, having
the team get to know us better. I think it's been made very easy by the team
in terms of their openness. This is a great group of women and they want to do
well. So as a group they've made it very easy for me and my staff in getting
to know them and trying to help out as much as possible.  
But a first year is an exciting year. I think the thing that I'm so impressed
with is the trust factor. Because at this point in time in the tournament,
that's truly a critical factor. As you know, many teams in this tournament, I
guess with the exception of Louisville, I mean, coaches have been with their
team multiple years, five years, ten years, a long, long time. So I think
what's fabulous about this group is they've been able to really just come
together as a group and keep that trust factor alive, because that's really
what can be the difference down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Takia Starks and Danielle Gant and the individual
match-ups?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Do I have to? Absolutely, they're fantastic players.
Takia Starks to me is an excellent guard. She's got this shake-and-bake move,
but she's got this pull-up J, she can go on the rack. She pull up a three.
She's complicated because she can change her speed. Obviously plays with a
great deal of confidence. No. 55 as you suggest, she's just a tough match-up
because she can play inside and out, she can play the 4, the 3, she puts the
ball on the floor, she is great at offensive and defensive rebounds. She's the
heart and soul of that team, a lot like No. 10 is. She is their go-to guard.
They rely on her greatly and she does a great job organizing, and just when
you think you've got her, she gets out there and hits a three.  
The X factor is No. 21, coming off the bench. Probably a starter, really. But
she's an incredible player. Can shoot off the pass, has her range, has a great
deal of confidence right now, given what she's doing in the tournament, given
her stats.  
So they have a lot of great players, without question. Like I said a bunch of
seniors, a whole lot of seniors, a whole lot of experience and they're very,
very good.  
  
Q. Wanisha, has tried to put out of her mind what she is going through for
the last time this year, what kind of a leader is she?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: She is a great leader, brings enthusiasm to the team,
and she isn't afraid to say things when necessary. I think she is a deserving
person, I think she should get everything that she deserves. I tell her, get
everything you possibly can, this is not the time to worry about scrap books
and play sad songs and memories, this is a time to go after what you deserve.
I think she is an incredible player. She feels like she has her best game
ahead of her. She wants to be sure she plays her best games, plural, and
that's something you earn every game, you earn that. And I think she has a bit
of an time to do that.  
Wanisha is a great player. I think she would be a fabulous WNBA player, her
body type, quickness, speed, versatility. She can play the wing spot, the 2-3,
she can play the 1, and she's very, very smart. She picks up things quickly.
So if I were a WNBA coach I would being looking at her. She is not the top
echelon in the draft because of stats and things of that nature, but, boy,
she's right in there.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive style of Texas A &M and the pressure
they put on you guys and is there a team that you faced like that or that
you've seen like that?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, we've faced some pressure, we've got some that?
(Chuckles.)  
A&M has excellent pressure. Again, I would go back to Carolina and the
pressure they like to put on you. I thought Virginia at times had some great
pressure. I thought when we played Tennessee. Again, when we played
Connecticut, I felt we got a lot of great pressure there. I think A&M has
their own great pressure and whether they deny the wings or front the post,
the way they get in your face and cut through lanes, and I think that, you
know, our job is to be attacking and keep our poise and composure at times as
well.  
So I feel like we play a lot of big teams, I feel like we've been in a lot of
situations, but at the same time, you know, everything you've got -- every day
you've got to come out there and execute and get it done against excellent
ball pressure.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck tomorrow afternoon. We're now joined by
Chante Black, Wanisha Smith and Abby Waner.  
  
Q. Chante, what's the difference between Coach and Gail?  
CHANTE BLACK: They're two different people. I don't really know any specifics
that would point out to say differences between the coaches, maybe
personality, I would say. I know that Coach McCallie is a more energetic
coach. She's always in the game, you see her hands going on the sidelines, but
I don't have too many specifics.  
  
Q. What's been the difference in the style of play that you guys have played
coming into that tournament? How has that been different?  
WANISHA SMITH: Just the same mentality, just to try and win games. The major
difference is we had run a match-up, that's one of the only differences.  
  
Q. Abby, who does Texas A &M mostly remind you of that you've played that
year?   
ABBY WANER: Um, I don't want to say a specific team but the ACC, I think, has
that style of play, which would be athleticism, outside of me (Chuckles.) And
run and gun, get up the score, defense, in the lanes, high pressure D, so I
think A&M does fit that mold if you want to call them an ACC-type team.  
But they're athletic, they have great perimeter play, we've faced a lot of
teams like that, that all posed their dangers.  
  
Q. Abby and Wanisha, what did you guys know about A &M before Monday or
Tuesday?   
ABBY WANER: We watched them play in the Virgin Islands back in November but,
you know, they lost to Wake Forest and we got killed by UConn by 26. So we
would like to think we're a different team then, and now they're a different
team. And it's hard to catch games on the east coast, so we haven't been able
to watch them too much outside of that game.  
CHANTE BLACK: Basically the same.  
  
Q. Talk about Wanisha's senior leadership?  
CHANTE BLACK: Nish is a great leader for this team, only senior on the team
that's played a complete four years for Duke. So she always knows what to do
when we get into tough situations and the tempo -- Coach always talks about
poise and Nish knows how to maintain poise for this team. So it's good we have
her on this team.  
  
Q. Wanisha, could you talk about what experience does the program have when
they make so many Sweet 16 appearances? What factor do you think that
experience has?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think it has a major experience, not only for the players but
the coaches as well. Our coaches have had great success, and just being able
to translate that to us we get into the tournament and into different
situations, just being able to communicate to us what to do and what not to
do.  
  
Q. For Wanisha and then Abby, Coach McCallie was in here earlier talking
about how you have a huge trust factor and how critical that is in the
tournament, and obviously she's new. Can you talk about that trust and how
it's built over time?  
WANISHA SMITH: The transition has gotten smoother toward the middle of the
season. I think that's normal to have a new team with a new coaching staff and
just really knowing what they expect and, you know, just trying to do what
they want us to do. I think right now the trust issue is not an issue anymore.
We're completely comfortable with each and every one of our players and our
coaches. So I mean I think that's going to work well for us in tournament.  
ABBY WANER: I think the fact that we have established a level of trust says a
lot about the team that we have. I think it takes a certain level of maturity
and being able to accept adversity and move on from it, and our team does
trust each other, and that makes it easier for us to trust and develop a new
relationship with our coach.  
  
Q. Wanisha and Abby, can you talk about Chante's dominance in recent games
and how long have you seen that coming?  
WANISHA SMITH: Chante has been phenomenal. I think her last game, it was
really good to see her play against posts that were her height and being
physical with her and her being able to withstand the physicalness and still
dominate with the number of points she had and the 16 rebounds. I'm sure that
will carry over.  
ABBY WANER: There has been a lot of talk about how great Chante is playing,
but it's not a surprise to us. All along we've thought she was one of the best
post players in the country, and she makes it fun for a guard to play because
she doesn't play like a low-post player. She makes us look good and we'll get
her the ball.  
  
Q. Chante, how do you expect A &M to defend you?   
CHANTE BLACK: Texas A&M likes to front the post, but I expect their post to
come out and deny a lot, put a lot of pressure on our guards, and you know,
just go from there. That's what we've seen so far.  
  
Q. Chante, you talked about tapes. Did you watch them versus the Paris
twins? Them against Shaunte Smith of OSU? Which ones?  
CHANTE BLACK: We've seen the combination of films, we break it down pretty
well, so we know they like to front a lot.  
  
Q. Chante, can you talk about your plans to defend any of the post players,
Danielle Gant specifically, I don't know if you're assigned to her or not but
what y'all's plans are for those players?  
CHANTE BLACK: We're just going to go out and defend them.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow afternoon and we'll see
you then. Thanks.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Summitt. Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously we're really excited to be in Oklahoma
City, and just excited about our first game with Notre Dame. Fortunately, you
know, both teams are obviously familiar with each other, having played them. I
think just being able to look at their game when we were obviously at Purdue,
got to see a little bit of them. But very impressed with their play from the
time we played them at Notre Dame to the time we saw them on the court against
Purdue.  
We know that their play is going to be key for us, because their guards are
all very much involved in playing off the dribble and running the team, and I
just think just watching obviously Tulyah Gaines and Ashley Barlow and Charel
Allen, the three of them, to me, set the tone for how they want to play. And
they refuse to lose against, obviously, Oklahoma in a very tough, close game.  
So our players understand the challenge, but at this time of the year it's
never going to be easy. So we certainly have to step up our defensive play and
particularly in the one-on-one game.  
  
Q. Coach, this season looking back at the January 5th game, have you all
shot the ball any better than the game against Notre Dame?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I don't know percentage-wise, but it was a good game for
us. I thought in that particular game our transition, just our board play, I
thought was one of our better games. It was late going into it, us coaches
have to find something to worry about, because I thought at DePaul we played
one of our best games. And, you know, coming off of that game I thought we
might have a let-down, but fortunately for us we played very well.  
  
Q. I know people around the country like to watch you and your intensity on
the court, but your players love to talk about how sweet you are, now nice you
are.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: What do they want? (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Have you changed over the years in that way? If so or if not, has
anything impacted that over the years?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I think you have to change. Because I
think that obviously just looking at when I started my career, and I'm not
saying I'm not demanding, but I think my communication skills are quite
different. And just getting to know each student-athlete that I coach, that
starts in the recruiting process. But I've always said people don't care how
much you know until they know how much you care. And I think we are family,
and I think they have to understand that you have an interest in them as a
person, as a student, as an athlete, but when you step over the line on the
basketball court there are certain demands. And I'm going to continue to
demand that. I might turn the volume down at times. Sometimes it's turned way
up. But I think it's all about knowing your personnel and knowing how to best
communicate with each individual.  
  
Q. Pat, there is obviously always a sense of urgency when you're this close,
but given the fact that five of your players, unless Candace Parker changes
her mind, five of your starters are likely to leave, do you as a coach feel a
particular urgency knowing it might be harder for the next couple of years?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Knowing that I'm starting over next year?  
No, I think every year at this time of the year I just hope that our staff can
do a tremendous job of preparing through our scouting report, and just do our
preparation on the floor. This senior class, they're a special group. They
have been a challenging group at times, but we're in a good place right now
and I think they're in a very good place. We talk about the legacy that this
senior class could leave on this program. Yes, they've won SEC Championships,
and, yes, they've obviously cut down the net last year in Cleveland, but is
there more for them to really leave their mark? And I've tried to put that in
front of them, because I think they are such a talented team that they should
be thinking, we want to certainly let people know that we want to win a
championship. We've won one. We would like to win two. We want people to
remember this senior class for a number of reasons.  
So I think as far as their focus, I don't see it as pressure for them. I see
it as just an opportunity and something they're really excited about at this
time of the year, and they know it's going to be hard. They know that it's
going to be very difficult to even get out of this region, much less win a
championship.  
So they have to bring it and we have to be very mindful of playing possession
basketball. And not taking possessions off.  
  
Q. Candace came in from the very beginning with so much hype, and I was just
wondering if you could talk about her makeup that has allowed her to handle
that and flourish in it and about her as a player.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Candace coming out of high school, obviously watching her
play and just seeing what a great upside she had to her game, I didn't know at
that time that she was going to be the great player that she has become,
because I didn't know how hard she was willing to work. When you watch kids in
high school you get a different look, and when you get in the college game and
particularly coming off a knee injury and having to work through that, I think
that really inspired Candace.  
I think the thing that has allowed her to elevate her skills and her game
overall is her commitment. I've said this many times, but she is the one
player on our team that has been in the gym the most, and worked on her ball
handling, her left hand hook, her right hand hook, her jump shot, playing off
the dribble. You know, she's really expanded her game through her commitment
of getting into the gym and doing so.  
She'll tell you, she'll find something that she wants to work on, and she's
going to work on it may be on Monday, on Tuesday maybe it's going to be a
different skill, different facet to her game. But she's very focused in
getting better all the time. I think that and aside from that it's just really
running the floor a lot harder, going to the glass a lot tougher, rebounding,
making rebounding and defense a priority. That's where, to me, to separate
herself out now and help us separate ourselves out as well is her defensive
play, and just the presence she can have on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Pat, can you give us your first impressions of the other seniors that
played in that All-American game here four years ago?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously Alexis Hornbuckle to me is a player that at
the time coming out of high school I thought, wow, what a great athlete. Also
a tough-minded defensive player. But now, as I look at Alexis's game and how
she has simplified more on the offensive end and focused on only taking the
three ball when they leave her open and not forcing that, being able to get
paint points, put-backs, her presence right now on the floor from a defensive
standpoint really sets the tone for us.  
And Anosike, obviously Nicky is another player that just really has stepped up
and, said, I'm going to be a force at both ends. She's much more aggressive
offensively. But if you could look inside of our team, what you would see is
that Nicky is really at times the heartbeat of our team. She's the leader.
She's always the one that's pulling everyone together. So in particular I
think those three have, they elevated their play and they have established who
they are, and they've gained the respect of their teammates consistently.  
  
Q. Off the court, do you have any curiosity or any interest in watching how
this event goes? Because Oklahoma didn't make it. There was such a curiosity
and speculation on, will fans come now? How much do you pay attention to that
as someone who is interested in the growth of the game?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I hope the fans will come out. We were
in a similar situation not at the regional level but the Final Four, and we
lost in overtime to Virginia on the campus of ODU. So Virginia game to
Knoxville and played on our home court, and obviously that was one of the
hardest things, knowing that, you know, Tennessee fans and obviously even our
own department had made tee shirts up that said "Tennessee in the final
three." Well, Tennessee wasn't there. And Joan Cronan, first thing she said
is, "You don't know how many thousand tee shirts we have and how much money we
have spent." And I said, "Next year we won't have to get any practice gear, we
will wear those tee shirts," which we did.  
Fortunately we got back to the Final Four the next year and beat Virginia for
the championship. But having said that, I got on the radio, I got on
television, I pleaded with the people in Knoxville to support that event, and
it was unbelievable, the response. And I think it's all about just getting
people to understand that when you host an event, obviously the people here in
Oklahoma City, and just in the surrounding area, hopefully will encourage
people to come out.  
I think it's going to be great basketball, I think you have some special teams
here. You've got coaches that have been in the game and been very successful
in the game. So that would be my message, and that's what I did when we were
in that situation. I'll just tell you, I'll never forget how the people
responded.  
  
Q. Candace has this said this shoulder thing is fairly constant but when it
happens like it did the other night, does your heart jump up in your throat?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: At this point in time anyone who has a problem with a
shoulder or ankle or knee, yes, it gets my attention. The good thing with
Candace is, you know, I think she listens and also responds well with our
trainer, Jenny Moshak and I'm constantly asking Jenny about that. And Alberta
has a similar problem. You just hold your breath. It's like from the time that
we left Perdue to time we arrived here, we did very little contact, and we did
virtually nothing up and down the floor. Because I am a little paranoid at
this time of the year about keeping them healthy and not going with a lot of
contact until we throw the ball up.  
  
Q. Muffet said she had you at a good time, you have a bad shoulder and your
knees aren't what they used to, what do you think about that?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Is she talking about me? She's going to have to take those
high heels off to catch me! (Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nicky, when you beat a team by 24 earlier in the year and they've never
beaten you in 19 tries, how do you avoid overconfidence?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think they're a lot better team watching them play against
Oklahoma, and I think their guards are really good. The combo guards can shoot
from the outside and drive. So we're maybe going to have to key in on that.
And, you know, this is for a championship, you know, you win or go home. So
that's motivation right there.  
  
Q. Alexis, you guys got the late game again, in West Lafayette you started
off sluggish in that late game. What do you do differently here to make sure
that doesn't happen again?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I don't know what to tell on you that. You still have the
long days, everything pretty much is the same, the shootaround is kinda early.
You just have to be ready. It's the Sweet 16, that should be motivation within
itself.  
  
Q. Candace, Coach was talking about the transitioning of your game from the
time you got there to now and part of it being your work ethic, could you talk
about that? Also how you have been able to handle and thrive in the spotlight
without it letting it wear you down.  
CANDACE PARKER: At Tennessee you play with the best, you're coached by the
best, so every day you're getting better. And I think that's been the key. We
play the toughest schedule, and in the summer we have some of the best
facilities and one of the best strength and conditioning coaches. So we just
get in the gym and we lift weights, and championships are won in the off-
season.  
We came to Tennessee to win a National Championship and to be in the spotlight
and to have pressure. So that's something I came into the situation knowing
how it was going to be.  
  
Q. Nicky, are you trying to take more of an active leadership role at this
point in the year? And if so, in what ways?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I always feel like the seniors, it's their job to step up in
postseason and lead the team, because we've been here and we know what it
takes. I know my freshman year in the Final Four I didn't know anything that
was going on because no one really took the time out of their day to help me
out. So I always told myself I would never let it happen when I was a senior
or when I was an upperclassman, period.  
So I really just try and make sure that no matter what, you know, the team is
on the same page, and that your freshmen never feel lost because we need them,
because I know what it's like to be a freshman and feel lost because I was
there. So I just make sure it doesn't happen on this team.  
  
Q. Alexis, I know Pat was influential with you and you had some family
losses in the last year or so. Can you talk about what she's meant to you as a
coach and mentor in the last few years?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Coach has done a great job of building a relationship and
that works two ways. I had to work hard to get a better relationship with her.
And as you mentioned, I have had family members lost within the past year and
she's just been there for me. She's like, whether you need to talk or if you
need to stay at home a little longer, no matter what it is, I just want you
100% on the court. You see the type of lady she is on the court, but at the
same time her mother instincts kick in.  
  
Q. Pat talks about the combination she needs to get you guys to win, the
"big three." Can you talk about how you have to play and also the last run-
through for you guys, are you savoring the moments you have left?   
CANDACE PARKER: I think definitely our team needs all three of us to step up.
These last four games definitely. You know, we have to bring what we do best
to the table. In terms of savoring the moments, we are. We obviously know that
there's not much time left and this is our last run. I just want you guys to
know I love you.  
  
Q. Anosike, talk about the experience you had in the McDonald's game here
several years ago, and do you remember meeting each other for one of the first
times at that time?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: You know, I would love to talk about the McDonald's All
American game. Nicky and I were on the East and Candace was on the West. And
all I gotta say is we won. The West lost.  
It was a great experience. We were talking about it in the locker room a
little bit, just being here and having great memories. We have fun together as
a whole and, hopefully we can keep our winning streak alive on the court and
she can get one, you know, because it's on her!  
CANDACE PARKER: You think that is funny! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Candace, talk about the shoulder issue.  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak has done a great job. She is the best trainer in
America, in the world, ever. She is definitely -- it's getting rehab and icing
and stimming a lot. I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Nicky, going back to that McDonald's All American game because I know how
much Candace loves that, she won the dunk contest here in Oklahoma City. Four
years since then she's become what she's become, not just the dunker. Can you
talk about the evolution of her game and her ability as a teammate over the
last four years.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: Candace has definitely gotten her hair done since then.
(Laughter.) And now she's fabulous!  
But she has gotten a lot better every year since she's played, definitely
tried to get as much advice from her offensively as I can. She'll whisper
something to me during practice when I'm not making my shots or something. But
I would say she's definitely in the gym all the time trying to work on her
game and it shows. You get what you put into it and she is definitely a
testament to that.  
  
Q. Following up on the dunk thing, Candace, was the reaction to that a
little different than you thought, where it was like, that's the girl that can
dunk, instead of that's the girl that's talented and she can also dunk? It
seems like here and in the Army game that's what everybody was talking
about.  
CANDACE PARKER: In the women's game dunking is not something you see every
day, so I feel like at the beginning it was like that, but then as my career
has progressed it's different. I think now there are more girls in women's
basketball that are going to be dunking, so I think it's going to grow.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: (No microphone) -- a game where our experience down the
stretch, all had an amazing game. And I thought our seniors stepped up and
played with a lot of poise. We're going to need a lot of poise and then some
to tackle the challenge that's ahead of us with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess the first question just looking back at the early January
game and how hot Tennessee was, especially Angie Bjorklund, how do you tackle
that game keeping the pressure on Candace Parker and focusing on their
perimeter players as well.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: They shot the ball extremely well from the three-point
line, and we actually tried to guard them, our game plan was not to pack it
in, although it looked like that way. So we've worked on our defense overall
since the Big East Tournament. Since actually after the Connecticut game we've
played a lot better defensively. And I think our attitude is a little better
about the defensive end. We are rebounding a little bit better. We just got
better defensively. We'll see if we got good enough.  
  
Q. You just kinda touched on it a little bit but what are the best ways to
defend Candace Parker and how much of that involves trying to get her into
foul trouble?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I think similar to how we looked at Courtney Paris; I
don't think you stop her, I really don't. I think you have to hope that she
doesn't have a monster game and it would be great if she got into foul trouble
but that's not our game plan. We're going to play our game and really we have
to go out -- I think the first time we played them we worried too much about
her, she still got 20 and everybody else beat us as well. So I think we need a
new plan.  
  
Q. A lot of emphasis obviously on the post game but you've got two teams
with veteran backcourts, Tennessee with Shannon and Alexis, in yours with
Charel and Tulyah Gaines. Can you talk about how key the guard play is going
to be?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: For us our guard play has to be great for us to win and
it has been very good. I think their guards are very experienced, excellent.
They have a great team all around. I think their backcourt is exceptional as
well, certainly among the best in the nation. I think that at this point in
the season, I think in the NCAA tournament I think the guard play is usually
what wins the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contributions of Charel Allen this season,
especially here toward the end of the year.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Charel Allen is the only player in our team's history
that has scored 1,500 points or more, gotten 500 rebounds and gotten 200
assists and 200 steals. It's kind of amazing with the players we've had come
through that she's the only one that's accomplished that. So she has left her
mark on our program, and has been sensational since her freshman year but this
year even more so.  
She's the one who makes the big shots when we need them. She's played well
consistently all year long, has had an incredible season.  
  
Q. The people here say it's all your fault that they aren't going to have to
open the upper deck tomorrow. (Chuckles.) Do you feel a sense of guilt?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: No, we're combing the state for Catholics right now. I'm
hoping to fill up the arena and get all the Catholic school kids out here
today. We were practicing over at the Fighting Irish gym at Bishop McGuiness.
I'm hoping the people come out. I plan on wearing red and hope the people will
cheer for us.  
  
Q. Why red?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It's Oklahoma's colors. I figure maybe they'll cheer for
us rather than orange.  
  
Q. After the first meeting you mentioned that your team was, I think your
exact quote was, "we were definitely intimidated," how do you rectify that?
Does it help that you've played them once, seen that at emotion of fear once?
  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know if it helps playing them once, but I think
it helps that we did play three of the No. 1 seeds, you know, and Rutgers as a
No. 2 seed. So we got better during the year playing those kinds of teams,
certainly coming out of the Oklahoma game, another great team that we were
able to play and gain some experience. And I think at this point in the season
the seniors are thinking, we don't want our season to end. So I don't know
we'll be intimidated. I don't think we will be, but certainly we're going to
play hard, and I think for us, that's our big key. You know, we want to go out
and play our game, play hard and see what happens.  
  
Q. In building your program to one of the elite programs you have won over
the Connecticut and Rutgers, but you haven't had the elusive win over
Tennessee. Talk about what that would mean to break that streak.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It will be great if I wouldn't have to answer that
question anymore. I think that would be the best thing about it. They're an
excellent team and probably the one year we had the National Championship team
we didn't play them, not to say that we would have won, but certainly that
probably would have been our best chance.  
They've always been a higher seed when we played them, and not the kind of
team that looks past people that you can sneak up on. So I know I saw in the
paper again today and I feel like it's printed on my forehead, "0-for-
Tennessee." But I think I'm giving Pat a good time. She's coming off the
shoulder injury, she's got bad knees. I think this year if we get her in a
running game I got her! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about playing the top seed, your team is getting a chance
to play them again after the game, that has to be extra motivation, not just
the loss but the chance to beat Tennessee?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I think it is motivation, not so much, you know, in kind
of a revenge sort of way, but just for themselves to say, you know, we're
going to play our game. I think we looked at the film from that game and we
were pretty bad start to finish. We didn't have a lot of highlights to look at
to say, we did this well or that well. So I think that's been how we've looked
at each game after we came out of those types of games, and said, if we at
least play our game then we can feel good about how we're running our stuff or
how we're defending or how we're rebounding. And that's really what we're
going into the game thinking.  
  
Q. After Devereaux went down, you guys struggled a little bit at the end of
the season. Did that have anything to do with her injury? She was contributing
a great deal to you at that point.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She really was. We had a great week after she we went
down. We beat Pitt, Syracuse and won at DePaul. I think offensively we were
really doing a lot of good things. Defensively we had gotten a lot better
which was surprising because she is definitely one of our better defenders and
one of our best rebounders. We really missed her in games when rebounding is a
big factor. When we played at Rutgers, I thought we really missed her ability
to defend in there. And certainly there are times she helps our press and she
helps us in a lot of ways. So I definitely think we've missed her, but we kind
of banded together pretty well immediately following her injury.  
  
Q. You have lost Devereaux Peters, Erica Williamson can you talk about what
you're getting out of her now that you're using her in the post?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I was pleased with her against Oklahoma. I think having a
big body in there and having a defensive presence. And it's hard to say you
play well when you let Courtney Paris get 24 points and 16 rebounds, but I
thought she did -- she didn't get a lot of rebounds but she was effective
keeping others off the boards. She has had some great games for us this year,
really, really maturing as a sophomore and throughout the year had some great
games. So she is going to be important, I think. Certainly the interior
defense is going to be really crucial for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your other sophomore, Ashley Barlow? You've been
getting consistent scoring from her.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She's kind of the unsung hero of our team. Somebody
nobody talks about. We get a lot of stuff from her. She is able to score out
on the offense, and get big plays. I thought the steal she had late in the
game against Oklahoma sealed the win for us. She is a great free-throw
shooter. She shot well from the three-point line this year, and she is the
most determined player I've ever coached. She isn't real big or real fast but
she gets the job done because she has a tremendous will, and she is a really
important part of our team.  
  
Q. Will you or have you picked Lindsay Schrader's brain at all about Candace
Parker?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: No, we haven't. I know they played together a little bit
back in the day, and before we played them last time we spoke a little bit.
But I don't think -- I think she's somebody that you don't need to know too
well because she's just a great player, and there's not a lot of secrets, I
think.  
  
Q. Obviously Candace Parker, and some of the guards get a lot of attention
but can you talk about Angie Bjorklund, obviously memories of her and Vicki
because, maybe?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I have fond memories of her, and I think she made seven
threes in our game, and we were trying to guard her. But she is somebody that
is a huge concern to defend. You can't worry about the inside when she's on
your side. She had an incredible freshman year. I knew watching her play she
was going to be a great player. She reminds had Beth Morgan who was a great
player in Notre Dame shift, she is just an outstanding player and we might put
somebody on the bench with her just so we're ready for her when she comes in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Charel, like every Notre Dame player, you've never beaten Tennessee. They
handled you easily earlier in the year. What do you take out of that game and
what would it mean to be the team that broke the ice?  
CHAREL ALLEN: It would be great to beat Tennessee. They're the No. 1 seed,
we're the No. 5 seed. We have nothing to lose. They have everything. They're
the defending champs. And I would think we learned when we played them earlier
this season, we just have to guard the three-point line. We gave up seven
threes to one girl and that's not acceptable. We have to guard the three-point
line.  
  
Q. Charel, would you talk about how many times you've seen those three-
pointers over and over? Have you guys watched the video of that game?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We have watched it over and over again, and actually I'm tired
of watching it. So we're going to get out there and show them that we can
guard the three-point line.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Coach said she hasn't tried to pick your brain at all about
having played with Candace Parker for any tips or anything like that. Is there
anything that your teammates have asked you involving Candace that you can
help out on or anything like that?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: I played with her six years ago, so she was a completely
different player than she is now. We were friends back in the day but I
haven't contacted her or anything like that since then.  
So, no, they haven't said anything to me about it, no.  
  
Q. Ashley, would you talk about what it means to get this far for the first
time, and what's driving you now to keep going to the next round?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: It means a lot to us and, I mean, we just continue to fight. It
was amazing to -- very exciting to get to this round, and we played all the
way to the end and fought all the way, and that's what we're going to continue
to do. And we believe in ourselves.  
  
Q. Ashley, Coach said that you were the most determined player she has ever
coached. And also she said they don't run a lot of plays for you. Seems to me
to be kind of opposite thing.  
ASHLEY BARLOW: When you have a player like Charel Allen on your team, I mean,
she is a great scorer. But you've got to stay in the offense, and that's what
I try to do and that's when my shots come when I stay in the offense. I do my
shots through the offense and it's not like I'm out of it. I mean, I just work
and try and do whatever it takes for the team to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck tomorrow evening.

### [Kristi Toliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15662)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Maryland press conference. We'll
start with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, sometimes it's just not your day. You have to give
credit where credit's due and I thought that the Stanford did a tremendous job
tonight for 40 minutes.  
Credit to them. I thought they continued to hit big shot after big shot. And
really they played poised for a complete 40 minute game. And from our end I
felt like we dug ourselves into a hole early and felt like we were trying to
fight and come out of that for the entire game.  
But credit again to Stanford how aggressive they were, how they played us
defensively, made it extremely difficult and obviously the shots that they hit
from 3 were big time daggers. And they did a tremendous job.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kristi, you and Candice put on a pretty remarkable show. Are you able to
even realize that right now?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Candice played phenomenal today. Made big shots, was their
leader. She did a great job. Right now all I'm feeling is the loss and the
fact that I don't get to play with my seniors any more and that's what's going
on in my head.  
But, yeah, she played a great game.  
  
Q. Kristi, what was going through your mind in the second half though, you
got 24 point in the second half, was there something that you wanted to do or
you saw that you could take advantage of?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Again, I just wanted to be aggressive. I think that I was just
taking what the defense was giving me and I had open looks and I was able to
create and then I kind of got in the zone. That was basically it.  
  
Q. Crystal, can you talk about what you're feeling right now and what hurts
the most from this loss?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: As a senior I didn't want my career to end and neither did
the rest of the seniors. And it's never going to be like this any more
professionally. The team atmosphere, it's never going to be like this any
more. And we just didn't want it to end.  
  
Q. Kristi, Wiggins got her points but how disappointing was it to let
somebody like J.J. homes get her career high?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Yeah, she played great too. Again, Stanford knocked down a lot
of shots and they did a great job in the first half and in the second half we
weren't counting on them making those same shots again and they did. So you
got to give credit to them for stepping up and playing big, not only Candice
but her surrounding cast.  
  
Q. Marissa, even though they had the lead and as coach was saying that you
guys were trying to dig out of a hole, it seemed that you never really were
out of it until the final ticks went down. Did you guys feel that even though
they were 12, 10 up that a couple 3s from Kristi and you're right back in it
and you were there until the end?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Definitely. We never thought we were going to lose the game
until the final buzzer sounded. We have a lot of weapons on this team. So no
matter how many we were down we always feel like we can get our self out of a
hole with the great shooting we have on this team.  
  
Q. Crystal, could you talk about Stanford's inside game and how hard it was
to score and stop them from scoring?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Well they had a great game plan and they just did a good
job.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student-athletes and we'll take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. When they started, when they came out hot from the outside did that cause
you guys to have to change something that you were doing?  
COACH FRESE: They're just obviously so dangerous when they're hitting 3s with
the kind of inside presence that they have inside. So we really felt like we
wanted to stick to our game plan. That eventually those shots weren't going to
continue to fall. As much game film that we had watched on them, we felt like
the percentages were going to even up. But obviously like I said, all the
credit goes to Stanford for just making so many great shots in this game.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Stanford's inside game. Particularly on
defense against your girls?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I thought that they were very physical. Very aggressive.
And I thought at times from our end we really shied away from the contact and
which is something from our end that I thought we could have been a little bit
more aggressive.  
But they made us with work for any shot that we got, obviously, with both
Crystal and Laura, the touches that they got and the moves that they had to
make, they made everything extremely difficult. They're just talented, big,
post players for Stanford.  
  
Q. Last three minutes of the first half, couple turnovers, a couple air
balls, how disappointing was that stretch and how important was that
stretch?  
COACH FRESE: Well, yeah, that stretch was critical and I thought really to be
able to cut for us into the lead and to be able to go in with some momentum
into the locker room at half time.  
But again I think credit to Stanford's defense and just how smart they are,
the plays that they were able to make tonight.  
  
Q. Another stretch was that stretch of free throws that you guys missed five
of six, you cut it to six, Candice hit a 3, and then you had a chance to get
some points back with those free throws and they didn't fall. Was that crucial
to you?  
COACH FRESE: It was critical I thought. I mean uncharacteristic of us from the
foul line. Again, I don't know if that's nerves or for us we're usually a
better free throw shooting team and it always seemed like when we were
starting to get some kind of momentum obviously Candice did what any All-
American does, she stepped up and hit some big 3s and some big shots.  
  
Q. Was Kristi getting all those points on her own, or were you running
things for her or was she in the zone?  
COACH FRESE: A little bit of both. In terms of our play calling we wanted to
bring their bigs out as much as possible. We wanted to set a lot of them on
ball screens. We knew they were going to make it extremely difficult inside
with their great post presence, doubling, post to post, so a lot of that, some
was play call and some was just a lot of on ball screens that we wanted to
set.  
  
Q. Things got out to such a quick offensive start, a lot of points on the
board, did you have a sense that it was sort of a keep up kind of a mode?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, and I tell you, I thought the tempo was going to favor us,
to be honest. Stanford likes to have more of a controlled pace and a
controlled offensively. So at the time I thought it would favor us to be
honest. But again credit to them, 98 points that they put up on the board and
they were clicking on all cylinders.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the imprint the seniors have left on the team?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I tell you, as difficult as right now is for our team and
for our locker room, I tell you, I don't want to be sad that it's over. I want
to be happy that it happened.  
Especially with this group. What these seniors have meant to our program in
their four years and like I told them in the locker room, to go through your
college career and only be one of four teams to win a National Championship
and obviously to be the first at Maryland and they have raised the bar, they
have raise raised the standard for Maryland basketball and I think that's why
the pain is there just because we have had such a tremendous experience with
them, what they have meant to our program and what they have meant just as
people. Not just basketball players, but what they have meant as people to
each and everyone of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the Stanford press
conference. Take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, I just want to congratulate Maryland on
a great season and they're a fantastic team. I'm really proud of our team to
be up here and be representing the west at the Final Four and we had to work
very hard to beat Maryland. And we did it with I think everyone really
contributing, willing to do whatever it takes. We knocked down our high in
terms of 3s by knocking down 14 3s we had a great inside presence with Jayne
and Kayla, they're defense and their rebounding, you know, you thought Roz
worked extremely hard on Kristi Toliver, she's a fabulous player. And even
though she did score a lot, I thought Roz worked really hard and that was real
important for our team and Candice, what can I say about Candice. She is a
great player, steps up in big games and she really stepped up for or our team,
knocked down shots. People came off the bench, Jeanette and Jill contributing,
and our whole team was ready to go. So I'm really proud of our team, I think
that through the whole NCAA tournament so far they have really responded to
the challenge and obviously there's going to be a bigger challenge next week
and we'll be ready.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, when the 3s started to fall did you kind of have the sense it
was going to be a good night?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah. I think that just you could tell from the beginning our
team knew, this is just such a special team. And before the game we all
huddled up together and we could just see the focus in everyone's eyes and I
think on the shooting we were relaxed much because we had confidence in each
other and we knew that everyone was going to have each other's back. So I
think that we started out shooting really well and I think that when we got
our offensively and our defense going it was the whole night it was great.  
  
Q. J.J., what did you have for lunch today? What was that about?  
J.J. HONES: I felt like throughout the course of the tournament people have
stepped up big, obviously Candice 44 points, 41 points, Roz had a big game.
Jayne and Kayla have been solid. I felt like people might have been sleeping
on me in terms of that. And so I felt like it was kind of my duty to make
shots and whatnot and so -- I don't know.  
  
Q. Candice, were you considering that what this game meant, were you nervous
at all before the game and what did you do before the game, anything different
you talk to the team?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know what, we all talked and surprisingly, no, I wasn't
nervous. I just thought, I knew this wasn't going to be my last game so I
wasn't nervous and our team knew that and I think have you to go into a game
thinking that every time. Otherwise you'll put pressure on yourself.  
I had just great encouragement from my teammates, Jayne, snatched me, grabbed
me and just said some really great words of encouragement before the game. And
Tara also said things and everyone just has confidence in me so I wasn't
really nervous about that.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about how the night went, I remember last week you
said you looked at Candice and you knew she was fine, was that sort of the
same sense you had tonight?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yeah, I think our team from the very beginning was just extremely
well prepared and very confident. You could tell that everyone, we were out
there telling like stories from the beginning of the season, with how hard we
worked and how hard we had to work this entire game to get this win.  
Candice was the best, I told her before the game she's the best player on the
floor and there's no one who can stop her out there. She's played all over the
world and no one can stop her there, so why tonight.  
  
Q. For Candice, did you feel like a sense of mission to get Stanford back
into the Final Four?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. I think we all do. Growing up on the west coast,
a lot of us, all of us except for Roz grew up on the west coast and we really
know that how great of an institution that Stanford is. What a power it is in
basketball.  
So absolutely, we were aware of that and we wear that with so much pride. So
we did have sort of that mission and me especially. Especially being my last
year and I knew that this team is a team that can do it.  
  
Q. Candice, obviously this has been the round that tripped you up in the
past, did you think at all about that? Did you think back on those other two
games you played in the Elite 8 and draw motivation from that or did you try
and shut it out?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. That, I think that helped me a lot because I just
thought about my freshman year even at Michigan State, seeing just I think
that what hit me was actually my sophomore year we lost to LSU and they were
celebrating and dancing and I was just like, gosh, I just want to dance like
that just be excited and go to the Final Four with my team. And I kind of had
that image in my head before the game started. And sure enough, we were all
out here dancing.  
  
Q. For Kayla, what is somebody six four doing out there past the three foot
arc?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: They found me on those on the pick and pops with Candice and
I've been practicing my 3 in practice and we have a couple plays for that. But
I think it was just my time to step up and hit them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the work you guys did defensively on Langhorne and
Harper inside?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that they were a big focus with those two and Toliver and
Marissa, but I think that our main goal when we huddled up before the game was
rebound. We said if we rebound we'll win the game. And we actually ended up
getting out rebounded, but I think that it was just, we took it kind of to
heart. We kept that two seed in mind and it just, there was no way we were
going to lose this game.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: The same way. I think that preparing against Pittsburgh and
Cal and the doubles really helped us for this game. We had Candice all the
time helping us on the post and I think it really took the pressure off of me
and Jayne, knowing that Candice was always going to be there.  
  
Q. Candice, you seemed extra eager to take 3s tonight and one time I thought
maybe you took a 3 when you should have been killing the clock. You seemed to
be pretty confident out there. Do you know you can step right up to that line,
you know, you don't have to go three or four feet behind it to shoot.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, I know. In the timeout I think I hesitated one time to
take a shot and Tara looked at me and she said, whenever you get a shot, just
take it. So I think that probably came after that talk, but.  
(Laughter.)  
But, yeah, you know, I think that's I was just feeling it today and really I
tried to attack the basket first and then once you attack the rim you can, it
sets up your outside shot. So I just took 3s just in the flow of the game when
I felt like it.  
  
Q. Roz, they cut it to six, and Candice hit a 3 and they missed some free
throws, but you guys did that sort of unflappable thing again. Where you
didn't let it get to you. Did you guys feel like it was pretty well in control
when they made a run at you?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: In this game we were very aware of the fact that Maryland
has been down before and by big numbers even and has come back and won. So
it's funny because we were on the court up what was it, 10 or 12, with like 22
seconds and saying, "They can come back. You know, they can still come back."
And we were keeping each other so honest, making good plays and coming in
like, we don't even congratulate anyone, we're just like everybody has to box
out, be fresh. So there's definitely that sense of do not let up.  
  
Q. J.J. when you said that they were sleeping, did you mean that they didn't
have you on the radar, they didn't and they were they underrated you or
something?  
J.J. HONES: You're going to have to ask their coach what they put on their
scouting report. But I don't know, I just found myself open and my teammates
found me and I mean I hit shots.  
  
Q. You also drove though too.  
J.J. HONES: Oh, yeah. Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let the student-athletes go back to the locker
room. Take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. I hate to ask a one person question, in what was such a great team game,
but we have all our own angles. For Candice, where does this rank in the games
that you've seen her, that she's played for you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: In some ways it might be the very best because the most was
on the line. We talked a little bit before the game and she just said to me,
she says, I'm not nervous and I said, well Candice, we want to play more. We
don't want this to be our last game. And I said that you got to just whatever
sometimes when I watch her play like when I saw her play at Maples that last
game, I just said, I can see when you relax and are having fun. Just do the
same thing.  
Actually against Pittsburgh I thought she was kind of tight. And actually in
the beginning of the second half I thought our team was a little tight. We had
a 10 point lead and then we were short on all our shots and I'm like, forget
about the lead let's just play the way we played in the first half. Maybe we
shouldn't have had a half time.  
But Candice just, she hit a real big three for us, she hit a couple of them, I
guess, but I think in the second half kind of right at the top and she was
just such a great leader for our team. She really, I had no idea she really
had 41 points. She had a lot of free throws. But this might be her biggest
game. But I hope her bigger, biggest one is ahead.  
  
Q. Can you remember ever being up by 10 points at half when the rebounding
totals are even and your opponent shot 64 percent from the field?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I really can't. I know that they shot well, but we were
shooting really well from 3. And a lot of it for me at half time is kind of a
sense of how are they playing us, what kind of shots are we getting and we
were getting some good shots. And we were working hard defensively. And
Marissa Coleman was I think kind of the one that was really hitting for them.
And then Kristi Toliver I think she was maybe the leading scorer at half time.
But they were working hard for their shots. We were taking care of the ball,
we weren't letting them just play volleyball off the back board, which we have
seen them do a million games. And we were hitting our shots.  
And we had good flow to our offense. We were running things pretty well, it
wasn't like perfect, but we were getting shots we liked. And then Kayla just
decided to go off. And I like that plan.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what it feels like for you to go back to the
Final Four. It's been 11 pretty long years.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that going to the Final Four is something really
special. Obviously winning a National Championship is even more special, but
sometimes things just have to be right. And I think that we have had some
great teams, we have had some great individual players, but I don't know that
there's ever been anyone that has done any more for their team than Candice
does, in so many ways. Whether it's defensive rebounding, scoring, a team
leader, and I'm just at this point I'm just really happy for her and really
happy for our team to have this opportunity. And the fact that they really
play hard for each other, they really enjoy playing with each other, they're a
crack up just sitting back there and they just wanted it for each other. And
it's really special.  
There's no guarantee, I don't know how many coaches have in women's basketball
have gone to the Final Four, there's a couple coaches that monopolize it, but
it's a really special opportunity. And we want to go there and just have a
great time and just do our best.  
  
Q. I want to know if you were nervous before the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I really wasn't. I think in some ways for our team and for
me the best thing happened, which I think you recognized, the fact that we
were a number two seed. I think that in some ways that took some pressure off
of people and the fact that we played, I thought Pittsburgh really prepared
fours this game. Pittsburgh was extremely aggressive. And that, at half time I
said, so which half was harder, this one or last week? Or last night whenever
we played. And they were just like, yeah, we can get our shots. And I said,
yeah, so let's run our offense now let's play great defense.  
So I thought we did. We really -- I think people really worked hard to do what
we asked them to do. And then you have very -- they're exceptionally talented,
Kristi Toliver, she's fantastic. She's just, we were working as hard as we
could to keep her in front and she still went by. Langhorne and Harper, are
both great players. Marissa Coleman. And we gambled and Strickland hit a shot,
and then we just kept gambling. Before the game I had our manager chart
Strickland's shooting and it was scary how she shot and I was really nervous I
thought maybe this isn't going to work and then Bobby said yeah, but, you
know, I can hit shots in warm up too. So I said all right, we're going to
stick with the plan.  
  
Q. That first half was a little fast paced, Maryland thought that favored
them. And you were a little concerned yesterday about the pace. How did you
feel as that everybody was going up-and-down?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I feel like our team's in great sheep. The TV time outs are
so long that I wasn't worried about the pace at all. Honestly, I was wanting
us to pick it up more. I thought we could have maybe run a little bit more.
But one of the things for us I wanted to keep Jayne in there. And so basically
I told Jayne I said you can walk down the court, but when you get down there,
move. And get good position in the post. They are some big, I mean Maryland
has some very big physical bodies. And the toll was not running as much as it
was when you got there and you're playing against 55 Perry and she's got her
forearm in you or Langhorne or Harper, and they're very physical.  
  
Q. Could I get some thoughts first of all on J.J.'s play and then Kayla.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that J.J., she had, I teased J.J. before the
game and Jill both, and I said, Jill's coming back and sometimes you can get a
sense before a game like who is kind of ready and who is doing things. And I
said it's Oregon day. I said we need our Oregon players to step up. And J.J.
stepped up big. Knocking down big shots, making that steal, I didn't really
even see it I turned and I saw her just going in for a lay up.  
But our team, I think our team had confidence. And J.J. shot with confidence
and played with confidence. And Kayla is outrageous. She just is so she is so,
I mean this, you hear this line on ESPN all the time, as cool as the other
side of the pillow. Well that's her. She is really poised. And she is talking
to Jayne, I'm, they're longer, I'm going to have to lob it a little higher for
you, she is really, really a mature player. And she stepped out and hit 3s and
we have been working on that. So I am glad to see it come to fruition in this
game.  
THE MODERATOR: About the pace again and you talked yesterday about it you were
kind of okay with whatever the pace was, but could you have imagined that you
would have 51 at half time or 98 as a final score. Could you have ever
pictured that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We knew we were both really talented offensive teams and I
don't think it reflects bad defense necessarily, we worked very hard on
defense and so did they. But I think you just, I think it's great for the
women's game. I think it's great for hopefully it's a really good TV game. A
lot of scoring, clean play, only seven turnovers on our team, not a lot of
fouls called. I would think that for the fans that came from Spokane, that
they would really enjoy watching and the TV people would watch it too. I sure,
I thought it was a fun game. And we just want to keep it going. Our team
really enjoyed it, they're having a great time in the locker room right now.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you very much.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started take an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH FRESE: First of all I tell you, just we're extremely happy to be here.
We appreciate every single time that you get to advance and move on and to be
able to play tomorrow.  
I'll tell you, just very proud of how we came out and played what I thought
was probably pretty close to a 40 minute effort from our end, from a defensive
end. And just the unselfishness we displayed together as a team and just being
able to execute the scout and the game plan almost to perfection yesterday.  
So quick turn around, obviously, with the tremendous Stanford team. And as
always, they're extremely well coached by Tara, do a phenomenal job and we
have got to continue to execute our game plan and be ready to play. And
obviously both teams are very, very talented and we have just got to be ready
to come out and play 40 minutes of inspired basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Brenda, did you have a chance, I'm assuming you scouted the Pitt/Stanford
game. And Pitt tried to disrupt Candice that was sort of seemed to be their
game plan. How will you try to stop her?  
COACH FRESE: Candice is obviously an extremely tall especially talented
player, very versatile, athletic, that's why she's an All-American. But I
think by committee, obviously, being able to run so many different looks at
her and players, just because she's extremely talented, again, I think we need
to have tremendous team defense tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Nebraska, start with coach, talk about your defensive effort last
night. Where you got contributions from everybody. How do you get to that
point where you get the unselfish nature and get these girls to buy into
that.  
COACH FRESE: Well I tell you, we were really locked in together as a team. I
thought our hustle plays really were the difference in terms of our energy and
our intensity. But just the commitment. We talked about it leading up to this
game, we talked about it in the locker room and you could really see the focus
and the concentration that was there that we really wanted to defend for 40
minutes.  
  
Q. Crystal, how much through the course of this year has last year's NCAA
exit sort of motivated you and driven you guys?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think we were really just disappointed with how our
season ended last year and this whole season we have been using it as
motivation to push us through and I think that right now after we got through
that second round now we're just a whole different team and we put that in our
past. We're concentrating or we're not concentrating on that too much any
more.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to tackle it. But with Kristi and Crystal being such an
amazing inside outside game, have teams will many underestimated everybody
else. I know that you guys almost all of you score in double figures and that
is been a little bit under the radar for the other guys and that's helped them
pick it up?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I don't think so at all. As you can see when you listen to
people talk they talk about how deep our team is well, how balanced our
scoring is. I think that that is what makes us so good just how anybody can
come out and score 20 a night. So I think we really use that to our advantage
our balance offensively.  
  
Q. Laura, talk about the post matchup tomorrow night with Jayne and Kayla
inside that rebounding margin that they had last night probably made an
impression.  
LAURA HARPER: Definitely. Seeing such a strong rebounding advantage that they
had I don't want to say pressure but it puts a lot of focus on post players as
we know it's something that we're going to have to be focus and be ready. We
have played against very good post tandems before and so we'll just have to
come out and play our game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Who is the quirkiest on the team and what makes them so goofy?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: That's a tough one. I would probably say each and every one
of us have our moments. I don't think one single person gets the award. I
think everybody at different points in time has their goofy moments and does
certain things.  
LAURA HARPER: I don't know. I think Jade has her moments where you just don't
know what to expect from Jade and she just keeps us all kind of smiling and
guessing what she's going to say next.  
  
Q. Do loose moments like that help you guys especially when the stakes are
so high right now in this tournament do you need those kind of loose moments
to relax?  
LAURA HARPER: For sure. We play our best when we're playing loose and having
fun. And last night was just a prime example of just not even thinking, just
playing, playing D, playing offensively, just doing all the little things. And
that's just when we start to flow the best.  
  
Q. Laura, follow-up with the post player. Who does Stanford remind you of
teams you played so far their tandem?  
LAURA HARPER: I mean, personally I think it's like UNC, just because with
Larkins and Pringle just being both daggers and you can't just stop one. But
also coach also compared them to Oklahoma too, so.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think they're pretty different. I really can't compare
them to anybody. So it's kind of tough.  
  
Q. Can you just from a matchup perspective what are the things you need to
do, what are the things you cannot afford to do tomorrow night against
Stanford?  
COACH FRESE: I think that we obviously have to be able to come out and play
another tremendous 40 minutes of defense. We understand that. Stanford's
offensively, the number of sets they run, it's extremely complex. So we have
got to be able to defend and obviously we have to be able to rebound. The two
staples we have talked about all season long. And it's exciting that I really
feel like those two areas are going to be a main focuses and keys of the game.  
  
Q. Crystal or for anyone else, this is kind of your coach described it as a
bracket that's been a little overlooked and I know you guys have been
motivated by being an underdog and Stanford feels very much that they're the
underdog, they wanted the number one seed, you guys got it, do you feel like
it's kind of a grudge match between two underdogs?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Kind of in a way. Our team always loves being its underdog
and I know Stanford wasn't happy about getting it the two seed, but a lot of
people still don't think we deserve it and we want to prove a lot of people
wrong.  
  
Q. I want to ask a completely goofy question. The Happy Days, you guys ran
into the actually Happy Days members. By a show of hands how many of you had
ever heard of any of those actors before? Okay. All of you. Okay. But is it
true now that we heard that the only way that you knew who Henry Winkler was
the Fonz was because somebody had seen it in Family Guy?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I knew him from the Water Boy. That's how I recognized his
face.  
  
Q. Tell us a story about that for those who don't know about how you ran
into them?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: We were in the hallway and walking toward the elevator and
all of a sudden everybody was like, that's the Fonz, that's the Fonz. And
everybody was, hey, hey, hey. And so everybody turned and looked back and we
are like, oh, yeah, that is him and everybody started running over we're like,
can we get a picture with you. It was very exciting.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Where was this?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: In the lobby right near the concierge desk?  
COACH FRESE: The funny thing with that story as well one the age gap, kind of
that you alluded too, and then my husband and I spent my husband probably
spent an hour up in the room laughing about the Fonz, just thinking probably
through the course of his life when I ran up to get a picture with him it was
here, with my thumb, you know. And just the poor guy what he must go through
in his life with the excitement that we all showed when we got our pictures
taken with him. So it was a great moment. Light. And just what we need to just
to have a lot of fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Stanford got Cuba Gooding and you got the Fonz. All right.  
COACH FRESE: Yeah.  
  
Q. You recruited Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, can you just talk a little bit about
what you saw in her. She said she narrowed her choices down to you and
Stanford?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, it was a really intense recruiting effort. It came down to
both schools. Just a great kid, tremendous family, she had visited campus
numerous times her and her mother and we did a home visit with her. And just a
special player whose had a tremendous career for Stanford.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies, while you go behind us here and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you had your last meeting with Kristi after last season what are the
things that you wanted her to improve upon and has she come through on
those?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I think that obviously it continues to be a process with
each and every player and for Kristi we really felt like from her sophomore
year to her junior year we wanted to, Kristi is someone who always leads by
example. She has a tremendous work ethic and passion for the game. But we
really wanted her to get more vocal and really display more leadership. And
probably more consistency kind of like you saw last night in terms of her not
showing frustration.  
I think that obviously it sums it up, the floor game that she played last
night for us shows you just how far she's come and how far she's grown and
again it's a credit to Kristi from all the hard work she put in an and in the
summertime to going to the point guard college, to just all the little things
that she's done to put her game into this position to be so coachable is
really a credit to Kristi.  
  
Q. Can you talk about a little bit about the season, I asked about that
second round loss and how much you guys have gotten out of that, but this was
a season where you were in and out not on the road with the team the assistant
coach was there, how did the kids sort of handle all the changes that were
happening in your own structure while they were trying to sort of keep this
going?  
COACH FRESE: I think that our players have shown through it all just the
ownership that this is their team and this is their season and we really
talked about it from day one with our first team meeting when I announced to
the team that I was pregnant and just we knew kind of how the season at times
was going to unfold that I was going to be in and out wasn't it.  
So can't say enough about the leadership of our upper class men and really
taking that to heart. And the ownership there. And I think that this team has
really displayed what a team is really all about. Just in regards to it was an
uncharacteristic season to have your head coach not travel on road games, be
in and out. My assistant coaches, I can't say enough for Daron Park who, with
the way that a new coach coming in, coaching this team, all my assistants,
Erica Floyd, Diane Richardson, everyone really stepping up to the plate.
Coaches and players alike.  
Really that's what a team is all about, really pulling for each other and
helping each other through it.  
  
Q. Was it bumpy ever? It sounds like it went very smoothly but was it?  
COACH FRESE: Well I think like throughout the course of any season you're
always going to have different patterns and flows to it. And I just feel
really fortunate of just all the great people we have in place. And you are
uncertain the first road trip I didn't travel to was UCLA and UC Santa
Barbara, two very difficult games for us. UCLA we were down 17 and to be able
to watch the comeback that our kids displayed I knew that you could just see
something special with this team this season, the lessons that we took from it
a year ago, to heart.  
  
Q. You guys are playing for a spot in the Final Four. Both teams are. That
should be motivation enough. But it definitely seems both teams have an edge
about the lack of respect angle. Will that play a part in the motivation
tomorrow as if the Final Four isn't enough?  
COACH FRESE: I think that both teams know where it's at at this point. I think
that it really comes down to getting out on the court and executing. And which
team is able to execute their game plan or is allowed to.  
I think once you tip up the ball, all that goes out and we're just going to
play.  
  
Q. This is the round that has stopped Stanford three of the past four years.
And two years ago you advanced past the Elite 8 and won the whole thing. How
much does that experience matter right now that your kids have won a National
Championship, played in that game and Stanford's just been trying to get to
the Final Four?  
COACH FRESE: You would like to say that you should, that you can count on your
experience, but at the same point the year that we advanced we didn't have the
experience, we just played. So again, I think that it really, I would have to
say that you just come out and you have to be able to play and you have to
play for 40 minutes and it can come down to a possession, it can come down to
a lucky break. But just wanting to come out and play as hard as we possible
can for the 40 minutes.  
  
Q. We asked the kids earlier, I'm going to ask you about the rebounding and
the battles after you saw what Stanford did last night and what your girls did
too. Talk about that inside battle?  
COACH FRESE: It's going to be a battle on the boards, absolutely. A hundred
percent I would agree with that. And a battle of the bigs. It's going to be
exciting to be able to see from both teams. Just special players, amongst both
teams.  
So getting on the glass is going to be key, I know Stanford's focusing on it
so is Maryland and so it should be a lot of fun to be able to watch them
amongst both teams and just the competition that's going to be out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach I'm guessing maybe your first experience with Stanford
was as a player at Arizona. Just curious looking back 15 years, 15, 16 years
ago, what you remember about Coach VanDerveer's teams then Stanford and
learning from that.  
COACH FRESE: Right. Well I tell you when I was a player at Arizona, Stanford
just like they are now, they were rolling. It was it was back with Jennifer
Azzi and the National Championships that they had won. And always just
remembering and continue to have the utmost respect for what Tara's done with
her team and program, as an Olympic coach, what she's done for our game has
been truly special. And she's one of the best basketball minds in the
business. And she continues to have dominant teams each and every year.  
  
Q. Did you win any games against Stanford when you were at Arizona?  
COACH FRESE: No. Not, not those years. They were a special team, special
group. That had just had done so many things in that era when Jennifer Azzi
was a Kodak All-American she was actually an idol for me. It's kind of hard
when you're playing against her and you think of her as an idol. But just they
were a lot of fun to watch.  
THE MODERATOR: All right coach, thank you.  
COACH FRESE: All right. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the media conference. Take questions for
the student-athletes after an opening statement from the coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought our team played a much better second half. Made
some good adjustments. We did a really good job of getting the ball inside to
Jayne. I thought Kayla stepped up big. I was really for the most part our shot
selection was good, and our defense especially on our double on Walker was
really strong. I thought Candice really plays really well within herself when
she didn't force things, she really made nice passes to other people. J.J. hit
some big shots. Roz hitting some big shots.  
And I was really disappointed with the call against Candice having watched it,
I saw it the first time, but when I saw it the second time, it really I
thought it really put her at risk to get hurt and that was something that had
me really upset.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, expanding on that, what's it like as a coach when you see your
player on the ground like that taking a hard foul?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that hard fouls are part of the game. But a play
should be made on the ball.  
I just think that when, there's a lot, people put a lot into it, this is a
situation where in all games sometimes things happen that's very emotional,
but as a coach it's really hard when you see someone go down like that. You
watch your whole season kind of flash before your eyes. And with Candice
having such a spectacular career at Stanford and we want to keep playing. And
our team obviously depends on her a lot. So I was, you just, I think I just
kind of had to kind of pull my heart off the floor for a minute and I ran out
there.  
  
Q. Candice, you're going to play the team that is a number one seed that
maybe you feel look you guys should have or could have gotten. How much
mileage, how much motivation have you got from that throughout this
tournament?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I've been in this situation before where we have felt like we
deserved a one seed my freshman year. And it really comes down to this game.
We can't talk about it. We can't say we should be this or that. This is the
game that's going to prove that. So I think that as a team we're really
focused, we're excited about this and we're just going to play the best game
we can and we're going to play tough and together like we have the whole year.  
  
Q. J.J. you also got knocked down, can you talk about the Pitt game and it
was just a really tough battle for you guys and how that is going to translate
into playing another team that's going to be tenacious.  
J.J. HONES: I feel like earlier in the season like especially in Pac-10 UCLA
was an equally physical team. And yeah, we were on the ground a little bit
more than normal in the game last night, but I felt like our team was prepared
for it. We knew what was coming. We know that in tomorrow's game it could be
equally physical. So I feel like I'm happy we're playing the game that we just
did, because it definitely gets us prepared for anything that they can throw
our way.  
  
Q. Jayne, what do you guys need to be prepared for in terms of Maryland and
what they do?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we really need to pay attention to our scouting report
and to what our coaches are giving us. Really just be focused. I think more on
what we need to do. I think that is, will be a very important thing for us.
Taking the shots that we need to take and being patient and having the focus
that we have had throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. For anybody who wants to tackle it, the Vanderbilt players said they
thought that Maryland resembled Tennessee in terms of their style and their
athleticism. From what you've seen in film or what you've heard about them, is
there anybody on your schedule that Maryland reminds you of?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well I know the Maryland players very well, I played with
three of them several years on teams and I think I have a pretty good feel of
their game. They're incredible players. I think we played Tennessee this year,
we played UCONN and they're right up there with those teams. We know that
they're high caliber, they won a National Championship and we definitely know
that they're a great team.  
  
Q. Candice, last night you guys were the team with all the experience that
had gotten through that round, now you're going against a team where a lot of
the players have passed the Elite 8 and gone to the Final Four and won a
championship. How much of a difference does that make, the fact that they know
how to get past this round and this is the round you guys have not gone past
for awhile.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think it helps a lot having the experience and knowing what
it feels like to get to the Final Four. But it's a game. You have to still
play. Maryland's in the same position we were in last year, losing early, so
they're motivated just as much as we are and I think that its just going to
come down to who wants it more. It's really, you know, experience it means a
lot, but I think that it's just going to be who is hungrier.  
  
Q. For anyone, your coach during this selection show alluded to the fact
that maybe a lot of people don't get to see you play especially for those of
us on the east coast, what are we missing out on not being able to see you
guys play that much on TV?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think there's very quality basketball being played out
on the west coast. I'm from the east coast, and I know that they're definitely
is a lack of exposure. I didn't really know much about Stanford growing up in
Queens and being in high school and I had to do the research to find out that
there's a strong program there, a strong tradition, we have a lot of Pac-10
schools in the tournament. We're physical. More physical than you think. And I
think that there's a lot to be said about finesse too. That's exciting to
watch. And I know I've got -- I'm very lucky to play with a couple of All-
American caliber players and I think that people who haven't seen Candice play
and haven't seen Jayne play would be missing out on something is really
special.  
  
Q. Kayla, Jayne was talking about the fact that she was at the Pan-American
Games, she has seen Humphries, she's been around a lot of the great post
players. You're going to see one of those great post players tomorrow, how are
you preparing for that and what do you think about all that?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well I think that the Pitt game really prepared us for the
physicality of Maryland. I think doubling Cal and Pitt is really going to help
us against Maryland. But just as long as we stay to our scouting report and we
focus on ourselves I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Tara, how much benefit is it that Candice knows some is of these players
really well we really well and that they have crossed paths frequently and
might know each other's game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's going to -- I don't know, I think it's going to
be irrelevant once we're out on the court. But our team listens to Candice.
And I think that if Candice knows firsthand that she plays with Jayne every
day, maybe she is played with Laura Harper, or played with Crystal Langhorne,
played against Marissa, maybe those are the three, you know, if she is
confident, then our team will maybe feel that confidence coming from her. And
from what I've heard from Candice, Candice feels very confident and believes
in her teammates, with Jayne and Kayla and Jill and Roz, J.J., and the rest of
the people that will go in the game.  
So but the fact that they know them and they're friends, that's, that will --
I know from guarding Candice my two minutes in practice that won't matter,
because she will go after anybody.  
  
Q. Tara, you guys were in this position two years ago, how is this group
different from that group that wasn't able to get past LSU that year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that our team, the last, the three years that we
have been to the Elite 8 I'm very proud of all those teams and they have all
done really, really well. I do feel that this team is very different and I
feel really different today. I remember just as an example when after we beat
Oklahoma we were not expected to beat Oklahoma and we were not expected to
beat even though maybe we might have been seeded higher, people were very
surprise that had we would beat Connecticut or beat Vanderbilt. We were a six
seed and we beat a two seed.  
We really have been preparing for being in this position all season long. I
think our team's win at Rutgers let our team know right away, hey, we're going
to play with the big women. Our win against Tennessee, our win against Baylor,
even though we lost some players to our ACLs, everyone else has really rallied
and believed in themselves.  
We did have a bad weekend, but everyone came back and rededicated themselves
and I think that that's where someone like Jayne just said hey, what do I need
to do to help my team. Roz is in the gym more, Candice, J.J., everyone stepped
up their game. So I feel like this team is ready to be in this position and I
just -- we have watched more, we're way ahead of where we have been in past
years in terms of preparation. We have been working for this day and I just
have confidence that our team will come out and give their absolute best
effort.  
THE MODERATOR: For the post players, Kayla or Jayne, both can answer if you
like. Last night you had, you two individually and as a team had an
outstanding rebounding night. Out rebounded Pitt 54-30. Now tomorrow night you
take on a team that's known as fierce rebounders, I think the last couple
seasons maybe the best rebounding team in the country. Just maybe just talk a
little bit about how you go in and rebound with a team like Maryland.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that's definitely a big, it will be a huge part of the
game tomorrow night is who controls the boards. Just I think the first thing
we talked about was rebounding. A lot of teams that play in women's
basketball, they rebound the ball really very well. So it will be extremely
important for us tomorrow to really make that a big focus point.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I feel the same way. I think rebounding is going to be a key
part to this game and winning it.  
I think that if we all box out and don't rely on jumping out jumping people I
think we'll win that margin.  
  
Q. Candice, do you have any soreness or after affects from the foul last
night?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, she kind of got my hand. So it's just my left hand but
it is okay. It's nothing serious.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about you've had 75 points in three tournament games
and the offensively is sort of running through you. Can you just talk about
the success you've had offensively he in the tournament so far and what you
think it means going forward?  
JAYNE APPEL: It would be selfish of me to say that those are my points. But
it's really my teammates points. They're forced to guard Candice on the
outside otherwise she goes off for 44 points. They're forced to guard Roz. She
showed last night she had hit that shot. J.J., you know, we have guards on the
outside that are going to hit that shot. And teams are forced to stop me and
Kayla inside before they can worry about the outside, I think. It's an easier
shot to make a lay up than a 3-point shot. Well at least for me. Maybe not for
Candice, but.  
(Laughter.)  
I think it's very important for me and Kayla to easily establish the inside
and force them to guard us so that our guards have pressure taken off of them
and can just really relax, shoot the ball and have fun. And I think that will
be a big key for us tomorrow is just relaxing and playing ball.  
  
Q. I'm guessing this might be for Rosalyn, talk about Kristi Toliver a
little bit of the she had a great game last night without scoring. What do you
do to slow down her floor game?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Kristi Toliver is an amazing player. We know that
Maryland has a large group of players that are all very talented. We're going
to scout them, we're going to watch video, we're going to try our hardest to
learn what are their tendencies. Is she doing her crossover, or going behind
her back before she usually steps back for that three. So that way you can
help yourself and give yourself the best chance of trying to contain her, stop
her, she's a good passer as well as a shooter. And I think that you just have
to be focused and like Tara says, you also have to have amnesia almost too. So
you can't let any one play get you down. Someone's going to hit shots,
someone's going to make a big play. But know that you can do it on the other
side of the floor and that next time down it's going to be a hard shot that
someone's going to have to make on you.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. They will be going back to the break out room and in
just a moment we'll resume the interview with coach. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you address Jayne's import to you offensively, how important she is
to what you guys do offensively and what you guys do generally?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You've watched us play all season, and the thing about Jayne
and Jayne in some ways can do what Kristi Toliver does. She doesn't have to
score to be really important for our team. But she does score very well.  
We do run our offensively through Jayne. And we do come down and look for
Jayne before we take other perimeter shots for the most part.  
She's a great passer, she's a very intelligent player, she scores well. She
pretty much demands a double. And when teams do that, then she passes out as
you've seen her get like seven assists in a game.  
I think some of it is her size, her hands, her court awareness. The fact that
she's incredibly unselfish, she doesn't care about scoring but she just cares
about winning.  
  
Q. Since 1990 nine schools have won championships but only three of them
have won more than one and you're one of them. In your mind what are the
components to winning more than one championship?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that when you win the first one, for us in 1990 it
was incredibly exciting and then you just, when you have one, then you don't
see it as being impossible. It kind of just looks like this really steep
mountain to get to the top and when you get up there you're like, oh, the
climb wasn't that hard.  
And, but then when you start all over again you're like, whoa, this is hard
again. And I think that having been there as a coach and our whole coaching
staff has been to the Final Four and won a National Championship. I think that
our players kind of just realize it's not impossible and it's do able.  
So I think that having, when you do it once then you feel like well you can do
it again. And it's something that obviously we hope to do another time, but
it's a really special accomplishment and it just to go to the Final Four is
really special. To win a National Championship once would be enough. But once
you get it, I think you just, you want to do it again.  
  
Q. What do you think the pace of the game is going to be the tempo?
Obviously both teams can score, they tend to just seem to run up-and-down the
court. How do you think that's going to play out?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well I think that I'm fine with really any tempo that
happens. We're fine running up and down. We want to run.  
What I find a lot of times is that players I call it kind of uphill/downhill.
People really run faster on offensively and kind of go slower on defense. And
as long as we're running fast on defense, I'll be happy with that tempo.  
But that's going to be our focus is going to be our defense and our
rebounding. Then if we can get out and get some easy baskets or get Jayne on
the block before there's a lot of big crowd there then I'm happy with that.
But we don't want it to be just a flat out kind of run and gun show. For our
team we want to really make sure that we're playing with a purpose and that we
have the shots that we want that we're taking the shots that we want.  
  
Q. Just curious, I saw a story you called Jayne the franchise and you have
Candice Wiggins who is everybody's All-American. Could you elaborate on the
franchise tag you put on her?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I might have happened when she first signed with Stanford or
was first coming to Stanford. But just Candice obviously is an absolute phenom
and I love coaching Candice. But Candice needs Jayne. As just as much as Jayne
needs Candice. We need that inside presence. The big that can move some people
out, can score on the block, that passes as well as she passes. And when you
look at all the teams that are pretty much in it, at the end they always have
some really big physical post players as Maryland has three of them.  
So we're really fortunate to have Jayne, because we can build a team around
her. And as much as we're going to miss Candice next year, which we will miss
her terribly, to have Jayne as a foundation of your team is a great starting
point. She is -- I think she's in a lot of ways the rock to our team. We go to
her and she delivers.  
THE MODERATOR: Looking back and I asked you a question similar to this on
Friday about just coaching for as long as you have, but Coach Berenato of
Pittsburgh talked both yesterday and the day before about just the growth of
women's basketball and how important it is and thanked the writers and you
started down south in Moscow, Idaho and now an at Stanford, just kind of
curious from the AIAW tournament at Idaho to here today, just what you've seen
in growth in the sport.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that we have always had very talented female
athletes and what we have now is more opportunity for them to play and improve
and grow and do things that some of them never got a chance to do. With
scholarships, with basketball camps, with so many summer teams and high school
tournaments, I just think sports is just besides being so much fun, I think
it's very valuable to the experience of both young men and young women. And we
have seen a boom, but we also know that we have a very, very long way to go.  
We just -- I'm really thankful that I work at a university that values women,
that values women's opportunity to play and we just -- I love my job and I
just, I can't even, sometimes I'm just really thankful that I wake up every
day as a basketball coach. Especially this morning. It felt really good.  
  
Q. Sort of dovetail off that, are there structural things that the game
needs? One two or three things that this sport could use to sort of move it
up, move it forward?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Tell me your first name again.  
  
Q. Milton Kent.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Milton, that's an excellent question. You know, I don't
pretend to have the crystal ball for basketball, but I think that a lot of the
leadership in the NCAA, women's basketball, that this is a great tournament
and the NCAA puts on a first class tournament just like here and we talked
last night about how the number of people coming out and watching is great and
I hope we have a great tournament out tomorrow night.  
But I think that it's really important if there were things to do, I would say
institutionally that each place, whether it's Stanford or universities to
really value the experience for women as much as they do for men. To put the
resources and put the focus and give the women the same opportunities to have
great competition, to have great coaching, and to really grow the game. That
would be I think institutionally we should do that.  
And I think that across the country you see different places, different
pockets really promoting and really working hard to make women's basketball a
big time sport. Which I think it should be. That would be my first kind of
idea.  
I think another thing is that to get away from kind of east coast, west coast.
I see it in so many things like we play east coast style and women's
basketball is going to be better when everyone is included in the
conversation. That in fact it's that women's basketball is great nationally.
And not just this conference or that conference. And to get away from also the
kind of a labeling of well this is the best player and this is a best program,
but that there's more depth and breadth to the excellence of women's
basketball. And then I just think that my third thing would be to really work
on developing coaches that really make it a quality experience for student-
athletes. That we don't get into just pressure, the pressure of coaches to win
or not to lose their jobs, and that they don't make it a quality experience
for the student-athletes.  
I think that their experience should be the number one thing. And, yes, I am
proving, but, and yes, you want to win as a coach, but really the education
and mentoring of young women and more women in women's basketball.  
  
Q. If I can follow-up the last part up particularly. Is it possible though
as more money comes to the sport and more demands come to coaches, obviously
there are more high six figure, more seven figure contracts coming, can a
coach really afford to spend the time sort of making the experience better
when the principal function seems to be now to win?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think the salaries of coaches should dictate the
experience of the student-athletes. I think that I do think that it would be
great to see improving salaries across the country for coaches, women's
coaches and not have the disparity between men's and women's coaches and
that's a whole discussion about maybe separate discussion there, but I think
that the experience for both men and women and the college and high school, we
do set the, we do set the tone a little bit. People come and watch our
practices and people watch games and see our behavior and I think that
modeling good behavior and mentoring young women should be the focus of our
job, not just winning games. That the, just the winning should not be
everything.  
And I think it's do able. But I think that it will take, it takes, I don't
know, some strong leadership, whether it's in the NCAA or institutionally, and
people really saying that this is important. That the student-athlete's
experience is the key ingredient in the whole.  
  
Q. To develop the game, women have 15 scholarships, men have 13. That
probably plays a role in more Mid Majors or more upsets among the men. Is that
something that the women should consider or is Title IX make that
impossible?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You mean like having fewer scholarships?  
  
Q. Yeah, so the talent is spread out again farther so there's more
interest.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a good question too. And in some ways in a
lot of programs you don't use all 15 scholarships. And a lot of programs I
think actually abuse kind of male practice players and the number of guys in
practice and if you make a mistake on a recruit, they're not practicing,
you're playing against guys every day. But we do have is a real high inches
dense of ACL injuries that like on every team you can find I'm sure at least
one and maybe two. And that's in women's basketball and not in men's
basketball.  
So we could probably work it with 14. And like right now we only have really
11 healthy players, but I think that somewhat based on injury and if you
didn't then you would have less opportunities for women and more male practice
players.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach. Thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We got into philosophy here. Dang, I got to just think about
Maryland.  
(Laughter.)

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement by
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, I just really loved our defensive intensity and our
hustle throughout the game. And I thought that we came out really inspired and
wanted to come out and play as aggressive and focused as we could from the
defensive end. And just a credit to this team. We were excited. We were ready
to come out and play some of our best basketball, and I thought that we did
just a tremendous job on the offensive end as well. The unselfishness that we
displayed, being able to get the ball inside, being able to be aggressive and
then being unselfish with each and every play that we made. And a credit to
this team, also a credit to Vanderbilt, I thought they played really scrappy
and were a tremendous team.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Any of you, can you remember the last time you guys played confidently
and as dominantly as you did from start to finish?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I have a bad memory, so I'll use that. I can't remember.
It's probably one of our best games, but I'm not sure exactly when it was.
We're just happy we're playing like that right now.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: I also have a bad memory. But a game that really sticks in my
mind, it probably wasn't the last game but a great game that we had was
against LSU and against Oklahoma. I think we played tremendously from start to
finish, all 40 minutes. And I think that we executed the game plan. We played
loose and free, and that's exactly what we did tonight. So I think you can
compare those two games.  
  
Q. Marissa, can you talk or Kristi, can you talk about the contributions
Marah had coming with those 3s early on?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think she played great today. She had been struggling in
our past couple games and I think she came up big for us. She hit key 3s for
us when they were going on their runs, and I think a few of her 3s were
definitely demoralizing for them and daggers in their hearts and got us going.  
  
Q. Kristi, did you make a concerted effort coming into tonight to feed the
post and maybe not take your shot because you didn't take a shot until like
the last minute of the first half.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Not consciously. I know that we always go inside and out. We
have the best post players in the country, and we were just trying to
distribute to everybody. And everybody today was -- I felt like Tom Brady.  
(Laughter.)  
Everybody was just connecting. And we had great chemistry, and everybody was
executing offensively for the game plan. So I just had a lot of fun just
seeing them succeed and finish plays.  
  
Q. Crystal, you guys look especially inspired. Does it even cross your mind
before games like this that any of these games could be your last?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: You can't help but think about it being a senior. I think
that's what our senior class thinks about a lot. Any game could be our last
and we just want to go out there and play hard every minute we're out there
because you never know when it's going to be your last few plays.  
  
Q. Marissa, you guys talked about playing good defense before but this is
the first time in a long time you really played great defense. What led to
that tonight?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think just listening to different people in the media,
watching ESPN, and us not really being the talk of things and mainly because
of our defense. So I know from us talking we just wanted to make a conscious
effort to go out there and get stops. Especially from the guard's end we
struggled with our perimeter defense a lot this season, and I think tonight it
was 1 through 5. Whoever was in the game we communicated well, and we executed
our game plan and got stops after stops.  
  
Q. Kristi, do you always smile when somebody fumbles a pass and misses an
assist for you?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: You know, that was something I consciously wanted to do today.
I wanted to smile for 40 minutes. And they're not going to make them all, and
I think that today I wanted to work on my mistake response and not get so
negative and not get so down, not scowl because these guys are watching me.
And if they're watching me smiling when they're missing, of course I'm going
to smile when they make it. And I think that gives them the extra confidence
to go up and finish plays.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: It does.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: I know it does.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: All right. They will go to the locker room, and we'll hear from
Coach Frese.  
  
Q. Laura's defense in particular, I know she got in some foul trouble, but
it looked like she was really playing some of her best. Can you talk about her
performance tonight?  
COACH FRESE: I thought given the limited minutes that she played because of
the foul trouble, she was really the energy and the spark on the defensive end
and I think you could see that even at times when she had to go out because of
the foul trouble just what she brings to the table and I thought she was huge,
especially with her play against Wirth, she's very talented and I thought that
Laura made her work for everything tonight.  
  
Q. Marissa mentioned not being the talk of things and I guess no one has
been really talking about Maryland winning it this whole thing. Do you think
maybe they might start talking about you now?  
COACH FRESE: I hope not. I love it right where it's at. It remind me of two
years ago and it's just amazing that you can continue to dismiss this team
32-3 and not see the positives of how this team plays.  
Obviously they're a tremendously talented offensive team and we rebound the
ball extremely well. But I hope it just continues right along the path that
it's been. I think that's, we work better that way.  
  
Q. Christie's game, especially the first half, how impressed were you with
how she was distributing the ball?  
COACH FRESE: I thought she was a floor general for us. Really set the tone.
And just her presence her poise, being able to get the ball to the amount of
touches that she was able to get inside for Crystal was really key in terms of
our overall game.  
  
Q. How reliable has Crystal been for you guys down the stretch?  
COACH FRESE: Oh, I mean, Crystal's obviously our go to player. The fact that
any pass you throw in there she's going to catch and I thought really it was
as physical as it was inside she was able to make so many plays and obviously
it's no secret she's our go to player inside.  
  
Q. You only had one point from your bench, is that a concern?  
COACH FRESE: Well I think that any time we have obviously been able to get
great energy. And in any game it's different. To be able to see the energy
that we were able to get from Jade in this game and obviously the last game
from Ashleigh, but it's all kind of related at times and from our end when you
look at the talent that we have the media time outs are about five minutes
long and in the tournament, so I just really felt today in the flow, we were
well rested, and just that's why really why our starters played so many
minutes.  
  
Q. Couple of the players said yesterday that they felt the pressure was off
after having getting through the first week. Did you sense that they were a
little more relaxed?  
COACH FRESE: I could sense it from our last game at home against Nebraska,
just the relief that we had. And just coming out here we have had great
practices leading up to this and I definitely think that like you see tonight,
just from our end, being able to play so freely makes a big difference in our
play.  
  
Q. How important was the last five minutes of the first half. You let
Nebraska back in the game the other night and it seemed like you put your foot
on the gas?  
COACH FRESE: We talked about it. We didn't want to lose our focus and we
wanted to play, obviously, a complete 20 minutes when we were out there. And
we really talked about it in that last time out and just great to be able to
see the focus and the intensity that we had on the defensive end.  
  
Q. There was some people saying that Vanderbilt kind of reminded them of you
two years ago. Young, kind of nothing to lose and playing hard. Do you think
that gave your team a little bit of focus knowing what they were going through
so they didn't let them play that way tonight?  
COACH FRESE: Our team respects every opponent that we play and we could really
tell on film we knew how well coached Vanderbilt was. How their team is, I
mean just played very scrappy like you saw tonight and we don't want to
underestimate anyone and this team won't. Not with the pride that we have and
with what we're playing for.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. That will conclude the interview. Thank you, cope.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.

### [Shavonte Zellous](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18451)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BERENATO: Just like to congratulate Stanford. I thought they just did a
great job and they really I think took it to us on the inside. And the
rebounding was a huge factor in the game. And we were out rebounded by 24. And
that had a lot to do with the size of Appel and Pedersen. So congratulations
to them and I wish them the best of luck as they continue on their questions
to a National Championship.  
At the same time, I just want to say just how proud I am of my team and of the
university of Pittsburgh. And I think that, it was a great honor to be in the
NCAA but we didn't just settle, we just weren't happy to be in the NCAA. We
felt like we could really he do some damage and I just think that what the
seniors have done, Marcedes and Mallorie and what they have done, it's just
been great and Shavonte Zellous, she's an awesome player and she's a great
teammate, she really took the team on her back tonight and I thought that you
could see some of her explosiveness and she's charismatic on the court.  
And I thought Mallorie Winn really stepped up and just did a great job.  
So for what these ladies have done for the university of Pittsburgh and for
the people of Pittsburgh, for our Chancellor and Steve and Carol and Don and
our community. We're a hard working community, I think I mentioned that the
other day and they bring their lunch pail and their hard hat pretty much every
day and I just can't say enough about them.  
Again, to the seniors, they were just, they're a pleasure. I don't look at it
as that they're leaving or our season is over for them it's just beginning.
And really that's what an education is all about. I think they will have great
a careers and for Shavonte we have next year and we'll start working and I
wish we could play another game tomorrow. We definitely, I definitely my staff
Jeff, Caroline and Shay, we want to thank them.  
We're not ready for this to be over. So to everybody involved but especially
to my team, it's just a hell of a group of girls and ladies and you know what
they're going to be community changers. They're life changing people. And I'm
really proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcedes, how tough of a matchup was Appel inside and then the second
part of that they seemed to double down on you a lot and it didn't seem like
you guys were ever able to figure out how to get the offense going out of that
double team.  
MARCEDES WALKER: She's a really good player. I knew coming into this game she
was a really good player and I knew I was going to have to play a strong game.
She had the best of me. And as for like the double team, we knew that they
were going to double and that was a lot that we were working on in practice,
so we were expecting them to double, it was just that we couldn't, I didn't
hit any shots and I wasn't aggressive on the double team and I tried to kick
it back out and stuff like than just re-post but we wasn't able to get it
going.  
  
Q. Shavonte, can you just talk about what it was like to kind of engage in a
game like that, especially in the first half when it was so close and where
you felt like it got away.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: In the first half it was close. I think that the second half
it was close too. They just, we let them get away from us. I think that they
by them off offensive rebounding and put backs, the things like that, we let
it slip through our hands and that's how they got away from us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about at one point it was 49-46 with about seven and a half
left and you took out both Zellous and Walker. And that's what when the game
got away a little bit. They went on a run. How hard was it to see that happen
under those circumstances, I guess.  
COACH BERENATO: Well, it was very hard and you know, Walker had four fouls.
And Shavonte, she rarely, rarely, rarely, I mean rarely asks for a breather.
And she had asked for a breather and it just happened that Marcedes had picked
up her fourth foul so we just felt like we thought that we used a time out, we
thought that would be good enough. But I just thought that they really
exploited the inside on us. I thought that then we rest a couple sets probably
took some ill advised shots, missed, didn't get the rebound, then went down
and they connected and I thought that they scored the two plus one and then
the very next time down the court they penetrated, we had like three great
stops and on the rotation they kicked it out to the wing and they hit that
three. And I thought that that was a dagger we got Tay Tay right back and they
came right back down and she hit, the same girl hit the shot again, you know,
a three. And I felt at that like that was really tough to overcome and then it
was nine points and we really we just didn't chip it away after that to be
honest with you.  
I thought that really up until about two and a half minutes to go it was a
three possession ball game four possession ball game and that's a reasonable
ball game. We pressed them and I thought that we surprised them with that. But
their size really hurt us. I thought that, um, you know, they just they really
exploited us on the inside.  
  
Q. Coming into the game did you ever imagine that they would have such an
edge in the rebounding department, really physically dominate you the way they
did?  
COACH BERENATO: I knew their size. They start two six four kids and so we have
really felt that Pedersen was going to be the difference maker to be honest
with you. We felt like my kid is five nine and that starts at the four spot so
she was somebody that we were really worried about. But we thought maybe we
could out physical them and I did think in the first half I thought it was a
tremendous game it was really a physical game, it was a fun game, it was a
great game, and the first 13 minutes of the second half, so you look at 33
minutes and then like I said, you know, I felt like if we could just keep
going at them, go at them, just attack and maybe we could wear them down.  
But actually it was the reverse. And I thought they just did a great job of
just running their splits, running their sets, running their curls and they
just dominated us on the inside. Dribble penetration as well as just both
Pedersen and Appel on the flares and the handoffs.  
  
Q. I know it's tough to look at the whole season after a game like this, but
can you put into perspective what the team accomplished this year and do you
think you were maybe even a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of where the
program is?  
COACH BERENATO: Yes, I think I can put it into perspective where the team is.
And it's not hard for me to think about it after a loss because winning and
losing is part of it. That's just the way it is. I did not think that we would
be sitting here as the losers tonight. We really felt into our heart and soul
we were distinguishing to make it to the Elite 8 and have the opportunity to
play. But I feel like I enjoy every moment. And I try to make the team and the
staff aware of everything that we have accomplished along the way.  
I'm not real good at like strolling down memory lane. I don't have a very good
memory. I don't remember who I met five minutes ago, so that's in the past.
But I do really think that I really live for today and I enjoy everything and
every minute of what we do. And I feel like it was great year for us. We tied
our record number of wins with 24, which is what we got last year. We beat I
think five or six Top-25 teams. Which is a record. We beat a team in the
Top-10 when Notre Dame was number nine in the country. We got our first Top-20
away win, which was DePaul, January 6, and we beat them by 30. We beat West
Virginia who was 13th in the country, we beat Baylor who was just a national
name.  
But more importantly I think we have three seniors -- that Mallorie has
already graduated. And Marcedes and Karlyle will graduate in April. And
Shavonte will also graduate as you know she's a junior. And these people are
just such wonderful people. And I think probably the most important thing that
we have done and I always say winning is great, but losing like the highs of
winning are not as low as the lows of losing. And it's hard to lose. But I
don't think that we are losers. Tonight it was a double win for Pittsburgh.
And I know some people might go, oh, that's so contrite or that's so whatever,
but I really believe that. Because I feel like Pitt women's basketball has
been embraced by the community. And has been embraced by the community of
Pittsburgh as well as the university.  
And I think that five years ago that's something that my staff and I, we were
brought here to do. We were brought here to be healers and I think it's about
people, it's about the story, and if you look at the stories of the kids on my
team, it's so much more important and so much more valuable than pick and roll
or a 1, 3, 1, nobody's more devastated than me for losing. But at the same
time I think that we really he need to keep it in perspective and I think the
university and I think the community and this team has really a lot to be
proud of.  
THE MODERATOR: All right.  
COACH BERENATO: I'm just going to say before we leave. Okay. I probably have
another minute, right.  
THE MODERATOR: You got four or five.  
COACH BERENATO: Damn. All right.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH BERENATO: Well let me -- no, I'm just kidding. Just, I just want to say
to the NCAA, and I really I guess I really he can't see back there, but I
don't really he know who is here but NCAA and to the people of Spokane, you
guys have done a tremendous job just in hosting and you have embraced us. And
to my host family, John and Karen, you guys are awesome and I'm sure you're in
the audience somewhere. And Ray and Kevin, coming out here from Pittsburgh and
to the other writers, if you guys don't write about our story, our story never
grows. And as the NCAA they, we're the NCAA. We represent them. And women's
basketball is the greatest story in the world. And they're great student-
athletes. And they're kind and they're gentle women and they care and they're
great volunteers and they're just hard working kids and so I just want to say
to everybody that's here, the auxiliary people that have helped with this,
with facilities and travel and security and catering and I know all about it,
because when I was at Georgia tech I hosted two Final Fours and at Pitt we
hosted a regional last year.  
And then just a special shout out to our Chancellor and Steve Petersen and my
staff, you know, who has really changed the face of women's basketball at the
University of Pittsburgh. I feel like that is team now, it's a team that
people will recognize and they have worked hard for it and they brought great
pride to the university as well as to the community. But we could have never
done it if my staff and the community and the administration didn't jump on
board.  
So to all of you that are here tonight, it's late somewhere, in the world, and
I just want to say it's like the saying it's five o'clock somewhere. Well, I
just want to say on behalf of my team, thank you all very much because by you
being here our sport will grow and grow and grow and all these NCAA events
will be sold out in the future. So thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach thank you.

## March 29, 2008

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Jennifer Risper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18063)

### [Christina Wirth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16901)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then go to
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BALCOMB: I'm just really proud of this team. I think their improvement
over the season has been amazing. I just, I feel bad for them not playing to
the level they have been playing for the last two months.  
We didn't give it our best effort. Maryland's a great team. We got so good
defensively and just didn't come out with that intensity and dictate and got
down against too good of a team to really come back.  
But we fought back and I'm really proud of the way we handled ourselves in the
second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How did Maryland compare to Tennessee or LSU?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I guess to Tennessee they would compare, they're really good
in transition, a really good offensive team. I thought they did a good job
with their switching man. And then LSU just with their switching man and just
being aggressive, being physical down low, that's how they would compare to
those teams.  
  
Q. Do you think they can compete with them?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Yes, definitely. I definitely believe that they can compete
with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about offensively it was a struggle to get some things
going it looked like and especially from long distance for yourself. Were they
doing something special with you?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: Like Jennifer said, they were switching every time on pretty
much all their screens, so I didn't get very many open looks. The ones I did
have I just didn't knock down, and that happens.  
I think that all year we prided ourself on our defense, and that's how we win
games. Every team's going to have a night where they struggle shooting the
ball and you can't rely on that. And tonight we just didn't get it done on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. For both of you, talk about the year in general, what you felt like you
accomplished and what you're looking forward to in the future.  
JENNIFER RISPER: Kind of like what Coach said. We have come a long way. Just
in the beginning of our season with one of our first losses to Indiana State
if you look back and you see where we came defensively, offensively, we just
formed together as a team on and off the court. We worked a lot harder as the
season went on. Even last year just making it this far to the Sweet 16 that's
just an amazing accomplishment in itself.  
So I guess I just would say that we came a long way from the beginning of the
season, and we have definitely added. We know where we want to be next year.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: We did great. We have come a long way. We have had a lot of
adversity, and I think that it's made us stronger as a team. I think a lot of
times when they face adversity they start to sort of go their separate ways,
and that definitely wasn't the case with us, and I'm proud of our team. I
think that our young players stepped up. And something that we talked about in
the locker room was next year we're not going to be a young team, we're going
to have a lot of players with a lot of experience, and we're just going to
remember this feeling and build on it next year.  
THE MODERATOR: All right we'll excuse them to the locker room and take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I asked the players about Tennessee, because the Maryland side of things
they feel like they have been kind of left out of the discussion about who was
going to get to the final. Do you think this is a potential finals team?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, I guess so. I haven't watched any of the other teams. I
have been preparing for Maryland.  
  
Q. You played Tennessee three times this year. Are they comparable to
Tennessee?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah. I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about their offensive efficiency. It seemed like they
got it inside with Crystal and then enough outside game Toliver, just the
aspects you have to deal with when you're guarding them.  
COACH BALCOMB: Toliver handles the ball extremely well. She just has a really
good sense of the game. I think it was really tough for our guards with our
matchup with the different defenses, switching man, everything, we had so many
different people on her, but she is really, she really reads the game very,
very well and is extremely confident, and she can change speeds and take you
off the dribble, penetrate and dunk to those posts.  
I think also getting 42 points inside in the paint was really something that
hurt us. We gave Langhorne, a really, really deep position inside and again,
that not dictating, but it's really hard to stop because of that balance where
they have a great guard, all their other guards can shoot it and spread the
floor and then you got Langhorne inside. That's a tremendous post player to
have down there. So they have all the pieces to the puzzle offensively, and I
think that's why they're so dominating on the offensive side.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you saw the second half that you liked. What did
you try to do at half time, and what kind of response did you get from your
team?  
COACH BALCOMB: I just think our effort was a lot better on both ends of the
floor. Especially crashing the offensive boards, finding other ways to score,
instead of just shooting the 3. Down the stretch we had to shoot the 3 and
couldn't make them, but attacking the basket, getting to the free throw line
more, crashing the offensive boards. And even defensively I thought we did a
better job. We went back to a lot of our matchups, and we did a better job
keeping them in front. They still really hurt us on offensive rebounding and
checking out.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the season, where you came from and where you finished
and what you're looking forward to?  
COACH BALCOMB: I'm really I think the best word is just very, very proud of a
team that I think has, like said earlier, they have come farther than any team
I've ever coached. And we were not a very good team early in the season. And
since December they just really bought on to our vision as a staff and as
leaders. They really stepped up. The two ladies next to me as juniors stepped
up as leaders, and then the team stepped up with them, and they have worked
extremely hard.  
They paid the price to get here. They gave us everything they had, and they
bought on to a lot of changes in roles. And accepted those roles, and I just
loved seeing the freshmen grow, the team grow closer as a team, and people
being willing to get out of their comfort zone so that they were able to grow.
And that's hard for 18 to 22 year olds to do. And I just, when I see players
do that, I just enjoy coaching them.  
And I told them in the locker room, I had more fun than I've had in a long
time coaching a team because in the last month they just, they were so easy to
coach because you could coach and teach you didn't have to motivate. They
already were extremely self motivated, they owned it, they took ownership of
the team, they led each other and they worked their tails off. And so they
were exactly where we wanted them to be.  
We didn't have the size and strength to matchup with Tennessee and Maryland,
but we didn't lose to anybody that wasn't bigger and stronger and more
athletic in the last three months. And in fact we beat a lot of teams that
were bigger, stronger and more athletic. And that's what we mean by over
achieving.  
  
Q. How much do you chalk up to their defense or just an off shooting night
for you guy guys on the offense?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think they did a good job defensively. I always give credit
to people that can make us take tough shots and they got us out of their flow
by switching on a lot of screens. We did have looks and against a team and I
said this every time we played great teams at the next level, that are Elite 8
and Final Four teams, you have to make shots. And we had shots, but I do think
that they did a good job being extremely physical, but we had to make shots
and didn't knock down shots that we usually make.  
And we're not a great offensive rebounding team, so we're a team that really
has to not only do you have to play great defense, but against these teams,
but you got to make shots.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. With that, coach, the interview's completed. Thank
you very much.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you very much.

### [Candice Wiggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18463)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought our team really had to battle. It wasn't pretty,
but I thought it was a very physical game and I was really proud of how our
team stepped up. Pittsburgh has some really talented players. Zellous had a
great game for them. I thought Roz really worked hard especially in the second
half. We did a much better job defensively. We didn't give them transition
shots, first half we gave them too many transition baskets.  
I thought we did a great job on Walker. What did she end up with? I don't have
a stat sheet. 2. Okay. So I thought the we did a great job on her. Jayne
really finished well, did a good job at the free throw line. They were a very,
they're an athletic team, they let them play tonight, and I think that that is
all in our favor for Monday night and I'm really excited that we'll be playing
Monday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, you guys, there was a long stretch where you really couldn't put
them away. Go up by seven and then they would get back into it. With a can you
kind of describe that second half and sort of that the way the game was
going.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think it's in tournament time it's everything
changes. The pace of the game, the intensity is just up. Everyone knows what's
at stake. So I think that was probably a cause as to why we couldn't get a run
or get a lead going.  
But I think that maybe halfway through the half the second half we all looked
at each other and we just stayed together. We stayed tough. We never quit on
each other. I think that's why we were able to pull away is we stayed
together.  
  
Q. Candice, did you break anything and Jayne, if you could talk a little bit
about the inside play and did they let stuff go and was it pretty rough?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: No. I did not break anything.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think in the tournament it's always a lot more physical than a
normal season game. I think we had a, she was a big challenge inside for us
guarding Walker. And by matchup I was matched up on her, but really it was a
team effort in stopping her a hundred percent. It was everyone doubling down
and knowing what they were doing on the outside.  
  
Q. What about offensively for you? Were they leaning on you more or more
physical for you?  
JAYNE APPEL: We have had physical games all year and in the Pac-10 we have Cal
with those two and they're just as big and there's two of them, so we have
gone against it in past games, but they definitely were very physical inside.  
  
Q. Can any of the girls talk about at one point I think it was like 7:45
left you were up 49-46 and they pulled out both Zellous and Walker and it
seems like that's where you went on a run and took control of the game. How
important was that time right there?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think that was a very important time for us
offensively. We really went on a run, we were able to O board. I think that
was a time where usually we were executing our offense, defensively, we had
game plans whether Zellous was in or wasn't, we had strategic plans for both
of those situations. And I think we really worked hard and came together to
execute those plans and in both of those situations. And I think we definitely
did take advantage of it. And again, as Candice said, it was really the second
half, I mean people came off the bench staying stay tough and together. Let's
get this going. People wanted this win. It wasn't just everybody on the court,
it was everyone. So that was a stretch where I think the whole team came
together. And that's what made that special.  
  
Q. You hit a couple of big shots right after they pulled close and you
seemed pretty assertive tonight. Were you looking to take open shots when you
had them?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I would like to thank my teammates for really and my
coach, even in shoot around people are saying positive things to me. That
helps. And honestly, my success really comes from the fact that we have such
great great players like January and I Candice and that's just the honest
truth. Because people have to pick them up. People have to pay attention to
them. And that's what I'm in the gym working for, those opportunities when
everybody's paying tense to them and I get my shot and I'm ready to knock it
down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they were doing to you defensively, you didn't
even take a shot until midway through the first half and after coming off that
huge game the other night did you get frustrated at all or did you know that
the other ones would come through?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well we knew that they were going to to focus in on us. I
think it was pretty clear that they're not going to want me to score 44 points
again. So I was really working to be patient and not force shots and not and
my teammates eye, I didn't even really need to shoot. Everyone was doing
really well. So I was looking to get Jayne looks on the block and I think
everyone was knocking down shots, so it wasn't really a necessity. So I wasn't
really frustrated or anything like that.  
  
Q. I know you were asked about your shooting, but to me it was sort of a
complete game and I think even the five fouls should how aggressive you were.
You were doing Candice Wiggins kind of rebounds underneath and everything.
Were you possessed tonight or what was going on?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think during half time we were up, but we were up one
point and I thought about what it would be like to, I honestly thought about
what it would be like to come back here and everybody is going to be like I
should've, I could've, I would've, and I think that was definitely feeling I
brought the out in the second half that I don't, I didn't want to have that
kind of a conversation with my teammates or with myself.  
And defensively, Zellous is a very good player, she came out in the first half
and really did very well. And I took that personally. Jeanette took that
personally and we worked really hard and I got most of my fouls in the second
half but I think I frustrated her and I know she scored a lot less. So that
was my main contribution to my team.  
  
Q. A little bit of inspiration from Cuba Gooding talking to you guys.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: So Cuba and I --  
(Laughter.)  
No, so, anyway, -- anyway we were going it was a couple of us heading
downstairs to get something to eat and we saw Cuba in the bar. We weren't in
the bar you but we saw him. And anyway he came up to, he had already spoken to
the team came in, spoke to a couple of the people who were in the room with
Tara, we do an inspirational movie theme for every game. And Men of Honor was
a the team for the game four. And so he was in that movie and we told him that
and he was very excited about it. And then I ran into him at the bar and we
had a little conversation random about McDonalds and I brought him back a
fillet of fish.  
  
Q. Did he pay you back for it?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I said it was on me, don't sweat it, Cuba.  
(Laughter.). For real.  
  
Q. Did you have to leave a ticket for him?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: He's filming tonight. I got his cell though. -- no. I
don't.  
(Laughter.)  
CANDICE WIGGINS: No questions about that any more. Get the mic away.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about we'll ask you this tomorrow, but can you, I
know it's too early to even ask this, but Monday, Maryland, a lot of big
bodies, any thoughts to what that's going to be like?  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't think it's ever too early. We're already talking about
them in our locker room, getting a scouting report after the game. Waiting for
the 30 minutes of media to start. So we have already started. We have been
looking forward to this game a lot. We know it's going to be physical. Tara
kind of gave credit to Pitt saying they're getting us ready he for Monday with
how physical they were.  
I think we're just going to come out and try and do what Stanford does.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting Walker out of the game and how it seemed to
frustrate her, that she wasn't able to get going offensively and then she
picked up some early fouls. It seemed like your team really fed off that.  
JAYNE APPEL: Well I think that our coach told us before when we were scouting
them that in games that she's scored I think it was 10 or less, they haven't
won. So I kind of made that a goal of mine to always make sure I was doing my
part in stopping her. And I knew my teammates would do their part also.  
I think that that was our main focus on defense. Definitely her and Zellous.
So making sure that she didn't score and getting her in foul trouble, that is
really it kind of hurts their team because she's a big part of their offense.
So that was really important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you go back to the locker room now. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about offensively the difference between the first half and
for your team and the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought that in our, our team wanted this game very badly.
I thought in the first half we really weren't able to establish any flow
offensively and I thought that, I mean they were really all over Candice and
the physical nature of the game is different than what we have played in in
the last games.  
I think that it kind of, it kind accounted for some of our maybe bad timing
and I thought that some people were trying to make some plays that really
weren't there. And we tried to do a couple of those in the second half too.
But once we kind of got in a little flow and I really think Roz was really so
huge for with her hitting some shots and her really playing as well as she
did, she really took a lot of pressure off of Candice. And also off of J.J..
and then I think things kind of went from there. When she kind of got going
and she was so into it, I think that was really the key for us.  
  
Q. Like I asked the girls, how important was that stretch when they took
Zellous and Walker out of the game a little over 7:30 minutes left and your
girls made a couple big plays. I think I think you went on a 7-0 run. Did you
feel the tide turn right there?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There was a time in the second half where when Walker went
out I thought, well, I'll get Jayne out and give her a little rest. But then
she went back in and they're a different team without Walker in the game in
the same way that we're a different team without Jayne in the game.  
I'm not sure why both of them went out. But when you have your two best
players on the bench, I really tried, I try never to take Candice and Jayne
out together. But we did take advantage of that a little bit. The women on our
team really responded I thought really well.  
THE MODERATOR: One quick look at the stat sheet out rebounding 55-30, that
seems like maybe the ball game kind of in a nutshell there.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We did talk about rebounding being really key. And just I
think you could get a sense from our team that this was really important. And
they played really hard for each other and just to battle and to not back down
when a team really took it at them and I was, I really was afraid when I saw
Candice get hit, but I think the other, just the physical game will really
help us to go for Monday night and hopefully beyond.  
  
Q. Maryland has a lot of players left over from their 2006 National
Championship team. Does the difference in tournament experience concern you at
all heading into Monday?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think at this point it does. We'll have a very good
sense of what we need to do against them and they have a very good sense of
what they will need to do against us. But I think our team is playing very
well. People are very excited to play with and for each other. And I think
it's going to be a great battle on Monday night.  
Both of our teams have a lot of really positive tournament experience. Maybe
the fact that we haven't gone to the Final Four will work for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach, thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Sure.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from the coach and then take questions.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, us an all know, we're very excited to be here.
Our season feels like it's gone really fast. I just, it's hard to believe that
we could only play a possibility of four more games. And we just really want
to put everything on the floor and I thought we had a really good game against
UTEP, I thought we played well against Cleveland State, we're playing with a
lot of momentum. Actually, finishing the Pac-10 tournament and the feeling in
the locker room is that they just people want to just keep playing together.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Pittsburgh hasn't been to this game before in their program's history,
your program has, but most of your players haven't, because you're start ago
fairly young lineup. Does experience matter at this point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that experience can help you. The fact that maybe
just even all the different routines of the NCAA, practices, it is exciting.
But having players that have been here before I think can show some of the
younger players make them feel comfortable. A lot of it is seeing yourself
being successful at this level and hoping to go beyond.  
  
Q. When I team like Pittsburgh plays Connecticut twice in one year, even
though it was lopsided losses, how much does that prepare them for this type
of competition and especially maybe playing a program that maybe runs a
similar style of offense to yours. Do you think that can help them even if
they were pretty much blowouts?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that Pittsburgh has had a great season. They do play
in, they do play excellent competition, whether it's on -- the Big East played
a double round robin, so did Pittsburgh play like Notre Dame place, Rutgers
twice?  
  
Q. No, but they met Connecticut twice because of the Big East tournament.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Okay. So but I think that they have played really good
competition. I don't know that our style and Connecticut's style is really
similar. I think that they play a lot more extended defensively or they play a
different defense, but the fact that they have played against really good
talent and really good teams I think it's a plus. And we have done the same
thing. Playing Connecticut, playing Tennessee, playing Rutgers, a lot of the
same teams you're talking about. I feel that the competition that we have had
in our conference a lot of people feel that it hasn't prepared us, but in a
lot of ways I think it has prepared us for the tournament.  
But to answer your question directly, I think that Pittsburgh's here for a
reason. They're prepared and they have some really talented players and
they're playing really well right now.  
  
Q. You guys, your players and you have talked a little bit about how the
pressure's of playing at home. Last two games at home in the tournament and
how in a way that can be a little bit of a disadvantage and now that you're on
the road, it's a chance to kind of bond and all this stuff. Have you guys
started getting into that, that sort of road trip coming together getting
really getting down to business kind of thing?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think one of the things for us hosting like hosting at
home, we hosted, Maryland hosted, when you're at home for us this year one of
the things that was really great for us was that our team was finished with
their finals. We did have people stay in a hotel just for the Friday, Saturday
and Sunday in preparation for the games. And I think that having kind of
having the separation and having the focus helped us this past week end.  
Being up here we just got here last night, but my sense is that people are,
there's really a very comfortable, they're excited to be with each other, they
enjoy spending time with each other. They're just, you're in the meal room and
people are, there's a lot of laughing and very relaxed. And when we're at
practice, we're very focused there. And they know that it's a one game show.
And I just feel like our team doesn't want to waste maybe how well we have
played lately. Having played well against UTEP, having played well against
Cleveland State, played well in the Pac-10 tournament, finishing strong and
just really wanting a crack at some of the teams that maybe we played earlier
in the season and play them again.  
  
Q. For those of us who aren't familiar with Candice, can you share a little
bit about who she is on and off the court a little bit?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, we're really fortunate at Stanford to have a player of
Candice's physical talent and physical ability. But that only really scratches
the surface in terms of what she does for our team and who she is and our
program.  
Candice came on as a freshman and she basically the first day of practice in
my mind she practiced like the Olympians that I had worked with. She practices
hard, she's very intense. I made the mistake of trying to guard her in a drill
and she jammed my finger. I mean, it doesn't matter who is guarding her or
whatever, she goes really hard and she has, she I think the number one thing
is she's extremely competitive, she really is very dedicated and very
committed and she's very focused.  
The off the court -- just in terms of a player, she can shoot, she can
rebound, she can defend, she's very unselfish -- but off the court she just is
kind of like all the college kids. She has a lot of friends, she's in a
sorority, she has -- I just think she has real, she's a real special human
being. She is a very humble person and a humble player. And she's just really,
she's a joy to be with every day.  
I love coaching her and I have made a point of telling her that basically
every game before every game I just said, "Boy, I'm excited about the game,
but it will just be one less that I'll have to yell at you." And she's really
someone that I'm very proud to say I'm her coach.  
  
Q. A bit more on Candice, do you recall the first time that you met Candice
and her mom and what kind of struck you about the relationship that those two
share?  
COACH VANDERVEER: With Candice and her mom? Well I met Candice first, I
watched Candice play at it was a Nike camp in the summer. And she was a young
player. And my assistant coach pointed her out to me and I'm like, wow. And
then she came to our basketball camp and she basically, I put her through all
the drills all day long with all the campers and then she would tear up the
coaches at night. And one of our more astute players said "Tara, she's really
good." And I'm like, "Yeah, and she's really smart too." And so that player
made it a point to have breakfast and lunch and dinner with her every day. And
we're really, really excited that she was thinking about Stanford.  
And I met Candice's mom on a home visit. And just I could just see kind of the
special relationship that they have. And her mom and her whole family has
never been anything but extremely welcoming and positive with me and just I
remember her mom just saying, making a comment to me about how much Stanford,
how much Candice loved being at Stanford. And just how happy she was and how
sad it was it was only four years. And I said, yeah, I'm sad about that too.
But her mom to me has been really, really special. And her whole family, I met
her grandmother and other members of her family.  
  
Q. Is there a different feeling you didn't get to this round last year, but
is there a different feel now compared to the three years prior? Do you feel
more comfortable about where your team is, more confident or what?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a great question. In that every year you kind
of feel different. But like, just as an example three years ago this was
before Candice's class, so three years ago this game I saw, I'm talking to
Melanie and she goes every year I've gone to a regional it's always with
Stanford. And so three years ago we were playing Vanderbilt, which they were a
two seed, we were a six. And at that point we were playing in Oklahoma and the
preparation for that game and just to win by like maybe I mean just at the
buzzer when it was just an incredibly exciting game and really a thrilling
game. And we know that this game is going to be a great game to play in.  
The next year I think we were playing Oklahoma in this game. And again, just
we, you know, a lot of preparation and we have done the same thing this week
just really get ready to play Pittsburgh. And we know that this is obviously
going to be a great game.  
Last year it was very disappointing not to be in this game. For whatever
reason, I feel like our team is very excited to be here, but they're also,
they're very relaxed. Maybe some of it was the pressure that people felt at
home and honestly I think that this is something that really helped our team a
lot and I don't mean this in a bad way at all but to see the pain that Cal
experienced coming right down our tunnel where, for their coaches and players
were there, it was an extra reminder to our team of how fast something is
over.  
And they know it's all about tomorrow night's game if you want to be playing
on Monday night or if you want to have a shot at going to the Final Four and
this particular team doesn't talk about stuff much. They're not like looking
down the road or they just, this particular team I think feels very kind of
comfortable in their own basketball skin. They're just really enjoying just
hanging out in that locker room out there or at the hotel or they get together
and watched, they're excited to watch the men's game together and things like
that. But it's a, it feels, I said the other day, I said this team's growing
on me.  
THE MODERATOR: You've been at this a long time at Stanford, 22 years, there
had to be that first time you got a team in the Sweet 16, that's where your
opponent is tomorrow night. Can you just remember back to that first time and
how that felt?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that it actually happened when I was at Stanford you
mean or when I was --  
THE MODERATOR: Either.  
COACH VANDERVEER: 22 years is a long time. I think my, I think the first time
that the Stanford team was in the Sweet 16 was when we played at, we played
Texas. And I guess I would have to check but we had, we were, we played
Montana, won in overtime. And I think that we played in Texas and it might
have been like in the '88, and it was thrilling. We were absolutely thrilled
to be in the Sweet 16. And once you get a taste of it, you just want more. But
it was really exciting and I think it did great things for our program and we
just, we got there and we had a young team and a lot of the young players were
like, wow, this is really fun, we want to come back.  
  
Q. Who was the player who had lunch with Candice every day at the camp?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Clare Votensteiner. I'm not sure if it was, she might have
wanted the free lunch. No she was working camp, she was really cute. She was
like, "Boy, Tara, she's really good." And I was like, "I know, Clare."  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach, good luck. We'll now take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For either of you guys to start, can you talk about the matchup. What you
guys have seen from Pittsburgh on tape, what you're anticipating is going to
be the keys to the game tomorrow night.  
J.J. HONES: From what the coaches have shown us they're very long, very
athletic. They have a very big post player in Walker. So we'll have to just
follow the scouting report.  
JILLIAN HARMON: Just to add on, I think they also have a good combination of
inside and outside. They have got Zellous on the outside is their leading
scorer, I think they pride them self on their toughness so we just have to
come ready to play.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel relaxed? We talked a little bit on the phone the other
day with some of the players about being away from home now and having this
really feel like a road trip and the tournament in another arena and that
bonding that you guys will get for the last few games that you'll play
together. Is this a relaxed team?  
J.J. HONES: I feel like compared to last year when we were staying in the
dorms, while we were at Stanford this year we were in the Westin and we were
staying, kind of playing Stanford like it was a road trip, which is
interesting, I feel like that definitely helped for this road trip. So I felt
like we didn't necessarily have home court advantage. And so I feel like it's
not really much of a difference for the second time around.  
JILLIAN HARMON: I think we're definitely relieved to be out of Stanford, we
love playing at home but we're really glad to be here in the Sweet 16 in
Spokane.  
  
Q. For Jillian, can you tell us, talk a little bit about playing with
Candice, what she's like on and off the court and then J.J., if you would
comment.  
JILLIAN HARMON: Candice is just a tremendous player. I think everyone saw that
in her 44 point effort against UTEP. Not only did she have 44 points, she had
10 rebounds and 8 assists and she just brings so much energy to the program.
She's a great friend off the court to everybody, she's there for everyone. And
we, I think we all feel just so lucky to have gotten to play with her. And
I've gotten to play three years with Candice.  
J.J. HONES: I agree with what she said. Even if Candice doesn't have 44 point,
10 rebound, 8 assist games, I feel like she still comes ready to play. And if
maybe she is having an off shooting night, she does a very good job of
rebounding the ball and setting people up. And any time Candice is on the
court I feel like the defense has to know where she is at all times. And so
that definitely does open it up for perimeter players and even the post
players.  
And I feel like she's just so genuinely happy when other people do well that I
feel like you just want to do well for her. And I definitely feel like being
here in the Sweet 16 and then, you know, hopefully we'll get to where we want
to get, would be a great tribute to both Candice and Cissy.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, do either of you have a favorite story about Candice?  
J.J. HONES: Maybe not one for the record.  
(Laughter.)  
JILLIAN HARMON: I don't have a specific story, but Candice is just so
competitive in everything she does. If we're playing cards she wants to win
and she's probably going to win. And you can kind of see that on the
basketball court, every drill, in practice, every possession in the game. So
she's just so competitive and I think that's why she's so successful.  
  
Q. Pitt's making its first appearance in the Sweet 16. You guys didn't play
in this game last year, Jillian you played in this game before. Does
experience count at this point in the tournament?  
JILLIAN HARMON: I'm not so sure it does. I think that everyone who is in the
Sweet 16 is a great team and they deserve to be here. And this, our team's,
we're a young team as it is, we didn't make it past the second round last
year. And I think it's just whoever's executing and playing well in that
specific game.  
THE MODERATOR: When I introduced you, I talked about the northwest ties, just
comment about how many folks are heading up from the Portland area for the
tournament.  
J.J. HONES: Are there a lot of people headed up?  
THE MODERATOR: Yeah, you have a lot and what's that mean to you.  
J.J. HONES: Actually I feel like someone told me that my high school coach is
coming up, but I didn't even know that. So I don't really feel like -- it's
very something special to know that you're playing in front of people who have
watched you growing up or grow up and I don't know, I feel like not only do
you want to do it for your teammates but you also want to kind of show them
just what you've accomplished in your career.  
JILLIAN HARMON: I think that, I just am so glad to have the opportunity to
play in front of my family and friends. I probably got about 15 people driving
up. It's just a great experience to be in the Sweet 16 and they're all really
excited to come up and watch.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. That will do it. Thank you, ladies. Good luck in the
tournament.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with our press conference. Start
with an overview of getting to Spokane and what the season's been like and
then we'll go to some questions.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you we're thrilled obviously to be here in Spokane and
very excited to be one of 16 teams left in the tournament.  
Obviously you know how difficult it is to be able to advance each and every
round and we take nothing for granted.  
I tell you, just tremendous season, obviously, for us, and being led by our
veteran leaders, Crystal Langhorne, Marah Strickland, Ashleigh Newman, Kristi
Toliver, tremendous year that they have had and just wanting to continue to
advance. And getting ready for Vanderbilt, very difficult matchup playing in
the SEC, very talented. From our end just need to be ready to play and execute
for 40 great minutes of basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Jade Perry and Ashleigh Newman, they had
a really good game for you in the last game, but is it as much the lift they
give off the bench as the defense?  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, Jade and Ashleigh are unsung heroes and I think a big
reason why we are here today is just their play. In our last game against
Nebraska, the energy and the spark that they provided, I look at Jade and the
lift she gave us when we were in early foul trouble in the first half against
Nebraska, Ashleigh and her defensive intensity. Need to have both of them
provide that kind of spark, that kind of energy to be able to allow us to
continue to have that kind of depth off the bench.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Crystal Langhorne a player that gets her number
retired before she retires.  
COACH FRESE: Well, I mean when you're the all time leading scorer and leading
rebounder in the history of our program, and Crystal is by far the most
decorated player to ever come through our program. And what she's meant to
Maryland it only seemed fitting on senior day to be able to honor her and lift
her jersey into the rafters. And I think that the most special thing about
Crystal is not only what she's been able to do to produce on the court, with
the numbers the accolades, being an All-American, just what kind of person she
is off the court. And academic All-American, what she does in the classroom,
and just how she carries herself as a person.  
  
Q. Can you go into more detail about the off the court?  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, Crystal does all the little things for us. Like I
alluded to first on an academic front, just, a communication major, has always
from day one been able to take care and handle her academics. What she does in
terms of being a role model, out in the community, how she carries herself,
how she handles herself, and I think that the most special thing about Crystal
is just how she handles pressure. Never is phased or caught up into any kind
of pressure, and especially the little things off the court that a lot of
times girls can get caught up into with drama and different things that go on
and she's never been phased by any of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much this Vanderbilt team kind of reminds you of
your team two years ago that won the title and how hard it is for a young team
to take that next step once you've reached, you almost hit a plateau, how hard
it is to get over that plateau.  
COACH FRESE: I think that when you look at it sometimes it's kind of good and
bad. In the fact of you can play as really free and really loose because you
have nothing to lose and I think when you look at Vanderbilt you see that. You
see that how they have played through their last 15 games and they're
extremely talented. Obviously when you have a veteran-led team you have the
experience factor, but you also know every step and what it means and what you
have to do in order to advance.  
  
Q. Do you have any sense of the four teams here that have things in common
just in terms of what you guys have all done from a basketball sense?  
COACH FRESE: What we have in common? I mean that's a difficult question for me
given the fact that my focus has been on Vanderbilt, I got to be honest.  
I think that probably the interesting thing from all of our ends is I'm not
sure the critics out there who they really feel like deserves to advance. I
think we're kind of all kind of underdogs I guess would be my first guess and
probably assumption in terms of just the bracket. I'm not sure the critics out
there really have a sure favorite of who they think is going to advance out of
this bracket.  
  
Q. I believe on Selection Monday your team was the only one with a couple of
babies around, can you talk about the dynamic and what they brought to the
team and how they changed the team or had changed you at all?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I mean, obviously from our end it was, it's been a special
season. And for our team to really go through an entire pregnancy with their
head coach is the special dynamic. And I think that's something that our young
girls and women some day as they go through it will remember for the rest of
their lives.  
I think that's what makes it so special is our team is a family and every step
of the way of how we have approached the season, how our team has been able to
do so many things with or without their head coach, but it's really a family
and we all take care of each other and we all help each other out to the best
of our ability.  
So it made sense on the selection show just to have everyone there. It's our
extended family together.  
  
Q. As you went through that did you get advice from other coaches on how to
deal with the pregnancy during the season and the lack of sleep all the things
that come with that?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, most definitely. It has been neat to kind of see within the
coaching fraternity those that have had kids and the ones that have reached
out to be able to give such great advice. Really, I've only met one other
coach whose had twins, so the dynamic is a little different because you can't
travel, you're restricted from that at an earlier rate than if you were just
having a single baby.  
But the coaches that have reached out and really talked about it in this crazy
profession just trying to reach and achieve balance and really balancing all
of it between your team and your family has really been probably the special
thing to me.  
The other thing I would say in the coaching fraternity is, just the ranks, I
mean the number of officials that have shared with me that they come from a
family of twins or assistant coaches who are twins or within their family, I
think that that's been probably the most special thing is just that whole
extension that people have shared with me throughout the season.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've achieved that balance yet, there are those of us
who have kids who feel we have gone years without figuring it out?  
COACH FRESE: I think we're constantly working through that balance your entire
life and I think you kind of sometimes go in and out of it.  
You're asking me in five and a half weeks post, if I have achieved balance?
Absolutely not. But I think that's the goal, that we all want to strive for
that goal. But I think just having the tremendous amount of support that I
have at Maryland within my staff, our team, my family, really helps you to try
to get closer to that.  
  
Q. Vanderbilt had mentioned that they had yet to play their best game I
wonder if you feel like you've seen your team play its best game and how much
does it worry or how much do you stress playing 40 full minutes?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously I don't feel like we have played our best game in the
tournament. I don't think as a coach and as a team you ever feel like you've
played your best game 40 complete minutes but I think that's what you strive
for. Day in and day out you strive for your best practice as well as your best
game and your most complete game. So that's always a goal. That's where we
continue to set the bar and want to continue to aim for.  
  
Q. Could you take us through a typical day for you when you're balancing
baby schedules and basketball schedules. Just what a typical day is like for
you?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, obviously it starts really early. In the morning in terms
of the daytime it's always I try to get up and spend as much time as I can, I
guess if you're asking if I'm back home and I'm in Maryland. And to spend the
early morning with the boys, so I kind of have that bonding time. Whether
there's a feeding or a diaper changing of some sort that I can do. Then I head
into the office, I get prepared for practice mindset and focus and goals on
this team. And then when I come through back at night trying to reconnect
obviously with the boys and then you kind of find those moments when they're
asleep then you're working, back and forth, just every second, every minute
you find that you're not going to have time for you so much to speak. Although
I did get a massage out here.  
(Laughter.)  
Which was, there is my balance.  
(Laughter.)  
So you got to squeeze those moments when you can. But definitely just trying
to balance all of it.  
  
Q. On Selection Monday you, the team I cover, Stanford, was distraught that
they didn't get the number one seed visibly and you guys were elated. Did you
feel pretty confident that you would get a number one seed and what did that
mean to your team?  
COACH FRESE: I think that the committee always has difficult decisions to
make. Especially with how our game has grown. Obviously we're extremely
excited to see that we would receive the number one seed and I think there
were a lot of teams worthy and I think they had difficult decisions between
the one and two seed. I think we're all fully aware of it is just a number in
front of your name and you have to go out and you have to be able to play.  
But we do feel good in the sense of that the non-conference schedule that we
put together playing 14 games in 31 days winning the NIT, the amount of top-
ranked teams that we played, the ACC Conference, you know, how difficult it is
there. And just looking at the body of work that we displayed. Our three
losses were all against Top-10 ranked teams.  
So I compliment the committee, but at the same time I think there's a lot of
deserving teams and Stanford is one of them. They're a great team and have had
a tremendous season.  
  
Q. When Vanderbilt was here they compared you guys at least the team that
they think they seem to feel that you guys resemble was Tennessee. In looking
at film, who do they resemble that you've played this year and what kind of
matchup problems or defense adjustments defensive adjustments do you think
you'll have to make?  
COACH FRESE: They're a unique team because they're not characteristic of the
teams that we face in the ACC, so I would have to probably think back to our
non-conference schedule, just the fact that they run so many sets, they all
can shoot it, their post players can go inside and out. So I think they're
unique to probably anyone we have played. So I think they're kind of a
combination of a lot of different teams that we have had to play and we have
played some teams that have post players that can step out and shoot it and
just with their versatility.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Coach thank you for joining us.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. The obvious question is Marah, who won the fight?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I think that I would have to say I won the fight, actually.
It was a good battle between me and Laura, but I came out on top.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For Laura and Marissa, Vanderbilt looks a lot like you guys did two years
ago, a very young team, trying to break through to the next level. Can you
guys talk about what that was like making that championship run two years
ago?  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously when you have no pressure and you just have that air
about yourselves it's easy to play and be loose and have a chip on your
shoulder. But I don't know, we're a very veteran team, so we know what it's
like to be that team, so it's kind of like I think we're ready to counteract
and just play our game.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: When you're not expected to win like we weren't not expected
to win our year, then you just go out there and play free, there's no pressure
on you. You don't have to worry about living up to any expectations or
anything like that. But like we're we were saying we're a very veteran team,
battle tested and experienced. So we're very confident going into tomorrow's
game and for the rest of the tournament.  
  
Q. For all of you, we talked to your coach about how life has changed since
the twins came out. What's it been like for y'all? She described it as a
family atmosphere, do you believe this whole experience brought you all closer
together as a team?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I think that it's definitely brought us together as a team.
Just having the babies around, watching coach be so motherly with them and
taking care of them. And it definitely feels like we get to be their big
sisters and so it's a lot of fun.  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously they came at a good point in the season because it's
more like bringing us together type thing. Being together at her house,
holding the babies, just spending more time as a team with Coach B being
there, kind of picking her up, it just helps our like connectiveness grow
bigger.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think that on top of all of that I think it showed us how
great our coach really is. She's fought through a lot of stuff all season. She
came to practices when none of us knew how bad she was really feeling. She was
back so quickly after she had the twins, she surprised us at the NC State
game, she came down to the ACC tournament. So she's kind of like Super Woman.
There's not many people that can have one child let alone twins and come back
and do what she did and be so important to this team.  
  
Q. Can you follow-up a little bit on, what is that, as young women, what
does it mean to have a role model like that? Does it kind of show you that
there's more possibilities in life than maybe what you might have thought?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think it was an inspiration to all of us. Especially she
got a lot of criticism for her timing when she got pregnant. But she barely
missed a beat. And there wasn't a better time, we talked about it, for her to
have the twins with all the veterans on this team, a lot of us have been
through all the stuff. And we knew what was expected of us, so when she was
gone it was just extra motivation for us to go out there and play that much
harder.  
LAURA HARPER: Also with her being a role model it gave us like a release to
see someone working that hard for her to be at our Senior Night a week after
she gave birth and just wanting to be a part of this team it shows how much
she really cares and it almost makes us to work harder to see what the types
of battles that she went through for us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the assistant coach that took over, he was a first
year guy too and all of a sudden he's running the show quite a bit. What was
it like adjusting to him?  
LAURA HARPER: Well obviously getting adjusted to a new coach is something that
we have to deal with. But he came from the summer and he was very confident
himself and all of us and he instilled so much confidence in just us as a team
and us as players. So it made that transition a lot more easier. It made it
feel like we were actually players and he always said it was a players team,
he was just kind of guiding us along the way.  
  
Q. Brenda talked about the need to play 40 great minutes. Do you guys feel
like you've done that yet and is that a concern that y'all have the rest of
the way?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: We haven't done it so far in this tournament. We have done it
throughout the season. And I'm not going to say it's a concern, actually
thinking about back to our first two round games I think the reason why we
didn't play complete 40 minute games is I think we were putting pressure on
ourselves to get out of College Park. Because that was one of our main goals
because that's where we got knocked out last year. I think now we're going to
play more free and more confident and you're really going to be able to see
Maryland basketball.  
  
Q. I read somewhere you have family members around this area. Can you kind
of explain that who they are.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: My mom's whole side of the family is from Portland, Oregon
and she has family in Seattle as well. I lived in Portland until I was like
four. So some of my family is from Seattle and Portland and they're going to
drive to the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. This would be for Laura, tell me a little bit about playing with Crystal
and what she's meant to the program at Maryland.  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously coming in from high school I felt as though I was
going into college with the post player coming out of high school. So playing
with her the whole time I feel like I've learned from the best and I've
stepped my game up just playing alongside someone who is so good.  
I just feel like we kind of compliment each other. And her being so strong,
her on the left, me on the right. And being able to watch in practice it's
invaluable to be alongside someone for four years in a row and practicing for
four years in a row.  
  
Q. Laura, two years away from looking back from a National Championship,
what does that mean today, to this team today? I know some were on the team,
some weren't, but that's that mean as a group today?  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously being in this spot and thinking back to two years ago
winning a championship and actually seeing like the clips on the TV in the
hotel, it's just a good feeling for this team. It just, it's almost
indescribable because we didn't think about anything for that run. We didn't
think about playing games, we didn't think about what anyone had to say about
us, we were just playing for us, for each other. And just to get out of
College Park and realize how much pressure we put on ourselves, it kind of
just reminds us what how innocent we were and how much fun that was. So just
to get back to Maryland basketball and just play free play and relaxed is what
two years ago means to us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH BERENATO: I can't see you. Now I can see you. I just want to say thank
you to all of you for being here today. It's exciting. It's not only exciting
for Pittsburgh, but also for the other teams that are present. And to be in
the Sweet 16 is awe inspiring. And some people you dream about it your whole
life and some people, coaches and players, student-athletes, they go through
their whole life and they never achieve this.  
So it's with great pleasure and joy and excitement that we're very, very happy
to be here for our women's basketball program, for the athletic department,
for the university, and our community. Because Pittsburgh is a blue collar
city, and I think our team is a blue collar team. We're a hard working team
and there's a couple individuals in particular that really makes our heart
smile for. And that is our chancellor, Mark Nornenberg who really had great
vision five years ago and belief. And then there's two ladies, Carol Sprague
is the main reason that I would say I'm probably at Pittsburgh. She believed
in me and she believed in my family. And then she's been at Pitt I think like
34 years. And another lady, Donna Sand has been at Pitt for 34 years. They
have never experienced this.  
And they have worked every year and they have believed in the team every year.
And Carol Sprague was even on the NCAA Selection Committee for five years and
I can't even imagine what it would be like to be on a selection committee and
never even think about your team Pitt being up on the board. I can't even
imagine that.  
So for her I'm really glad she's not on the committee, I'm glad that she's
here. I don't know that she's been able to enjoy it yet because it's been a
helatious ride and a lot of stuff to do. But we're excited. We got here
because the team believed in us and we believed in our team. And I think any
time you have blind faith, anything is possible. And we have worked hard, we
have had our ups and downs and we have had a lot of downs this year and a lot
of situations that really could have held us back, but we weren't deterred. We
have had great highs, every day we are here and every day we're able to go to
practice is a wonderful day, it's a gift. I think we have to celebrate that.  
So we're just happy to be here. And for Spokane to host this regional is
awesome. We have heard tremendous things and since the minute we stepped off
the plane the hospitality has been nothing but glorious. And I just want to
say to all the people, whether it's been our hosts, at the restaurants, the
arenas that, we have used some different gyms already, you guys have been
awesome and we want to just say thanks in advance.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Coach Balcomb is from Jersey, your assistant Lisa was at one of your
basketball camps?  
COACH BERENATO: Hell, she went to my school. We were at the same high school.
Don't minimize it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the Jersey presence here in Spokane?  
COACH BERENATO: Yeah, we love it. Jersey girls, there's a play or something
out, Jersey Boys, everyone keeps telling me about that, forget that. It's
Jersey girls. Melanie's awesome. Melanie's, she's a terrific coach. I really
admire her. And Lisa, she's, she went to Glouster Catholic, she's from my
hometown Glouster, which is really a blue collar town and she was a blue
collar kid. And it's just really exciting having had the opportunity to see
them since they have been here, but I did spend some time a little bit of time
with them in Albuquerque, and whenever I see them of course I think that we
all make each other laugh and smile because people that aren't from where
we're from really have -- y'all don't have a clue. And it's just great. It
will be really great if the Jersey girls rule and we get to the Elite 8. I
think that would be really fun.  
  
Q. Your schedule, how do you think playing the schedule you did helps
prepare you for a game like Stanford and did you intentionally schedule teams
like Duke and Maryland with the NCAA tournament in mind?  
COACH BERENATO: Absolutely, Ray. And it's good to see you here. I'm really
happy that you made the trip. So thank you for the time and effort.
Absolutely, we really scheduled up and there was a time and it didn't hit me
until February that I thought I was crazy because we went through a really
helatious part of the schedule in February where we played I think it was five
of seven teams were in the top 15 in the nation. And we weren't ranked in the
top 15. And we took some dips. So of course everybody immediately, media and
the community probably across the country were like, "Well we knew Pitt wasn't
that good anyway" and we were just like, whatever.  
But we scheduled early on non-conference. We went up to Penn State and had a
really tough schedule up there. We played Penn State, we played Greensboro,
who is, or Charlotte I think at Charlotte, who usually goes to the tournament.
And then we played Arizona. And then we went to Madison Square Garden and we
played Duke when they were ranked sixth in the country, Maggie Dixon Classic
and lost to them on a last second shot. They scored with 1.2 seconds and won
by two.  
And then we played Maryland at Maryland and we lost by 13 there. And I think
that people would think oh my gosh what are you doing, but we definitely had
it in mind for the NCAA. Last year we scheduled so that, we really wanted to
be in the tournament and for 20 wins, on track for that. This year we thought
we had a veteran team so I needed to schedule up for seeding.  
But it did get to be a point where, I'll be honest with you, we were really
stressed. We had 18 wins and it was almost like, "Oh, my god, are we going to
get two more wins", and even though our RPI and strength of schedule were in
the Top-20 as a coach you put tremendous pressure on yourself.  
The second part was we scheduled our games on road and if you notice we only
had 11 home games. And eight of those games had to be conference. We didn't
play our first home game until December 6. I think December 5 or 6. Which is
ludicrous in essence, but for us we always talked about the tournament this is
what it's like we're going to have to be on the road and weather the storm. So
I think that definitely it has helped us.  
  
Q. Can you expand on that schedule a bit in terms of the Big East has done
very well in this tournament this year. Can you talk about playing that
conference schedule how it's prepared you to reach this point.  
COACH BERENATO: Well I think that again it's really wonderful to see five of
our teams in the Sweet 16. I only had pre- algebra so I don't know percentage
wise what that is. But 38 percent. My sons and daughters will die if they hear
me say this. But it's a really great percentage I think. That's terrific. And
I would say we without a doubt probably are the top conference right now in
representing. And for us we had to play those teams all the time. And we had
to play West Virginia twice. And West Virginia was, got ranked in the Top-10
at one point. And so again I just think that in our conference and we believed
there was so many teams that could have come to this tournament and competed.
But they didn't have the wins because we beat everybody else up. They just
didn't get the wins.  
But they're either in the NIT or even a team like Marquette, like Marquette is
a really good team. St. John's is a really good team. They didn't make it to
the big dance because wins and losses. And in essence that's it.  
And I think that when we come out and we're not -- we play Connecticut twice.
Connecticut is number one in the nation and I think Connecticut is a really,
really, really good team and I've said, if Connecticut, if we don't win the
National Championship, you know, I hope Connecticut does. I think they're
going to win it. And that's exactly how I feel. They're that good.  
So we have already played them twice, and we played all the other teams, we
played West Virginia, when they were ranked I think 12 and we beat them and we
beat Notre Dame who is ninth in the nation. And we beat DePaul when they were
15. And we beat Louisville who is in the Sweet 16 right now. And you know, I
just think that -- and then we played Rutgers we lost to them they were fourth
in the nation, we lost to them by four points without Mercedes Walker. You
know, we lost to some of those teams but they're here. They're representing.  
So I feel like for my team you know, I mean I don't know how they can look at
anyone and be intimidated because as long as you're not Connecticut, we feel
like we have a chance. And that's the truth.  
  
Q. You're obviously thrilled to be here how do you sort of change gears with
your team so that they're not just happy to be hear; and then the second
question would be can you just talk about Stanford a little bit and the game
that you've got coming up?  
COACH BERENATO: There's no changing gears because our goal was to be here the
whole time. We're not surprised that we are here. I know y'all are surprised
we are here but we're not. When we left Pittsburgh back last Wednesday we
packed for this trip. We knew that -- I mean we had our itineraries set and
the kids knew that they needed to pack straight through for Spokane. I told my
coaching staff to bring four good outfits for coaching. So we had a plan, we
had our itineraries straight through. It wasn't like after we beat Baylor we
were jumping up and down and going, "What do we do now, do we go home or not."
I mean it was sad. I mean we're a very, very happy, but you know we are here
to win and we are here to we feel like we can compete with Stanford.  
To address your second part of the question, we feel that Stanford has a great
team and they have a great coach. I think Tara does a great job and obviously
she's a legend in our game. And I think that the one thing that Stanford has
and Stanford has unbelievable tradition they have a deep and rich tradition.
And when you look at, I'm educated and you're educated to the game and they
have won a National Championship and they have been to four Final Fours and
they have been 1932, you know, Elite 8s and Sweet 16s and all that other
stuff, but my kids don't know that. My team, they don't know that.  
But my team, it like, so for us it's a game. You see, it's a game. And we have
been taking it just like in segments, game by game by game by game. And I
think that Candice Wiggins, she's awesome, she's tremendous, she's a, she's
one of the better guards in the country, one of the best guards in the
country. But I saw Candice Wiggins play when I went out to San Diego and
recruited Mallorie Winn, we have a girl, Mallorie Winn from the Bishop School,
and they played each other that game that I saw, and Mall's team beat
Candice's. But Candice was everything and she was all that and a box of
chocolates and player of the year and this and that. But Mall's team won.  
So I was fortunate to see her and now how fitting that they're seniors and
they're playing against each other. I just think that's really cool. I don't
know that that could have ever been planned. So again I think Appel is an
awesome post player, I think she gets better and better and better and better
every game. I think that Pedersen is really, she's the glue, she's the X
factor to their team. She makes great passes, high low, she can take it from
the outside, you know. So I mean they have a good team, but I think everyone
in the Sweet 16 right now has a good team. Everybody has an All-American. We
have Mercedes Walker, everybody has defensive Player of the Year. So we have,
you know at this point you throw the ball up and you hope that it's a great
game.  
  
Q. Can you compare and contrast Stanford for Connecticut having played them
twice and talk about what it was like to be celebrating your victory over
Baylor and watching Candice Wiggins score 44 while you were doing that?  
COACH BERENATO: That was a non-factor. We weren't watching her score 44. I'll
be honest with you, that's what you have videotape for. Our scout team was,
she was like, I have to go back to the hotel and because Stanford's on TV. And
I said no you're not going back to the hotel that's what we have VCRs for and
we taped the game and tonight, you know what, we're going to the Sweet 16 and
you're going to have dinner with the team. And that's I just really believe
that you celebrate the moment and tomorrow morning it will come really, really
quick and we'll start working on our scouts as we are.  
But you know, Candice, she scored 44, and she's capable of that. And I think
if you look at their run, you know, they were able to beat that team fairly
easily. So um, as far as comparing and contrasting Connecticut and Stanford,
about the only thing they have in common is that they run the triple post and
they're both pretty good at it. I feel very fortunate in that we have played
Connecticut twice and they run the same offense and so I mean Shay played for
Connecticut, she's our scout, she's, you know, last night I mean in watching
my practice I thought for a second well maybe my team should play triple post
in, they're doing pretty good with it. So I'm not a triple post girl, but at
the same time, you know, they run, they run a really nice set and they both
have inside outside.  
But again I think when you get to this point everyone has inside outside,
everybody can hit the 3-point shot, you know, it's, um, it comes down to
intangibles.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck in the tournament.  
COACH BERENATO: Thank you. And thank you for being here and keep writing about
our game because it's the only way our game is going to grow.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for the student-athletes now.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about how the non-conference schedule the games
against Duke and Maryland and then the Big East schedule prepared you for a
game against Stanford, which has won 20 games in a row.  
MALLORIE WINN: I think that the Big East is a really competitive conference
and I also think the coaches had a purpose in us playing some of the top teams
in the preseason such as Duke and Maryland. And I think that definitely
prepares us for this tournament. So I don't think we're going in with any kind
of intimidation, I think that our schedule has prepared us to the fullest.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Mallorie said it all.  
  
Q. Marcedes, can you talk about your matchup with Jayne Appel tomorrow
night?  
MARCEDES WALKER: It's going to be a really tough matchup, a really good
matchup. You know, I seen her play a couple times on TV and she really did
what she had to do for her team to win games and I think that's what I have to
do going into the game, I got to stay out of foul trouble and really help my
team and I just, I'm just up for the challenge. I played against Kia Vaughn
and all them caliber teams and all them good caliber players in the Big East
and it's just another challenge and I'm up for it.  
  
Q. Getting back to that tough schedule y'all had this year your coach talked
about there was some down times this year, some tough losses. Can you talk
about how you kept your composure from those losses and kept the big picture
in mind knowing that ultimately it would help you get to this point?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: We just had to come together as a team, having I think we
were down four losses or five losses back to back to ranked teams and that was
ranked in the top 15. So we just had to come together as a team and keep our
cool and knowing that we are still a good team and some teams have downfalls
and that was our biggest down fall and now we're up on our peak.  
MARCEDES WALKER: It was tough having them tough losses. We did have an up-and-
down season. Some games that we lost we thought that we wasn't supposed to
lose and that's what teams go through. You're not going to win them all. I
think that the best thing is now we are on top of our game and we're in the
Sweet 16. So I think that right about now all the teams that's out there right
now is the good teams and they know they're on the top of their game. So we
just have to show it tomorrow.  
MALLORIE WINN: We did have some up-and-downs, and I think that the great thing
about the NCAA tournament is that really none of that matters. Every game is
your last. Who you lost to and how much you lost by and who you won or who you
beat and how much you won by doesn't really doesn't matter. That's the great
thing about this tournament. And we are on top of our game now, like Marcedes
says.  
  
Q. Some of us here don't really know anything about you guys and your coach
and this is the first time we have seen your coach. And she seems like a lot
of fun a live wire and stuff, can you guys tell us more of what she's like
behind the seasons, is she kind at that of a butt kicker or is she always fun
or what? Gentleman she's a lot of everything.  
(Laughter.).  
MARCEDES WALKER: She's crazy, she's outgoing, she's behind the scenes, I ain't
going to say nothing, but, it's just like we just love playing for her. I
think that sometimes we get mad at her just like she get mad at us, but in the
long run we love her to death and she's our coach and I think that the way
that she is the way this program can explain this program, because I know that
she always talked about being how she was out going and stuff like that and
how she wanted want the players to be courteous to other people and I think
that she really, like the players really bought into her, because I think that
sometimes we act crazy sometimes we, like I know a lot of times when we do
media we're outgoing and I think that really comes from our coach and we
always, and we love her to death for that.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think Marcedes said it the best. Behind the scenes we
ain't going to say nothing, but, she is an outgoing person and she's very
happy and right now she's uppity up because we're in the Sweet 16. But we all
love her for that. So I think she said it the best.  
MALLORIE WINN: She's pretty much always outgoing and she does drink a lot of
coffee in the morning.  
(Laughter.)  
So, but just like any coach, she's tough on us and there's times when she,
she's always going to support us. There's times where she's tough on us, but
just like any coach she has her moments where she's kind of mean, you know.
But Coach B has done a lot for this program and to draw a lot of attention and
support for our program. So we do love her and we appreciate her.  
  
Q. For the seniors, coming in the program didn't have a lot of tradition,
didn't have a lot of wins. What made you think it was possible to do that at
Pitt?  
MARCEDES WALKER: I think that it came from like the head coach down to the
coaching staff and the administrators. I can speak for like when we came in as
far as like me and, well we're all seniors right here, it's just Shavonte and
Jania on the court, but I know that everybody really believed in Coach B and
the staff and what they were trying to do with this program as far as turning
it around. And we would never think like you can always say that you want to
come into a program and change it around, but for it to change around each
year that we have been there is, it was like pretty exciting. I know that
Coach B was like the big part of it and Coach Williams and Coach Shay, because
if you didn't recruit good players to come in and really like dedicate
themselves to working hard on the court and being competitors every night, I
think that like this program wouldn't be where it's at. So I think that by
them getting these caliber players here and really willing to work hard, this
program was able to change around.  
MALLORIE WINN: I knew them before I came to Pittsburgh so it wasn't like I was
coming into anything new. They recruited me at Georgia Tech. I knew what kind
of coaches they were and I knew their standards and I knew that they wanted to
come to Pittsburgh and recruit players that were accustomed to winning in high
school. So I knew that as long as you started as they started improving their
caliber of players that the program would grow and that's what it's done.  
  
Q. Mallorie, can you just talk about your recollections of playing against
Candice Wiggins in high school, coach mentioned you played against each other
and she was recruiting you. And for all three of the players if you can just
talk about how this triple post offense they run is similar to Connecticut's
and how much playing Connecticut helps you and in having someone who played at
Connecticut coaching you an and teaching you can help you prepare for that.  
MALLORIE WINN: I played against Candice about six years ago.  
(Laughter.)  
But Candice, she's a very good player. She was very good in high school. Coach
B said earlier, she was all everything, all counties all that kind of stuff.
Yeah, it really, it's not really about me and her. It's really just about us
knowing our game plan and I think we have a great scout against Stanford and
understanding that Candice is the focal point of their team, so we really do
need to pay attention to her and make a great effort to limit what she can do
in this game.  
MARCEDES WALKER: I think that, I know Coach B stressed the fact that Mallorie
played against Candice her senior year and it's just like you always got that
one best player on your team, just like Stanford is going to focus on Shavonte
and it's just like it comes down to a team effort. It's not just about one
player. And at this level you can't just let one player beat you.  
So I think that it's going to be a team effort on guarding Candice and
guarding Jayne too because she's averaging double figures and the other four
players too. And as far as getting ready to play against them for they run the
same offense as UCONN, it's just that you just got to just dig down and play
defense. You just got to get stops. And at this time people, you should be on
your top of your game as far as defense. And I do think that playing against
Connecticut got us prepared, will get us prepared for that. And I don't want
to mention like the 30 point losses and the 20 point losses, I won't mention
that. But it's just like right now you got to play defense. So that's it.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: As far as the triple post whatever offense they run, but
like she said, we did play Connecticut and I think Notre Dame ran the same
offense as well and it's just going to have to come down to a team effort
playing defense and stopping the go to players.  
  
Q. Mallorie, that game that when your coach came out to recruit, was that,
that was a really big deal in San Diego, right, was that, can you talk just a
little bit about what that game meant? I mean, was it all billed as the two
superstars against each other and also when you look at film now is this
Candice the same Candice that you played against in high school, does she look
the same?  
MALLORIE WINN: I think that back then it wasn't like me against her. I really
can't remember that well. I believe that either of us we were probably 1 and 2
in the county, so it was really just the two best teams going at each other.
And it was a huge game at the time. I think that after we beat, she played for
La Jolla Country Day and they were always our cross town rival, but after we
beat them I think that we left or I left my senior season leaving Bishop's,
which was my high school, number one in the county. So it was big in that
sense. What was the second question?  
  
Q. Looking at the film of her now, is it the same player that she was then?
What's the difference? What are the similarities?  
MALLORIE WINN: When I look at her I think her, she's the same in the sense
that she's very athletic, she's very passionate, she's a very passionate
player. She brings a lot of emotion to their team. I think that obviously over
the years she has developed her shot and penetration and all that kind of
stuff. So she's developed as a player. But when I look at her she's definitely
the same. The same looking.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, Stanford will come in with more experience in this game
than you guys have, does that make a difference?  
MARCEDES WALKER: It's not about experience right now. It's about who is going
to go out there and play the hardest to get the win. They have been here, I
can say -- well Candice been here for almost four years in her career, but
like the last couple years I can remember I think there's probably like, if
y'all can help me out, like this is their first time to the Sweet 16 in like
two or three years. Two years. So it's just like we fresh too because it's our
first time to the Sweet 16. So it's just like that it's the NCAA's, so you
just want to go out there and leave it all out there. It's not about the teams
that have been here way before you or if they have been here three straight
years and you just your first time here. It's just the best team go out there
and playing right about now you just got to be on the top of your game, both
teams.  
  
Q. A couple of you experienced I think the six win season when you were
freshmen. If that's right.  
MARCEDES WALKER: No. No.  
  
Q. You weren't here at that time. All right. Well like 12 wins maybe the
first year. How satisfying is it to go from where you were to where you are
now?  
MARCEDES WALKER: Well I was the only one who played that 13 year season or 13
win season. And I was pretty frustrated. But having these two right here
Shavonte and Mall, I know I used to talk to them a lot freshman year to get me
through. And it was like it was hard because I know I had injured my shoulder
and I couldn't play in the last post season game when we went to the Big East
Tournament.  
And I know coming from there Coach B was like, you never had a post season. So
ever since then we have been just playing post season and it means a lot to be
sitting here now and talking about the Sweet 16. And I don't know, I guess
that just comes from us working hard and the coaches getting players in there
to work hard to be here right now.  
  
Q. Your coach described your team as like a blue collar like team. Can you
describe what your identity is, hard working, could you describe would you
describe it as blue collar?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Our team? I wouldn't say we are a blue collar team. We do
work hard, but then we have like our up-and-downs days in practice when we're
just like, oh, you know, but when it comes all down to it, like right now,
we're all hard working team together.  
MALLORIE WINN: I think we're the kind of team that rises to the occasion and I
think that when we understand what's at stake and we play hard I think we're
very difficult to stop. I can't say that we're blue collar in that we're an
extremely hard working team on a consistent basis, but I think that when it
comes down to it, when the time comes and when we really need to play, we do
play.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies. Good luck.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Balcomb.  
  
Q. You've been in a few states since Monday and flown a lot of miles. Could
you just talk about the last three or four days and the whirlwind that it's
been to get here.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well I think that it really helped us to get out of New Mexico
as quickly as we did after our game. We flew through the night so most of the
kids slept and then went to class the next morning.  
Had that day off. Had a really good practice the next day. And then got on a
plane again and had yesterday off. And looking forward to practicing today.  
But again, our kids are excited, they're young, they have a lot of energy, and
this is where they want to be. So I don't think it's even been discussed or a
factor in how we feel. Because I think we feel great.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about all the Big East teams in the Sweet 16 but can
you talk about playing in the Southeastern Conference and how playing at such
a high level has brought you to this point.  
COACH BALCOMB: Absolutely. If you look at our record, since January we haven't
lost to anybody but LSU and Tennessee. Yet we have four losses. So you play
Tennessee three times and they're a number one seed and you play LSU and
they're a number two seed, and I think that's one of the things we keep
telling our players is how prepared we are. As well as beating Georgia twice
and having other quality opponents like Auburn and Kentucky and teams like
that, that we have done really well against. And I think that does build our
confidence, because our competition has been very good in the last two and a
half months.  
  
Q. As you look at film and stats and all, who does Maryland remind you of
teams you've played this year? If anybody.  
COACH BALCOMB: A lot like Tennessee, to be honest with you. They have just got
some great, great players, individual play, and knowing personnel and
defending that personnel. They have five tremendous players on the court that
can all create a shot for themselves or for someone else. And they have great
experience.  
So we have, individually, we have compared people to different teams, but as a
team, as a whole, Tennessee seems to come up more than anybody.  
  
Q. Last year you guys were expected to get to this point with a senior-laden
team and you didn't. This year it can be kind of considered a little bit of a
surprise, how do you keep kids from just having that being happy to be here
type of feel?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think you just have to know your kids. And I think that they
feel like they're playing really well. They feel very confident. They feel
like they have a lot of momentum going in to this game. And by being young and
not being expected to be here they feel a sense of relaxation that you have to
have on offense. Yet at the same time they're competitors and they want to win
every game they play.  
So it's a great combination, because you want to be intense on defense, but
you want to relax on offense. And then they don't have that added pressure of
being their last game and feeling, and a lot of them know what that felt like
last year. And they just feel a good sense of I think just looking forward to
the next opponent and to the next game instead of concern. It's a great
feeling. I know as a coach I feel totally different than I did last year. And
I know that I'm sure they do too.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the matchup what concerns you player for player
and how you'll matchup with these guys?  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, I don't think we play a lot of player for player, but I
think that what we like is to keep people off balance. We like to play
different defenses. We like to play matchup zone, we like to play man, we like
to play trapping, half court, three quarter court. So what we like to do is
keep people off balance as a team.  
Individually we don't really matchup with them. I don't think there is a
matchup to worry about. But we play defense and have all year, it's the best
defensive team I've ever coached and we have just held our last two opponents
to 46 and 47. And I feel like we did that is a team. And I think the advantage
is we know we need each other. And there's a lot of, there's a sense of trust.
We help and then we rotate and the next player is there. Defensively that's
what I try to teach is team defense, not really individual matchup defense
anyway.  
  
Q. Can you pinpoint a game at some point during the season where you can
look back and say this is where I knew this team was going to make it this
far?  
COACH BALCOMB: Not really. I think that our team, our season thus far has been
about recovery and the only thing I looked back about is losing two straight
games at home. That had never happened to me at Vanderbilt and to our program
and we got, we really got beat and beat well by Old Dominion.  
So we knew that it was broke and we needed to fix it. And so we had a lot of
time to do that. I like the timing of when that happened. And what we did with
our program and the things we did and the adjustments we made and then we got
everybody on board. And once they have been on board and once we have, we had
their attention and made the most of that and we have just, it's been just a
focus on getting better every game.  
That's why I was talking earlier, I don't think we have had our best game yet.
We're that young that we can't wait for another game. We want to keep it going
because we want to play our best game.  
  
Q. How important to the program to get past this stage where you've been a
few times and you personally have done it at another school, but for this
team?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it's something that we strive for as a program. The
expectations being from the SEC conference, but the expectations at Vanderbilt
when I came there was to get the team back to an Elite 8 and then on to a
Final Four and a national championship. And we will always have those
expectations and be reaching for those. This year is no different than any
other year. And I didn't treat it any differently.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier you feel different as a coach from last year to
this year. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think that there's, again, with a senior class, you want so
much for them. I feel exactly how may players, what their statements have been
interesting, because they haven't talked about them feeling the pressure, they
felt like they wanted to do it for Dee and for Carla and Caroline and I felt
the same way. They were my first recruiting class and they had been through a
lot of adversity. And that first recruiting class of six or seven players,
Caroline was a walk on actually in that class, and to get all the SEC
Championships and the individual accolades that we did, but we wanted to go
farther and make a run in the NCAAs. And so what we had talked about when I
recruited them was getting to a Final Four and winning a National
Championship.  
It was really talked about as one of their goals and that's why they came to
play for me at Vanderbilt. And so they wanted to do things that no one else
had done. And that's the ultimate goal of a National Championship. That has
not been done at Vanderbilt.  
So I think we had dreamed about it, and they had the same dream and so then
the players we brought in behind that came in with that same vision and wanted
it for them before they left. I felt the same exact way. I knew I was going to
have another shot, I knew I was going to come back, but I wanted it for Dee
and Caroline and Carla.  
  
Q. I know sometimes foul trouble and getting a team's star player in trouble
early can be key. Maybe more so with this team, they get over 85 percent of
their points from that starting five. Is it maybe even a bigger point of
emphasis to get to the bench in this game?  
COACH BALCOMB: Not really. I think that most teams down the stretch here once
you get into NCAA play have an either five, six or seven man rotation. I don't
think there's anything deeper than that. And everybody likes to talk about
depth being such a factor, what I think we want to do is not just get them out
of the game, but wear people down. Since depth is something that we have, we
feel like we have a starting seven.  
So that's one of the things we did against West Virginia, so since we just had
success with that we'll be trying to do that again. But we, again, we don't
want to get in an up tempo game with them, because that's their strength. So
we want to go fast to slow. Which is very unique in our program and something
that we want to make them defend us in the half court and we want to keep them
in the half court.  
  
Q. They get a lot of points also from the foul line and they seem to get
into the bonus pretty early in halves. Without necessarily touching that third
rail, how important will officiating be, will there be something specific he
you'll be looking for in terms of how the game is called?  
COACH BALCOMB: No, that's something I try not to focus on at all. Because I
don't have any control of that. The officials or who they're going to be. I
know our first two games were officiated differently than the SEC was and
that's an adjustment for the players.  
I think that you don't, again, we're in a new region, different officials,
you're going to get a different combination of officials, that might determine
how they officiate it. The key is adjusting to those officials in the first
couple minutes of play. Your players have to be smart.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll go ahead and take questions for the student-
athletes from Vanderbilt.  
  
Q. I asked your coach the same question, a lot has been made about all the
Big East teams that have made it to the Sweet 16. Can you talk about playing
in the SEC and what a tough conference it is and how it's helped get you to
this point?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Sure. I think playing in the SEC prepares us for any team
that we're going to face just because it's so aggressive and just really
physical. And so we're able and capable to when we play teams like that, to
just be physical with them and maybe show them some aggression that they never
face when they're playing in their conferences.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: It's just, a big thing is we play against great teams like
Tennessee and LSU, Georgia, really there's no game in the SEC that you can
just completely overlook. It's good because once you get to tournament time
you're going to play against a great team every night and everybody is ready
to play. So just getting ready for that during your conference play prepares
you for tournament play.  
  
Q. How is the kind of sense and the feeling around the team different this
year than it was during last year's tournament and is there more kind of
relaxation entering in a this game?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that this year we have talked about this a lot, we're
just more relaxed this year. Last year we had three seniors who were great
players and I think that we were all kind of putting a little pressure on
ourselves for them just we wanted to go so far and end into the second round,
which it ended there, which was disappointed.  
This year because we're so young people don't expect a lot from us. We expect
a lot from ourselves, but it's just a different feeling because we're so young
and we're just a different kind of team this year. I think that because our
defense is so much better this year that it just allows games to be more fun
because nobody can take anything away from your defense.  
There's nights where your offense is struggling but because that's not really
our bread and butter this year, our defense is, we're just allowed to play so
much more free and just really go after games and know that we can stay in any
game because we can shut people down.  
  
Q. I asked your coach who she thought Maryland resembled of the teams that
you've played this year. So I ask you all that, but also I would ask you, who
do you think you guys, how would you describe your style to someone?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I guess we would say Maryland kind of resembles Tennessee a
little bit, where it's more about knowing the personnel, just what the girls
like to do and their kind of style of play. They just like to run and get out
there and in transition and play. What was the other question?  
  
Q. Who do you think, how would you describe your style?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I kind of just go with what Tina said, kind of last thing she
said was just our defense. We really take a lot of pride in our defense this
year. One of the keys we have is just running to have fun. So I guess that
would be our style, just getting out there and playing basketball together as
a team.  
  
Q. For Jennifer, your brother played at Eastern Washington here, have you,
are you familiar with this part of the country, ever been here before and if
not, what he's he told you about this place?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Well, no, I've never been to Washington. He really told me
that there's not much to do out here.  
(Laughter.)  
But I don't really do much anyway except go to the movies and go bowling with
Tina, so there's, you know, I don't know. I came here for basketball, so
there's not, you know, the mall, that will be fun, but that's it.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You guys have compared them to Tennessee, can you talk about how your
games went with Tennessee and how your defense worked against that type of
team?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: We played Tennessee three times so far this year and I think
that every time we played them we have gotten more competitive with them. We
talked about how they're similar to Maryland and that they're just, you need
to know their personnel. All five players on the floor can score and they're
good at it. So we just need to defensively we just need to know personnel. And
just really be aggressive. Teams like that, if you're they have great
shooters, if you're going to let them shoot, obviously they're going to knock
it down.  
So I think with Tennessee we got better every time we played them and just
taking those things away from them, not giving them anything easy, and then
just really just being the aggressive team. Yeah, Maryland's a great team,
they won a National Championship two years ago, but we're not going to be
intimidated by that, because we're going to go out there and go after it and
we're going to play hard and make them do things that they're not used to
doing. And I think that playing Tennessee three times just has prepared us for
that.  
  
Q. This ties in with a question about the Big East earlier, but the national
perception is that there's two power teams in the SEC with Tennessee and LSU.
Does, would you guys getting to the Elite 8 kind of dispel all that national
perception that there are a lot of powers teams in the SEC and that you guys
and Georgia and the like should be taken seriously as national contenders?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Go ahead, Tina.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that nobody makes it to the Elite 8 if they're not a
great team. Right now I think that we're in a good position just that we made
it this far and we're excited about this game. I think that we're just going
to go hard after it and I think that even getting to this point shows people
that we deserve to be mentioned up there with the other great teams in the
country.  
In the SEC we lost to LSU and Tennessee this year. But we played them tough
and I don't think that any team in the SEC will say that when they know
they're going to play us next game that they overlook that game. I think that
we compete with people and we challenge people every night that we play them.
So I think that we're kind of on the verge and just, with the youth of this
team, I'm just excited for what we're going to continue to do this year but
even what we're going to do next year because we're just getting better every
day and I think that teams are, they're going to see that we're improving and
that they can't take us lightly, because we are a good team.  
  
Q. Have you guys talked to the seniors from last year at all in this run or
have they been in contact?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Well, Dee Davis she was at our bus when we left to come out
here and Caroline is also one of our grad assistants. So just with Caroline
there, she's always just encouraging us and just telling us keep pushing, this
is the best time of your life right now, this is the time where you go out
there and have fun. And so I think it really just, it clicks with a lot of our
girls now just because we're so young and that's what we want to do, we just
want to have fun. And sometimes basketball can seem like a job and it can seem
hard, but when you're out there with a group of girls that it's just fun to
play with, then this is the best time.  
We're just excited. You're going to see smiles on everybody's faces because
they just want to be here and we just can't wait to play on Saturday.  
THE MODERATOR: We have talked so much about the youth of your team, you
obviously are two of the veterans, just I'll ask Christina first, what have
you, maybe talk about some of the conversations you've had with some of those
young teammates gets continuing them ready for this trip?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that Jen and I have taken on a leadership role that
usually is seniors take because we only have one senior this year and didn't
want to leave it all on her, so our younger players have been amazing just in
terms of just being open to listening and trying to make the changes that
coach asked of them or that we ask of them.  
Just we have two freshmen that start and you talk to them and it's all head
nods and just, okay, okay, yeah, sure. And which is great. When you have an
attitude like that instead of somebody whose going to look at you like, okay,
you know, not listening, it just makes it so is easy because they're open to
what you're saying they want to make the changes because they want to help the
team.  
Our freshmen have been amazing, even our sophomores who are relatively young
they are just open to it. They're listening, they just want to do anything
they can and we have talked a lot this year about roles on the team and just
and it might not be the role that you're us a today from high school or
whatever, but or not the role that you want, but we have people on this team
that are just so willing to do whatever it takes to win that if you talk to
someone it's, and you sit them down and say, this is what we need from you, I
guarantee you in the next game or the game after that they're going to do it
and it's going to be beneficial for the team.  
JENNIFER RISPER: That's great.  
(Laughter.).  
THE MODERATOR: Ditto?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Yeah. Well -- yeah. I don't know, I guess talking to some of
them, we can talk about the things that they do well like Merideth she's a
great shooter, but in a basketball game sometimes your shots aren't going to
fall. So we try to focus on things that you can do. Which is working hard,
going after it, just the hustle plays, rebounds and steals and just being out
there forcing and dictating the other team.  
So I guess we talk about things like that. The biggest thing is just like
having fun like when we're playing on the court and we're looking in each
other's eyes or someone gets a charge we run over there and we huddle and
we're happy that she just gave her body to cause the other girl to get a foul.
And that girl's probably going to go sit on the bench now.  
So I think that the biggest thing is just we want to have fun together and
then also too the attitudes are just great. Especially Jence like as our point
guard she's so is focused and determined, but she works so hard and she is a
great person she's a great person to just encourage you.  
And so I think it's just fun. It's fun to play with these girls just because
we're young, but also too another thing is we're so young, but all of our
girls like even our freshman and sophomores like they play a lot. And you
think that they don't have any experience, but they have been playing all year
and in extremely tough games, lots of minutes. So they have gained so much
experience over the year, so.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, ladies and good luck.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought that hats off to Tennessee, that they got a great
team. I thought Coach Summit, her usual self, made a great sub tonight,
putting Auguste in for the freshman to give them more defense and quickness,
and I thought that was a great move.  
I'm really proud of our team. I think they fought. I didn't play a lot of
people tonight by design. They played as hard as they could. I'm really proud
of our effort. We just come up a little bit short.  
Ask the players questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. You guys had plenty of ball to play still. What do you tell yourselves in
the locker room with the NCAA Tournament coming your way?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Like Coach said, we're very proud of ourselves, we came out and
fought for it, and you've just got to learn from these mistakes the last
couple minutes, the mistakes that we made within the game and go back and
correct them and get past this point and move forward. I'm looking forward to
the NCAA Tournament.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Sylvia. You look at the mistakes you made and
we've got some time before the tournament starts, and you go back home and
improve, and you come back to the NCAA Tournament ready to play.  
  
Q. Sylvia, before the game or after last night's game Candace said Tennessee
was a different team from the last time you guys played them. Did you sense
that they were a different team today? If so, what way?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't think so. I think they came out and did the same thing
they did in the previous game. They crashed the boards, they played hard, and
I don't think there's nothing changed about their team.  
ERICA WHITE: I don't think they changed much, either. Tonight's game, we've
seen each other all year, and this time of year it's just hard. I would say
they just wanted it a little bit more, but different team? I don't see any
difference.  
  
Q. Lady Vols are a team you're going to want to see down the line for a
little bit of redemption?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: We ain't looking for pay back, but once we meet up again we'll
do a whole lot better than what we did in this tournament?  
ERICA WHITE: I agree.  
  
Q. You say they wanted it more. Does that bother you? Is that something that
will stay with you a little bit? Why do you think that was the case?  
ERICA WHITE: Does that bother me? You know, Tennessee won. Tennessee is the
SEC champion, so hats off to them. I look at my teammates and I look at the
stats sheet, and I don't see any difference on that stats sheet too much. The
only thing that I can think of, they had to have wanted it more than us. Maybe
they prayed more last night, I don't know.  
  
Q. Sylvia, how do you think you played tonight? You kind of got off to a
slow start. Were you a little hyped up like you were talking about the other
night?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't think I was hyped. I think I just was missing a couple
jiffies, didn't get a couple of calls that I thought was fouls. You can't live
in the past. You just have to come out and work hard, and I think I did that
in the second half.  
  
Q. What do either of you take from this game positive? Tell me something
about that.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Just our ability of sticking around and coming out and playing
hard and giving it our all. We all made a couple of mistakes, but just to
stick around and play the way we did, I take that as a positive standpoint?  
  
Q. You've played against Candace a lot of times. What was your impression of
her play tonight?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Same thing, she's going to come out, she's going to bang and
get her points. There's nothing you can do to stop her, you can only try to
slow her down, and that's what we tried to do tonight?  
  
Q. You guys won the regular season title ostensibly by beating them on their
home court. Now they win the most recent title, the tournament. Which would
you rather have?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Both (laughter). You sit here and you think about the things
that you need to do and the things you did wrong, but for the most part I'm
glad that we won the regular season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. For Coach?  
  
Q. Did you see a different team today from Tennessee?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: None whatsoever.  
  
Q. At the end of the first, you guys had a lot of momentum going your way
but then there were a few hollow possessions down there. Do you have feel that
would have been the turning point and if you made a few of those buckets you
could have come away with a W today?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought our missed free throws really hurt our momentum
more than anything throughout the game. We had two or three times we could
have really taken advantage of the situation. In a game like this you're
hunting separation, and our missed free throws, I don't know about that. The
rest of it was Tennessee's defense. They were pretty good today.  
I would say there was a little difference between this game and the other
game; probably their defense was better.  
  
Q. When I talked to you yesterday you said home court advantage wouldn't
play a factor here because you went into Knoxville and got that big-time W,
but every time some momentum swung their way everybody in orange was up on
their feet. Did that play a factor today?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Think that helped them. Up there we were able to remove the
crowd from the game by the way we played. But we just never could -- we needed
to make a play in the last three minutes to really kind of quiet their crowd,
and we could not make it offensively or defensively. Part of that was because
of how good they were.  
  
Q. The shot that Parker hit, I think it was just under two minutes to go,
shot clock was running down, she hit that jump shot. Is that one of the plays
you look back on, just a great player making a big-time play?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That's the difference in the game, shot clock is down, the
ball is outside with six, they're in disarray, they just throw it to her and
she makes a play. I thought that was the difference in the basketball game.  
  
Q. With 17 seconds left Quianna put up a shot. Was there miscommunication
there or did you want her to shoot that that soon?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: In Connecticut I took a time-out with a 17 seconds to go,
ran a three-point play, and it didn't work. Tonight we thought we would let it
run and hope to score and actually go for a two and score and call a time-out
and foul. But didn't none of it work. So when it doesn't work, it's always on
the coach. That was my fault.  
  
Q. What positives do you draw from tonight going into the postseason?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Here's what I told our players after the game: If Tennessee
is good enough to win a national championship, we are, too. We beat them at
home, we had a great game here today. I don't see much difference in the two
teams. That's what I see. Whatever they are, that's what I think they are.
Wherever you put them, we're right there.  
  
Q. Today was a record for an SEC tournament, over 12,000 fans. How good is
that for the college basketball women's game?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think it's great. Two of the greatest players to ever play
the game, two Olympians, great game, great excitement. Great game if you don't
care who wins or loses, except I do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, sir.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
COACH SUMMITT: If you don't mind, let them take questions first.  
  
Q. Big-time win tonight obviously in front of a nice home crowd. Talk about
what it's like headed into the NCAA Tournament right now.  
CANDACE PARKER: We're really excited to get this win tonight. We really want
to thank our fans because they're the best in America. It was like a home game
tonight, playing in front of all that orange. But we know that this is the SEC
Championship, and we have bigger fish to fry. We're going to celebrate
tonight, but when we go back next week we know we have to play for the NCAA
Championship.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about tonight's game.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I'm really proud of our team and how we played tonight and
stepped it up. Like Candace said, we have bigger fish to fry. We want to win
an NCAA Championship so we've got to go back to the gym and get to work.  
  
Q. Nicky, your thoughts on the game and on the crowd?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: LSU is a great team. We knew that coming in. But we knew we
were better, and we just tried to show it on the court. We played with a lot
of confidence. You know, Candace led us throughout the game, and she
definitely earned my respect every single time we stepped on the court in this
SEC Tournament.  
  
Q. Candace, you were tied at 54 and you hit that big shot with the shot
clock going down to zero. Can you talk about that play?  
CANDACE PARKER: I remember the shot clock was winding down and they passed to
Lex further out towards the three-point line so I called her name an threw my
hand up, she made a nice pass. I knew they knew the shot clock was winding
down, so I pump-faked and got a nice look.  
  
Q. You promised yesterday you'd be a different team tonight than you were
the first game. In what way were you different tonight? You said defense and
rebounding. Were there any other things you did tonight you didn't do in the
previous game?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, I think this team is a completely different team
than we were in the regular season. I think we play for postseason, and now
that we are here we have all stepped up our games. I feel like, yeah, defense
and rebounding was key, but we had each other's backs. Honestly, we just were
talking to each other and pulling through tough times. I mean, we really had
each other's backs.  
  
Q. Candace, Sylvia beat you out for SEC Player of the Year. Was there any
extra motivation going up against her tonight?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, postseason is what I play for and what our team
plays for. That gives a little bit of motivation and a little bit of incentive
to play harder. But I think we just came out and we stepped it up for our
postseason. We had something to prove. We lost regular season SEC to them, so
I think we came in with a chip on our shoulders.  
  
Q. With this being postseason, does this mean a little bit more, take the
edge off of losing that game, or will that one still remain in the craw as you
go into the NCAA?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Well, it was definitely motivation coming into this game as
far as a rematch was concerned. But as far as looking further into the
postseason, that's the past. It's time to build on it. Actually this is going
to be in the past and the postseason is a whole new season. It doesn't matter
what you did before. It's all about the six games to get to the championship.  
  
Q. Candace, playing the whole game as you did I would have thought you would
have been pretty tired, but then you sort of skipped down the bench and it
looked like you were in good shape. How tired were you, and were you able to
rest at all when you were in a zone? Were you able to maybe take a few
possessions off?  
CANDACE PARKER: I got my second wind when we won, skipping down the bench, to
answer that. Yeah, I feel like I was a little bit winded playing three games
in three days and playing 40 minutes. But honestly, my teammates had my back,
Nicky was in my ear, just to play hard on every possession. And I think
towards the end I used that and stepped up.  
  
Q. Tournament time is right around the corner. Is LSU a team that you want
to face again, or you don't really want to see them anymore seeing as they got
the win in Knoxville and they gave you a tough fight tonight?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: Honestly, we don't care who's on the list. We'll take whatever
opponent that they send to us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, players.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously I'm really proud of our basketball team. I thought
our defense was about as strong as it's been all season long.  
When we had to make stops, they did a nice job. I liked the fact that we were
able to change up our defenses. I thought that that worked to our advantage.  
The zone was really good to us in the first half, and we had some good zone
possessions in the second half. And then when we really needed to make stops,
you know, I asked them specifically, what do you want? And they wanted to go
with a man-to-man defense.  
I thought they did a great job of working in the high-low. Sylvia is so good.
She's just got great hands, one of the best inside players that we've seen in
the game. I was really pleased that we were able to obviously disrupt at
times, some of the high-low action, and also that we made plays down the
stretch against one of the best defensive teams in the country.  
  
Q. Mixing in the zone and particularly in the first half, was that -- would
you think fatigue in that strategy at all?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. I mean, that's why we played as much zone defense
against Vanderbilt as we did. We felt like that we had to be able to save at
least some of our legs, and of course we were going home and they were getting
in ice cold whirlpools, and I think that kept our legs a little bit --
probably a little more fresh because of that.  
But I still knew we played our starters too many minutes in our second game,
which concerned me. I think they just -- tonight they just came in and stayed
focused, and they played through fatigue. I thought the mental toughness -- I
thought Vicki was really key coming in and playing the way she played. She
made a difference in us closing out that game.  
  
Q. I just want to follow up on that. Was your plan all along that Candace
was going to play 40 minutes?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, she had talked to Dean, and Dean said that she may need a
time-out somewhere around the 15-minute mark, second half. I asked her if she
wanted to come out then, and she said, no, she wanted to stay in the game.  
She called one time-out herself. I said, if you need more timeouts let me
know, but I've only got two, and I may need them.  
I think that we had an understanding that she could come out if she wanted to,
she just chose not to in the end.  
  
Q. You've talked throughout the year or throughout the season about not
really knowing this team. How much better do you know it after this
tournament?  
COACH SUMMITT: I know the way they played in this tournament they're a team
that's got a chance to win the championship. I think for a team coming off a
championship, I think they had a hard time being motivated for 40 minutes game
in and game out. Fortunately with the schedule we played, that made it very
challenging in a lot of games.  
But I think right now they can see a light at the end of the tunnel. When you
can see something that is doable if you're willing to work for it, and they've
been there and they've been down that path, then I think right now they'll
have a lot of energy and a lot of passion for how they want to play in the
postseason, and certainly I'm going to give them at least the next three days
off and let them rest. I mean, I know there's a lot of fatigue that they're
going to deal with, so I'm just really proud of them, and we want to make sure
that we don't over-train in this time period.  
  
Q. A lot of orange in the audience tonight. Talk about what it was like
having everyone on their feet screaming, over 12,000 people?  
COACH SUMMITT: A difference-maker for us, to have this crowd. The one thing I
never take for granted, you're going to hear me say this a lot, is how
wonderful our Tennessee fans are. And when you talk about women's basketball,
you know, we have the greatest fans in the country. The numbers speak volumes.
We have people come from all over just to watch our team play in Nashville
that had never seen us play. It was amazing how many people were just coming
up and saying we came here from Montana, we came here from California, we love
the Lady Vols and we wanted to watch them play. It touches my heart because
when I started out coaching and there was 54 people that came to the first
game and then we got over 100, and we weren't even selling tickets, they were
getting in free.  
And to see where we are today and to see the impact, I feel that our fans have
had on women's basketball, and they certainly have been a great source of
energy and pride for our team, every team, and for our coaching staff, and
they're just tremendous.  
  
Q. I probably should have asked this of Candace, but she played really
poorly against LSU in the tournament last year, and she's played great against
LSU in both games this year. Do you think that game was a source of motivation
to her this year, or was that even a factor?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Candace after that game -- I think she took total
responsibility. She had, what, four points in that game, low energy. That's
the worst I've ever seen Candace Parker play, and I watched her play in high
school and AAUs and obviously had an opportunity to coach her and watch her
play these last two years. I just couldn't believe that Candace played the way
she played.  
I just think she learned from that, and I'm sure, as the team will tell you,
she said that won't ever happen again, and it hasn't.  
  
Q. To follow up that question, you talked about the game of women's
basketball. Tonight's record crowd, over 12,000 people, what is it like when
LSU and Tennessee get together and what kind of impact that has on women's
basketball?  
COACH SUMMITT: Any time you have the top two teams in your conference meet,
it's big. Obviously LSU has got great fans. Because of the match-ups we've
had, and they beat us out last year, and we're playing for a championship this
year, it was just great. I mean, it was great. I know television loved it and
I know the fans loved it. I have to believe there are a lot of eyes on this
game tonight and a lot of interest throughout this country because we are two
of the top teams in the country, we both are working and worked hard for a No.
1 seed.  
Someone suggested last week we might be a 2 seed, and I told our team, "Let's
win this tournament." I don't care what people are saying, it's all about what
you say through your game and what you do in the SEC. So I feel like both
these teams deserve No. 1 seeds.  
Thank you all for being here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Sarah Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16854)

### [Samantha Mahoney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18070)

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, disappointed with the outcome today. I thought that
after the good game we played last night we definitely had some confidence
coming into the game, and I thought our team really played hard, gave a lot of
effort. We were up against a very opponent, and I thought LSU played really
well today.  
But I would compliment our team. I think that it was not a lack of effort. I
think we had some execution breakdowns, and we did not have a good day
shooting. But I think going into postseason, our team plays with enough
intensity on defense and enough intensity rebounding that we have a chance to
beat anybody we play, and I'm looking forward to going into the postseason
with this team, and I'm real proud of what they've accomplished in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Samantha, you have played them pretty tough the last time. What was the
difference in today's game?  
SAMANTHA MAHONEY: I think our shooting was a key factor in the game today. I
think they really pushed the ball hard at us every time down the court to get
easy baskets. We didn't particularly guard them well in transition.  
  
Q. Do you feel like fatigue was at all a factor, having just played late
last night?  
SARAH ELLIOTT: I don't think it was a big factor because we work really hard
all year-round to keep in shape, and our physical and our endurance up. I
would not like to think that it was, but I'm sure eventually it did get to us,
but our mindset was to play hard and give everything we had. I believe we did
that, we just didn't want the outcome that we wanted.  
  
Q. Samantha, they kept a pretty comfortable lead the whole second half, but
at the same time they never were able to completely blow you guys out. You
hung tough, and Van commented earlier about how you guys never gave up and
threw in the towel?  
SAMANTHA MAHONEY: Well, we knew if we could keep the game close we'd have a
chance at the end like we did in Baton Rouge. That's what we were telling
ourselves today. We were down in the last four teams in this tournament and we
didn't want to give up that easily.  
  
Q. Sarah, what makes Fowles such a difficult and tough match up from your
perspective?  
SARAH ELLIOTT: She's a all-American. She's great hands, great touch, she's
very athletic. All you can do is be physical with her, play her tough. All I
can do is just give her my best, and I know she's going to get baskets and I
have to expect that and be understanding of that. I just have to limit her
baskets, do my best to do that. She's just a great all-around player, and I
give her props. She works hard.  
  
Q. Can either one of you talk about the postseason and where you think you
should be and if you think you played your way in?  
SAMANTHA MAHONEY: Well, of course we want to be in the NCAA Tournament. I
think we beat a few ranked teams this year, we've played a lot of top teams
really tough down to the wire. We really competed hard in our conference. We
extended it to nine wins now, I believe it is. And I think we really deserve
to be in the NCAA tournament.  
SARAH ELLIOTT: We competed very hard all season. We had one of the tougher
seasons in the nation, played LSU and Tennessee twice, and we both -- we
fought very hard each one, and I believe that we deserve to go and, you know,
give it our all because I believe that our defense can definitely keep us in
the tournament. We play with everything that we've got every game, and we're
just not willing to give up, and I think that's a very big thing.  
I mean, I love this team, and I know we all desperately and lovingly want to
go into the NCAA.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Anything for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you just answer the question that they did about the NCAA?  
COACH MITCHELL: I will now answer that question. We've been talking around it
for a while. Look, I think it comes down to what the committee values, and I'm
not sure I have a good grasp on that or if anyone knows. And it's a
complicated process, but I think our case is pretty simple. Are you going to
reward a team based on the team they started out to be or the team they
became?  
I think our players deserve a lot of credit for undergoing a coaching change,
having to make that transition was not easy. Having to play one of the top
schedules in the country, and having to do that in the pre-conference portion
with significant injuries to significant contributors on the team. I think
that is a piece of the puzzle that people have to look at.  
You know, wherever our league stacks up, a team that wins nine games against
Southeastern Conference competition, if we're not a team that's worthy of
strong consideration or even in the tournament, I don't know what they're
going to say that they really value. I don't know what the case against us is
going to be besides five of our losses are against Tennessee and LSU. I mean,
that's one part of it.  
We didn't duck and run, and we could have scheduled in a manner that would
have gotten us to 20 wins, but I don't know if we would have become the team
that we were able to be or that we are today had we done that. I'm real proud
of our players.  
I told them in the locker room I'm going to talk to whoever I can talk to and
I'll fight for them because they have gone through a whole lot this year, and
to come out -- I think we saw last night we earned our top-four seed. We
advanced. It was not a flukey-type game. We came out and we knew we had to
win, and we won that game. I think there's a lot to be said about Kentucky,
and I think that we are extremely deserving.  
  
Q. You've just played a team that has still not lost an SEC game this year,
yet you stayed in it, you never threw in the towel. How proud are you?  
COACH MITCHELL: I'm very proud of our effort today. I thought that LSU -- I
have so much respect for them. Not only are they talented, they play extremely
hard and they play with a lot of discipline, and you don't always see that
from real talented teams. I don't see LSU taking a lot of shortcuts, and I'm
so impressed with the way that they play and carry themselves.  
So I have a lot of respect for them, and to see our players go out and battle
and to see our players prepare this morning and listen and really want to come
in and win this game is something that I think speaks to what kind of team we
have been able to become.  
  
Q. With the NCAA right around the corner and a possible berth coming you
guys' way, when you get there is it something you think your team is going to
be playing a little bit better seeing as the last team you faced was LSU, a
team with their caliber?  
COACH MITCHELL: That's another case I would make for our chances going into
the tournament. I don't know anybody that would draw us and go, boy, I'd
really like to play Kentucky in the first round of the NCAA tournament. I
think they would look at the way we play, and we play really, really hard-
nosed, really aggressive and tough, we're going to guard every time we take
the floor, we're going to rebound every time we take the floor, we're going to
find ways to win. I don't know that anybody would be jumping up and down if
they drew us in the NCAA tournament.  
So I would have a lot of confidence in our group going into it. We have played
the top teams in the country. We know what it's like to compete against them.
So I would go in with an extremely high level of confidence if we were to get
a bid.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Thomas was able to do in the first half? You guys
seemed to be sagging off of her to get some fouls and she made a few key shots
for them?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, Thomas was 5 for 10 in the first half and then 0 for 7
in the second half, and we just were going to ride that and play those
percentages, and I thought -- we could live with her 5 of 10, we couldn't live
with 14 from the line, and I apologize for beating LSU up, we were so hard and
tough on them. But in all seriousness, we fouled too much in the first half.
So our players were clear on what the game plan was, and -- she's a good
player and she did a good job. She did a much better job today than she did in
Baton Rouge, but that was the game plan with her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Quianna Chaney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18071)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, when you're ready, just an opening comment.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Give Kentucky some credit for playing well tonight. I
thought they did a good job of defending us. They played really well.  
Then I thought our two oldest players, Fowles and Chaney, were pretty good. I
thought Ashley Thomas gave us some big points early, but I thought when we had
Chaney's 7 for 10, Sylvia's 6 for 9, they let them out of 12 free throws, and
that's pretty good. You've got to have seniors in this league to win, so our
two seniors stepped up.  
Ask the players questions.  
  
Q. Just talk about the big-time win tonight. You know you're back in the
championship game. What are you looking to do different this year than you did
last year?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I think just our mental focus and our toughness to come out
and play well as a team and just make sure we play team ball and stick
together.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I'll agree, focus and come out and play for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Have you guys put aside to this point the goal of winning this tournament
since you haven't done it, but now that it's here how badly do you want it?
How much is the desire there for this title, especially since you haven't won
it?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's like a sense of urgency. You want to win it real bad but
you've got to calm down and make sure you come out on the right note. I know
me personally I always get over-hyped for games like this, and I learned how
to calm down and let the game come to me, so I'll be looking forward to the
game tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you played Tennessee before you went down 16 and then you turned
that around. Why did you all start so slow, and then what changed to enable
you to take over and take the lead?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I don't usually take over like this, but we will not answer
in questions in regard to playing Tennessee at this time because Tennessee has
got to win a game, I'm sorry. I'm not being rude, I'm not going to get in that
deal. I'm sorry, I really respect you, but we will not answer those questions.
You can ask anything else you want to ask.  
  
Q. Talk about you kept Kentucky in foul trouble from early on. That didn't
really allow them to establish the game than that they wanted to. Would you
attribute some of that to the win tonight, you guys were able to play loose
and keep running on them?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Yes, I'd say that was part of our game plan was to run. We
know they send the majority of their players to the boards, so we had the
great opportunity to run. We got them in foul trouble early on, and that's
something that was a part of our game plan, as well.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you didn't play that much against Ole Miss. It was such an easy
win tonight. You got 30 minutes. Do your legs feel pretty good? Do you feel
pretty rested going into this championship game?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yes, I'm feeling very rested for the most part, but even if I
do have that doubt, I'm pretty sure our trainer, she'll do a great job of
getting us rested tonight.  
  
Q. I apologize if this has been asked before, but what's the difference
between this game and the last time you played UK as far as from you guys'
perspective?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: If you ask me, I don't think it really was a big difference. I
don't feel we played our best basketball tonight, but we ended up with a win,
so I'm grateful for the win.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Here's what we'll do in fairness to you. When this game is
over with, I think we'll still be here, and really quick-like if you would
like to ask our players a question at the end of this game, we'll be glad to
answer it at that time because we'll have a winner.  
I want to have access to the press. We need the press, and I don't want to cut
that out. Is that a fair deal to everybody? So you can get to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Before the tournament I was reading articles, and you were talking about
that you focused more on LSU this year and things that you needed to improve.
What do you think that your team has improved the most at thus far?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I don't think there's any doubt the most improvement they've
made is having a little fun, just fun, just enjoying playing and having fun,
winning the SEC championship and stopping at Dairy Queen and having ice cream.
I think that's important if you want my honest opinion, in coaching and
dealing with players.  
I think the second thing now that you want to hear is offensively. We have
made some changes. We've got people like Chaney we're just letting shoot. If
you touch it and you feel good, shoot it. We've made some changes in the
offense a little bit, a little more screen on the ball, a little more set
plays, not a lot of set plays. We actually put in a play today that worked
really well for us. We called it BB, named it after Basketball Bob. I'll take
credit for it, but that's what we ran.  
  
Q. You played two games that were vastly different with UK this time around.
How did this game kind of look to you?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought this was a carbon copy of the game in Baton Rouge.
I thought the game with UK up there we played really, really well and shot the
ball and scored, and they didn't defend us like they defended us the last two
games. The last two games went almost identical except at the end. They had
not played last night before, and I thought we were able to wear them down. We
didn't play many minutes, and then at the end we were able to stretch it out a
little bit, whereas as home it went down to the very last play.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Ashley Thomas?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought that was the difference in the game tonight. First
time she's ever had a double-double. To put one in front of Sylvia and one
behind her, they tried to double Chaney, and when they did that left her open
and she made some big shots. She hit some shots. She made some shots. And then
she rebounded the ball unbelievable. That's the best she's rebounded the ball
since I've been in Baton Rouge.  
  
Q. You maintained a double-figure lead throughout the second half but you
never could turn the game into a blowout. Talk about Kentucky's effort and the
toughness they played with?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought Kentucky had great effort. You know, I thought
they played hard. You go back and think about it, they've beaten Georgia twice
in a season. Kentucky plays really hard. Matthew Mitchell is a greedy kind of
person in life, and I kind of thought the team reflected it. They could have
threw in the towel when we were up 17, but they didn't. Mahoney has done a
great job.  
You know, when she moved to the point that really helped them in my mind. That
other little kid is tough and really played well, but she's just a tough
match-up for us at the point. She's really a good player. And Elliott is --
what I hate most, I miss Elliott's daddy. I sat in the stands tonight and
listened to him. He plays as hard as she does, and I enjoyed dad as much as I
enjoyed watching Georgia and Kentucky play.  
  
Q. Your first answer in what's changed about LSU is that they're having more
fun, that you went to Dairy Queen as soon as you won the regular season title.
Are you doing anything fun with them tonight?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: At LSU we don't celebrate semifinal wins. I don't mean that
bad. We're going to celebrate the championships. That will probably be
milkshakes or something, I don't know.  
  
Q. Sylvia was mentioning that she tended to get too hyped up sometimes for
big games. Is this something you've talked to her about early in the year, or
how has that come about?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We talked to her about watching fouls. You cannot get in
foul trouble. Then we talked to her about that you were going to get banged
across in the lane. Don't let that bother you. Then we said get in big games
and just -- you're a great player. Sometimes Sylvia, you think Sylvia is a
great player.  
Sylvia don't think that all the time. So in turn I tell her all the time, I
don't never talk to her -- I usually call her big one or a great player. Great
players think they've got to make great plays and they've got to be a factor
in the game, and you can't be a factor in the game if you're all nervous and
hyped up.  
  
Q. No matter who you play tomorrow, I think it's safe to say that the winner
is going to be from the state of Tennessee. Are you going to tell your ladies
anything tonight, tomorrow morning, not to get wrapped up into the team that
has the home field advantage?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We don't even mention that. We played Tennessee in
Knoxville, they had 17,000, 16,000. We don't bring that up. All you're doing
is creating a negative in the players' minds. Last time I checked the basket
was ten feet high, and if we can put it in there we'll win. We're just looking
forward to playing in the game. We'll actually start just as soon as the game
is over with and we will prepare for the players in the morning. We won't be
-- we want them to get a good night's rest and then we'll be meeting with them
in the morning, not tonight.  
  
Q. You mentioned the play that you all put in for today's game. Can you go
into a little more detail about it without giving it away? The play that you
put in, the BB?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We just tried to put in -- we run a lot of motion here so we
can put in quick hitters on the day of the game that nobody had scouted. We
put a little play in for Chaney. She didn't score off of it but big Syl scored
three times off of it. They were doubling us outside and I thought it was a
good move by Bob.  
I want to say this, too, the player most unappreciated at LSU is Erica White.
We bring Chaney in here, we bring her in here, we get questions about Thomas'
play. Poor old Erica runs this team, is the whole heart of our team and gets
very little credit in some people's minds. In the coaches' minds a lot of
credit.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Jennifer Risper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18063)

### [Christina Wirth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16901)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, I was really proud of our effort. I thought we came out
really strong, and they had been starting games unbelievably. I think we did a
great job being ready to play. Defensively I couldn't ask for a better effort.
Offensively, you know, we really struggled. They really picked up their
defense and their denial and took things away from our offense. I think that
really we had a lot of opportunities that we didn't take advantage of, and
eventually they started offensive rebounding, which they do so well.  
But really, I think we've played them harder each time we've played them this
year, and like I said, I'm proud of how much we've improved as a team.  
  
Q. As Melanie mentioned, getting better each time, is that a little tough
when you've had the losses to come back and try and find the improvement, and
obviously you started much better tonight? Do you think you're getting there?
And how much do you think you've improved over these games?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I definitely don't think it's hard to come back. I think that
every time we play them we're excited about the opportunity that we have, and
I think tonight we came out fired up. Like you said, when we played them at
home they came out and jumped on us early so tonight we had a focus on really
attacking them, you know and just going for it. We had nothing to lose.
They're a higher seed, higher ranking if that means anything, so we just came
out. Yeah, we're getting better all year long, so any time we have an
opportunity like this to test us, we're excited about it.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk about the struggles you've had in the last two games
offensively? Are they putting some special defenses on you, or what's going on
there?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I mean, I think teams know that I'm a shooter so I think that
they're starting to do a better job than early in the season. I had wide open
looks pretty much every game, and now I don't get those wide open looks as
much. I did get those looks, so did Merideth Marsh and our other shooters, we
just didn't knock them down. I thought gen did awesome this entire tournament.
We just need to find a way to hit those shots. Yeah, they had good defensive
pressures, but shooters have to keep shooting, and that's what we're going to
do.  
  
Q. You had 15 rebounds yesterday, nine rebounds today. What's your secret?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I don't know. I just want to get it. We do a lot of drills in
practice where we're fighting hard and just competing a lot, so I think it's
just carrying over into the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. For Coach?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the tempo of the game, especially in the second
half?  
COACH BALCOMB: What about the tempo?  
  
Q. It seemed like there were a lot of long possessions on both ends of the
court, and was that by design or was that because of the defense of both of
the teams?  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, the score was 26 to 20 in the second half, so I think
both teams were playing very hard defence. We've played each other three
times. We know each other very well. It's like an NCAA game. Both teams are
very prepared, they're both very successful, and you're going to see great
defensive efforts and people being taken away from things. And it's going to
be hard to get shots, so you're not going to be able to make one pass and
score. It's not going to be easy. So that slowed the tempo down more.  
Yes, obviously they're very, very good in transition, and that was one of our
goals was to slow them down and to stop them -- we held them to 26 points in
the second half, and this is a team that scores 80 and 90 a night, so I think
that was definitely a big part of our game plan and was successful.  
  
Q. You talked last time you guys played about the height differential, the
speed and the athleticism. Does it come down to that again tonight?  
COACH BALCOMB: Personally I don't think it did. I think they hit shots and we
didn't. Who would have thought we'd shoot 2 for 17 from three and had open
looks from especially Tina Wirth and Merideth Marsh who are two of the best
three-point shooters in the country, that they generally make. They shot the
ball really well from three, especially in the first half. We did a better job
getting out on their shooters in the second half.  
I don't think it's so much height and athleticism, but they do have one of the
best players in the country, and that changes your team defensively. Candace
Parker changes a game. You've got to play her a certain way and try to take
away her without giving too much to everybody else. So that makes it even more
difficult.  
But the fact that we held them to 63 points, I don't think that happens to
them a lot. I think that that's something that's going to give us an
opportunity to make a run in the NCAAs, and in the postseason that's where we
want to be defensively. Offensively we didn't make the shots. We had them but
we did not make them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2008

  

### [Nicky Anosike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16903)

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously second half I thought our defense really
stepped up for us. We went with a little bigger, more athletic lineup, which I
thought helped us run our five defense, basically our switching, man to man.  
That to me was a big difference. And opened up the game obviously with too
many turnovers, just a little bit too careless and maybe over-anxious
offensively.  
But I think that when you get to the free-throw line, shoot well from the
line, and obviously Candace did a good job for us, and also just working hard
for the basketball. I thought Nicky Anosike had a tremendous defensive game.
Her presence made a big difference in what Vanderbilt was able to see and able
to do, so really pleased with our seniors and their play.  
  
Q. Nicky, the regular season loss to LSU, could you just kind of -- what did
the team come away with from that game? What did you learn in that game?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think the main lesson that we learned from that game is that
even though you're up by a lot, you've still got to keep fighting and pushing
and you should never let up, and the effort still has to be there.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk a little bit about the defense in this game? You
guys have played excellent defense in this tournament, how important is that
for you guys right now?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think we really picked up our defense, especially in the
second half and towards the end of the first half. Like Coach said, we had a
big lineup in there and we were able to just play to our strengths. We had a
lot of defense translate into offense and transition and things like that. So
I think we really did a great job of just playing defense and playing
together.  
  
Q. Nicky, you guys had to play Vanderbilt for a third time. How difficult is
that to beat a team three times in one season?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think what makes it so hard is that they know our tendencies
and we know their tendencies, but I guess the team that plays the best defense
and rebounds the hardest is the team that's going to come out with the win. We
knew that going in, and we heard all the stories about how they've never lost
in this building, but we just stayed strong, I guess.  
  
Q. Candace, can you just also talk about the match-up tomorrow against LSU,
what you all will take from the last game going into tomorrow?  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I mean, they beat us on our home floor, and they won the
SEC championship outright, so obviously we have incentive going in. But what
it's going to come down to is defense and rebounding and playing a 40-minute
game. I think we're a completely different team than we were when we played
them, and I think we're going to play with energy and play for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you. For Coach?  
  
Q. Starting out Vandy went into that 1-3-1 defense and you didn't have a lot
of success. What did you do to change that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I just thought we were standing on offense, so we just
went into some different offensive sets to attack them better and even went
with a triangle, a high post and two low-post players.  
I think when you're not shooting the ball very well, you can become stagnant,
and I thought they were early, but then we picked our pace up. We had to rely
a lot -- we only shot 22 percent in the second half, and I've always believed
you're going to have some of those nights, not that you didn't have good shot
selection, but obviously you just didn't make shots. We experienced that in
both halves. I just really felt like that we stepped up at halftime -- we
talked at halftime a lot about having to be a better defensive team because we
know Vanderbilt, we run a lot of great action.  
But I thought the key for us was that we just got the ball moving a little bit
quicker and then we got on the glass. We got on the glass, and that really
helped us, particularly in the second half. We weren't out on the boards.
Candace had one defensive at halftime, Nicky was the only one that seemed
committed to rebounding, and when you're not making shots you've got to get on
the glass.  
  
Q. Candace said they're a completely different team than when you played
LSU. What's different about the team now? It wasn't that long ago.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think that game was a definite wake-up call. I think that
they realized that they had just been playing in spurts. I mean, you think of
the number of times we've gotten off to a huge lead, only to see it dwindle
away and then us have to fight to the bitter end and the last possession to
win a game.  
I think that that was a costly one for them. They knew they probably had lost
the SEC regular season title, and they really had no one to blame but
themselves. That was probably when we had our best player meeting and coaches-
player meeting. I think that's when they took ownership. I told them -- we had
gotten away with being a team that played in spurts and playing the scoreboard
instead of playing the game with great passion for 40 minutes. I said, if
you're going to be a championship-caliber team you've got to do it.  
I've said a number of times, it is difficult to motivate a team coming off of
a championship with the exception of the '98 team. They were different.  
  
Q. Talk about the difference in the three-point shooting. They were 2 for 17
and you were 6 for 19.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think Vanderbilt has been very committed to the three-
ball, and I think we did a better job of extending our defense. I think our
switching man really helped us because when they set the ball screens in the
first half, you know, we were trapping the wing, and running what we call our
Velcro in the middle of the floor with a hedge and going under.  
But I thought in the second half we were more aggressive and we were switching
and closing out on the basketball a little bit better. So I think the shots
were more contested than anything.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the tempo was upbeat again tonight, and later on
between the first -- at the end of the first half. Is that what you're going
to need to have versus LSU tomorrow night?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we -- I think our team is best when we play up-
tempo. We're looking to score in early offense without having to always think
setup. This team, I think they really thrive on that, as well, and that's
where our defense has to generate our primary opportunities. We've done a
pretty good job of that. And also just getting our guards to get to the paint
in transition. Candace has done a great job in this tournament of running to
the rim. So that puts a lot of pressure on the defense and also opens up the
inside-out options, as well.  
But I think everyone that knows our team knows that we want to play up-tempo.
We want to run at you but not necessarily with you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow night, Coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Ashley Houts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18037)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Angel Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18059)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH LANDERS: I thought it was a very hard-fought game for the most part. We
picked up a couple of quick fouls in the post early in the game, and I elected
to go zone, and quite honestly I feel like that I stayed -- I kept us in it
too long. They were able to knock down a couple of threes and build a sizable
lead at the half.  
And then we came out the second half, I was really pleased and proud of Angel
and our basketball team because they did a nice job, her teammates did a nice
job of getting her the basketball in the second half after really being
challenged and really kind of playing poorly in the first half, she really
established herself there and brought us back and basically got us very, very
close again, along with the assistance from her teammates. But we never really
did get it over the hump. I thought Elliott hurt us early and then hurt us
again late.  
  
Q. Ashley, could you kind of talk about the offense and why it never could
really get going? Was it more their defense?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: I think it was a combination of both. We missed some easy shots
there towards the middle of the second half and just really couldn't find our
groove and get in it good and score. And I think when you miss easy shots and
open looks that it definitely affects the way you think on offense, and for
the most part play on defense.  
But I think we had some -- we stepped up in the second half, we just couldn't
get over the hump, and I think when you miss some easy shots, you just can't
get in your groove.  
  
Q. Ashley, I know the seeds say Kentucky was supposed to win this game, but
I can tell by the emotion that you have that you guys feel like maybe you're
not playing at a level that you can and you're a better team than you showed.
Is that pretty much a fair assessment?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: Yeah. We didn't really look at the seeds coming in. We knew we
wanted to come out and make a statement because of what they did to us in
Athens. And we didn't do that because we didn't win the game.  
It's just something we've got to get better at. We've got to go as a team and
get better and go to work in practice and just continue to improve.  
  
Q. Angel, how important -- it got 39-39 and you guys turned it over. How
important would it have been to get over the hump there and why couldn't you
push past that point?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: I believe that point right there should have been handled in
the first half. We played poorly in the first half. It shouldn't have been
that close.  
As far as coming out offensively, I don't think we did a good job setting up
well, communicating on both sides of the floor.  
We did need to push it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how Humphrey being ineffective affected the team
essentially?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, she's someone that offensively we depend on, so it's
tough, a little tougher for us when she can't produce. But you know, when you
look at the shots that we got and our shooting percentages across the board,
you know, it really isn't that impressive. We had pretty good shooters go 3 of
11, 2 of 8, 3 of 12. You know, and we got some pretty good looks at it.  
I know we threw up probably four trying to beat the shot clock.  
But you can't -- I just don't feel like we can at all lay it at Tasha's feet.
As I said, I thought Angel was less than effective in the first half. I think
she could have maybe established something there that might have changed the
way that the game would be played. And then in the second half she did that.
You know, that was obvious that they were going to do everything that they
could do to keep Tasha from scoring, sagging and bringing the double. But they
did not treat Angel that way, so Angel had the opportunity to make up for it,
and could have, and did in the second half, and I'm proud of that.  
  
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys had a pretty good feeling coming
into the tournament from the standpoint of closing the season strong and
giving Tennessee a challenge there. What do you do to regain some confidence
in this team, or is that not really a factor?  
COACH MITCHELL: That's a tough question. You know, without going into any
detail, and I won't go into any detail, I've pushed a lot of buttons. I've
tried a lot of different things this year. Some I'd probably go back and wish
that I hadn't tried, to get this basketball team to respect and appreciate the
right to play Georgia basketball.  
As you recall before the season, we talked about getting a swagger back and
embracing a work ethic that I felt like we had gotten away from, and we just
haven't gotten that yet. I thought it showed tonight. I thought Kentucky came
out and pushed us around. They pushed our post out of the blocks and off the
blocks in the first half.  
And then it's interesting, I said to our post players, we have to do a better
job of screening, and they did, they really did. They got together and they
really started to screen well. And then son of a gun, Kentucky's defensive
people started -- we were making slower cuts than we should have been making
and Tennessee's defensive people on the cutter started guarding them, so the
shots that we were getting in the first half off of bad screens for our
guards, we couldn't get off of good screens in the second half.  
And again, it's just -- and all that, you can't fix it here. You can't fix it
at shoot-around today. Those are big-time investments that players make on a
day-to-day basis. I thought in the fall that we were headed in that direction
of getting it back, but it slipped off the table.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Alexis Hornbuckle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16879)

### [Candace Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16368)

### [Pat Summitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14068)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, an opening comment and then we'll take
questions for the players, then come back to questions for you.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I thought our basketball team came in with great energy.
Certainly being able to score off of our defense early and just by pushing
tempo. I thought Shannon really got the ball and got us some good open-court
looks. Candace ran the floor hard and was consistent in running hard, and
obviously that gave us a chance to score in transition.  
I thought our guard play between Shannon and Lex was really solid, and that's
exactly what we need, and I think it's what we have to have to be the kind of
basketball team that we need to be, not only in this game but as we move
forward.  
So overall a good effort, good energy. Good off the bench. Vicky Ball brings a
lot of energy and certainly did a nice job coming in, and Nicky Anosike is
always doing a lot of the things that go unnoticed but her defense and her
toughness and just how hard she works at both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about your shooting game today. This looked like a real
upgrade for you. What was going on today?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I just tried to come into the game and relax and let the
game come to me and not force anything. My teammates were doing a great job of
just running the floor and pushing the ball inside, so I just took any open
opportunity I could.  
  
Q. Question for Candace. Can you talk about you and Shannon hooking up in
transition and how much better that makes you guys?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think we've really emphasized in practice the last couple
days just up tempo and pushing the tempo every chance we get on makes or
misses, so I think Shannon did a great job of just looking up the floor, and I
just told her I was in a run, and she made some really nice passes.  
  
Q. Alexis, in the second half there was a play where you were leading a
break up the left side and you kind of looked back to the middle, Candace was
there and somebody else. You misfired and sure enough, somebody picks it up
and hits a three. When things are going good for you guys, even a bad play can
turn into something nice?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: That definitely does happen. I definitely saw Vicky's ball
first, and then I saw Candace, and a girl hit my arm so I misfired. Luckily
Angie was there to pick it up and knock down the shot.  
  
Q. Since you made your decision that this is your last year, is there more
of a sense of urgency with tournament time coming?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly I think there's always a sense of urgency. This is
what everybody plays for in the postseason, and I know our team has stepped it
up. You know, this is the time of year that you play for.  
  
Q. They seemed to have so much trouble underneath early. One of their post
people was 1 for 8. How much do you kind of discourage them from thinking that
they can score those kind of easy baskets, and is that an early victory that
kind of sets the tone?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, Nicky and Vicky and Alex really try to take pride in
if the guards get beat or if our men are in the paint or anything like that,
own the paint and making people earn their baskets. I know myself, I felt like
I disciplined my team early on in the season because when people penetrated or
something like that in there, I wasn't there to block a shot. I think just
having a post presence and having the type of bodies that we worked hard on,
that discourages easy shots.  
  
Q. Candace, could you talk about just the way this team played overall
offensively today? It looked like you got a lot of nice things going here at
the start of this tournament?  
CANDACE PARKER: I remember before the game, Nicky an Vicki pulled us all
together and said we didn't start off the tournament last year well at all,
and that it set the tone for our loss to LSU in the semifinals last year. We
all knew that we had to come to play. Florida is a great team; they were
playing well. I think we just decided to play with a lot of energy, and we
played a 40-minute game. Didn't we?  
COACH SUMMITT: We did (laughter). I'm glad to say that. It makes me happy.  
CANDACE PARKER: It's on the record. Write that down, please (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Maybe you can expand on the fact that you finally got that 40-minute
effort you've been looking for.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think it's sometimes -- and I've talked about this, but
coming off of a national championship, it can be very challenging in terms of
getting the players to understand how they need to play every possession and
have a sense of urgency, and as coaches you always feel that.  
But I think with this team, they had so many returning players that I think in
some regard they wanted -- if they could, they would probably have said let's
fast-forward this season and get to the postseason. You want them to always
enjoy the process, and I think they have. But I think at times they've just
played in spurts and just tried to be able to close out games. And that's what
really, I think, hurt us in our last loss against LSU, and take nothing away
from LSU, they just dominated us in the second half.  
I think we're very focused. I think they came in focused, and if today is any
indication and we can build on that, then I feel like our basketball team is
going to be ready to play.  
  
Q. Florida seemed to hang around in the first half and then you kind of blew
it open the second half. What was the difference there?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think a couple things. We changed our defensive scheme,
and I think the change was good for us. But at the same time I thought we did
a little bit better job on the glass and on the defensive boards, got in
passing lanes and created some opportunities in the open floor that gave us
easy scoring options. I just think our play was better. Alexis and Shannon
played really well, but Alberta came in and was very efficient for us, as
well. That's something we haven't had in the past consistently is great guard
play.  
I don't think we can win this tournament here, I don't think we can get to
Tampa, if we don't have great guard play.  
  
Q. LSU really had an easy time of it today. Was it significant that your
team, as well, didn't really have to exert or extend itself when you think
about going through the entire tournament?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think it's important for us as a coaching staff to be
mindful of winning and taking the opportunity to not give extended minutes.  
I know we were talking about it coming out of halftime, they said, "we need to
press, we need to press." I said, "no, we don't need to press."  
I understand, because they're a lot like I am, and with Nicky and Holly, they
both played in the program, so they know we're all about keeping pressure on
with our defense and extending our defense. But I told our team I'd really
like to run our match-up zone as well as we could as well as our three-two
zone and get better in the half court. I certainly never told them we weren't
going to play hard by any means.  
I think we had some good looks at what we needed to do to cover the three-
ball, and they adjusted well out of it for the most part, our team did.  
  
Q. I had kind of a silly question. How's your shoulder doing?  
COACH SUMMITT: My shoulder is fine. That raccoon is in bad shape.  
  
Q. Which shoulder was it?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was my right shoulder. Anyway, not a very good decision on
my part. Sometimes I tend to react without thinking. But I am here, alive and
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, we'll see you tomorrow.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Chelsea Chowning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18057)

### [Sarah Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16854)

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll have an opening comment for you and take questions
for the players.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're obviously very pleased to win this game tonight,
just really proud of our players. Our players gave a supreme effort, and we
knew we would have to. We had to fight all year long to win games, and this
was an outstanding victory for us.  
We talked about trying to use the bye to our advantage. We had fought hard to
earn that fourth seed, and we wanted to try to use it and make something of
it. It hasn't happened a lot of times at Kentucky, so it's a testament to our
players to have gotten in this position and then taken advantage of it, and
really a game that we had to win. That's a difficult position to be in.  
We talked about that before the game. And I'm just real proud of the way our
players responded. Great, great night for the Kentucky Wildcats.  
  
Q. Sarah, talk about what this win means because you scored ten of your 16
in the first half, but in the second half you scored the two big baskets when
your team needed it.  
SARAH ELLIOTT: We just basically, before the game, talked about like how we
just needed to pull together and believe in ourselves because that's what it's
going to come down to. Whatever happens during the game, we have ups, downs,
goods, bads, we have to be there for each other and we did that. Each and
every one of us just fought and that's what caused us to have a great outcome
and the W.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you talk about the pressure that was on you guys to win this
game knowing that it would be the end of the season if you lost?  
CHELSEA CHOWNING: I don't think we necessarily felt it as pressure. I think we
just -- really it energized us because we knew if we didn't come out with a
win today our season would be over, and we don't think we're a team that
deserves for our season to be over right now.  
So I think that it took all 15 people on our team and all of our coaches
coming together and realizing what we had to do to win this game, and it was a
rough game. We had the lead at halftime, but we really -- they challenged us
in the second half, but we responded, and I think it shows a whole lot about
our team's character that we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Chelsea, I think it was a six-point lead inside two minutes, and you
chased from behind and blocked a shot that could have got them within four.
Can you talk about that play? Sarah, since you seemed to like it you can talk
about it?  
CHELSEA CHOWNING: I think it was a three on one, and I don't know, I was just
the only one that was back on defense. I think it was a messed up possession
on offense and I was the only one back and I tried to pass the ball and make
Houts pick it up and she did, and threw a real good pass to No. 24, Darrah,
and I just went up and blocked it and I was able to get the rebound.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you talk about that three-pointer going right into halftime,
the momentum that gave you?  
CHELSEA CHOWNING: Well, we were trying to go inside to Sarah, and I don't know
if Sarah touched the ball on that possession but everyone else did, and we had
really good ball movement. Amani dumped a pass down to Vic and it was a really
good pass. I didn't know how much time was left at that point, but I saw they
all collapsed inside so I called for the ball and Vic saw me and I just caught
it. I knew there couldn't be much time so I just shot it. That was a really
big momentum swing going into the half.  
I think when we played Georgia they had a similar play going into halftime
where they got the momentum off of a three going into the half, so it was nice
for it to be our turn.  
  
Q. Chelsea, this is the first time Kentucky has ever beaten Georgia in the
SEC Tournament. How big is that for this program?  
CHELSEA CHOWNING: It's a very big win. They're a great team. This is also the
first team that I think we've beaten twice this season, so that's another
accomplishment.  
They're a really tough team, and I think that we were really fortunate to have
the bye. I think the fact that Alabama challenged them yesterday helped us out
because we were refreshed today. They put up a tough fight, but I was really
proud of our team and how we really unified and came together to win.  
SARAH ELLIOTT: Last year we played them, I think it was the second round, and
we got crushed. We came together this year, and it was just like -- leave
everything out there, no matter if we get crushed or if it's within two points
or whatever, even if we're up. I don't think Georgia was expecting us to come
out with such a momentum of speed so quickly. I think it kind of caught them
off balance and worked out for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. For the coach?  
  
Q. You were up by ten, and then they pulled it back to even and then you
build it back up to ten. What did that tell you about their resolve tonight?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were obviously pleased to build it up to ten, and I
thought that the way that the energy our players came out with tonight was
really a big factor in the game. I can't tell you how much respect I have for
Georgia and their program and Coach Landers and their players, and so I was
keenly aware that a run would take place in the second half, and so when
you're playing a good team like that, any time you can gain an advantage and
create a cushion, so to speak, it's big, because it gives your players
confidence.  
But I was very proud that our players responded. I didn't sense any panic in
us at all, and we talked about that in the huddle I think when it was 41-40,
if they took the lead one or two points, let's don't worry about that because
I really felt like we had done a good job of what I talked about in the
opening, using the bye to our advantage and trying to get into their legs a
little bit. I don't know if that was a factor or not but that's what we were
trying to do, and I was just trying to tell the team let's hang in there
because I felt like we could run it back out again if we just kept guarding
the way we were guarding.  
  
Q. Talk about what a win like this does for you going into tomorrow night
against a team like LSU?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, LSU is going to be obviously the favorite in the game,
and it's a tough, physical match-up for us. But I think the way you saw our
team battle tonight and fight and come out with that type of energy, we gave
LSU a heck of a game down in Baton Rouge, so I'm going to point that out to
our players and tell them they need to gain confidence in that. We know the
only way we can go to the NCAA Tournament for certain is to win tonight -- we
had to win tonight, so the only way we can keep that alive for us is to win
tomorrow.  
We came down here to win the tournament. We knew we had a good SEC run and we
were confident that we could come down here and make a run at the tournament.
We'll go out and play to win tomorrow night and see if we can get a victory.
It'll be very difficult, but I told our coaches, any time you play on Saturday
in the SEC tournament it's going to be a difficult game. I'm proud of our team
tonight, and we'll get ready for LSU.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the adversity of playing without Carly, and will she
be back for tomor row?  
COACH MITCHELL: She will be back tomorrow. It was a one-game suspension, and
it was, and I don't want to comment on it any further. It's been a team issue
and it's been handled and we'll move forward. I have a lot of respect for
Carly and she'll be ready to go tomorrow night, and she will be available
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH MITCHELL: Tremendous. We've had to play short-handed a lot this year,
and so our players were well-equipped to face some more adverse circumstances
because we've faced plenty. If any team in the tournament was ready to do
that, I think we were, and as you could see -- I could tell when our players
came out in the first four minutes, we were down 6-4, but the energy that we
had played with, I felt good about our chances tonight after they came out
that way and knew that we had responded positively to the adversity, and
that's what you want to do.  
  
Q. Your team took the lead for good at the ten-minute mark of the first
half. You never gave it up even when they cut it to one. At the 11-minute mark
of the second half you grinded it out.  
COACH MITCHELL: We were guarding so well tonight and a great defensive effort.
That's been something that we've had to do in this league all year. We haven't
had very many pretty victories. It's always been we've had to rely on defense,
and boy, they came to play tonight with some great defense, and I was real
proud of that.  
  
Q. They tied it 39-39, but you guys never let them get the lead. Can you
talk about how important that might have been if they had gotten that lead for
momentum?  
COACH MITCHELL: I think for us and where we are right now, I think that was
probably a big factor in the game. I think that us being able to never
relinquish the lead from a psychological standpoint, an emotional standpoint,
I think that was important. This one is about a tough group of young women who
came together and fought real hard, and I give them all the credit. They did a
great job tonight and I'm real proud of our players.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, give us a quick opening comment and then
we'll take questions for the players, they can be excused and we'll come back
to questions for you.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: First of all, I thought our team, understatement of the
year, I thought we just played well. I thought our girls played the best that
they played all year. I thought Mesha Williams was outstanding, I thought
Kristen Morris was really good for us. It is a great win, and we're looking
forward to playing the next game.  
It's been a long time since I've been here, and it feels good to be in the
semifinals. First thing I did today is I went in the Fox TV room. I forgot
where my dressing room was; I've been so used to doing that.  
  
Q. Erica, there was a stretch where it was maybe 18:12 and Sylvia was out in
foul trouble and you I guess responded to that and really opened up a lead a
lot. Talk about what you all did and kind of the mindset.  
ERICA WHITE: Well, this is a veteran group, and having Sylvia out of the game,
we knew we had to step up because we were either going to play well at that
time with her out or play really bad. We were able to respond, like Coach
said, a lot of players on the bench stepped up. Mesha Williams came in and
stepped up, and we were able to sustain without Sylvia for a little while.  
  
Q. I'm assuming most days you go against Mesha in practice. Talk about how
you feel her game has progressed this year. Obviously she plays with more and
more confidence.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Mesha always plays with confidence when her name gets called. I
think tonight she showed what she goes up against in practice. Tonight she was
aggressive and she crashed the boards and got some points for us.  
  
Q. 20 points at the half you guys were up, 40-point win. How good of a W was
this in the first round? You know you get a good head of steam going into the
second round of semis?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It was a good start, especially just because we played as a
team, and just to get everybody and then get a feel of how this thing is going
to be for this weekend, I think we got off to a good start.  
ERICA WHITE: I agree with Syl. We got off to a great start. Ole Miss was a
great opponent because no matter what the lead is they're the type of team
that won't give up. That was good for us because we knew we were going to have
to compete for 40 minutes. I think it was Ole Miss having us play at our
highest level to hang in there, so I give a lot of credit to their team.  
  
Q. Talk about the production from everybody on the squad. Everybody got in
the scoring column today. How important is that, people come off the bench and
knock some of that rust off so you have everyone contributing down the
stretch?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It was very important, especially when you've got your key
players on the bench, me, Ashley, Erica ended up getting in foul trouble at
the end. But just for those players to step up. We have faith in them because
we see them every day in practice, but just for them to step up is big and
play a big part in the offense.  
ERICA WHITE: It's really huge, especially this time of year, the postseason.
For players to come off the bench and play well, that gives them a lot of
confidence for this tournament and leading into the next tournament.  
  
Q. Sylvia, we saw some ice on your knee at the end. Is something going on?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: No, it's nothing to worry about. I'm just being cautious and
making sure I get rested up for tomorrow.  
  
Q. I'd like you both to comment on Coach's pants.  
ERICA WHITE: I thought my Coach looked nice tonight (laughter).  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That will get you big minutes tomorrow, Erica.  
ERICA WHITE: I thought my Coach looked nice. Don't talk about my Coach.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I know he didn't dress himself, his wife did (laughter).  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I know I'm styling.  
ERICA WHITE: You are, Coach. Top-notch.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I might have been criticized behind my back a lot, but since
I've been at LSU the only criticism I've had to my face is that I don't wear
enough purple and gold so I'm trying to change that every day. Our fans are
just -- oh, Lord.  
  
Q. I saw the bench and they looked like they were channeling some of the LSU
football team. Were you guys trying to do that, get a little championship
swagger going?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Just anything we can get to get our team motivated and get them
going, getting them pumped on the bench for us and get some energy on the
floor, we're willing to do that, so we got them motivated by doing that.  
ERICA WHITE: We're definitely trying to play with our championship swagger. We
can't lie, we stole that from the football team. They're the best team in the
country. We're trying to win a championship just like them.  
  
Q. Was it part of you all's preparation to want to make a statement to the
rest of the teams in the tournament by starting out impressively?  
ERICA WHITE: Well, you want to make a statement, but most importantly you want
to come out and play well for your team, more importantly than what the other
teams here think. You come out and play basketball, you get a game like this
where you've been contributing, that helps us to play better basketball for
tomorrow. That will help us for the championship game if we get to that point.
It's more for us to just come out and play well, but if you make a statement
in the process, then that's good, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Could you also make a comment about everyone on the team got in the
scoring column. How important is that for everyone to get in, contribute down
the stretch, that there was more productivity from everybody?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's important for two reasons. Number one, it lets those
players that are going to play, that you may have to play in back to back
games feel good about themselves, and number two, Sylvia Fowles, she has a
double-double and plays 17 minutes. For her to play her 17 and Ashley Thomas
to play 11 and win, I thought that was really big because we're saving their
legs for tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How much different are the emotions playing against Ole Miss or maybe
just more than physically, Renee Ladner?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: To play against my two former players and for the score to
be like it is, is the only negative from my point of view. I hate to put a
score up there like that for their sake because I wouldn't be there today for
if it wasn't for Renee and Peg and players like that. It's about my former
players, and I really feel for them today. Looked like to me they spent
everything they could beating Mississippi State.  
  
Q. You had a 41-point lead with seven minutes left in the second half. You
walked down to the end of the bench and told your ladies something, you guys
started laughing, then they called a time-out. What did you tell them?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We were just all laughing that Whitfield actually passed the
ball. She's played at LSU, got three assists. Last time Whitfield passed the
ball it seems like we were back in the -- I don't know, eight or nine years
ago, and I just said, we were rolling if she was passing the ball, because
once she gets in the game, she puts it up. That's all that was about.  
  
Q. I know you made an emphasis of trying to improve the offense this year,
but you're playing such good defense. It's been a constant for this team.
Coaches are always proud of their teams playing defense. Talk about what they
do so well.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Here's the whole deal: When I came to LSU, the one thing I
was not going to do was change what we were -- what Coach Bob Stark and them
had been doing defensively. They led the country, and any time I had ever
watched them play, you just couldn't score on them when I was doing TV.  
When the other team had the ball, to make the decision, I would not tinker
with that. I've actually let him run that a lot. And then on offense, I just
wanted us to get in a freer mood to play, have fun, get a shot, shoot the
ball. But our defense has been really constant for us all year, and I'm really
proud of that.  
I'll tell you, y'all haven't asked me this question. I thought the game
difference for us tonight, we met last Thursday and decided -- last Tuesday
before we came here, that for us to move to another level, we would have to do
four things different, and we all agreed that 80 percent of the things we
needed to do was rebounding. I thought defensive rebounding tonight was better
than it's been all year.  
  
Q. Your bench outscored the entire Ole Miss team. What does that say about
the team three years in a row and the tournament coming up in the next few
weeks?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That says that I'm really excited about that because
sometimes we have not played them enough, and to be able to play them and them
to score 38 points was just unbelievable. I said it, I told them at the end, I
told our seven players that come off the bench, that's the best you've played.
I told the last five players that was the best they have played all year. I
thought our last five players played outstanding, they didn't turn the ball
over a lot, we were rebounding, we didn't foul a lot. So that's been good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Hope y'all have a great day.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Depree Bowden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18041)

### [Sha Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16874)

### [Corey Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17049)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, an opening comment.  
COACH BUTLER: Obviously any time you lose a ballgame you're disappointed. We
got beat by what I think is the best team in the country, and they're
talented, they're deep, and obviously they're very, very well coached. There
were certain aspects of our ballgame I was very, very proud of, and there were
aspects of it that were disappointing.  
I think the thing that's most impressive about Tennessee is how deep they can
go and how much talent they can bring off the bench. That's really hard to
counter.  
Our transition defense was not our best tonight, and I felt that was where we
really broke down. I was proud of our rebounding effort, that was a big
turnaround from the last time we played them. But we were beat by an
exceptional ballclub.  
  
Q. What did you think when you saw Marshae go down and how did that affect
the game?  
DEPREE BOWDEN: When I saw Marshae go down I knew me and Sha would have to step
it up and people off the bench would have to step it up, as well. It affected
our low-post game because some people on the bench weren't used to playing
minutes, so that was kind of different.  
SHA BROOKS: I didn't really see Marshae fall down so I didn't realize she
wasn't in the game, but by then we realized that the post players had to step
it up and the guards, as well.  
  
Q. Whose decision was it to wear the orange uniforms today?  
DEPREE BOWDEN: I think I had a lot to do with that. I like playing the orange.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Anything for Coach?  
  
Q. Early on, I think Marshae was 1 for 8 out of the gate and you were
getting some -- the ball at least under the basket. How discouraging was it
you weren't able to finish there, and did you feel like maybe there could have
been more calls and if things had gone that direction you might have gotten to
the line a little bit more?  
COACH BUTLER: That was one of our objectives was to try to get to the free-
throw line. We felt like we could do that if we were aggressive. Clearly I was
wrong, but that happens sometimes.  
I felt like we were attacking and I thought we were being aggressive, and
that's all I asked my team to do. If fouls aren't called or shots are blocked,
those are things that are not within our control so not worth talking about.  
  
Q. How tough is it Marshae going down, having to watch her have to sit from
the bench? How tough is it and how much does it change things?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, it certainly changes things, but if we were a team that
we're looking for reasons why we lost, we're never going to point to an injury
or an excuse. Marshae being on the floor or not on the floor doesn't have
anything to do with the way we play transition defense, and I thought that was
our biggest weakness tonight. Did we miss her? Absolutely. She's our leading
scorer and our leading rebounder; that's obvious. But we're not playing tennis
or golf. This is a team sport, and when things don't go your way in one area
then you've got to fill in in another area. We were able to generate 61
points. We just gave up way too many in the full court. They scored 92, and I
felt that had a lot to do with transition defense, or maybe I should say a
lack thereof.  
  
Q. You mentioned the transition D. How hard is that momentum to get back
against a team like Tennessee?  
COACH BUTLER: It's very hard. They're a momentum team. They generate their
momentum. They've got such great fans, and you get all that orange in the
stands yelling and chanting, it really creates a snowball effect sometimes. We
just -- we missed assignments and I didn't feel like our communication and our
defensive transition was what it should have been. But again, they're
fantastic individual players.  
They're so threatening with the ball, you've got to match up with everyone.
You can't miss one assignment or leave one person open or she'll be the one
that hurts you. But they do a great job of making it feel like that everything
is closing in on you, and there's only so many timeouts in a game that you can
call and try to break up some of that momentum. In their instance that's
players making plays, and I think that's one of the things that's admirable
about the things that Tennessee tries to do to you is they just put their
players in positions to succeed and then they let them go, and they do. They
succeed and they fully expect to succeed every time.  
  
Q. What did Marshae do?  
COACH BUTLER: I really don't know yet. I don't know the details of the injury.
The detail I got, she can't go back in the ballgame. That was the one that I
was made aware of.  
  
Q. Inside ten minutes Hornbuckle was trying to lead a break and she missed
two people in the paint that she was going for. She said one of your people
got a hand on it, another player picks it up and throws in a three. Even when
you had a chance to stop them, is that the kind of thing that when things are
unraveling --  
COACH BUTLER: A little bit. There's just no area that you can break down in.
There's no -- hey, we won't guard her, we'll put two people on her or we'll
stop the ball and not worry about their fliers, then their fliers will knock
shots down. They're a very well-rounded team. It's a very well-balanced
attack. You look at what they did numbers-wise, they had three kids in high
double figures and two other kids with eight. So you don't have to play a
perfect ballgame to beat Tennessee; I don't think that's true with anyone. But
you do have to minimize your errors and mistakes, and that was the one area
that I felt like for us was just not up to par today.  
  
Q. The final outcome was similar to the game in Knoxville, but it seemed
like you guys hung around for most of the first half. Were you proud of your
team for staying in it longer today?  
COACH BUTLER: I was proud of our effort and our fight. I felt like we had a
lot of people that didn't fault until our tanks were just empty. That's always
what we want to do. Our goal with this program, I don't think that we were
operating under the illusion that we were going to go in undefeated this
season. We wanted to go in and battle and fight and compete and feel like at
the end of every day we had gotten better. That doesn't always mean that the
scoreboard was going to be in our favor and the end result was going to be in
our favor.  
Tonight was one of those games. If we had played better transition defense
would we have beaten Tennessee? That's impossible to say. I know we were down
15 at the half and I think we had given up 17 transition points and then they
outscored us by 15 in the second half and it was a similar result in
transition.  
So there were a lot of things that we did make go our way. Again, the
rebounding war was something we were really concerned with. We got our butts
kicked on the boards in Knoxville and we responded to that challenge and got
20 offensive rebounds against one of the top rebounding teams in the country.  
  
Q. Do you think you've done enough now to be playing in the postseason?  
COACH BUTLER: I know that we'll be playing in the postseason. It's just a
matter of who we'll be playing against and which tournament we'll be
participating in, and regardless of how that works out, I think you'll see the
same excitement and fire and determination and all the things that I think
have been characteristics of this ballclub since we first tipped it up against
Xavier, and you'll see our best.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 7, 2008

  

### [DeWanna Bonner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16847)

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Jordan Greenleaf](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18036)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We can start with the players. Questions for the players?  
  
Q. DeWanna, can you talk about the comeback, and were you guys just spent at
that point, or what happened down at the very end?  
DEWANNA BONNER: I thought we fought hard. We hit some big shots. Our free
throws killed us at the end, we were 11 for 20. We just kept fighting hard,
and I'm proud of the team and the way we played tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, do you want to go to a comment?  
COACH FORTNER: I feel like I just got done with a prize fight. It was just one
slug and then another slug and it was just a hard-fought defensive battle. The
free-throw line really hurt us tonight. If we could have knocked those free
throws down it would have been nice.  
But I thought we just -- both teams just played very tough, and it was just a
tough game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for players?  
  
Q. For either of you, did the recent game against Vanderbilt help you in any
way to prepare for this game, and if so, how?  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: Yes, we knew that Vanderbilt is a very good three-point
shooting team, and we knew in order to stay in the game with them we had to
limit their three-point shots, and that was one of the things we focused on in
this game, and I think we did a good job with that.  
DEWANNA BONNER: Yeah, they were kind of fresh on our mind. They have a great
inside and outside game, so we just had to play tough defense. We came out
there and we fought and we limited the three-points like Jordan said, and we
just kind of stayed in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, players, thank you. Now for Coach?  
  
Q. After you played Vanderbilt just a couple of weeks ago, what kind of
adjustments did you make prior to this game?  
COACH FORTNER: Well, we knew we had to take that three-point shot away because
they shot the ball really well against us at Auburn and they were 10 for 20
from the three. We really made an effort to make sure we were out on shooters.
I really thought if we had three or four made threes we could win the game,
and we could have if we had hit the free throws.  
I thought our defense was much better. It was not good when we played them at
Auburn. Much better tonight, but it's very hard for us to score against
Vanderbilt. They're a very tough, physical defensive team. But when you get
yourself to that free-throw line you've got to take advantage of that, and we
just couldn't do that tonight.  
  
Q. Talk about what you all were able to do to limit Christina Wirth
tonight.  
COACH FORTNER: We were switching in our defense, and that kept her from --
they run a lot of things like she'll screen and pop out or screen and pop up,
so we were switching those, and we ended up having somebody on her. She wasn't
getting many looks.  
But God, she killed us with that one at the end, at the elbow. Boy, that was
nice, got a little free right there. But we were switching in other man
defense, and I think that kept her from getting looks.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Shantell Black](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18046)

### [Danetra Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18027)

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: LSU was clearly the better team today. Yesterday I was asked
about the stats sheet. Well, obviously the stats held true today.  
COACH LADNER: Yesterday State beat me in a lot of stats, and I still had the
one that counted was the W. Today LSU dominated us in every aspect of the
game. I think LSU is maybe one of the best teams in the country, maybe the
best defensive team, I know that we've faced all year. And they caused havoc
on our team all day, so hats off to LSU. They were well prepared, they looked
like a championship team and we were just not at our best.  
  
Q. 18:12, you fouled out of the game. Do you feel like -- what didn't go
well for you there?  
DANETRA FORREST: I felt like we did have a great job right there to get her
out of the game, but what did happen was obvious. They put the hammer to our
mix and killed us in every set.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about LSU's defense, what they do, what makes them so
tough?  
SHANTELL BLACK: They don't let you go to where you want to go. They don't let
you take the shots you want to take. They keep you up the middle. They're
smart defensively.  
DANETRA FORREST: They're very big. We're a small team, so when you have a big
team you have to try to bring your A game and try to go around them, but they
are very quick and athletic, so that's why they are the best defensive team
that we face.  
  
Q. Shantell, did they look any better than the last time you all played
them?  
SHANTELL BLACK: I don't think they looked any better, I just think we looked a
lot worse. We weren't as aggressive. We didn't come out with the same
mentality as before. We played them a lot better the first time. Our effort on
the boards was pretty low this game, but I think we were the ones that played
bad today.  
  
Q. Danetra, you looked pretty down. How tough is it? You talked about
wanting to extend your career. What are the emotions like when it came to an
end?  
DANETRA FORREST: My emotions were I just got killed. You seen the score, so
there isn't a good emotion that I could feel right now.  
  
Q. What were some of your thoughts when it was --  
COACH LADNER: We had an opportunity. I thought we were in good shape. I
thought our kids had done a good job defensively guarding and even getting
some turnovers and getting Sylvia to get over the back and I thought we'd take
advantage of that and unfortunately the ball would not go in the basket and
then it rolled, and unfortunately there was nothing we could do to stop it.  
  
Q. You shuffled the starting lineup a little bit today. What were your
thoughts?  
COACH LADNER: Well, Bianca has had three huge games for us, and we thought we
needed to start offensively and get a little punch out of the gates. Also it
gave us a little more size, and then we had just worked our two guards to
death, and I thought that Shantell -- it would give Shantell and Kayla Melson
a little break going in and out and then we could come back and pop them in
the mouth if there was such a thing that could happen. But mostly we did it
because we needed to score. We struggled getting open, number one, the
physicality of the game, and then number two, getting an open look. And that
made us very tentative.  
  
Q. What makes LSU so good defensively?  
COACH LADNER: Well, they're very physical, they're very quick around the
perimeter, and if you get around the first line of defense there's a tree
standing in the middle of the lane and the branches go from one side of the
court to the other. You're not looking at the rim, you're looking at Sylvia,
and she is the best defensive player to me in the country, and she alters
everything you're trying to do. Even when we would get around and get a chance
to get in a two on one, she would swat it down and make us look at her versus
the backboard or the rim.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2008

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Jessica Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18064)

### [Jennifer Risper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18063)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you could, Coach, a quick comment and we'll take questions
for the players and then questions for you.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, I think it was a really hard-fought game by both teams.
Auburn did a great job defensively. We were really out of sync on offense,
turned the ball over a ton, and they really took us out of what we do. I was
really impressed with their defensive effort. On the other hand I was
impressed with our defensive effort.  
I think we did a great job rebounding, and rebounding was our number one key,
rebounding the basketball and keeping them off the glass because that's what
they're so good at. I think we knew each other really well playing so
recently, and we both did a great job preparing our teams and taking each
other's strengths away so you saw a really hard-fought defensive battle.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, questions for the players?  
  
Q. Jess, can you talk about how important you knew that free throw shooting
would be down the stretch in a game like this?  
JESSICA MOONEY: Free throw shooting is important in every game. Coach
emphasizes it in practice. We work on it every practice. We have to hit 80
percent or hit five in a row, some kind of thing, before we can go home. We
know it's an important emphasis for every game.  
  
Q. Jennifer, can you talk about they did a good job of shutting down
Christina, didn't score until 1:43 left. Do you and the other guys have to
step up and take the slack there? Just talk about that.  
JENNIFER RISPER: That's just what a great team does. You're just there for
each other. Even if Tina's shots weren't falling, we actually could have done
a better job of attacking the basket a little bit more, but as a team we're
going to stick up for each other and pick up each other's slacks.  
  
Q. Jen, can you talk about your teammates and your team's response to
adversity, of which there was a fair amount at various times in this game?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I thought we did a good job. Tina, for example, a lot of
shots she shot didn't go in, but she hit a lot of big shots at the end of the
game. And also Amber went to the free-throw line and hit two big free throws.
So yes, we were battling back and forth throughout the game, but when it
counted our team stepped up the most.  
  
Q. Can you talk about whether you think this game being close would have
been more of a benefit than it would have been had it been a 15, 17 point game
like it was a couple weeks ago?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Yeah, I think it prepares us a little bit more, gets us more
focused for the next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Now for Coach.  
  
Q. Melanie, was it a little frustrating? There was quite a discrepancy at
the free-throw line. You guys were having a hard time, and it wasn't like you
weren't trying to get the ball inside.  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, we wanted to get to the free-throw line a lot more. We
wanted to drive. We wanted to take them off the dribble and we wanted to get
the ball in the low post to Liz and draw fouls, and the opposite was
happening. We were getting offensive foul calls, travels. We were turning the
ball over in the post, and when we drove we were just making bad decisions on
when to drive, when not to drive. We weren't seeing the help and making the
decisions on whether to kick.  
Last time we played them we drove and kicked a lot. Tonight we drove and tried
to shoot up over two and came up empty a lot.  
  
Q. Did they do anything special on Christina? Or was it Christina's
struggles?  
COACH BALCOMB: I suppose they did a great job on everybody. You have to key on
Tina. Obviously they did a great job on her. They took her out of a lot of
things. She did get looks early on that she usually knocks down and didn't,
but I think they continued to take her looks away, and we just started going
to Risper a lot and Jess. Jence had a big drive, really because we wanted to
penetrate more.  
  
Q. You guys were tied up going down the stretch, and Kristina was 0 of 8
from the field. Talk about her stepping up and making that shot, her first
field goal of the game.  
COACH BALCOMB: When she made that shot we all breathed easy. We became as a
team tense because she wasn't hitting her shots and we rely on her so much.
She has been so consistent for us, so consistent, and has been the go-to, has
hit so many big shots.  
What's nice to know is no matter how she struggled all game offensively, she
took big charges, she stepped up at the end and made that shot, and to be able
to do that says a lot of her maturity on the floor as a player.  
  
Q. How much does it help being on this floor? I mean, this team has had so
much turnover since the last title was won here. But you mentioned early in
the week you were going to talk about what this program has done here. Is
there a little bit to feed off of their familiarity?  
COACH BALCOMB: I don't think here. I don't think anybody played if I'm
correct. I was here (laughing), so I have a lot of familiarity. I haven't
brought a team here that's lost a game yet. But I really just keep telling our
kids that we're successful here, and we joke about it with the freshmen, we
don't lose here.  
I think what's more familiar is winning last year and having a lot of players
from last year, the sophomores so successful and the juniors and the seniors
playing in that game. That's probably more important to them right now than
where the game is.  
We love playing in Nashville because our home fans get to be here. It was just
amazing how many people stayed tonight when the weather is so bad and it's so
late.  
  
Q. Do you think it's more of a benefit for this game to be close like it was
than if it was more of a blowout?  
COACH BALCOMB: I hope so. You know, you don't ever want a game to be close,
but at the same time, we haven't been in a lot of close games down the
stretch. We've been playing really well and our games have not been close and
we have not had to hit big free throws or execute down the stretch, and that's
one thing we just talked about in the locker room is building confidence from
that, that we were able to be successful doing that.  
  
Q. Same question for you as to the players. Can you talk about your team's
response to the various kinds of adversity in the game?  
COACH BALCOMB: What specific adversity?  
  
Q. Well, a lot of times during the season you have built a lead but tonight
they came back. There were travels called, there were fouls called --  
COACH BALCOMB: You mean my technical (laughing)? I don't know if it's
adversity. I think things weren't going our way, and generally they have been
going our way. It's one of the things that our staff and players on the bench
really had to step up for everybody else. We talked to each other about
staying calm. Obviously I didn't do so well at it. But I did tell my players
let me talk to the officials, don't lose your cool.  
I think we were starting to do that, just getting very, very tight. You could
see it in their body language, so we asked for our players on the bench to
help, as well as the staff, to just encourage and be positive down the
stretch, and I think they really did that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll see you tomorrow night.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, give us an opening comment and then we'll take questions
for the players. They can be excused and then we'll go back to you with
questions.  
COACH LANDERS: I thought the first half was very much lack luster on our part.
I would have liked for us to have played with more intensity than we did. The
turnovers hurt us and the offensive rebounds that they got hurt us, and
consequently we were involved in a much closer game, the fact that they shot
the ball somewhere in the vicinity of 52, 53 percent according to the official
stats here. We had a little bit higher in the first half.  
But there was just a lot of disappointments in the first half, and most of it
from a lack of effort or presence of pride or intensity, passion. We didn't
seem to have that.  
But the second half I thought we played better. We didn't turn it over. We
continued to rebound reasonably well, got on the offensive boards a little
bit, and just slowly built a lead that maybe they couldn't get back to at
around the five-minute mark.  
  
Q. For either of you, the lack of passion and intensity, is that more
because of going up against the 12th seed, or what do you attribute that to?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: I think -- you know, I don't know really what we can attribute
it to at this point, but I think we each individually need to come every game
ready to play and not really take anything for granted at this point. Once you
lose, you're done.  
So I think it's up to us to come together and to get ready for each and every
game.  
  
Q. Tasha, do you want to answer that, also?  
TASHA HUMPHREY: I'm not sure what to attribute it to, but I know we can't let
it happen again. Like Ashley said, we are in the postseason, we are one and
done from this point on. I think tomorrow we've to come out with a better
intensity in what we have to do and just a greater accomplishment.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half and what you were able to do better?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: Yeah, like coach said we didn't turn it over as much and they
didn't get easy points off that. I think we ran some plays, got some people
open and a couple people stepped up and we just hit some shots. I think that's
really what pulled us away at the end of the game, taking care of the ball,
and like he said, just staying consistent on the boards.  
  
Q. Ashley, the wear and tear, you obviously came in and you didn't want to
play 40 minutes. You went 38, but you wanted to get some more rest on the
bench. How do you think that's going to affect you going through?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: I always think it's in the back of our heads, that's probably
one of the main things we think about is we're tired. But at this point you've
got to put that away. At some point you've got to say we've got to fight
through this and we've got to keep playing. Everybody out here is tired. It's
just something mentally that you have to get over. It's just a barrier you
have to get over. I think if everybody can have a positive outlook on it, it
won't be affected.  
  
Q. Tasha or Ashley, the Kentucky game, I guess you guys already had a game
against Auburn where you got a little bit of payback if you want to call it
that. Are you guys looking at that, that Kentucky was the team that beat you
earlier in the year?  
TASHA HUMPHREY: Just looking back on that game, if that doesn't get us fired
up, I don't know what will. I think that's going to get us hyped up because
they beat us on our home court in the beginning of the competition. I know
it's one of those feelings in your gut that you don't want to have. We're
going to get rest and come back prepared to do what we have to do against a
good Kentucky basketball team.  
  
Q. Tasha, this is your last time around for this SEC championship. Do you
feel, not any pressure, but how bad do you want it?  
TASHA HUMPHREY: I mean, it's kind of an indescribable -- ever since my
freshman year we've lost. Every year, well, we have next year, but now I'm
running out of time. I can't speak for Megan and I can't speak for Rebecca,
but I know for me, coming in collegiate ranked and winning the SEC title is
something I've always dreamed of, especially as a little girl.  
I know tonight we didn't bring that energy and that intensity and that fire we
needed to bring that we're here and we're a forced to be reckoned with
tomorrow. I think tomorrow we have to bring it or if not we we're going to end
up Athens earlier than we expected.  
  
Q. You shut them down for 8:33 midway into the second half. Did you start
doing anything different defensively at that point? They only scored free
throws.  
COACH LANDERS: No, nothing from -- technically different. I just tried to --
at halftime and each of the timeouts there early in the second half to get our
kids juiced up a little bit, to get them to play a little harder, more
determined.  
When you think of some of the things that happened in the first half, and I
know that, you know, it depends on which side of the floor you're sitting as
to how you interpret those things, but we played defense twice in the first
half and they score on the 30-second clock buzzer. We go for three steals in
the first half and they score on all three of them. What are we thinking? What
are we doing?  
I know who the shooters were and who the drivers were. To answer your
question, all I tried to do at halftime, we didn't talk technical. How we were
trying to defend wasn't the issue. The way that we were defending was the
issue. I mean, if I tell you for two days that Jenkins is a driver, guard her
that way.  
  
Q. I know it's been impossible for you to kind of get a read on this team
when they were coming out. Did you sense anything like this today?  
COACH LANDERS: Yes.  
  
Q. When did you kind of start to sense that?  
COACH LANDERS: The last couple days, really. Not a whole lot of enthusiasm. My
question at halftime tonight was -- when I walked in was how do y'all feel
about the way you played? No answer. Why didn't somebody jump up and say we
played great, or why didn't somebody jump up and say, hey, we haven't played
very well, and this is not right. No answer. I mean, that's not a trick
question.  
  
Q. I'm just looking ahead to tomorrow night, what Kentucky has got for you
and how the team played today and how you carry that over into tomorrow.  
COACH LANDERS: Well, if we're still talking about what I just was talking
about, I mean, there's got to be a mindful decision as to how you want to be
remembered in Nashville this weekend. We give beautiful answers to tough
questions when we're talking to you folks, but we don't always give beautiful
answers when we walk out on the floor, and that's where the question is going
to be answered. We can sit here and talk about it, have theories about it, but
when we walk out on that floor tomorrow, either we came to kick somebody's
tail or we came to play.  
You've heard me say it a million times. Everybody loves to play basketball,
not everybody loves to compete. Somebody drives it by me one time, that's it,
especially if I've already been told they're a driver. Not only do I feel like
I failed defensively, I feel dumb, because somebody already told me that. I
let somebody shoot a three-point shot and score. I'm upset with me, but then I
also feel goofy because you've been telling me this kid can hit threes. It's
not going to happen again. But it does. That's what's got to change.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much, and we'll see you tomorrow
night.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Katie Hancock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18043)

### [Tierney Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18042)

### [Stephany Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13862)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could, a quick opening comment. We'll take
questions for the players, they can be excused and then we'll come back to
questions for you.  
COACH SMITH: I just felt like we ran out of real estate. We've had so much
adversity with injuries, and we are so young in our rebuilding process, in our
primary eight-man rotation consists of four freshman and three sophomores and
a junior, and we were just starting to play a little bit better, and a person
who has a lot to do with that is Varisia Raffington who has a lot of skill and
talent, but I'm really proud of our fight and talent and we've just kind of
made the step into the college game just as far as awareness of the offensive
and defensive game. It was a good fight.  
I thought Tierney and Katie did a good job, as well. I thought we did things
for the most part that we were going to try to do, which was try to limit
Tasha Humphrey's touches. Sometimes we gave too much emphasis to that and they
got hot around the perimeter. But I thought we made some good adjustments. We
wanted to be the spoiler, and that opportunity slipped through our hands, but
I am proud of how hard we fought.  
  
Q. Can both of you talk about the first half, shooting 52 percent, going
toe-to-toe with Georgia? Just how much fun was that?  
KATIE HANCOCK: We were walking out of the game, it was Tierney, and we were
going through a little tunnel, and I said, that was the funnest game we've
played this season. You notice that you don't really get tired when you're
having fun, and that's really what it's all about for me, just coming out here
and playing with some of my best friends, so I had the most fun.  
TIERNEY JENKINS: Like Katie, I did have a lot of fun. 52 percent, coaches told
us to take good shots and be patient, and that's what we finally realized this
game, and I think that's why we were making those shots.  
  
Q. How does it make you feel -- I thought you played a great game. Both of
you really played hard, and I do commend you guys, and you never quit. So how
do you carry this over to next season? You're young. And what do you prepare
for in the off season to get ready for for next season?  
KATIE HANCOCK: Well, I wish we were still playing, first and foremost, but
this is a perfect time for us. We're kind of firing on all cylinders, things
are really clicking, and we're definitely going to take all this momentum into
the off season because that's really where it comes down to players getting
better. That's exactly what we're going to do this summer and this off season,
and I'm pretty excited about it.  
TIERNEY JENKINS: This summer we're going to work extremely hard. As freshmen
we didn't really know the ropes. Experience means a lot in the SEC, so I think
we can be more of leaders just because we're sophomores, so I think that will
help us a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What do you attribute the first half to, the good shot selection, the
better offense than what you've had the last few games?  
COACH SMITH: Well, when we played in Athens, Georgia really took us out of our
offense, and they didn't leave us with many options. When they overplayed we
didn't do a good job of taking advantage and cutting hard to the basket, so we
worked a lot the last few days on backdoor cuts and relieving some of the
pressure and getting better shots at the rim. But I just think that -- I think
the mind is so powerful, and we had a very good mindset coming into this
basketball game of trying to be the spoiler and that there was nothing to
lose. My focus was just -- you know, y'all, we're going to be together for at
least two years, three years. Let's try to get over that hump and win this
first game in the SEC tournament so that we gain that experience and you stick
around as long as you can.  
You know, we're just so young. And I think that our mindset was strong today,
though. I think that we were just determined to throw the first punch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH SMITH: Thanks a lot.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Danetra Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18027)

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

### [Bianca Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18025)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the players and then we'll go back to
questions for Coach Ladner.  
COACH LADNER: I was really proud of the effort that we showed throughout the
game. I thought the game was exactly the way it should have been. I knew it
was going to be a battle because I know what a good job Coach Fanning does and
how hard her kids play. I knew for the most part it would be a slugfest and
that's what it was, and we probably had the final run, and I'm very, very
proud of my kids.  
  
Q. Bianca, you guys really fed off the shot Danetra had at the end. Can you
talk about how big that was?  
BIANCA THOMAS: That was a big play. We definitely needed a big play at that
time, and she just made a big play. She went to the free-throw line and made
the free throws, and that put us up, and that was like momentum to the second
half, to finish it.  
  
Q. Bianca, you scored 18 points today, the only person on your squad in
double figures. You play LSU tomorrow at 12:00 o'clock. Are you going to need
some more offensive output from someone besides yourself, the only person in
double figures today?  
BIANCA THOMAS: It doesn't matter if it's just one person. All of us played
together and it's not about one person giving double figures. Shawn was double
and triple-teamed. She kicked out to open players and we made shots. I'm sure
tomorrow she won't be double-teamed as much and she'll get open looks and
everyone will get open looks, and we'll have more people in double figures.  
  
Q. Remember for me if you will against LSU the last time you played and the
things you need to do different.  
DANETRA FORREST: Well, remembering that it was very ugly, we didn't take care
of the ball, we didn't rebound, and they are a very good team and we let them
get out in front, and that can't be done against LSU because they will make
you pay, and that's exactly what they did.  
  
Q. Bianca, can you follow up?  
BIANCA THOMAS: I agree. We didn't rebound. We turned the ball over. They're a
great team, so you have to bring your "A" game if you want to beat them. It's
going to be a hard task, but if we play hard and rebound and claim our
turnovers, we can win.  
  
Q. You all went on that run in the second half and you scored nine points or
whatever in the run. Can you just talk about what was going on and how you
were feeling?  
DANETRA FORREST: Well, we all knew coming into the game, the thing is I didn't
want this to be my last game. I love my team, I love my teammates, so I just
wanted to keep going. I want my season to keep going.  
  
Q. For either of you, was it as physical of a game as you thought it would
be?  
DANETRA FORREST: Yes, it was as physical as we thought. If anybody doesn't
know, State is our in-state rivals so we expected to get hit. We just have to
stay up and bounce back and get up when we are hit.  
  
Q. Bianca, you've come back and won all year. Can you talk about what you
all are able to do in the second half?  
BIANCA THOMAS: It's all about rebounding. They out rebounded us pretty bad and
we had to get on the boards and limit our turnovers and do those things, and
we would win. We had no doubt that we were going to win this game, we just had
to get on the boards.  
  
Q. What will you do tomorrow if only one of your players scores in double
digits against LSU?  
COACH LADNER: We're in trouble. You never put that in your game plan. The most
consistent player we've had all year has been Shawn Goff. She's been able to
score. We prepared for her to be triple-teamed. What happened last time she
was triple-teamed, she kicked it out and our shooters knocked down shots.  
I think any time you play your in-state rival, the goal gets a little smaller,
you get a little tighter, and you want to win the game so badly you're a
little tentative. I thought we had a lot of that today. When the ball doesn't
go in the hole, it's very difficult to stay on the defensive end of the floor,
so no, you always want your big-time player -- Shawn Goff who has been our
most consistent player to do the scoring and then have the role players fill
in, but in the past games Bianca has hit double figures, so we're not
surprised by that at all.  
  
Q. You guys have 17 turnovers, shoot 32 percent and got out rebounded by 12.
Do you expect to win with stats like that?  
COACH LADNER: Yeah, we've had that all year. It's amazing. You pick up the
score sheet and the statistics are there and they don't ever fit exactly what
happens in the game. So I guess the intangibles come into play. You keep
fighting, you keep clawing, you keep digging and somebody makes a big play.
Dee Forrest goes to the free-throw line, and then she goes up to the free
throw and knocks down five free throws. We shot 12 for 22 today from the free-
throw line. That's a little bit uncharacteristic of us. I guess as an old
rookie coach, I don't put a lot of stock into that statistic. I know we
trailed by one and hadn't won a game, so we busted that wide open, too.  
In these type of games where it's a slugfest, where you're evenly matched, it
comes down to one or two possessions that can turn the game, and for us, I
think Dee Forrest's and-one broke their backs, so to speak.  
  
Q. You talked about some of your players getting triple-teamed. Tomorrow you
play Sylvia Fowles, the SEC Player of the Year. If that's your plan tomorrow
is to put a lot of players on her, how do you plan on stopping players like
Erica White?  
COACH LADNER: I don't know if you can stop any of them. If I were to plan I'd
put all five of them on Sylvia, but I don't know if that will work, either.
The last time we played them we did a fairly decent job of making runs on them
but we couldn't sustain the run. You know so we're going to have to play our
matchup, we're going to have to guard the three on the perimeter, we're going
to have to try to put a body on Sylvia when it goes in.  
The one thing we won't do consistently is go into Shawn Goff because naturally
there is a big body in the lane, and at this point in time I don't think you
change a lot of anything. I just think we'll have to dig and claw and hope we
can knock down shots. They're the best team in our league. We have a big
challenge ahead. There's not really any answers. I hope some intangibles kick
in with a little divine intervention and we'll see what happens.  
  
Q. On top of a physical game like this, how much is left in the tank
tomorrow and how much does fatigue play a factor or how much is that a
concern?  
COACH LADNER: Well, that's always a concern, but I just believe you have to
come out and put it together for 40 minutes. You have to take whatever is left
in that tank, whether it's a little or a lot, and draw on it and hope that the
adrenaline kicks in and you make some plays down the stretch. Again, we go on
those long droughts of not scoring, but get you see our kids will continue to
play defense, and that's really difficult to do.  
There's no secret there is a big challenge ahead tomorrow. We will have to
play a near-perfect game. You definitely can't go 12 for 22 if you get to the
free-throw line and miss those shots. We'll rest, we'll do what we've been
doing all year and we'll go out and try to play them as best we can.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about what they were doing with Shawn Goff. Can
you talk more about that? Was that a big point of emphasis coming into the
second half?  
COACH LADNER: The point of emphasis going into the second half was that we had
played poorly and we were only down by one, and the fact that we had been out-
rebounded, and we thought that was a key in the game. We really discussed
that. I tried not to talk to them about offense as much because on my
particular team, the more you talk about it, the bigger it gets. So we leave
that part alone and we come back and say we've got to defend and we've got to
rebound. Ultimately that gave us an opportunity to throw in a shot here or
there, and it worked for us. So our point of emphasis was defending and
rebounding coming out in the second half.  
  
Q. One of your players had a pretty big collision with the bench. Were you
right there?  
COACH LADNER: Yeah, I picked her up and threw her back out.  
  
Q. You're not the biggest player on the court --  
COACH LADNER: I took charge.  
  
Q. Were you a little concerned at that moment?  
COACH LADNER: I love anybody diving out of the bleachers. They could dive into
anybody on the bench and heels could fly and I don't care. As long as she's
making that effort, I can live with that.

### [Tysheka Grimes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18024)

### [Marneshia Richard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16877)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening comment and then we'll take questions for the
players.  
COACH FANNING: I think you have to get credit to Ole Miss. They're a team that
plays very hard. I felt like we put ourselves in a position to do things to
win a ballgame because first half we got three to the line, we missed some
free throws and we had an eight-point lead where I thought that we just didn't
focus and we weren't tough enough from a defensive stand in the first half.  
Second half the bottom line is, I think, turnovers, and then shots. You have
to make some shots. Our percentage was 22 percent, and we missed some key
buckets. We had some good open looks, we had some lay-ups, and if that
happens, as a team you have to be ready to rebound. You have to find something
-- if you miss shots, then as a team you have to find a way defensively to
make it up or to get that extra rebound, and we just -- they made some big
plays.  
They hit a couple of shots down the stretch where we were in their face, and I
think we lost focus just a little bit and they gained some momentum and put
themselves in a position to get a stretch there and got a lead that they could
hold onto.  
Hopefully we learn from this. We've been trying to emphasize -- I thought
February we played better in terms of spurts. But that 40-minute game that
we're looking for, it's elusive a little bit right now. We haven't tackled it
the way we have to. It takes focus, it takes the value of every possession and
being smart with the basketball, and if we continue to improve that and mature
as a basketball team, we'll end up a good basketball team. Hopefully we'll
have that opportunity in postseason play.  
  
Q. Marneshia, they made that run in the second half, you guys were up by
three or four, then they were up by six. What was the difference there?  
MARNESHIA RICHARD: Like Coach said, I guess we got a little lax and lost
focus. We turned the ball over and then we didn't fight back.  
  
Q. You guys dominated the boards particularly in the first half. Were you
concerned that you had such a lead and yet you were only up by one at the
break?  
TYSHEKA GRIMES: We really base our game on -- we try to base our game on
rebounding, and the offensive boards helped. We really had a great rebounding
game, I think. By them being up by one, we felt like the rebounding --
offensive rebounding was a big part of it, but we had to stay consistent and
we weren't really consistent towards the end of the game.

### [Tom Collen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18035)

### [Sarah Pfeifer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15509)

### [Brittney Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16853)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you could open up with a comment and then we'll take
questions for the players and then we'll come back with questions for you.  
COACH COLLEN: Well, it's a frustrating loss for us because I think we let it
get away. I think early in the game we missed a ton of lay-ups. We missed free
throws. We didn't execute particularly well. I think they shot the ball
particularly well. I think some of that was them, and I give them credit for
that, and some of that was our execution on defense. But it just got away from
us early. We're not a team that's really built to try to come back in
ballgames. I don't think we not try to come back in ballgames, I just don't
think we're built with a lot of athleticism and the ability to press and
extend into the full court.  
It's hard to battle back, and I think when you look up at the clock and you've
got a double-digit lead and you can't fight and you can't bite into that at
all, I think it's hard to keep your effort up. So a little bit of an extension
early about the way we've played down the stretch. I think we've played better
than this down the stretch in terms of the frustration that the players feel
and that the coaches feel, just a little bit of an extension, really, from our
last 10 or 11 games.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Would either one of you mind just talking about that same thing, how
frustrating it is to try to come back when you get down early that way?  
BRITTNEY VAUGHN: It just gets hard trying to battle back, just executing on
offense, not being able to -- like Coach said, make lay-ups, that was one
thing we weren't able to do. When we were called for foul shots, we didn't
make our free throws, so that was frustrating, not being able to get back in
the game with the clock stopped.  
As far as the defensive end, we just couldn't get stops when we needed them.  
SARAH PFEIFER: I mean, you get off to a start like we got off to and you're
trying to play five or six players and you're fighting from behind the whole
game, and it's tough. And that's what we've made a pattern of doing. And it
just seems like we have to have all five players playing at their best to get
stuff done, and we haven't had that in a long time. I mean, it's frustrating.  
I mean, we know what we had to do, we had the opportunity to do it, and we
just didn't make it happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Anything for Coach?  
  
Q. There was one stretch during the first half I think you got to nine and
had four straight trips where you could have got it closer but didn't. Do you
remember that, and if so, can you just talk about that?  
COACH COLLEN: I remember a stretch where we cut it a little bit, and I thought
we were going to get a little bit of momentum, but it seemed like -- like you
said, we got some stops, we got a couple scores, and then three or four
straight times down the floor we wouldn't execute or we'd be one and done.
It's pretty hard to get a lot of offensive rebounds. We're 5'11" in the post
and our backup player with a post-concussion so she couldn't play, so we're
playing a small 5'10" forward backup in the post. We couldn't compete with
them on the boards and we couldn't get them stopped. We couldn't get them
stopped inside. We couldn't get Bonner stopped.  
You know, we've been in this mode for a long time with the personnel that
we've got. We have to play a near-perfect game to be able to compete in the
SEC. It's just hard to go out and try to play that way. Obviously we were far
from that tonight.  
I look at the stats sheet at the end of the first half and we had five
turnovers, which is pretty good, and we're shooting 45 percent from the field,
which is pretty solid. But we're 6 for 12 from the free-throw line and we're
getting out-rebounded by seven or eight and the other team is shooting 60
percent from the field. You just can't stay in games playing like that.  
  
Q. Were you surprised as much as you were mixing up the defenses in the
first half that they were able to generate so many good looks?  
COACH COLLEN: Well, I was frustrated that they were able to do that. You know,
I think Coach Eatman was frustrated. He coordinates our defenses. I can't tell
you how hard we worked and how much we walked through preparing for what they
were going to do, and we just missed assignments. And every time we missed an
assignment they stuck a shot. They got to so many easy shots. They drove right
down the middle of our defense so many times and just got the lay-ups. That
was frustrating.  
I think we shored it up a little bit in the second half, but then we didn't
play as well offensively in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Thank you very much.

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Depree Bowden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18041)

### [Sha Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16874)

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome home. If you could make an opening comment, then
we'll take questions for the players. They can take off, and then we'll come
back to questions for you.  
COACH BUTLER: Very pleased with the way that we played the basketball game
tonight. I thought almost completely for 40 minutes we executed and followed
the game plan and played with the type of passion and energy and confidence
that you have to play with at this time of the season to make things happen,
and that's what we wanted to do tonight was make things happen, not be
reactive, and I thought we did that, especially in the face of a little
adversity, Marshae picking up two quick fouls. We had people step up and score
in other ways, generated offense from our defense. Depree carried us a lot in
the first half, Sha very composed under pressure, but overall a fantastic team
effort.  
  
Q. Depree, can you talk about your mindset in that first half when you just
seemed like you could make everything?  
DEPREE BOWDEN: Well, I hit my first two and I kind of got confidence from
there and just started shooting. They beat me on my senior night, so I knew I
wanted to get back at them.  
  
Q. Do you realize you outscored them by yourself in the first half, and have
you ever been involved in anything like that?  
DEPREE BOWDEN: No, I didn't realize I outscored them in the first half, and
yes, I have been involved in something like that before.  
  
Q. Sha, the last two matches with South Carolina have been very close games.
What do you think was the difference today?  
SHA BROOKS: We just had more intensity. They beat us last time so we knew we
had to come out and play aggressive in the first half and in the second half,
we kind of got in a lull in the second half, but then we had to pick it back
up in the end.  
  
Q. For both of you, how much different do you feel like you are, I think
it's eight days ago, since you played UT, and what needed to happen
differently for you guys?  
SHA BROOKS: I just think that we came out really, really aggressive, and we
wanted this thing. We've got to want every single game. We were more prepared
than South Carolina. We knew all their players and what we had to do to win.
For UT we're just going to have to go out and out-hustle.  
DEPREE BOWDEN: For UT we have to start out confident and be aggressive and put
two halves together.  
  
Q. What did Carol Ross's pregame talk mean to you?  
DEPREE BOWDEN: It meant a lot. She got us motivated and inspired to play, and
it was good. It was real good.  
SHA BROOKS: Same as Pree.  
  
Q. How about the hot three-point shooting and the scoring in the first half
itself?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, she was a little humble, but I think especially in an SEC
ballgame when you're able to do that, it's a tremendous performance and I
think you saw an instance of a senior sensing the moment. All factors
considered Marshae was on the bench. Her shots were not just big in terms of
momentum and that sort of thing, but it made everybody around her confident.
When one of our shooters is hitting, I think it makes all of our team feel
like good things are going to happen on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. How much of a birthday present is this for you?  
COACH BUTLER: It was fantastic. It was all I wanted. I just wanted to win,
didn't care by how many, didn't care what it looked like, just wanted to win
and advance.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys are on that bubble that everybody likes to talk
about?  
COACH BUTLER: I sure hope so. I sure would like to think so. I think we've
done some things, and a big one was today. We needed to win this basketball
game and do it in a convincing fashion and show that we're a postseason team.
I think that's definitely a performance that you saw today. We were an NCAA
Tournament team, no question.  
  
Q. How much different are you than eight days ago, and what closed the gap
from that result against UT last time?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, I think the offensive confidence that we played with today
was crucial, and our preparation as the players mentioned. We had an
opportunity, obviously, to play a team we were very familiar with, and now
hopefully we'll be more familiar with Tennessee.  
It always helps to have that first game under your belt and have some actual
film of you versus them to look at and see where we fell short and see what we
did well, so that's what we'll do now is go back to the drawing board because
obviously the game plan we were in in Knoxville didn't turn out so well.  
  
Q. How did it feel to have your parents in the stands and see this game?  
COACH BUTLER: It was nice. I'm a family person. It's great to see so many
familiar faces and different people that mean a lot to me. You know, I can't
say that I looked up there too often.  
I did hear my mom whistling every now and then. But it's great to be in
Nashville and in the mid-state where basketball is so important and well-
supported and in a place where a lot of Gators showed up to cheer for us
tonight.  
  
Q. Are you going to bring Carol Ross before every game now?  
COACH BUTLER: Carol Ross has got other duties, and certainly I draw a lot of
the things that I do, and probably even things that I say from her. So just
her presence before and around the game today certainly made us feel good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll see you here tomorrow.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Jordan Greenleaf](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18036)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, a quick comment if you would and we'll take questions
for the players.  
COACH FORTNER: I thought we shot the ball really well tonight, and that's so
important when you're playing basketball. The ball has got to go in the hole.
But I was pleased with how we shot the ball. We hung tough at times.  
We were having a hard time pulling away from Arkansas, and then we just hung
tough and stayed with it and stayed with it and eventually did that, and it
was just the persistence and just hanging tough. So I was proud of the total
team effort. I thought we had good play off the bench and just proud of the
whole effort.  
  
Q. Dewanna, it looked like Arkansas threw a lot of different defenses at you
guys but you were still able to get some good shots, and you in particular
seemed to be able to get them pretty much when you wanted them?  
DEWANNA BONNER: I think that's something we worked on throughout the week, and
we came out aggressive and took the basket and got some open looks in the
middle and in the corner. We've been preparing for that, and I think we did a
good job against their defense.  
  
Q. Dewanna, how do you feel the first half as well as you and the team were
shooting?  
DEWANNA BONNER: I came out very confident, and we came out with a fire ready
to play. They came out shooting well and I fed off them and they fed off me
and we just kind of got rolling that way.  
  
Q. Jordan, similarly, just talk about your team shooting in the first
half.  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: I think that like Dewanna said, we came out and we executed
very well. I think we were just confident, and Coach has been talking about
confidence all year, and I think we just came out and we executed the offense
very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Even though you've already beat this team twice, can you talk about how
important it was to get ahead of them early and not let them hang around?  
COACH FORTNER: I'll tell you, they hung around for a long time. We couldn't
quite put them away, and that's a real credit to Arkansas. You know, in
preparing to play a team that you've played twice already and beaten twice,
it's not an ideal situation, but we made it more about us, more about Auburn
and how well we could come in here and play and get the win.  
We have a lot on the line here. We're trying to get to that NCAA tournament,
so the more wins we get, the better it is for those opportunities to happen.
We just made it more about us and didn't focus on it being Arkansas, and we
had played them twice already. We just wanted to come out and have a great
effort.  
  
Q. How momentous, Coach, is it to shoot well heading into a challenge
against Vanderbilt?  
COACH FORTNER: I think it's very important. A win builds confidence in your
team, and a good shooting percentage like that definitely will help our
confidence. And that's just very important for us. Vanderbilt is a very good
team, and it's going to be -- it'll be a tough ballgame for us.

## March 6, 2008

  

### [Demetress Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18038)

### [Ilona Burgrova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18039)

### [Susan Walvius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15514)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll ask you for an opening statement and we'll take
questions for the players and they can take off and we'll do questions for
you.  
COACH WALVIUS: Opening comment, you have to give Florida a lot of credit. I
thought they came out and played absolutely fantastic today. They were
extremely aggressive offensively. They made it difficult for us to feed our
post play, which was our game plan today, and you've got to give them a lot of
credit.  
We are hoping that we're going to have an opportunity to continue our season
and feel like we've -- we're hoping that we've got an opportunity to play in
the WNIT, and that's what we're talking about now in the locker room, just
continuing to hopefully have the opportunity to continue to play basketball.  
  
Q. For both of you, first half you go to the locker room and realize you've
been out scored by their hot shooter 19-17. A little disheartening she was
able to get going that early?  
DEMETRESS ADAMS: Yeah, it was a little disheartening, but our team has been a
team that has been able to fight back whenever we got down, and I think we did
a good job this time in trying to fight back and just to shore up those errors
that we made to get those shooters over it.  
ILONA BURGROVA: I don't have anything else to say.  
  
Q. Did they give you any different looks than they did in the regular
season?  
ILONA BURGROVA: What do you mean by different looks?  
  
Q. Did they surprise you with anything?  
ILONA BURGROVA: I think that this game they were able to run a little bit more
than they used to in the games before, but otherwise I think they played the
same game. They just were successful with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, players. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. How tough when you're shooting poorly in the first half to see someone
get hot and put you in hold the way she did?  
COACH WALVIUS: It did seem like everything they shot went in the basket.
They're competitors. It says a lot about them to come out and play the game
the way they did today. Their system didn't change in this game, but they were
much more aggressive within their system in this game today. I thought they
did a great job, not only offensively, but they did a much better job
defending us this game. They did a much better job on the boards this game.
Typically we are a good rebounding team. Typically we are a scrappy team and
they were able to get to the rim at will and score or get fouled, and I
thought they had an excellent game plan and I thought they executed it well.  
  
Q. When Marshae picked up her second foul early on, did you think you'd be
able to open up a big lead there?  
COACH WALVIUS: No, Florida has got a lot of talent, and one of the things
Florida does extremely well, as well as anyone, is attack the rim with
penetration. I thought the players that they had come in the game, I thought
they did a great job for them, especially on the defensive end. I was hoping
that maybe we could get a little bit of a rebounding advantage at that time,
but that didn't seem to go in our favor. Again, I thought Florida looked
absolutely great today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.
