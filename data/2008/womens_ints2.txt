_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Marist postgame press
conference. We'll have opening remarks from coach Brian Giorgis, then we'll
have interviews with our student-athletes.  
Coach, your opening comments, please.  
COACH GIORGIS: You know, as I told the kids in the locker room, I couldn't be
more proud of a group of kids. That's a great basketball team that we played
today on their home court, and I think we gave them everything they could
handle and more. Unfortunately we couldn't sustain it through, you know, the
whole 40 minutes.  
I thought Erica White was the difference. Her energy and her hitting the
perimeter shots, you know, caused us problems in our defense. And obviously
Sylvia's Sylvia. I said it yesterday, I think she's the greatest center that
I've ever seen as far as complete centers. There's a lot of them that can
score, but the things that she does on the other end as far as adjusting
shots, I mean, she came out of nowhere to block two shots, I'm sitting there,
Rachele with a 14-footer is open, is money, and all of a sudden it's blocked.  
You know, way tip our hats to them. We left everything on the floor. I
couldn't have asked more from our kids. We were right there with them on their
home court. A sign of a great team is a team that overcomes adversity, and
they overcame us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Julianne, particularly on the perimeter, their defense made you dribble
around so much, shot clock violations. How difficult was their defense to try
to penetrate?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Their defense is really unbelievable, probably the best
defense I've ever played against. You know, they really come at you,
especially in the second half. I mean, they were swarming us. When Fowles
starting jumping screens, it's even hard to see over her head. I mean, it's
hard. It really was hard. We did the best we could. But, yeah, I definitely
give them credit for their defense.  
  
Q. Rachele, it seemed like you had a good plan that when you got shots, they
went in. You had to like your game plan. How hard was it to sustain against
that kind of defensive pressure, even though you had a good plan?  
RACHELE FITZ: It's very hard. It's difficult because they do have such
athletic and long players, especially inside. So it was difficult to get the
ball inside, I feel.  
But when we did, we produced. We made our shots. It's hard, you know, after
Julianne had a good first half, so I'm trying to set screens. Her girl was
just sticking to her like nothing. So it's hard to set screens and continue to
get her open. It's hard to get the ball inside when you've got someone 6'6"
who's right there in your face. Even their other two post players are very
athletic and long. So we tried to capitalize on their size if Meg had them
down low, or me vice versa. It was just a rough game, battle down there.  
  
Q. The mood in the locker room at halftime to be only down two on their home
court, how is the team feeling coming out of the locker room for the second
half?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Well, we were feeling good because we were hanging right with
them. We were down, I don't know, maybe 10 or more points at one point that
half - more than that - and we came back. You know, going in at halftime, only
down by a couple points was huge. Sometimes that's what happens when you play
schools like this that go so deep. You start to lose gas in the second half.  
But we did, we were excited during halftime. You know, they just -- we ended
up just kind of, like I said, running out. But the mood was good at halftime.  
RACHELE FITZ: Definitely, I think we came in with a lot of energy. We had
confidence. Like coach said, we had our game plan and we made the other people
heroes that we were supposed to.  
  
Q. Julianne, just hitting some big threes in that first half, emotionally
how you were feeling you're helping to keep this team hanging around?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Well, it felt good to hit them. I knew I had to do something
to get us going 'cause I felt like we started out a little slow. So it
definitely got things rolling, I thought, both individually and I think as a
team.  
I was definitely blessed that they were going in. It was helping us somewhat,
right?  
  
Q. Julianne, in the middle of the second half, Erica, there about midway
through the first half, single digits, she would hit a big shot. She had
steals, did this, did that. When you're watching another player get hotter,
get off like that in a stretch, what are you thinking?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Yeah, she started going off. But she was one of the players
that we kind of wanted to force to beat us, and she stepped up, she really
did. And it was frustrating. It's frustrating to watch another player just,
you know, go off and light it up. There's only so much you can do. You pick
your poison. We had a really good game plan.  
But, yeah, you know, to answer your question, it is frustrating when
somebody's getting steals and then making shots left and right when it's
somebody that you were hoping wouldn't. And she did, so I give her a lot of
credit for that.  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to excuse the student-athletes now. Coach Giorgis
will now preside at the press conference. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. You said yesterday a lot of people weren't giving you a chance coming in
today. Being down at halftime, how were you feeling about the way the team was
playing?  
COACH GIORGIS: We felt great. First thing I said when we went into the locker
room, I said, This is what happens when you execute a game plan.  
Again, we were a little out of our element because we switched to the matchup
after the first couple of series where we obviously struggled with fouls. And
Meg picked up the two fouls early, so she's going to be cautious. We said, You
have to give up shots. Our kids aren't used to it. We've been a very good
defensive team. We pride ourselves in getting out on shooters. Our whole game
plan basically was, you know, if Thomas, White, LeBlanc, anybody else but
Chaney and Fowles is shooting the ball, that's a good thing. That's what we
tried to do.  
In fact, I think in the second-half run, if I'm not mistaken with the stats, I
think White only had eight threes all year. She hit the two. She hadn't taken
many. It's not that she wasn't a good shooter, but she only made eight threes
all year. She hit those two in a row. The dagger was -- we had done a great
job on Chaney. And twice we had communication problems where she got open
looks. She hit the one three that put it into double figures. You couldn't
hear yourself think. It really got the crowd back into it. That was right on
the run when we had to call the quick timeout. Another one was on an inbound
play. We switched out like we normally do and then all of a sudden we left
her. She stuck the bucket.  
You know, for her to get 10 was really what we didn't want. We had done such a
good job on her in the first half where she only had the one field goal. And I
got on Erica's case because she was supposed to be all over her and force her
to drive. We had just a couple mental errors there. Then when you're down 11
and now all of a sudden you start doing things, start panicking a little bit.
The crowd did a great job for them, you know, because we'd call out things or
we'd show signals and either we couldn't see them or couldn't hear them so a
lot of kids weren't sure what we were in.  
  
Q. You've talked all year about the senior leadership. For the seniors in
that locker room, how are you feeling? What are you going to remember about
the years they've given you?  
COACH GIORGIS: One, I'm going to remember how hard they cried because they're
pretty upset right now. But like we told them, I mean, 102 wins in a career,
you can't ask for much more. You're averaging 25 wins a year. National
rankings two consecutive years. Again, I think they said they felt they
validated their top 25 ranking. I mean, heck, Tennessee lost to these guys by
19 on their own court. We were right there. If Rachele makes the bucket at the
end of the half, would have been the ultimate contortion shot, we would have
been tied at the half.  
You know, it reminded us when we played UConn a couple years ago in the NIT,
we get to that 10-minute mark of the half, Gino benched his whole frontline
because he's ticked at them, we're down three at the half, all of a sudden
that same type of thing, that little run. Then all of a sudden, you know,
you're gasping for air, you're trying to do something to get back.  
So, you know, hopefully we build on that. But, you know, we have some great
seniors to replace. We've got a great recruiting class coming in. These kids
have helped build what I feel is a top 25 program. I told the kids today when
we did the tour of the football stadium, when you look at the resources you
have here, compared to a school of 4,000, it's an absolutely wonderful
academic school, one of the prettiest schools you'll see, you just see the
difference in terms of that where -- you know, I can't be more proud of a
group of people because we don't have any BCS scholarship offers for our kids,
yet we played with them for 30 minutes today and had a crowd and a bench that
was very nervous, you know, with kids who didn't receive scholarship offers
from the big schools that have these types of facilities and resources. They
just wanted to go and have a great academic education, you know, playing in a
great conference that's known for its academics, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. You have an outstanding program.
Best of luck next year.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 24, 2008

  

### [Lisa Etienne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18370)

### [Jennifer Rizzotti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18369)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Hartford. Coach Rizzotti will have some
introductory comments, then a session with the student-athletes.  
Coach, your opening comments, please.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, obviously we ran into a defensive buzz saw tonight. The
pressure that Texas A&M put on us was unlike anything we have seen and
probably anything we would have been able to prepare for, even if we had a
week. Just giving them a lot of credit for how hard they played and how they
were able to maintain their intensity for 40 minutes was really impressive.  
We always talk to our kids if they want to go deep in the post-season, you
have to do it with defense and rebounding. I certainly think Texas A&M has the
same philosophy about defending to get them to advance. They proved that
tonight. They were phenomenal.  
I'm proud of my kids and the season we had. 28 wins is the most we've ever had
in the program's history. Although they're upset, which I'm glad they're upset
we lost, when they look back and reflect on the year, for the seniors on their
careers, they have a lot to be proud of. We accomplished a lot this year.
Their hunger to try to get to the Sweet 16 was to me very impressive. Although
we didn't play our best tonight, I know they gave a lot of effort. For the
guys coming back, it's a great experience for us to learn from.  
Lastly, I know I'm going to make her more of a mess and she's probably not
worth anything to anybody right now talking-wise, but I'm just proud of
Danielle, what she has done and what she has meant. She's really been the face
of the University of Hartford women's basketball program. Nobody has ever come
through those doors and done what she's done as an individual. She's really
taken our program to a whole 'nother level. Whatever we accomplish in the
future, she will always be a big part of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lisa, talk about their defense tonight, how difficult it was to even get
an entry pass into the post or anywhere on the court.  
LISA ETIENNE: As y'all saw, it really was that good. I mean, it was like 10 of
'em out there. It was so hard to get the ball into the wings. Couldn't get it
to the post players. They were just everywhere. It was really hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll excuse the student-athletes. Coach,
we may have one or two more questions for you.  
  
Q. Jen, you had expressed some trepidations yesterday about points on
turnovers. It was like 19-0 at halftime. What did you see out there that you
could have done that you didn't?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I felt like, you know, their defense to begin with was taking
us out of our offense. But it also took us mentally out of the game. That's
probably what I was most frustrated with. Even when we drew something up out
of a timeout or talked about something at halftime to adjust to their
pressure, I think our kids were so mentally flustered with their pressure and
physicalness, they weren't even in the right spots. That's something I said to
them. I can't help you score a basket if I draw something up and you run it
wrong.  
That's a maturity thing. That's something that we'll have to get better at.
But, again, it's hard to put them in that situation a lot. We played a pretty
good non-conference schedule and were very successful against everybody but
UConn in terms of playing against pressure. But no team we've played has been
able to maintain their defensive intensity the way that Texas A&M did tonight.
Not even close. I mean, even the UConn game, as good as they were, it was a
different kind of mental breakdown. Tonight was just all about them physically
staying in denial, pressuring us, taking away cuts, taking away passes for 40
straight minutes until the buzzer ended.  
Looking back and talking to the younger guys coming back, that will be our
focus, is that we got to be able to still think the game and still mentally
adjust when teams are outplaying us physically. That's something that I was
probably most disappointed with tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you've had a magnificent season. You have only three
seniors on your team, lots of great things to look forward for.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: We'll be back.

## March 24, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have a brief opening comment from Coach Chancellor.
Coach, your opening comments.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: First of all, I want to give our opponents a lot of credit.
I thought Marist, they were so well-coached, so disciplined and did so many
great things. Maybe they didn't have someone 6'6" and a guard that played out
of her mind today like we did.  
I was just amazed at how hard they play, how much heart they have. And no
wonder they went to the Sweet-16 last year and come within a hair of going
today to a Sweet-16.  
They come into our building and played great. That should be hats off to that
group of kids and their coaching staff. They had a great plan and followed it.
We just probably had a little bit too much height at the end for them and our
point guard play.  
I'll say this, our point guard tonight, when she got her second foul, I don't
want to say all the thoughts that were going through my head at that time. But
when she came out, she was well-rested for the second half, played like she
did, I just thought that was your best performance since you've been at lust.
Agree or disagree?  
ERICA WHITE: Agree.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Sylvia, you were just Sylvia. You're a great player.  
Sylvia Fowles just became the all-time rebounder in the history of the SEC.
All-time rebounder. Did you know that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Brian told me in the locker room (laughter).  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I told y'all yesterday about who was smarter than me
(laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Sylvia or Erica, a game like this is a game that a lot of teams need the
extra push heading into the Sweet-16. Is this the game you needed tonight to
let you know nothing comes for free when it's tournament time?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Yeah, I agree. During this time, when you go up against
opponents, it's a win or lose and they gonna give they all no matter what name
you got written across your chest. Marist came out tonight and proved they
wanted it, but we wanted it even more.  
ERICA WHITE: I think Marist was a great opponent for us, because they're so
disciplined, they play so smart and they never quit. To have to fight as hard
as we did to win, you need that in a tournament. Even if we're the No. 2 seed
playing at home, you're gonna get a game, so it was great for us.  
  
Q. Erica, I gather you weren't too happy about having to sit on the bench in
the first half. You played like you were on a mission in the second half. What
went through your head, even though the coach doesn't want to say? Sylvia, is
LSU two teams, one team wither her and one without her?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I won't say we're two different teams, but our momentum changes
when she's off the floor. Like I say, Erica gets everything going. She the
head of the snake, and without her we're kind of lost.  
ERICA WHITE: When I got my two fouls, those were some tough calls. That was
tough going out of the game so early. But I just tried to stay focused, just
stay in the game mentally and come back in the second half and play well.  
  
Q. Erica, can you talk a little bit, in the second half it looked like you
had a certain fire and intensity in your eyes. You were not going to be
denied. Can you describe what was going through your mind midway through the
second half.  
ERICA WHITE: You know, the style of Marist, the style of defense they were
going to play was Pacman defense. They were basically going to sit four people
on Sylvia and dare us to shoot. So basically all night I was just dreaming
about knocking down open shots. And so, you know, I didn't get a chance to do
that in the first half. So I just tried to stay focused.  
You know, my teammates and I received a handout before the game where some
Marist players thought that our defense was questionable. That definitely fed
into my intensity and made me want to play even harder. So I was happy I could
compete, you know, in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, Erica did everything but dust off her shoulders in the middle of
the game. Was it hard controlling her? Or do you let a player like that go
when they're feeling it like they are?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: About three times on the bench tonight, our staff was
saying, No, no, no. Then she would make play after play. We were saying, Man,
I taught her to make that play. I thought that was a great shot (laughter).  
I thought one of the differences for us tonight, in the first half, we were
going to put Sylvia on 14 and put Ashley on 12 because we thought 12 -- we're
trying to keep Sylvia out of foul trouble. So when we switched that in the
second half, we were able to put Sylvia on 12 because she didn't have but one
foul. I thought that turned us around. Then we stopped those guards from
penetrating. But we were trying to get to halftime for her with one foul.  
Sylvia's defensive player of the year, but I think Erica White is the best
defensive point guard on the ball in the country.  
  
Q. For all three of you, talk about Marist's defense, especially in the
first half. They seemed to triple Sylvia, were running a box-and-one on
Quianna, took her out of the game. Talk about the way they played defense the
first half or so.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You want to answer that?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Erica.  
ERICA WHITE: Well, in the first half, like you said, they had someone trailing
Quianna so she couldn't get the ball. They basically had three people on
Sylvia daring us to shoot.  
The difference in the game was in the first half we were not able to knock
down open shots. In the second half we knocked down perimeter shots, then they
have to come up and guard us. You look up and Sylvia is being guarded by one
defender, and no one defender in the country can guard her.  
I think that was the difference in the game in the second half. We just said,
If you're going to dare us to shoot, we're going to knock 'em down. That
opened Sylvia up and that opened the game up.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Coach Starkey suggested in the second half, we were setting
high ball screens, and we decided to set low ball screens. When we did that,
make the forward come off of Sylvia, that's how we were able to get her open
in the second half a little bit. Our players were really smart and ran it
really good. But I thought they had a great defensive plan for our team.  
  
Q. Erica, with 13:30 left in the second half, you got a steal. You proceeded
to go the length of the floor, get the bucket. That was the ignition point. Is
that the kind of performance you'll need not only from yourself but other
players as you make your run towards the Final Four and possible national
championship?  
ERICA WHITE: Definitely. Making a play on the defensive end of the floor,
that's something we've hung our hat on her at LSU. That's something we're
going to have to continue to do. We pride ourselves on our defense and make
those plays. Then on the other end, if you have a layup, make the basket. We
have threes, let's knock 'em down.  
As we continue to drive through the tournament, that's gonna be our focus,
just to make plays, especially on the defensive end, but on the offensive end,
as well.  
  
Q. Erica, could you tell us what was going through your mind when Coach
Chancellor pulled you out for the last time, and then when you were out there
at mid-court after the game, knowing this part of lust is over.  
ERICA WHITE: I was thinking, this is my last time in this building and these
fans are incredible. I just wanted to just go out and touch every single one
of them. I knew that that wasn't possible. But I just wanted to wave to as
many people as I could and just make eye contact to let them know they do mean
a lot to us. Our fans are incredible. They've been incredible for four years.
At that moment, I was thinking of them. They were up on their feet, cheering.
I was just thinking about all the things I love about LSU, the fans, the band,
the cheerleaders, the Tiger Girls, everyone on staff. Every aspect of LSU,
everyone that goes into this program, I was just thinking of them.  
Sad that I have to leave, but just wanted to pay a tribute to them.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: What was going through my head was that this was my last time
on the court. I got a little numb feeling in my stomach, but it was a good
feeling just to see our fans up yelling and screaming and knowing we did a
great thing and we left on a good note.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you got the record on one of the cheapest rebounds ever. Ashley
blocked a shot, the ball went right in your hands. But seriously talk about
getting the record in this league. You know how many great players there are.
How special is the record to you?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's very special. But to be honest, I barely think about it.
If I go out there and I do what I have to do on the court, it will pay off. It
has showed.  
But I credit my teammates for that, for getting me in the right position,
especially Erica. I know there's a few times she had to tell me to get to the
ball, to do this, to do that, help on this.  
But I'm happy to hold the title. But it's just another thing for me. Not too
exciting, I guess.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll excuse the student-athletes now and have a
session with Coach Chancellor. Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, particularly the defense, the way you were able to hold Marist to
really a few shot clock violations, also make them chew up the shot clock, how
important was that?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought we were able to -- we kept them from just running
their offense so fluid like they had in the previous game. So when the shot
clock ran down, and I thought in the first half they hurt us with penetration
because Sylvia was outside on 14. Then in the second half, that's why I took
the 30-second timeout. I usually don't take that. I don't like to take it. But
I did because I wanted to change the adjustment. That let our perimeter people
know they could pressure more because if their man got by them, two or three
times 3 and 22 drove in, but they saw Sylvia out of the corner of their eyes,
not how many shots she blocks, but how many shots she changes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that handout that Erica mentioned that said Marist
said y'all didn't play defense or something.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Bob Starkey gives out handouts and motivational tapes and
everything. We just talked about the things that they did. See, when you have
a turnaround of only one day, we always call what I call bullet points that I
try to emphasize. I think you can emphasize too much. You got to pick out one
or two things you're gonna try to take away, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Coach, this team was almost a tale of two halves. Two-point lead at
halftime. Second half was pretty much a runaway. When you look at this, is
this team going to need to have two solid halves as the competition gets
better throughout the tournament?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Here's what happened to us. I've said it all along. I didn't
want to say it in front of Erica too much 'cause I didn't want to give her the
big head. Any time we've lost her, she is kind of the head of our defensive
operation. Tay-Tay gets a lot of credit, Sylvia does. But when we lost her, we
lost our little offensive sync, and we were trying to hang on till halftime.
At halftime, we knew we were going to switch Sylvia, then we were going to
turn Erica lose because we thought she would be fresh. We wasn't trying to do
anything in the first half but hold on.  
  
Q. Coming off the court at halftime, you seemed a little bit frustrated
maybe about LSU's last attempt to get a shot. Didn't go well with Ashley
Thomas. A failed layup there. What was the mood like at halftime and what did
you say to the team in the locker room?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: At halftime, our mood was one that we didn't think we were
playing that well. So my mood was to take the first part of the half and
correct some things that we were going to do. But at that time we began to
talk about positive things. We were playing at home. Our crowd would make a
difference. Let's execute. We're going to wear them down sooner or later.  
Then I cautioned Q. Sometimes when you're having a little box-and-one run on
you, they're manning you, zoning the rest of them, you're used to shooting a
lot, you get frustrated. We talked to her about that. We talked about just
getting the ball to Sylvia. We told them at halftime if they put seven around
her, bring two off the bench, get her the ball. We were saying, they had three
around her. I think they had everybody on the team around her. None of them
can stop her.  
  
Q. You had a lot of missed shots from outside, Allison and RaShonta. But
they kept shooting it. Did you continue to give them the green light?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Perhaps in my mind, that's the most difficult decision in
coaching. You're there, they're just packing your post player, they're manning
your best outside shooter. You can't get any shots. They're just getting other
people wide open. If you stop 'em, that hurts their confidence, then you can't
get the ball inside.  
So I first of all tried to say, Just shoot it. Then I stopped them and said,
Let's don't shoot it till the last 12 seconds of the half. And then I called
them over, the two that were struggling, I bragged on them, told them little
funny stories, different things. Obviously did none of that help (laughter). I
tried every psychological ploy I knew.  
So I finally stopped all of that and called another timeout and told them to
pass the ball inside. If that hurts you're feelings, I'm sorry, but enough is
enough. I have great faith in my shooters. I can't get them to have as much
faith in them as I have in them.  
  
Q. Do you remember a game with that many shot clock violations?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's amazing. Our team -- that's because a lot of teams play
us. I'm going to say this. We have them come in here all the time, on the
road, everywhere else. I read in the paper the next day, they say we just
didn't shoot well. But we have the most suffocating defense I've ever been
around. And I'm bragging here about our team. And usually we do cause a lot of
shot clock violations. We play kind of an inside-out type of defense.  
  
Q. Talk about the crowd.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: When we went up six, I thought our crowd made a major
difference in our defense today. When we started, it really ignited Erica.  
  
Q. When you look at the way the game went tonight, home crowd played a huge
part in the game. Is that something you're looking forward to when you go down
to New Orleans? The second half, it sounded like an LSU/UConn or Tennessee
game. Is that something you're going to be counting and relying on?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think this: crowds don't win games, but they can help you
emotionally. I thought tonight they just helped us so much. When we were
struggling a little bit offensively, we had to win the game defensively, and I
thought they generated a lot of enthusiasm and got us pumped up. That's where
our crowd helps us you more defensively than it does offensively. And I hope
we'll carry a great crowd to New Orleans.  
I thank you for your support of this tournament and women's basketball. I hope
you have a great day. I'm going to have a tremendous night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck in New Orleans.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the postgame press conference. I'd like to welcome
the victorious Texas A&M Aggies. Coach Blair will have an opening comment and
we'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach Blair, your opening comments, please.  
COACH BLAIR: I thought basically our defense controlled the tempo of the
ballgame and we were forcing them to making drives in the last five seconds.
Their post player was doing a good job of hurting all of my post players on
her drives at the end.  
I thought our wings was doing a pretty good job. You got to give up something.
We'll have that talk about our post players about giving up the drive to the
basket, but 24 was doing a good job the whole night. I liked our intensity. I
liked what we were doing in transition. We got a lot of easy baskets off of
steals. A lot of that -- whoever scores the layup is not necessarily the one
that created the turnover, she's the recipient, because we're a very unselfish
team on giving up the basketball, like in the second half when we had a three
on one, when it went from T.K. to Morenike back to Gant. These kids are very
unselfish and they do the things.  
Certain nights it might be Starks' night. She just got selected District 5
Kodak All-American today into the top 40. We're happy for her. On other nights
it might be D.G. we have instant offense coming off the bench.  
Eastern style of basketball is old school of basketball that I really admire
because they have to play the game between the ears, not necessarily above the
rim. You have to set screens. You got to run a good motion. And they are a
very good team, just like you saw Marist earlier. I think ourselves and LSU
were just a little bit too athletic for them. I think that showed. But what it
didn't show was on the rebounding. Hartford came in and just kicked us on the
boards just about the whole night because of just special effort. But as a
result they were giving up something in transition. But I would just like to
commend Hartford, what Coach Rizzotti has built over there in such a short
time. You better enjoy the ride if you're in the mid-level schools.  
But Marist made it last year to the Sweet 16. Perhaps next year it will be
Hartford's time. We got a tremendous break when 23 got into foul trouble
because she runs the show for 'em and does an excellent job. When she went out
of the ballgame, it created a whole lot of more scoring opportunities for us.  
But I'm proud of these young ladies up here, just like I am of the ones in the
dressing room. But it was a very businesslike game for us. We're gonna play
pressure. I thought the officiating was fair for both teams. We've got to get
a little bit better at making the right decisions and do it consistently once
we start going against the teams that will be in the Sweet 16.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the evolution? Last year was one-and-done, two
years was losing in the first round. To get to the Sweet 16, talk about how
satisfying it was and your goals going forward.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Well, I will start out by saying we were still growing as a
team. We were inexperienced. We hadn't been there before. We didn't know what
it took to win games. We had the talent, but talent -- Coach Blair mentioned
it to us before we came out to the game that talent doesn't win games. Every
night you have to be smart, you have to play together as a team.  
But I think this is a great win for us and we've grown over the years. This
just gives us great momentum and we'll just keep growing as a team every game.  
  
Q. Danielle, we quizzed you about going into the press table. On the first
possession of Hartford, you went halfcourt for a loose ball that set the
tempo. Talk about the defense and what you wanted to establish early.  
DANIELLE GANT: We wanted to get a lot of turnovers. In the first half, we
didn't do that. In the locker room we got a little, uhm, word from Coach
Schaefer. He wanted us to come out in the second half and play great defense.
And I think that's what we did.  
  
Q. Danielle, Oklahoma City, you're going home. Talk about how that's going
to feel to play there.  
DANIELLE GANT: It's great. Always great to go home and play in front of my
family and friends. Like I said, it's going to be great. We went there not too
long ago. I seen all my family. But just to go back and see them there again,
it's going to be great.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about the feeling of this team, the businesslike win here,
on this winning streak, talk about the feeling inside the locker room, the
confidence going on?  
DANIELLE GANT: I think it's great. The four losses we got in the beginning of
the season really got us going now during this part of the time. But it's
great just to have all these wins. I mean, the team, at first we were a little
down because we got those four losses. I think that didn't do nothing but help
create this winning streak that we have now.  
  
Q. Mo and La Toya, I notice there wasn't a whole lot of celebration out
there. First trip to the Sweet 16 in 14 years. Is that because you're still
looking at more business, more things to accomplish?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think what was different is -- I'm not saying in the past
years we haven't expected to win. Like I said, we have grown. We're smarter as
a team. We play together. We expect to win big games. We're not the No. 2
seed, no one picked us No. 2 seed for no reason. We just go out and try to
play like a No. 2 seed should.  
La TOYA MICHEAUX: I think what Mo said was correct. We're happy inside. But we
realize we have business to take care and we're looking forward to the next
game. We're very excited to make the Sweet 16. I believe it was the first time
in school history that we made that. No, since 1996. Much as we feel we're
expected to be there, we worked hard. I just think that's something we
deserve. When you look at the Final Four and stuff like that, you'll see a
celebration there.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Can you talk about shooting. If I would have said you weren't going to
hit your first three till nearly halfway through the second half, would you
have been pretty concerned going in?  
COACH BLAIR: They were doing a good job of denying us out. I just said, Get
the midrange shot, hurt them inside. We started doing that at the start of the
second half. I said, We do not have to shoot the three. It's something that we
do very well, is defend the three. It's something that Hartford does very well
also.  
Most of the time we were shooting a three on the end of a shot clock
situation. We were short on almost every one of them because they had a great
high hand in our face. The rest of the time we got to create, put it on the
deck, go to the hole, try to draw the foul, kick out or something. Our ball-
handling skills was not very good today at end-of-game situations.  
There's some things we did well. When you look at the assist-turnover ratio on
Starks and A'Qua, they might not have had the best shooting game, but they
took care of the ball and set it up for other teammates. The best thing we
could do is to use our dribble-penetration, get it inside. And that's what
Gant was doing a number of times. Reado played well in spurts.  
  
Q. Obviously now this is your third program to take to the Sweet 16. What is
different in a program when you reach the Sweet 16? What happens? What's
different?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, I would love to be facing a bunch of Cinderellas in there.
But I don't think that's gonna happen.  
You expect to play the best. That's what it's all about. We're the lowest No.
2 seed, but we're there. Everybody else is trying to play to get there. We
want to represent the Big 12. But what we want to do is represent that you can
get to the Sweet 16 without a bunch of parade All-Americans all the time.
Sure, we'd love to have 'em. But all of a sudden you can get there with just
pure basketball players that know how to play the game.  
I think we play both ends of the floor very well. That's our strength. Other
teams play one end of the floor well or they might be great on situation plays
or they might be good on the other end. But we play both ends very well. And
we've got a tremendous bench that gives me the luxury of staying in the press
a little bit longer than we normally do. That's what I did today. I stayed in
the press, trying to wear out and make their point guard have to make some
decisions. As a result, we were able to get a couple of charges on her just
because she had nowhere to go.  
  
Q. What about the program? What does this do for the program?  
COACH BLAIR: There's room for people to jump on this bandwagon at any time. I
don't think we have our spring football game for at least a couple weeks,
right? Okay, baseball's doing fine. They're doing fine. Our men had a great
season. They went right down to the wire on another tough call.  
Right now it's just about women. Isn't that great? The front page of your
sports page is going to be about women, either our swimming team finishing
fourth in Nationals. Shoot, we might even have a woman president. You never
know what's gonna happen.  
But right now isn't it good for women's athletics? Right now all across the
way, people actually do care. That's what this program is all about. We want
to go to that next level. We don't just want to get up there and play hard,
everybody pat us on the back. We're in this thing to win now, okay? When this
hair gets gray, I get greedy, and I'm ready to win.  
Hartford, you got a heck of a basketball coach. I don't know how much longer
you can keep her, but keep her just having babies and she's just going to stay
closer to home, okay, because you've got one heck of a basketball coach. And
you don't have to go to University of's to be successful. I had a great run at
Stephen F. Austin, which is very similar. Take care of your coach. Take care
of your assistants. Keep her there.  
  
Q. Danielle had the hot hand. Your thoughts on how she came through?  
COACH BLAIR: Danielle Gant never takes a bad shot, okay? She's very left
shoulder orientated, but at the same time try to stop it. I mean, it's hard.
We ran a couple of set plays for her on a lob early to start the ballgame,
then they made the adjustments, we went to something else. She's just very
good at putting the ball on the floor. Her first step from defense to offense
is the quickest I've ever coached. So when there's a steal about to happen,
she's already down the court. She anticipates very well.  
The kid is a next-level player. The best thing about her, she's a junior. Sort
of like Archie in the comic books. He never was a senior. He was a junior for
all those years. That's how that comic strip kept going.  
I love Danielle Gant because of how hard she plays. She makes the rest of us
play just as hard because she does the same thing in practice every day. It
never stops.  
THE MODERATOR: I think that's a wrap, coach. Good luck in Oklahoma City.  
COACH BLAIR: Appreciate it. You've done a great job of running this
tournament. Thank y'all.

### [Marylynne Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18416)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: No. 23, Lisa Etienne, No. 24, Danielle Hood, and No. 33,
MaryLynne Schafer, and the head coach of the Hartford Hawks, Jennifer,
Rizzotti. Coach, would you please open up with a comment, and then we'll open
it up.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Thanks for being here. We're excited to be playing another
day, and it's what our purpose was coming down here, to advance in the NCAA
tournament. Yesterday we broke our school record for wins with 28 on the
season, so I'm proud of the adversity we've handled throughout the year and
the amount of wins we've been able to get against quality competition, and
certainly Syracuse was one of the hardest teams we've played. We're excited to
be playing another game, and we know Texas A&M is going to be tougher, but
we're certainly up for the challenge.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, how late did you stay up to watch yourself on ESPN?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I actually went to sleep. We saw it at dinner I think once
and then I've had family tell me about it later but I haven't had an
opportunity to see it again.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, I was down at Tampa and Ty Rogers from western Kentucky hit a
shot and he said he went back and had 172 text messages waiting for him. I
wondered if you had any and if you could tell me the interesting part of
that.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I had 10 or 12, family and friends, old AAU teammates,
people I've come in contact with. It was nice to have that support.  
  
Q. Danielle, I would like you to talk about their man-to-man defense versus
the zone defenses you've been facing lately and how you guys plan to -- is
that more beneficial for you or less?  
DANIELLE HOOD: I think we play better against man but, I mean, we've
definitely beat teams who play us in zone so it's good to play a team that
plays us in man so we can go back to running our plays that we love to run so
we're excited.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about when you played for Coach Blair? He talked
about when you played for him in the Jones Cup.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I don't know any secrets, but I feel like I know what his --
obviously watching them but knowing from -- playing for him his team is going
to play really hard. The way that he coaches and the respect that he shows for
his players, I think, makes them want to play hard for him. He's not the type
of guy who berates kids, he's encouraging, but he knows how to get you to play
hard, and he demands the right things, and you can see in the discipline that
they play with that they listen and they buy in.  
It's certainly worked for them. They're a phenomenal basketball team,
certainly one of the best in the country, and we're excited about having a
chance to play against them and, like Hood said, test out our man sets now,
instead of forty minutes of zone. But they're one of the best man-to-man teams
in the country, and it's going to be a battle, and we're going to have to be
ready for it.  
  
Q. Jennifer, Texas A &M people talked about going into this tournament, it
was a big year for them; they needed to get to the Sweet 16. What could a win
like this do for your program?   
COACH RIZZOTTI: Obviously it takes us to a level we've never been before and
gives us the national exposure that this group of girls has been seeking.
We've been fighting to be in the Top 25 all year; we've been on the cusp of
it. We've played a tough schedule to give us consideration as an at-large bid
team, which I think we did, even if we weren't to win our championship, and,
you know, this team has been to this point before, MaryLynne and Danielle and
-- not Lisa as a player but she was part of the team.  
They've played in the second round of the NCAA tournament. For us it's a
chance to take a step further, and I know there is nothing more that Danielle
and the players want more than a birth to the Sweet 16.  
So I think for any team in the country getting to the Sweet 16 is a big feat.
So as much as it means to them, it means that much to us, as well, and it can
do wonders for the exposure of our program and what we're trying to do to get
to the NCAA every year, and not only get there but be a team that wins in it.
It's certainly going to help us in that cause.  
  
Q. Lisa, the post players obviously have been your biggest offense most of
the year. The guards have broken out in the last few games. Can you talk about
that a little bit, your mindsets as guards, you and MaryLynne, what you guys
have been doing differently?  
LISA ETIENNE: I think we've been doing what we've been doing all year, but a
lot of teams have focused more on our post players, so we're getting a lot of
open shots and more opportunities to shoot and score, so I think we're
stepping up and knocking down shots right now.  
  
Q. Danielle, your game went down to the wire, and I think all the starters
played over 30 minutes. Texas A &M, nobody played more than 25 minutes. Even
with a day off, does that make a difference at this point in the season?   
DANIELLE HOOD: I think it makes a big difference. Coach Rizzotti can go deep
in her bench, and when everyone can play, it limits your minutes and keeps you
fresh. So when other teams have to play their starting five for over 30
minutes, they're going to be more tired than we are.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Don't forget, Danielle only played 18 minutes, because she was
in foul trouble the whole game, so she should be plenty fresh. Maybe she can
give Lisa and Beverly and MaryLynne a break!  
Certainly it may make a difference, but mentally it shouldn't. You're playing
for everything right now, and we talked about this in our America East
tournament, we were the fresher team because we were able to play people less.
But never underestimate an opponent, because what they have in their heart and
their effort can overcome any type of physical fatigue, and we might have to
count on a few more guys off the bench this time.  
I think Lisa and Erica and MaryLynne are strong enough to play 30 and come
back and play another 30 if we need them to, but hopefully we'll have some of
your younger guys ready as well.  
  
Q. Jen, I wanted to ask you about preparation this time, vis-a-vis after
knocking off Temple and going to Georgia -- against Georgia, is your team more
mature this time? Are you better ready? Did you feel that you were ready last
time? Could you talk about that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Honestly, I probably feel like our coaching staff is more
ready this time around. I think that when we beat Temple there was such an
excitement about it, that -- not that we didn't prepare for Georgia, but it
might not have been to the degree we would with one day in between.  
And I feel like this time we learned from that, and we had been watching tape
on Texas A&M before we played Syracuse -- not me, but someone on my staff --
to make sure we were prepared and ready. And just like during the season when
you only have one game, or in the case of a tournament like Hawaii or the
America East tournament, you don't have any days to prepare, you still as a
coaching staff know what to expect, and you can convey that to your players.  
These guys adjust well. They can adjust to a team in shootaround if we need
them to. That's what we did out in Hawaii, and they were ready when we had to
play Virginia on the third day, and it's similar to that except we got an
extra hour and a half today, and we are going from zone to man-to-man, and a
"man" like we've probably never seen.  
I feel confident that our kids have worked hard all year to prepare for this
moment, and our guards are going to have to be ready to handle the pressure,
and our posts are going to have to be effective certainly in the paint and
also rebounding, but I think our team is more prepared for this moment than
they were two years ago, definitely.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Coach, student athletes, thank you very
much. Best wishes.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome back to the podium here Marist, the Marist
Red Foxes. No. 12, Rachele Fitz; No. 22, Nikki Flores; and No. 14, Meg
Dahlman. The head coach, Brian Giorgis.  
COACH GIORGIS: Nice to be able to come back and make an opening statement.  
We're excited to still be here and looking forward to tomorrow. I don't have
that much to say; we'll just take your questions.  
  
Q. Coach, happy Easter. What impresses you about Louisiana State?  
COACH GIORGIS: About everything. Their length and their athleticism, just
unbelievable. Their defense is obviously extremely strong, and we're going to
try to find ways to attack it and hopefully score some baskets.  
  
Q. Particularly the way the team won yesterday, what's that say about the
explosiveness that they have, which you might need against a team like LSU?  
COACH GIORGIS: The one thing that's great about our kids is because of their
experience and the success that they've had, they're not going to quit on
anything. They know that we have a formidable opponent tomorrow, but at the
same time, you know, we've played against people like Tennessee in the last
couple of years, and that doesn't mean we've won 'em, but, you know, it hasn't
been because we were intimidated or haven't attacked.  
That's what I like about our kids. They're just going to get after it. They
know it could be their last one and, you know, that it's on their court, with
their high-ranking. It doesn't matter; they're just going to get after it.  
  
Q. Coach, going back and reviewing the end of the game, the 32-2 run. I'm
sure you haven't been following anything like that. Is there anything in your
recollection as a coach or watching the game that you can recall something
like that happening?  
COACH GIORGIS: You know, it's kind of interesting, when you're in the game,
you don't even think of it. I didn't know we had a 32-2 run to finish the game
until somebody told me after the game. I just knew that we hit a bunch of
three's to get back into the game, and we got a lot of good stops, and our
biggest problem was giving up second-shot opportunities.  
And I noticed we were forcing tough shots and getting the rebound, so it was
one and done for them, and we were finding ways to score from different people
down the stretch. So, like I say, I hadn't been a part of something like that,
but it was lot of fun being part of something like that.  
  
Q. For Meg and Rachele, Coach talked about attacking the defense. Tomorrow
night how do you plan to do your best against their bigs?  
STUDENT ATHLETE: I think we have to realize we're not going to -- it will be
hard to stop them completely, so they are going to get their buckets, but if
we can limit them to one shot and rebound the ball really well, then hopefully
that will lead to our offense on the other end.  
STUDENT ATHLETE: It's going to be hard to get inside, we know that, from the
get-go. So we have to use our ability to shoot outside and to draw the posts
when we're going down low and kick the ball out. That's it.  
  
Q. For the players, just kind of a question off the topic of basketball.
Being here for Easter so far away from home, it seems like it would be a tough
situation, but Coach Blair from Texas A &M mentioned you guys miss lots of
holidays. Is this another one like it? Is this just the usual for you guys?   
MEG DAHLMAN: We're used to being on the road a lot, and I think we like
playing on the road, and I know my mom and brother are here; Rachele's parents
are here, and Nikki's dad and mom, so our families are great, and they travel
with us practically everywhere we go, so we're not that far away from them,
because they're always with us.  
  
Q. Nikki, how hard is it going to be for you to get the ball inside, and how
imperative is it for you and Juls to have a good game from the outside?  
NIKKI FLORES: Well, the guards are athletic, as is the rest of the team, so
we'll have to be able to make decisions, utilize penetration and kick, maybe
even kick interiorly, it depends on what the defense gives to us.  
  
Q. Coach, it's a familiar refrain what Meg said about limiting them inside,
but you limit them inside and Chaney might start hitting 3's, White might
start driving, it might be hard to not be pro LSU here, but how hard will it
be to stop everything they can do?  
COACH GIORGIS: It will be extremely hard. Again, you've got to take something
away and hope something else isn't working. We might try, you know, in certain
possessions to try to hold down Chaney and those types of people, and other
times we will try to limit what Sylvia can do inside. That's why they're good.
We'll have a few different things up our sleeves and try to do the best that
we can with them.  
The one thing I like about our kids is when things don't work, they don't
necessarily panic. Like with yesterday, with DePaul, the two guards just shot
lights out. Then all of the sudden in the last, you know, quarter of the game,
they went cold and we went on our run.  
We didn't make a lot of different changes from what we've been doing all game.
Just one slight adjustment and it seemed to help. We know that they can score
in a lot of different ways, and really to be quite honest with you, we're more
concerned with how are we going to score. They're the best defense in the
country right now, I think, scoring, defensewise.  
We've got to find ways to get good shots for us. Kind of like last year when
we were playing Tennessee and they were asking how are we going to stop
Candace Parker, we were like, how are we going to get shots for Julianne who
is going to be guarded by a 6-3 kid, that type of thing. We've got lots of
things to think about in the next 24 hours in terms of our game plan and what
we're going to try to do.  
  
Q. You've played big teams in the past couple of years but what is tomorrow
night going to present as far as being here in their own gym with a Rocky can
you say crowd, I can imagine?  
COACH GIORGIS: Well, that's going to be the one big difference. We usually --
although we have faced Maryland at Maryland, Duke at Duke, we just like the
challenge. Put it this way: There are not a lot of people out there that have
given us much of a chance. We've been in that situation before, and sometimes
we come through, sometimes we don't, but we don't care. We're just going to go
out and try to be -- try to pose as much trouble as we can and hope that it's
good enough.  
  
Q. Could you see any way at all that the emotions that would be involved on
LSU's side, with this being a senior class playing their last game here could
work as an advantage to you, as players looking from the outside in?  
Everyone would assume it's the obvious advantage with them, but could it be a
distraction?  
NIKKI FLORES: I think it will help us. We have a lot of senior leadership on
this team. Between Courtney, even though she'll be back next year, and me and
Meg, and then you have Alexis, who is still on the bench and basically leads
the bench with cheering, I mean, the senior leadership on our team is going to
help us.  
With our experience being here and everything, I can see what you're saying,
it can hurt us in a way, but I think it will work to our advantage.  
COACH GIORGIS: To be honest with you, I never thought about it until you
brought up the question. We've got a lot more issues with length and
athleticism than in terms of it's their last game at home. We know that we've
got a big challenge ahead of us. We like it that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, and student athletes. Best of luck.

### [Ashley Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18428)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have No. 12, RaShonta LeBlanc; No. 34, Sylvia Fowles; and
No. 54, Ashley Thomas. Now for the introduction, head coach Van Chancellor.
Coach?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We have a lot of players on this basketball team that get a
lot of publicity. Today I thought I would bring two players that have been the
difference in our team by accepting great roles and doing whatever is good for
the team. Ashley and Tai-Tai don't need the ball, and if you're gonna win,
that's what you got to have. Y'all know everything about our team. Let's open
it up for questions.  
  
Q. Ashley, kind of what Coach alluded to. You were always a post-season
killer. People don't expect you to have an offensive game. You get the ball
and knock down shots. Talk about your focus once the second season begins and
taking some teams by surprise.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: When it comes down to these last six games, either you win or
you go home. I want to continue playing until the last game and finish our
season on a win.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ASHLEY THOMAS: That's -- with, I guess, any team we played all season. They're
always focused on Sylvia, so whatever opportunities I get I take advantage of
them.  
  
Q. I know we had senior night a little while back, but tomorrow night will
be the last game in the PMAC for the Lady Tigers. Can you talk about the
emotions for tomorrow night.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's going to be a lot of emotion, after the game. During the
game or before the game, I don't think we'll think about it as much, but after
the game I'm sure there will be a lot of emotions.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: During the game you can't worry about that, because sometimes
you can let your emotions affect how you play. We'll just worry about that
when the game is over and as long as we come out with a win in our last game
at the PMAC that will be fine with me.  
RASHONTA LEBLANC: Like Ashley said, you can't worry about it when you're
playing, but after the game we'll deal with it then.  
  
Q. No one ever had to call your name to ask you to talk, did they, Van?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: No.  
  
Q. Ladies, talk about, is there a more quiet intensity on this team? There
is not a lot of talk or hoopla from the players but just the determination to
win and, I guess, take care of business, which is what you've been very adept
at doing in the NCAA tournament. If it's not a lot of emotion, what is it
between you guys that helps you succeed? The determination, business-like
attitude, what is it that helps you succeed in these situations?  
ASHLEY THOMAS: I think because we do have the same goal in mind and we are
determined we play off of each other. We don't have a lot of hoopin and
hollering, but we play off each other, and I think we have the same goal,
which makes us successful.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you've been through this before, but what was it that got
you off the golf course to get back into it? From watching them last year,
what changes did you want to make? I know specifically more outside
shooting.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Everybody thinks I came back to LSU because of the contract
and because I wanted to play for a national championship. Those were the two
great reasons, but I really got off the golf course because I felt like I had
in my life a lot of gas still left in the tank, and I wasn't ready to go out
and play golf every day, and I wanted to make a difference in people's lives.  
When you're coaching in high school and college, you have the opportunity to
influence kids' lives, and that's what I wanted to do. Then the biggest change
I wanted to make was let them enjoy the game. Sometimes -- the great news --
this team does not show, Scott, a lot of emotions, but that is what has made
them play consistent all year.  
I don't think we played but one bad game all year. And that's why we're so
consistent. We don't have a lot of ups and downs. But I came back into college
coaching because the best way to be young is to be around people that are
young, and this team has been a lot of fun to coach. They listen to ya, they
do what you want, and you tell 'em something to do, you're going to pretty
well get it done.  
  
Q. What about your impressions from watching them last year as a
commentator?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I did LSU's games in the SEC and then I did their games in
Austin, Texas in the first and second round, and it's pretty eerie at times.
Every time I played by my house out here, and I come back and see Tiger
Stadium, I say to myself, "Are you the LSU coach?" It's hard for me to believe
that I'm in purple and gold.  
Last year I was worrying about subjects and verbs on the air, and this year
I'm worrying about winning a game. I never dreamed this time last year that I
would be coaching a team. But when you move and take a coaching job -- this
team has gone far beyond any expectations I had for it, as far as enjoying it
and being a lot of fun.  
I want you to be aware Sylvia is 12 rebounds away from being the all-time
leading rebounder in the SEC history. Of all the great players I've been
associated with from my time at Ole Miss and doing TV, it's mind boggling she
is about to become -- I'm trying to motivate her for tomorrow night. I need
12, Biggon, I'll tell you that right now.  
  
Q. You've known Gary Blair for a long time. How good of a marriage is that
between him and Texas A &M?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think Blair was the perfect hire for A&M. They needed a
guy that wanted to build the program, work the program, wanted to work the
state of Texas. He coached high school basketball in Dallas, so in turn he had
a great connection, and I thought it was really good.  
Gary Blair leads the nation in coaching and making out the most NCAA brackets
in the history of coaching, by the way, if you don't know that. Before the
NCAA Committee makes their brackets out, they ought to call Blair. They could
save themselves a lot of time. He called me and told me I was No. 1, but that
just shows he doesn't know everything he thinks he knows about it. I'm just
kidding.  
  
Q. Ashley and Sylvia, talk about your defensive effort and going up against
Marist. They put up a nice run, did some nice things behind the arc. Talk
about your defense and stepping up and knowing that they were a 13 seed to
advance last year. Anything is possible.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: You can't overlook any team that you play in the tournament.
Guarding their post players, they can step away from the basket, but where our
post players, we're quick enough to guard those players that can step away, so
I think we'll be fine on our defensive end of the game.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I agree with Ashley. Their posts do step out, and they will
shoot three's and they will drive, and it will be a challenge, but I'm willing
to take it.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: They present a unique challenge for Sylvia. She'll have to
guard a post player on the perimeter, and that's something she is not used to
doing, but she's pretty quick, so we don't anticipate that being a major
problem. I think she presents problems for them, defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're aware that none of the young women sitting up there
with you have any idea what it's like to play a season without making it to
the Final Four, and this is their last year trying to make it four in a row,
and you're here in your first year, and I wonder what kind of dynamic that
adds or challenge that adds to you as a coach.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: People ask me all the time, is there a lot of pressure
trying to get this team back to the Final Four, and I've given all the answers
that are not necessarily the ones I was ready to. Here's the facts: I feel no
pressure for Van Chancellor. I feel a lot of pressure trying to help them --
being frank with you, I don't want to mess it up.  
I want them to have every opportunity. I study tape every day, because I want
these players to experience that. A lot of high's have already happened for me
in my life, but I also believe in this: I believe with all my heart that you
do the best you can when you play a game. You do the best you can as a coach
and as a player, and if you've done that, everything is fine.  
I would like to be in a position that we could play for a championship, so --
because I think we're pretty close right now, pretty close.  
  
Q. Tai-Tai, could you talk about Erica and how she's improved from last year
to this year? She seems to be more confident.  
ASHLEY THOMAS: Erica is more of a leader on the court. She runs the team well,
moves the ball well in transition, and she's clutch on her free-throws, and
she's developed her jump shot more this year. She shoots the ball better this
year than she did last year.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I want to make sure, since we have more of you here today
than we had the other day when I made this announcement: For everything you
hear about what's wrong with college athletics, I'm going to give you to my
right what's right about college athletics.  
Ashley Thomas has received a scholarship from the NCAA very few people get,
combining character, academics and basketball, to go to postgraduate work.
That doesn't make headlines, but that's what I'm proud of. What I'm proud of
is these players right here are ready to graduate. Some of them on our team
have already graduated.  
Some of them are going to graduate with a 2.8, 2.9 and 3.0, which is pretty
good. They might be smarter than their coach, but some might say that ain't
very smart, but that don't bother me. (Chuckles.)  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I'm smarter than you Biggon, so don't get carried away over
there. Thank you for covering this tournament. We've enjoyed it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our three substitute athletes are A'Quo Franklin, Morenike
Atunrase, and Patrice Reado, and we will have the Coach for opening comment
and then questions. Coach Gary Blair, who says he loves making the trips to
the stable.  
COACH BLAIR: Did you all go to Easter Egg hunt today? I did. That was fun.
Nothing to do but when you have a four year old grandson -- and they had to
drive back this morning, and my wife had to fly back, because they've got to
work tomorrow, but we had an Easter Egg hunt, and that was good. When you do
it with your four year old grandson, it's even more special.  
We're excited to still be sitting up here. It's beautiful weather. We've been
treated great, the administration here at LSU has ran a great tournament. The
NCAA reps have done good things for us, I hope they have for you. I would like
to comment -- I haven't seen all the other papers, but I would like to commend
the Baton Rouge paper.  
This morning it was nice to pick up the paper and see so much coverage on
women's basketball. And for you out-of-towners, they do that all the time.  
Okay? It's not just in this tournament, but they do a very good job of
coverage and so does the New Orleans' paper as well, but it's good to see that
coverage, and it's been going on down here for years.  
Jennifer Rizzotti. I had the opportunity to coach her on the Jones' Cup team,
along with Michelle Marciniak; those were our point guards, and Carol Walters,
one of our post players, Natalie Williams, Nakisha Sales, Sheri Sam, Pee Wee
Johnson, Katie Smith, Tina Thompson. It was the best team that didn't go to
the Olympics they ever put together, because every kid on that team has gone
on to be a WNBA All-Star.  
It was a pleasure to coach Jennifer Rizzotti because of the fire. You knew
right then she was going to be a great coach. It was just a matter of time
until she got all that playing time in the WNBA out of her, got a little bit
of Geno out of her and a lot of Geno in her, and she's brought it all to this
next level.  
And she's similar to who I coach against in my league when I have to go
against Kim Mulkey. It's good to see explayers get back into this game and
take these programs, the mid-level programs, to the high level, because the
mid-level programs can win at the highest level.  
You do not have to be a BCS school to get to the Sweet 16, as Marist showed us
last year and George Mason showed you in the men's game. It's good to see
everybody get an opportunity. We're going to have a lot of opportunities
tomorrow. We're going to see defenses that we didn't see against San Antonio.
They played us 85 to 90% man-to-man, which we didn't expect, and we're going
to expect triangles, box-and-two, denial-and-one's and different defenses to
try and slow us down.  
We will be playing our same man-to-man defense. That's what we do best. It's
not time to change. It's not time to change for Coach Rizzotti if she's held 7
of her last 10 opponents to 46 points or better on the defensive side. She's
doing something very well. Go with what brung you to the dance, because it's
working! I think we're going to have one of the best second round games
around. Open it up for questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Ladies, could you breakdown the match-ups, how you see it, what needs to
be done outside. A'Quo and Patrice could you talk about what needs to be down
outside against Hartford?  
STUDENT ATHLETE: As far as the match-ups, preparing for the Big 10 is just
like preparing for the Big 12, like Iowa State. We're going to match-up
perfect with them, pressure up on our defense, and on offense we're going to
dissect and attack the zone.  
STUDENT ATHLETE: I think on the defensive end we need to play like we have
always been playing, and on the offensive end we need to rebound and get the
put-backs.  
THE MODERATOR: Morenike?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: They said it all.  
  
Q. Coach Blair talked about a different approach this year, no Time Square,
no Disneyland, no sightseeing, more of the business-like atmosphere. Could you
talk about the approach you guys are taking?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I believe it's the same approach, we go out and sightsee
a little bit, but as far as us, we know what to expect. We've been here two
years straight, and we know what to expect. We're not just happy to be here,
but we're here for business.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Just to reiterate what A'Quo was saying, we haven't been
sightseeing as much as we have. Coach Blair likes to travel, and we've been
everywhere so far, but it's all business. We're here to win games, and that's
what's first.  
PATRICE READO: I agree with both of them.  
COACH BLAIR: These are my three senior starters, really, because we call her a
starter, still. They've been to Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Europe, they've
been to Disneyland, the state of Washington, they've been to New York City,
ESPN Zone, everyplace in the Big 12, which is not Disneyland, and it's been a
great ride!  
This is what college is doing for ya. Travel is an education, and I believe in
taking kids places that will help us in recruiting, but help us in the
competition factor, and we will play anybody, anytime. I think that's what you
need to do. But when you can get them on neutral floors and have a chance to
play teams, like in the Virgin Islands or in Hawaii or something, you take
advantage of that. We don't stay in the hotel rooms and just watch game tape
all day. We get out and we have a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Sort of along that line, when you signed with A &M they were coming off
an 8-straight losing season under their coach. What made you believe you could
turn this around, especially for the two of you from Texas?   
What was the vision of A&M in those days as compared to Texas or Texas Tech or
Baylor?  
PATRICE READO: When I was in high school, I excluded all of the Texas schools,
but for some reason when Coach Blair called me, right after they moved from
Arkansas to Texas A&M, I knew people that went to Texas A&M, and that kind of
gave me a hint that I could go there. And when I made my visit, I fell in love
with the coaches and the athletes that were there.  
And the schools that were recruiting me, they were the top teams, so I wanted
to go to a top team that needed more good people, like A'Quo and Morenike, to
bring the program up.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Same for me. I didn't want to go a program that had a
name for itself. I would rather be in a program that was on the rise, so I
chose Texas A&M.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I would say I didn't think I would end up in Texas, but I'm
glad I'm there now. I wouldn't go anywhere else. As far as me coming, I played
against A'Quo for all my years in high school. We played against their high
school, and I knew her, but we weren't talking, but I was playing against her.  
And once they told me who all they were recruiting, I said, I think they have
great athletes, and I think I have something I can bring to the program and
turn things around, and Coach Blair had successful years where he was at prior
to coming to Texas A&M, so I knew what type of coach he was and what type of
coaching staff he had. I didn't want to leave Louisiana, because I wanted to
stay close to home.  
  
Q. What schools were recruiting you?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: You were asking what schools? Tulane, LA Tech,
Southeastern; it was mostly the Louisiana schools.  
  
Q. For Coach and Morenike, this could be addressed to the both of you. I
know Morenike has overcome injuries and IS a senior, and you've had to battle
adversity, and, Coach, I saw in a story that you were quoted a couple of
months ago that you said people better learn how to pronounce her name,
because she's come to battle with avengence, so I'm curious, if Morenike --
maybe what she brings and what she has brought since her latest come-back.  
COACH BLAIR: First, you have the best voice among these guys because. You're
in radio; together, me and you, Morenike, Morenike, Morenike. If I had your
voice, I would be doing a radio show, too, but I've got a Monday tone voice. I
want your voice, but once you know it, it's Morenike, and it flows like she
does out there on the court, okay?  
  
Q. Got it.  
COACH BLAIR: All right. And hopefully we can keep playing, and everybody is
going to realize it's not Morenike anymore, because we're with Adidas now,
thank you.  
Now, what was the question?  
  
Q. Battling adversity, injuries, that kind of thing and what she kind of --
her role with the team now.  
COACH BLAIR: Basically the role of the team -- she's a senior leader. She will
do whatever we ask of her. You notice in that ballgame yesterday, I think she
was in the game 5 seconds and all of the sudden drilled a 3 from the corner.
She did it today in practice, the same time. She rotates in, all of the sudden
the shot is up, and she's got that flow about her. She's instant offense.
Sometimes your best players shouldn't be the ones that are starting all the
time, particularly when you have a team as balanced as we have.  
Because you've got to learn to accept roles. It's nice to know if somebody
gets two quick fouls, you can bring in an All-Big 12 performer or All-SEC or
All-Big East performer off the bench. The last team that could do that, I
believe, was Kathy Poindexter, and we've been able to do that. Danielle Gant
did it her first two years. That's because of the strength we have of those
top-six players that we have, and we've got some good ones behind them.  
So her role is to come in and fix what's broken, and she can play the 2
position, because Takia is in, two fouls, Gant goes to the 3, and she stays at
the four. If Gant is coming out, Reado comes out, Gant goes to the 4, and
Reado -- I told her when she came out of the ballgame, I said, "3 minutes go
in and get Micheaux," so when she went to the bench four minutes into the
game, she said, what did I do wrong, probably, in her head, but now I told her
in 3 minutes go in and get Micheaux.  
But now it's a positive spin, it's not a negative coming out of the game. It's
trying to balance six talented kids and get the most out of them.  
  
Q. Coach, you're selling basketball. Can you talk about how important
tomorrow night's game is for your program?  
COACH BLAIR: I'm selling basketball all over the country, Robert, not just in
Aggieland, because we're still in the growth stages all over the country. Our
men got eliminated last night in a tremendous basketball game, similar to two
years ago when LSU beat our men in the last-second shot.  
But it's time to quit playing close and be satisfied. It's time to have that
little bit of a hunger. These kids are never going to get another chance.
These kids have got to sit there -- yeah, they've earned another Big-12
Championship rank, but to keep playing, you've got to have passion for the
game, you've got to know a little bit of the history of the game and
appreciate the history, and then you've got to have some hunger to get to that
next level. And the eight teams that are seeded in the top two -- we're
expected to get to regionals. We're expected to get there.  
I looked at the stats this morning in one paper. I think a 10 seed has won
three times. They're 3 and whatever -- I want to make sure that doesn't
happen. But to do that, give your opponent respect. Because I know what it's
like being a nine seed, because we were the lowest-seeded team at Arkansas
that ever got to the Final Four in '98; we were a nine seed.  
I want to make sure that Coach Rizzotti is going to have her team ready to
play. The best thing about it is Rizzotti can't play, okay? Because if I had
to play her one-on-one, she would kill me. We're going to have our team ready.
It would mean so much for our area back there. We're in the business of
selling season tickets. Yes, I've been disappointed, but we still have a 33%
growth in season ticket sales. We're 8th in the league in attendance, okay?  
That doesn't satisfy me, not if you're Big 12 Champions. I want to go on to
that next level. We'll keep working. If I weren't a basketball coach, I could
be a damn good marketing director, because that's where you have to do it in
certain parts of the country.  
And, Robert, you have no idea how low basketball was in the state of
Connecticut before those teams that went to New Orleans in '92 and '93.
Basketball wasn't worth a flip, men or women, and look at what they're doing
at Connecticut now. Could it happen at Texas A&M? It's happening at Hartford
right now, and it's happening at a lot of other places. It can happen at Texas
A&M, and it's my job and these three girls up here to make sure it does
happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions?  
  
Q. Gary, along that line, Big 12 is No. 1 in RPI this year. Has it surpassed
the SEC in the best conference, and if so what makes it -- it's taken 5 years
to move up and get competitive. How do you see it?  
COACH BLAIR: There are a lot of great conferences out there, particularly the
SEC and the ACC and the Big 12. What makes our conference so good is there is
not a bottom. You've got Missouri on the bottom right now, because they're the
youngest team in the league, and they graduated everybody in two years. What
makes the league's strength is the continuity among the coaches within the
conference.  
In the late '90s the SEC by far was the best conference, because look at who
the head coaches were, and they were not going anywhere. Well, there has been
a whole lot of change since Moody left Alabama, Champie retired, Foster to
Ohio State, Sue passed away, Carol Ross is out of basketball, I left Arkansas
and somebody else is gone, too. Van. Okay?  
Well, you cannot just replace those players. It takes a while to get it there.
We're doing it because we have balance. Perhaps in the Big 12 we do not have
the great, great team, but we've got a lot of teams that can play great on a
certain night. Those teams can win national championships. That's what we have
right now. When we got 8 teams in there, when you look at Iowa State and Texas
at 7-9, they deserve to be in that NCAA tournament.  
And the SEC will get back once their coaches stay put for a few years and you
don't change 'em out as much as they're changing them out right now. The ACC
has gotten better and better, the Big East has gotten strong at the top and in
the middle, but they're pretty weak at the bottom. When you have 16 teams,
there has to be a bottom.  
So I love my league, but I love the SEC as well. But right now I think we have
the best balance. I'm not going to say we're the best conference, but I'm
definitely going to say we have the best balance and the most commitment from
administration of the 12 schools.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any closing comments?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I've already talked too long. I'm going to go back and watch
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, we'll see you all tomorrow.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: First of all, I want to give a line to Hartford. I thought
they played really well. They are a very strong team. There were a lot of
plays down the stretch and they are very physical, like I thought they would
be. And we got to give them a lot of credit because they really hung in there
and continued to fight and continued to play throughout the game and made some
plays down the stretch. They made a few more. It was a great game.  
First of all, we enjoyed the game. Coaching for me is fun. I do it because it
is fun. If I can't have fun, I can't get up in the morning. So for me it is
fun. Just the love I have for my team and my kids, how hard they compete, what
they bring to the table every day is just remarkable. It was one of those
things where when you look at Hartford on tape, you get ready to play them,
they keep coming at you and bringing that type of intensity. It is like
playing one of our teams in our conference.  
It was a great basketball game. It was fun to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Take us through the remaining minutes of the game, the emotions you were
feeling. Fantasia hits the big shot, and they come down and get the 3 from
Schaefer, the ups and downs of that.  
ERICA MORROW: I mean, it is really an up-and-down game. They made their plays;
we made our plays. Like Coach said, they made more than us. We got to be able
to stop them, and Schaefer comes out and hits a 3. You were thinking about
defense and now you got to turn it to offense. The emotions were up and down.
She is a great player and she made a great play down the stretch.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: (Indiscernible). It was a big shot. (Indiscernible). I
thought we played a great game. (Indiscernible).  
  
Q. (Question regarding game plan and shots not falling.)  
ERICA MORROW: We got the shots. They just weren't falling. They play great
defense and our shots just weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Fantasia, I guess the toughest thing about a loss like this is going from
complete anticipation to realizing that your career is done as a senior. How
are you feeling right now?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I had so much fun playing. I love all my teammates. I am
trying not to cry right now. It is my last game. I'm done. It's over.
(Indiscernible).  
  
Q. Both of you made all your free throws and you hung in the game despite
the spots weren't falling. Take us through your mind in a tournament game like
this and making all the big free throws.  
ERICA MORROW: Free throws are part of the game. That's what we needed to, I
guess, stay in the game, then that's what (indiscernible). It is just -- I
guess our minds were thinking how do we just stay in the game. As long as we
stay -- you know, when we were down two points or whatever it was, we still
had a chance. I think it is part of us being mentally tough and coming down
the stretch.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: (Indiscernible).  
  
Q. Fantasia, you said the emotions are with you right now. Can both student
athletes take a step back and appreciate what this program did this year, no
matter what happened today? You guys just had the most successful season in
school history.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I am blessed to be a part of this program. The coaching
staff, the University has been great with everything we've been through.
(Comment about offseason).  
My career has been awesome. I love (indiscernible).  
ERICA MORROW: I am proud to be a part of this team. A lot of people didn't
believe we would be here, even do half the things we did this year. I think we
came out and showed we are a great team and we are a great program. The
coaching staff and the players, everybody was great. This experience, we take
back the bad and learn from it and get better and get ready for next season.
Try to get back. We will be back next year.  
  
Q. How much was today resourceful? You were shooting 30% and still in the
game at the end of the game. Can you talk about shooting the ball from the
floor.  
ERICA MORROW: We're just not a shooting team. We have different players who do
different things. We have people who can shoot, go to the basket. I think it
is important that we played at the rim today. We showed them at the basket. It
was the NCAA tournament. No scholarships here. All teams are a great team. It
is the last 64 out of 300 and something. So I just think coming down the
stretch, you know, we tried to do what each individual player did nice and add
to our game.  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the student athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, I think -- I'm guessing if someone had covered you before the game
and said you would make 21 out of 41 free throws and out-rebound them by 14, I
suspect you would say I'm all in on that.  
COACH HILLSMAN: No question. What we try to do, we try to remain aggressive
and play at the rim. A lot of steps that you did did not (indiscernible).  
(Indiscernible). We tried to attack the rim and be aggressive. That's our
game, just trying to stay close to the basket. Trying to stay at the rim and
take the ball, that's what we do night in and night out, get to the basket.
That's part of our system, let our athletes get to the basket, Erica, Tasha
(indiscernible).  
  
Q. Coach, the end of the game situation where you guys were down, trying to
get the ball in the hole, just talk about that play that you were trying to
set up and did you think about calling a time-out to try and set a play up? Or
were you going in the goal there?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We practice this situation every day in practice. We don't
call time-outs in those situations. (Indiscernible) when the ball goes no
matter what the situation is. I am really nervous when we got the ball
inbounds. Why take a time-out? We practice these situations every day
(indiscernible). Get the ball out of the free-throw situation with 7 seconds
(indiscernible). They did a great job with Erica. They did a great job of
getting out (indiscernible). Nicole popped out and got the catch. We were in
good shape. We put time on the clock and run 7, 8, 9 sets straight through
with the same look. So I'm real comfortable not calling time-outs in a
situation.  
  
Q. What was the explanation for the technical foul?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Explanation was that I was too animated. Watching the tape, it
is very animated. What do you say to that? Somebody gives you a technical in
the coach's box, it is what it is. She did the best job she could.  
Even after that, with the type of game, you can't lose like that. The
basketball gods, they are going to do that to you, so I'm not going to worry
about it.  
  
Q. After the season ending like this, what do you tell your girls in the
locker room after this?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I tell them to make sure we will be back here. I told them we
will be back here and to be strong. (Indiscernible). That's pretty much what I
told them.  
  
Q. Coach Q, your freshmen came up big and made plays at the end of the game,
Tasha with the shot, Erica with the free throws. How proud are you with them
under that kind of pressure to make the plays they did, despite losing?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Very proud. We got a lot of building with this team. We have
to practice situations. We did what we had to do to get here. (Indiscernible)
be able to do that, you have to impact players who are unafraid. To be in
conference -- in the Big East conference, recruiting is so important.
(Indiscernible).  
You got to continue to get young kids that can compete at this level and
definitely have a future.  
  
Q. Coach, can you reflect on the seniors now that you have to say good-bye
to them? I think they have played together for ten years or something.  
COACH HILLSMAN: It is unbelievable. (Indiscernible) so obviously.  
She grew up into a fine young lady and turned into a great kid. Talking about
Fantasia, I'm sure, especially local media, you understand -- you know what
she's been through. To sit here night in and night out and face you guys
(indiscernible). She embraces opportunity. What can you say about her? You
think about the choice you have (indiscernible). To come back and be able to
compete at this level and to be aggressive. (Indiscernible).  
Hopefully you can continue to play, compete at this level.  
  
Q. You won a rebound and battled. How frustrating was it?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Frustrating that that wasn't the game plan. We got in foul
trouble. (Indiscernible).  
And, you know, down the stretch, the last play we were talking about taking
that shot. Are they going to have the guts and the courage to take that shot?
That was a tough shot to make. You miss it, you go home. You make it, you got
a chance to advance. Making a big shot down the stretch, that's in the
tournaments and that's what it's all about.  
She made a good adjustment and (indiscernible). She makes (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Take us through your emotions, knowing how close it came to you beating
them.  
COACH HILLSMAN: (Indiscernible) we have been in that situation before. Erica
made those shots in that situation. So we got to get the ball in her hand.  
This has been a really good experience and we've enjoyed being here. And I
have to give credit to Hartford. They are a tough team and playing and being
aggressive. I thought my kids really competed at this level of the situation
and this experience, to give us this opportunity. We would like to make it
next year.

### [Rae Rippetoe-Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18360)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student athletes, Monica Gibbs and Amanda Foster, and head
coach, Coach Rae Rippetoe-Blair.  
Opening comments, Coach?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Thank you. Give Texas A&M a lot of credit. I thought our
team was very prepared. We just couldn't handle the pressure.  
Going into the game, the one thing that we talked about as a team, we got to
handle the ball, and we had, I think, 30-something turnovers. You can't have
30 turnovers. I thought the rebounding -- and that's another area that we had
talked about the first half. Second half, we just -- we just did not do a good
job on the boards. I thought our kids played hard. I thought they worked hard.
I didn't think they gave up. They played until the end. Texas A&M is just
good.  
  
Q. Ladies, just talk about that pressure. What makes it so difficult? I know
you faced tough teams in nonconference, in power conferences. Talk about what
makes A &M different, their guarding you, either their man-to-man or their
back-court pressure.   
AMANDA FOSTER: I would say whenever -- they would kind of let you penetrate,
get in the lane, kind of bate you a little bit and then be out in the passing
lanes. We didn't step to the ball very well. Our passes weren't as sharp.
Since we were moving at a faster pace, it made it a little bit difficult to
pass the ball and see the floor as well. Lanes that are usually open weren't
as open, things like that.  
  
Q. Monica, maybe you could tell me, I noticed the first couple times down
the court and you and Micheaux were exchanging elbows a little bit. How much
more physical was this than what you usually encounter in the Southland
Conference? And did that make it tougher for y'all? Their defense, how tough
was it to operate against it?  
MONICA GIBBS: Well, in the Southland Conference, it is not as rough as we
probably played today. We had a lot more calls called on us if we actually
play in the Southland like that. Today was a big change.  
But I tried to use -- I am a fifth-year senior and I tried to use my
experience of playing that long and go with it and play as tough as them. If
they do so something, do it right back, like don't back down as a player. But
know your limit and don't hurt anybody in it. But just stand your ground,
basically.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student athletes? Thank you,
ladies. You may retire. Does anyone have any questions for Coach?  
  
Q. If you would, just assess your post-season as a good run to get here and
then just overall for the season.  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: It was a great run. Our last three games, we really
played well. To be honest with you, in our last three games, everybody has
sagged in their man defense, has not guarded Monica or not guarded Whitney. So
in most of the year, that's happened just because they have such a knack to
get to the basket. We probably have not played -- in fact, we have not played
as talented as a team or top ten team like Texas A&M.  
I knew the physicalness of it we would struggle a little bit with. And it is
just hard to simulate what they do in practice. We talked about it. We worked
on it. I thought we were very nervous, I'll be honest with you. I thought we
were very nervous coming out and we knew in those first five minutes things
can get away from you, and that's what happened. You try to tell your kids
that. They have never been here before. We've got a young team.  
I hope this experience -- it has been a great experience. Definitely not --
losing is not great, but it has been a great experience being here. Hopefully
we've told our young kids they will remember this, they will carry it over. No
matter who you are playing, you got to be ready. You got to handle the
pressure, and we just did not handle that pressure.  
Honestly, I'm little surprised. I knew they were that good, but I thought we
would handle the pressure a little bit better, the ball pressure.  
  
Q. From a coaching standpoint, how difficult a matchup is Gant out there
from the defensive end?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: She's tough. I mean, she can dribble. She is not going
to shoot the 3. We gave her a little space, and she was knocking down every
shot. We didn't do a very good job of guarding her, I'll be honest with you.
We got to block her out. She is just so talented. I thought she played an
excellent game today. I thought she was an excellent player. I think she is
one of their best players, and I am talking about all-around. She can guard on
the defensive end. She can get to the basket, the short jumper. She is just
very tough. It was definitely a very tough matchup for us.

ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

### [Rachele Fitz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18376)

### [Brian Giorgis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18375)

### [Julianne Viani](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18423)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations, and your opening statement, please.  
COACH GIORGIS: Just a tremendous comeback by the kids. I can't say enough
about these two people here, being down 13 didn't look very good, but
obviously Julianne shot us back into it, and Rachele just kept doing her thing
that made her a MAC player of the year.  
The third component that really helped was really our bench. I think when
Elisa Caron and Sarah Smrdel and Lynzee Johnson went into the game, they gave
positive things, and a team that shoots the ball as well as DePaul does, to be
able to hold them without a field goal for about the last nine minutes, you
know, it's really a credit to the kids' defense.  
We had trouble in the first half rebounding, but I think we outrebounded them
in the second half. We just persevered.  
It's hard to express two years in a row now of being able to come in and beat
a BCS school, a little school like Marist. It's tremendous, and we're just
looking forward to Monday.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Hitting all those three-pointers in a row in the second half, how were
you feeling when you stepped beyond the arc?  
JULIANNE VIANI: I was feeling pretty confident. I missed a couple in the first
half, but I had to remember that my team needs me to step up. I was getting
open looks so I was just going with the flow and taking them.  
  
Q. There was one sequence in there where as Coach said, you've been
outrebounded so bad in the first half, and I think the ball was tipped around
three or four times and then tipped out of bounds to you and then got a three-
pointer on inbounds. Did that seem to be a turning point?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Absolutely. At halftime, Coach really told us we needed to
step up and rebound, so it was good. I think we stepped up our aggressiveness
in the second half, going after balls, not worrying so much. That was a big
turning point for the second half, I really believe that it helped us get
going.  
  
Q. Particularly early there in the second half as they were growing their
lead did you ever lose faith at all and think this isn't our night?  
JULIANNE VIANI: I didn't because before the game I had this supernatural faith
that we were going to win. It was God. I have to credit him, but I really
believed we were going to win the game. Before the game started I actually
prayed to him for the victory, so I thought that was cool.  
  
Q. So God was against another Catholic school?  
JULIANNE VIANI: He wasn't against them (laughing).  
  
Q. Rachele, did y'all have any idea you guys outscored them 32 to 2 over the
last 12 minutes? Could you talk about the frustration you could see on them?
Did you have any idea what kind of a roll you were on?  
RACHELE FITZ: As soon as Julianne started hitting shots and we got open looks
inside, we knew we were on a roll. I think they were getting really down on
themselves, and we got up by 9 and then 11 and 13, just kept going. I think
they were getting frustrated and they weren't focusing as much perhaps. But
it's really frustrating when that happens.  
  
Q. Rachele, can you contrast the first half to the second half both the
inside battle and the rebound points?  
RACHELE FITZ: It was a battle the whole time. They're extremely strong and
aggressive post players, and we knew that coming in. But like Julianne said,
and Coach commented in the locker room at halftime that we really do need to
step up our game and stop worrying about fouls and just go hard to offensive
and defensive boards, and I feel that we really stepped up the second half,
everyone, rebounding, the guards, boxing out, post boxing out and getting more
rebounds and getting the ball out, and I think that helped a lot. Then we
matched their aggressive and physicalness.  
  
Q. For either of the players, just having last year's experience behind you,
did that do anything to maybe calm your nerves as they increased their lead?  
JULIANNE VIANI: Absolutely, yeah. I think that gave us a lot of confidence
that we've been there before and we can do it again, so I really do believe
that did help us a lot coming into the game. I mean, we didn't have pressure,
either way, but it helped. It helped boost our confidence.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse these young ladies and thank them very much.
Questions for Coach Brian Giorgis?  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Julianne. Did you ever lose faith? Did you ever think,
well, maybe this isn't our night? Maybe this isn't our year?  
COACH GIORGIS: No, because there was enough time left. Actually the whole
thing that we tried to do was to convince the kids that we don't have any
12-point plays in our play book, and don't try to get it all back at once. So
basically we just -- when we got down 13, we basically just tried to break the
game down in pieces and say, guys, by the next media time-out let's get it in
single digits, by the next one after that let's try to get it to five or less,
and it seemed to work, although Julianne got hers in bunches. We ran a couple
plays for her to see if we could get her a look, and we were successful with
that. So then we ran a different play for her to get a look, and that worked.
She brought us back in the game, and that combined with finding Rachele inside
and really putting the clamps down defensively, I think we got them to play
the way that we were where they tried to rush everything back once we made the
run because they seemed to come off beyond the ball screens a little bit
faster, a little bit out of control or not under control in shots that we were
making earlier that didn't make.  
The thing that we were fortunate with is we didn't give up the second and
third opportunities. I think at halftime they had seven second-chance points
to our zero, and it ended up 9-9. We did a much better job, again, being a
little bit more aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. You've been with Julianne a long time --  
COACH GIORGIS: I've known her since about the fourth grade. Her dad is my
dentist and has been for a long time, so yeah, I've known the Vianis. I've
coached three of them, so you could say that.  
  
Q. Is it what you expect out of her?  
COACH GIORGIS: There is no greater person I know of as a person of faith than
that girl there. She never loses confidence in herself, and she just believes
and she believes it's going to be willed. I'm not going to argue with her.  
  
Q. How long do you want them to appreciate this and enjoy this? And then
when do you start practicing --  
COACH GIORGIS: No different than last year. We're going to enjoy this tonight.
We're going to go to church tomorrow and celebrate Easter, and then we'll get
going after either LSU or Jackson State tomorrow afternoon. I'm sure we've
already done a little bit of work beforehand just in case, and again, BCS
wins, they've been happening more frequent, but this is another big, huge,
important moment in our school's history, and we're going to enjoy it. We've
always enjoyed these things.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the possibility of facing the No. 2 LSU on
their home court tomorrow?  
COACH GIORGIS: Yeah, that's -- they're a tremendous team, but that's what you
wanted to do. When you see the brackets come out, you knew DePaul is just a
heck of a team. And to be honest with you, we didn't really think of LSU. We
didn't talk about LSU because our focus was on DePaul, and tomorrow our focus
will be on LSU, assuming they get there, and obviously they're one of the top
-- they're one of the seven or eight teams that people talk about that can win
a national championship, and they're playing on their court.  
What the heck, we'll go after it just like we do everything, and we'll have a
lot of fun doing it. And if they beat us we'll tip our hats to them and we'll
go home and say it's a tremendous season. If we're fortunate enough to play,
have the type of comeback and shoot the ball like we did in the second half
and pull out another miracle, it's not Palo Alto, but we're game for it. We go
about things. No one expects the little 4,000 school to do much, and we'll
just go after them. We've played Tennessee, Duke, Maryland, Ohio State, we've
played a lot of the big schools, and yeah, we've lost to them, too, but we'll
go after them the way we try to go after everybody.  
Our little theme in the locker room has been the midge. We've got a lot of
people from Cleveland including myself, and the midge is that little bug that
landed on Joba Chamberlain during the Yankees' run. That's what we want to be.
We want to be midges. That doesn't mean we're going to win things, but we want
to be pests. That's the way we've gone about the NCAA Tournament last year,
this year. We just want to be pests. We aren't the most athletic team out
there. As you could see today we aren't the most physical team, we just want
to be pests. If it's good enough to win, great. If it's not, we've had a heck
of a year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Giorgis, thanks very much. We'll see you at tomorrow
afternoon's press conference.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [LaSharee Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18393)

### [Denise Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18389)

### [Erica Trahan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18392)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, first of all, I'd like to congratulate LSU and Coach
Chancellor for winning the game today. We played a great basketball team, and
I thought for our team, our young ladies, we had a game plan but we didn't
execute our game plan, so I have to give LSU credit. They talked about their
sticky defense and that's what they did tonight. They disrupted our offense
and didn't allow us to execute our offense.  
But I'm so proud of these young ladies that they competed till the end.  
  
Q. LaSharee, could you sum up the season a little bit?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: We had a great season. I mean, we had our highs, we had
our lows. We made -- we won our conference championship tournament, which was
one of our main goals from the getgo. We competed all season and never gave
up, kept our heads high. And again, this was a good experience. So as far as
our season went, I think it went great. We stuck together as a team, we grew
together and made friendships. That's all you can ask for, isn't it?  
  
Q. Erica, could you talk a little bit about trying to get things going
inside offensively?  
ERICA TRAHAN: Yes. All I know is my shot wasn't falling. I was rushing it
instead of reversing the ball, and I was trying to get going but I couldn't.
LaSharee is a great player, and her presence made me adjust my shot, but I
just never could get the shot to fall. But once again, you have these nights
that your shot don't fall, and you have to go to something else that can help
the team out. And that's what I tried to do.  
  
Q. You talk about your team having a game plan when you came into the game
tonight. How did you want to attack LSU defensively and stop them defensively
and how did you want to attack them offensively?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: Defensively we were just trying to limit the touches.
They're a great basketball team. You're not going to stop them altogether, but
we were just trying to limit some of the touches to some of the leading
scorers. We figured if we did that we could stay in this game, so that was one
of the game plans.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. You ladies are excused. We appreciate your
participation in the post-game press conference. Coach, it's your turn now.
Any questions for Coach Taylor from the media?  
  
Q. If you could address the same thing about the offense, about the game
plan.  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, that game plan was to sag in and try to limit Sylvia's
touches and also Chaney's, the two main scorers, so we played a match-up and
tried to sag in and double-down on her and limit her touches.  
Offensively we wanted to spread the floor, and whoever she was guarding, try
to pull her out, so we ran a four-up set, but their defense kind of disrupted
us at the point of opposition, so we were just kind of out of synch
offensively. But that was the strategy, to limit her touches and of course to
contain Chaney.  
  
Q. At some point Jackson State is going to win an NCAA Tournament game. How
hard is it to break through? It's a great challenge. If you go back through
the tournament book and look at the match-ups, they're tough draws. How hard
is it to, I guess, break through and to get the respect to break through and
maybe get a little bit better draw?  
COACH TAYLOR: Well, great players make great programs, so it starts there.
You've got to keep recruiting and get one or two great players that can really
change your season. I agree with you that it's going to happen. If you look on
the men's side, they're closing that gap, and I'm hoping one day that it
happens on the women's side.  
But it is a challenge, and we also talked with the girls about believing and
coming out. It's a 40-minute game, and on any given night anybody can win. But
I think you just have to keep working and of course winners make programs, so
you've got to keep recruiting and hope that the administration keeps giving
you more resources in order to go out and get those players.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. You had a wonderful season. Best wishes to
you and your student athletes next year.

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought it was a good game except we just got
characteristically turning the ball over more than we've turned the ball over
all year. For some reason we turned the ball over -- if I was going to give a
game ball out tonight I would have given it out to Mesha Williams. I thought
she was pretty good. 14 points, 7 rebounds and played extremely well, and we
are pleased with tonight's win.  
  
Q. For Sylvia, this was one of the lowest scoring games in NCAA history by
any team. Talk about the pride you guys take in playing defense, and did you
do anything special? Looked like the typical way you guys played defense. Was
there anything different?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't think it's anything that was different about it
tonight. I think Erica got us through because our defense style were her, and
once we seen her get things going, she makes it much easier for everybody else
to play defense.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Sylvia, just basic defense, Erica gets us started
on defense and just came out and played good defense.  
  
Q. Sylvia, could you talk about Mesha tonight and just having her in there
with you? What kind of game does that open up for you?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Mesha, the name speaks for itself. She's aggressive, she's
going to get you points. She's going to rebound the ball and she's going to
play great defense. That's something we see every day. Mesha has to guard me
every day. She makes me better, I make her better. But just to have her on the
floor at the same time, she makes things quite easy for me when I'm in the
game. So thanks to Mesha.  
  
Q. Erica, you played such good defense. What are some of the keys? What do
you try to do especially starting the game to disrupt the other team's
offense?  
ERICA WHITE: Just try to get ahead on the ball and try to make sure that their
point guard doesn't get comfortable and that she's not able to run her team's
offense. Just try to get deflections. When my teammates see me doing that, I
think they get energy from it, so you just try to get a hand on the ball.  
  
Q. Sylvia, how do you put a game like this into context? Obviously the games
are going to get tougher down the road. You guys have a chance to make history
with a fifth straight Final Four, which is looking down the road, but how do
you put this into context?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: You just come out and you play to the best of your ability.
It's not about the opponent, who you're playing. You've just got to come out
and play the way LSU is capable of playing, and that's something we did in the
second half. The first half wasn't as good, but you've just got to put things
into perspective and think about the long run.  
  
Q. For the players, Coach Chancellor kind of touched on the fact that he
wasn't pleased with the turnovers for this game. What's y'all's take?
Obviously you dominated Jackson State, but what is y'all's take on how you
played tonight?  
ERICA WHITE: Looking at the stat sheet that my coach has, we turned the ball
over 22 times. I cannot believe we turned the ball over that much. I take a
lot of responsibility for that because as the point guard it starts with me.
My take on the game is just -- that's 22 possessions that we didn't get a
shot, and it's 22 opportunities that we didn't get to score, and it's
something that we definitely have to clean up, and that starts with me.  
But 22 turnovers, I'm shocked to see that on that paper.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Like she said, 22 turnovers, possessions that we could have
got a shot out of, and I had a few that I shouldn't have had. But we'll clean
it up tomorrow in practice and just get ready to play on Monday.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Me personally, I'm pretty sure we can clean it up. We have
time. I'm pretty sure coaches will do a great job in practice tomorrow
cleaning it up.  
THE MODERATOR: The student athletes are excused. Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Talk about Mesha, I guess. You had said earlier in the year you should
have played her more. Are you kind of gearing her up for this run here?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought that -- usually in the two weeks between the SEC
Tournament and the NCAAs, I always try to evaluate some things I think I would
have done different. So tonight I was determined to get her in earlier. She
had 14 points and seven rebounds, which I thought was unbelievable. She was
just inspiring.  
When I said it, I don't wish but two games I'd have played her more. We're
going to make sure she gets in the game because she can just rebound the ball.
I thought tonight we were pretty dominant rebounding. I thought our field goal
percentage was good. We just were really just very careless with the ball,
which is uncharacteristic of LSU. We only averaged 12 turnovers all year.  
We shot 50 percent, held them to 32 points. They shot 23.1 percent. That's
pretty good.  
  
Q. What do you see in Marist? I know you watched a little bit of the game
tonight. What do you think you can do to pose a problem for LSU?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Just how tough they are mentally. They were down 11 and I
thought they were in trouble. By the time I turned back around, they went from
down 11 to up about 10, and they did it just because they're so tough. They
don't ever give up. They play hard. Those two kids inside are tough. Their
guards are tough. This is just a tough team. This is a team that, if I'm not
mistaken, I think they beat Ohio State to go to the Sweet 16 last year. I
wasn't in college coaching but I think that's right, so you'd have to look
that up. This is a team that's won 32 games this year. I don't care who they
played, 32 games is still 32 games. They've got a nice team.  
They beat a good team in DePaul. I thought DePaul was the best 10th seed in
the country. They beat them pretty good.  
  
Q. How did the time affect you?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: The time didn't affect me at all because after practice
today I went home, and because I was feeling bad, I rested most of the day. I
would have been ready by the time I got here tonight.  
The New York Times guy was here, and I told him if Marist won the game that we
would play at 6:00. You know why? Because they're out there in New York and I
thought they wanted all them New York people to see that game at 7:00 Eastern.
I thought if DePaul won we'd play at 8:30. That's good. I'd like to play at
12:00 in the daytime. Waiting on the game drives you nuts.  
  
Q. You were talking about making changes in the offense when you came here,
but you didn't want to go much to the defense. Talk about what kind of defense
you found when you came here and what makes them play so well, that sort of
thing?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's the most amazing defensive basketball team I've ever
seen. We do everything fundamentally sound.  
When I say this, when I see a men's game, I say, man, if they would have had
Bob Starkey they would have won the game. There's so many things at LSU that
is so sound, I don't want to change anything. We cut cutters and we double the
ball and we do everything defensively sound without gambling a lot. That's why
we gave up 32 points tonight. We led the country in defense this year for
however many years in a row. We are really good defensive.  
Our rebounding has gotten better. I want to say this, I am amazed how good our
defense is when you consider our rebounding is one little bit above average.
It's not average, it's a little better than average, but it's not good. But
tonight it was.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Chancellor.

ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Allie Quigley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18383)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bruno, your opening statement, please.  
COACH BRUNO: DePaul won 70 percent of the basketball game, but it was the
wrong 70 percent, and Marist won 30 percent of the game, and it was the right
30 percent. The reason we got beat tonight was because Marist was tougher,
smarter and better. The second reason, the same basketball team that
outrebounded Marist 30 to 15 at halftime got outrebounded 20 to 14 in the
second half. Again, I just want to make sure that this Marist team, I think
the nation understands how good they are.  
Believe me, I believed how good they were before we played this game tonight.
If our basketball team is good enough to be able to be up 11 at the 11-minute
media timeout, then we should be good enough to finish the basketball game.
But the reason we didn't was because, again, at that timeout -- let's just ask
questions and I'll go there later. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Allie, seems like everything was going you guys' way. Do you have any
idea what kind of happened to flip the switch? And what was it like out there
for you?  
ALLIE QUIGLEY: Yeah, definitely the momentum changed. I think that we just
didn't guard them. We didn't get rebounds and they did a pretty good job of
everything basically, shooting. Viani went off, and defensive rebounding, and
once again, they were better off.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the students and thank them very much. Coach,
would you like to continue your discussion and then we'll ask whether there
are any questions from the group?  
COACH BRUNO: I mean, when you ask me to continue the discussion, the 11-minute
timeout, I remember it like it was a second ago, and we knew -- we stated to
our team that Coach is going to take over the game with No. 12, and No. 3,
Viani is going to take over the game on her own. These are issues that we had
thought we had prepared for, and that's exactly what happened at that moment.
Fitz and Viani took over the game, and we had no answers for them.  
Again, I'm very -- I'm very irritated about the lack of -- no, I'm so happy
for Marist. They're just a great group of young women.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. You had a great season, and best
wishes for next year.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us the head coach of the victorious Hartford Hawks
and three student athletes, Lisa Etienne, Erica Beverly, and MaryLynne
Schaefer. Coach Jennifer Rizzotti?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Obviously we're thrilled with the win today. Beating Syracuse
is no easy task. I think they are a phenomenal team. They've had a great
season, and they made us really work for this one. But I'm just pleased with
the way our kids toughed it out, overcame adversity. Nothing really came easy
for us tonight. Wouldn't say we shot the ball great, never really got our
post-game going, and we didn't get to the free-throw line a lot. But I thought
that we toughed it out.  
We relied on what we have been relying on all year, and that's our defense.
Our kids were phenomenal. I told them in the locker room we proved we're more
than just a one-man show and we're also more than just a post show because I
thought our guards were great on both ends of the floor today.  
  
Q. Erica, can you just talk about the rebounding inside and how difficult
that was for you to even get rebounds tonight.  
ERICA BEVERLY: It was very difficult. They're very strong. We knew that they
were going to be pushing and hustling to get those rebounds because they have
about three players who have, like, 100 rebounds for the year, which is a big
deal.  
I just toughed it out with my teammates, got some battle scars over here a
little bit. Tried to get the rebounds.  
  
Q. MaryLynne, just take us through that last possession when you hit the
shot and what was going through your head going into it.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: It was plays we have drawn up in practice a lot,
situations. And I was supposed to come off and see the post players. When I
came I felt like they were guarded, so I just didn't really think about it and
I shot it. I thought I had an open look and the thing went in, so ...
(laughter).  
  
Q. MaryLynne, the last time when you won a game, what was the last shot
like?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I don't think I ever have.  
  
Q. High school game or anything?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: No, Not in that situation with me getting the shot, I
don't recall.  
  
Q. You see big shots all the time in the NCAA tournament. Do you think this
is something -- it just happened, I know. Could this be something you think of
in the future?  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: I think when you are younger you think about it, a
potential game-winner shot. It is just a great feeling. And it comes down to a
team effort, like, just battling it out throughout, so ...  
  
Q. I guess, MaryLynne, to lose Danielle 6 minutes to go, you must have to,
the team, dig deep.  
MARYLYNNE SCHAEFER: Yeah, we did. It is another thing to -- yeah, we did. It
is one thing to overcome adversity when you have one of your top scorers going
to the bench, fouling out. We just knew we needed to come together. It is
something we've been able to do all season when something like that has
happened with one of our players. And it just shows the strength of our team,
that we're able to push through and win the game, so ...  
  
Q. Erica, you were talking about Syracuse being a physical team. Texas A &M
looks even more physical. I know you are just now turning the page. How much
are you and the team going to have to turn it up a notch to match the
defensive intensity tomorrow?   
ERICA BEVERLY: I thought we turned it up here. As you can see, we came out
with the victory. I don't know. We just have to dig more deeper. I don't know.
We are going to stick to our defense like we always have. Offense will come,
like Coach said. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Lisa, it seemed like a very tough, hard-fought, physical game. How did it
rate with the games you have had to play this year?  
LISA ETIENNE: It is definitely in the top two, three. It was very physical out
there. Like Erica said, we came out with a victory, so it was worth it. I
think if you are in NCAA and it is not like this, then you are not in a NCAA
tournament. So it was good.  
  
Q. Lisa, you guys haven't lost since December 12th. Talk about what it's
like to be on a team like that. What do you get from getting a winning
streak?  
LISA ETIENNE: We haven't lost since when? You are thinking about Marist. We
ended Marist's winning streak on December 12th.  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to thank the student athletes for their
participation in the press conference.  
Any questions for head coach Jennifer Rizzotti?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: No? Okay. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, you got a lot of experience sitting in that chair. What did you
tell the players after the game about coming out and winning the game at a
NCAA tournament?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I just talked to them about two main things was overcoming
adversity, that it was a 40-minute basketball game and I thought they did a
great job of keeping their poise in a game where there was times where it
didn't seem like anything was going our way. We found a way to make shots. We
found a way to get stops and that was number one.  
The other thing I said was that we're a balanced team. Talk a lot about our
big three, Diana, Erica, and Danielle. And sometimes they forget. I think
Lisa, MaryLynne and Jamie are underrated. MaryLynne and Jamie kept Erica
Morrow and Chandrea Jones to 8 for 27 from the floor. I would say that's some
pretty good defense. I think those two guys were pretty key to our success
tonight.  
Obviously MaryLynne scored a lot of points. I thought it was their focus on
defense. So I was proud of how they overcame adversity. When they took away
our post game, we found a way to win anyway.  
  
Q. Coach, were you surprised at all at the end of the game the way Syracuse
went to the goal to try to take the lead back, with Nicole not calling a time-
out and just aggressively going for it at the end of the game?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah. I think it's such a hard call as a coach, you know. Any
of us in that position, you feel like if you had called a time-out, maybe the
other team will change their defense. If you don't call a time-out and you
don't score, it is like your fault for not setting something up. And it is
just tough and you just got to trust in your decision.  
I think Nicole Michael is their most experienced player. She has been in a
Syracuse uniform the longest. I felt like she had success driving to the
basket and getting fouled. I thought they were aggressive and got the shot
they wanted. We were fortunate they missed and able to pull down the rebound.  
That was kind of her game plan the whole game, was they weren't out there to
shoot a ton of 3s, they were looking to really attack off the dribble. And
they stuck to that right to the end.  
  
Q. It seemed like if you could have kept them off the free-throw line you
would have won this game easily. Did you expect them to get that many points
from the free-throw line? Why do you think that was happening? What do you
tell your team when you see them making 90%, shot after shot?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It is definitely tough to sit back and watch other teams
shooting a lot of free throws and your team isn't. And sometimes, you know,
you think, well, we're settling. I felt we went inside and trying to be
aggressive.  
They're just really tough to guard off the dribble. You don't face a lot of
teams that have, you know, kids like Erica Morrow, Chandrea Jones, and Nicole
Michael at the 2, 3, and 4 that can all shoot it well from the three-point
line and put it on the floor. And they were killing us on the glass. I don't
know that we've ever gotten up by 14 with this group. Usually that's one of
our strengths. They just had an attack mentality from the beginning. I thought
our kids did a good job of hanging tough and not allowing their made free
throws to affect us.  
We just countered them with made baskets, and that's what we have to do in
that situation. There are things you can control and things you can't. You
can't control the way they call fouls; you just have to overcome it and not
allow it to really deflate you at all. And I thought our kids kept their poise
pretty well in that situation.  
  
Q. You called a time-out before you got the three-pointer. What do you want
to do in that time-out? I'm sure you probably didn't want to lose on any
options. So what was coming to you when you saw it going up?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: The point of the play was actually to run MaryLynne out as not
a decoy but to pay attention to her. And when they came out on her from the
bottom of the zone, we had Diana and Erica on that same side. And so we said
to her if they come out from the bottom, hit Erica in the short corner so we
can drive; if they come out from the middle, hit Diana and she can attack to
the middle. That was kind of the point of the play, was to get it to our post
players. And it was the first time we had run that baseline runner set, and I
think it threw them off guard. So they didn't quite shift everybody.  
Again, you are worrying a lot about Diana and Erica because they are usually
our leading scorers. And, you know, Jamie is right there on the wing with
MaryLynne. You don't want to leave her. I think MaryLynne made a good decision
of shooting that ball. MaryLynne is not afraid of anything. I will take her
shooting free throws, making 3s, defending the other team's best player any
day, because that kid -- she has a lot of courage and plays with no fear.  
  
Q. You guys held Nicole Michael without a field goal. You shut down Chandrea
Jones. You had defensive intensity earlier. What was it with those two that
you did defensively around them?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, you know, with Nicole Michael, we put Erica Beverly on
her. Like, that's our defensive stopper. Whenever we have a post player, we
really want to focus on Erica gets the call. And she did a phenomenal job. She
played 32 minutes, which is a lot of minutes for Erica, and I thought she was
great defensively.  
And then our goal with Chandrea was to make her shoot it over us. We knew she
had a lot of ability with the ball in her hands. We just said if she pulled
back and shoots 3s or pull-up jumpers and she makes them, we will have to live
with that. Let's try to make her take tough shots so we don't get ourselves
out of rebounding position and we kind of force her to not really get any easy
looks. And, again, Jamie had a charge on that one. She did a phenomenal job.
And I know it expended a lot of energy for her on the offensive end, but it
was certainly worth it because that's as good a defense as I have seen anyone
play on her. I know she had 12 points and 12 rebounds, but you are right, she
did have to work for everything she got.  
  
Q. What does it take for a school like Hartford to continue with opponents
with resources like a Syracuse? Do you believe that the stability you have
brought along to the program, how much does that help you in recruiting and
building this program?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It helps a lot. Kids want to play in the NCAA tournament. So
when you can sell that as a point that you have and other teams don't in your
area, it's a pretty big deal. And I think our coaching staff has to work
pretty hard to find players that will allow us to keep at this level, but also
aren't getting recruited per se by a St. John's or Syracuse. Because a lot of
kids want to go to a big main conference.  
There are a lot of good players out there. We try to work really hard to find
the ones. Erica Beverly and Diana Delva, those two kids weren't recruited by a
lot of people and they were as good as any post player on the floor today.  
I think you got to get tough kids. You got to get winners and you got to get
them to buy into it. I tell them from day one that I know how to win. I have
done it as player and I have done it as a coach. If you do ask, I promise you
we will be happy at the end of the year. And these kids never doubt it for a
second. They do everything we ask. They play really hard, as you can see, and
we don't worry about what resources we have.  
Fortunately we are at a school that has a lot of great support from the
administration. It is not necessarily always about money. Sometimes it is just
about having people care about women's basketball and give you what you need
to continue to be successful and fly their ADs and presidents and everybody
from the school down to support us. That means a lot to us and I know our kids
really appreciate that as well.  
  
Q. Good first half from some of the freshmen, Silvia and Hollins as well.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: They've come a long way. I think a couple months ago we
couldn't really play our freshmen. We were playing Virginia and some of the
bigger-named schools. They really worked hard to find a way to help us and
give us minutes. I know Mary only played 2 minutes, but her 3 was pretty big.
And just the fact that I had the confidence to put her in the game after the
way she's played over the last month and a half and the way she's practiced, I
knew I could go to her for a little bit.  
And then Jonyce was ready. She was ready all week. She was aggressive in
practice. She was looking forward to the pressure. Defensively, she's been
dynamite in the last couple games we've had. So I have no qualms about putting
her in the game. Obviously you worry a little bit about experience. The only
way they are going to get experience for the next time is to play them now.
And I'm really proud of how they responded.  
  
Q. You have won a lot of NCAA tournaments. What does one win mean for your
program? Not saying you are not going to win Monday, but just getting this one
win, what does it mean?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It is a big deal. It is kind of like going to a Final Four at
a big school like UConn. It is not winning the national championship, but it's
like getting to that next level.  
And it means a lot to our kids that over the last three years now we've
advanced to the second round twice. And knowing that they can do it, knowing
that it's not just a fluke, knowing that we are able to compete at this level,
it means a lot, it really does. I think building forward, when Danielle and
Courtney and Jamie leave, this team is going to have a lot to build on for the
future.  
You know, they were excited. I mean, they were really, really happy. They're
happy in the locker room. They were happy at the end of the game. They know
they worked hard. The best thing about it, they're excited about Monday. They
know Texas A&M is really good, but just having the opportunity to play them
for a chance to win the Sweet 16, I mean, you can't ask for anything more when
you are a college player.  
There are very few teams that have the ability to win a national championship,
and then there is very few teams that I think will have a chance to make it to
the Sweet 16. We are 40 minutes away from that. As hard as it's going to be,
still the opportunity is in front of us.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, you have the floor, sir.  
COACH BLAIR: First, I would like to thank the media for being here.  
Way back in the days when I was at LA Tech, they used to have fashion editors
cover us when we'd go to New York City, and look at the media now. You're here
because you want to. You didn't draw the short end of the stick. You're here
because of women's basketball. That's what makes all of this worthwhile.  
We were ready to play today. The best motivation we had was watching the men's
tournaments and watching the upsets or the near upsets. When Duke almost got
upset, when Connecticut did get upset and all of a sudden you have to give
your opponent credit, give your opponent credit, we have been in that league
before so I know what the Southland is all about and it is a very good
basketball league. This was their first time to the dance, and we wanted to
make sure the first ten minutes was played under our pressure defense and our
press and then get out of it and see where we are.  
23 turnovers forced in the first half and a lot of them are unforced. I think
UTA showed what they could do in the second half because it was an even ball
game in the second half. But when you're the 2 seed, you cannot be nonchalant
when a game starts. You have to be ready to play. And our coaching staff did a
very good job because we respected UTSA. We respected their dribble drive. We
respected 33 and 23. We respected what they did.  
So defense keys us for easy shots. We were able to give the ball to Danielle
Gant early because we figured they would take Starks away, and they were
trying, but then all of a sudden Gant was able to get loose. And there is not
too many 5' 10 kids -- forget what the media program says. She's 5' 10", not
5' 11". There are not too many 5' 10" kids that can play all over the floor
like her.  
It was a good victory. We were able to rest a lot of kids, be able to get my
bench. It feels good to finally win a game in the LSU's gym and not have to
play them. I have been on the losing end against LSU a few times.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how frustrating it must have been for them and, I
guess, just the aggressive nature of your defensive intensity right off the
start?  
TAKIA STARKS: In our pregame talk, we just talked about putting the pressure
on, like Coach said. In a game like this in the first round you don't want to
come out playing nonchalant. We wanted to put the pressure on early with our
press. They committed turnovers, and just really upped our game on our
defense.  
  
Q. Danielle, is this the way you typically play defense? What's your mind-
set? What's your basic philosophy you are trying to do? Looks like you get a
lot of turnovers and just trying to be more physical than the other team?  
DANIELLE GANT: Yes. This is the way we like to play in the Big 12 where we
play aggressive defense, and that's what we wanted to bring to this tournament
today. Like Takia said in the pregame talk, defense was our main focus, and I
think that's what we came out to do today.  
  
Q. Takia, what's it feel like to be on this winning streak you're on right
now? What kind of rush has it been for you guys?  
TAKIA STARKS: Really, we are just trying to stay humble and take each game as
each game and not really looking forward to the next game. Just handing out
our business game by game and just staying focused in our game plans and just
staying with our principles on defense.  
When we play defense, how we did today, we're going to win a lot more games,
and hopefully we'll make it far in the tournament this year. That's our goal.  
  
Q. Morenike, can you talk a little bit about playing in your home state and
what that was like for you today. Do you have any family that came down from
Shreveport?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Yes, I have an uncle and a lot more relatives that live
here in Baton Rouge. My mother was able to make it from Dallas and the rest of
my family from Shreveport.  
A lot of my fans that also followed me throughout high school were able to
make it down. It means a lot to come back home and play in front of my family.
Haven't had the chance to, but I'm glad that we just happened to come back
home. So it meant a lot to me.  
  
Q. Ladies, can you just talk about the different feel for that game as
opposed to two years ago, TCU, and last year, UTA. Can you just talk about
when you take to court what's different about this year?  
TAKIA STARKS: Well, I think the main thing -- Coach addressed this before we
came here to the media room -- that two years ago we were excited to be there.
We were just excited to make it and advance into the NCAA tournament. This
year we came out, we have a lot more experience. We've been there. We've been
through the wars. The Big 12 has prepared us well for this tournament. And I
think they saw this tonight, just how tough we played defense and it just
creates so much opportunity for us on offense.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you just take us through that one play that kind of began
when you went plowing into the press table, almost into the gate there and
ended up with the lay-up? Just take us through what was going through your
mind on that play.  
DANIELLE GANT: Well, Coach Schaeffer, our defensive coach, was telling me to
get up the line because I was letting my girl catch the ball every time down
the floor. I just got up the line and knocked it out of bounds and flew over
the table. Got back up and my teammate passed me the ball, and so I thought
about going to the hole, and I went to the hole.  
  
Q. Danielle, wanted to ask you about that play in particular. Was that
something that comes from your preparation in defense, the way that y'all
practice and play, that you got to make a play like that? And, also, Coach
Blair yesterday talked about the restaurants y'all been to so far. Now you got
a couple more days here. Do y'all have a preference what you'd like to have?  
DANIELLE GANT: Seafood, shrimp gumbo, and little things like that.  
COACH BLAIR: Mike Anderson's tonight.  
DANIELLE GANT: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. The play when you went into the table and all, is that something that --
you are up 38-10 at that point. What makes you play that intense with a game,
you know, already in hand? Is that personal? Is that something that's grilled
into you in practice or what?  
DANIELLE GANT: That's drilled into us in practice every day. Just getting up
the line and pressure defense is what we really look at in defense and
practice, just getting up the line and denying the girl the ball.  
  
Q. Danielle, first of all, how tall are you? Second --  
DANIELLE GANT: 5' 11".  
  
Q. Now you've gone up an inch. Talk a little bit about your position
offensively, what would you consider yourself and then kind of explain your
role in the offense.  
DANIELLE GANT: I am just a versatile player. I can play the 1, 2, 3, 4, maybe
the 5. It is just great being my height and being able to play different
positions, being aggressive on the 3 position and the 4 position, just being
able to go inside with the tall players and make great shots.  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the student athletes now.  
Coach Blair, any other comments?  
COACH BLAIR: Monica Gibbs, very, very good player. Give her a lot of credit.
She's very good. She's hard to defend. And if she adds that good outside shot
to go with everything else she has, she'll be a Southland Conference player of
the year in years to come, if she's not this year.  
Reado and Micheaux played very well. Even though you don't see it on the box,
what we do to free up our outside game all starts with the inside gains, with
their screens in the offensive boards. They do so many little things, hedge
and screens. What UTSA does a great job of is dribble penetration, but we did
a good job of hedging their high-low, and particularly in the first half.
Reado is going to jump out. We can recover back and we can get A'Quo through,
and that's the key to our defense.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk a little bit about Danielle's role in the offense and
how it's evolved where injuries have played a factor in her playing different
spots and helping her grow her game.  
COACH BLAIR: We're a very unselfish basketball team. I think Danielle had
maybe 14 or 16 in the first half. And all of a sudden she's not going to say,
boy, I'm going to go for my career high. We ran the first play of the game for
her, a little UCLA cut on the post-up. We missed it, but then we scored on the
second or third option off of it.  
What we want to do is make sure they don't know how to prepare for us. Who are
you going to stop? We've got a lot of different weapons. You can bring
Morenike off the bench, and she was in the game for about 5 seconds and hit
the most beautiful 3 you've ever seen. Not too many kids can do that.  
But Danielle, you can play her at the 4 and you can post her up, which next
year we'll probably play her at the 4 like we did her freshman year a lot
because we've got Tyra White who will be healthy next year and they will play
a lot of 2-3. We're just going to move her all over the court.  
She is definitely a next-level player. If I am a WNBA team, I am just
drooling, waiting for a 5' 10" kid that can play the 2, 3, or 4. Hopefully
next year we will play the three-point game to her repertoire. She shoots it
in practice. We just have a little bit of a yellow light on her during ball
games.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how defense was the key. But only giving up 16
points in the first half, does that even exceed your expectations of what you
wanted out of this morning?  
COACH BLAIR: We were just -- we were just hooked up, baby. We were wired. When
you go in as a coach and realize there's never been a 15 seed beat a 2 seed, I
didn't want to be an asterisk, okay, like Stanford was a couple years ago when
we watched it firsthand ourselves because we had the winner of that game. We
had our team fired up. And you also got to understand, I'm a little slow
drawl. You know me very well.  
But I've got a guy on a different voltage over there next to me, Coach
Schaeffer. I can't keep him down. We're in the second half in time-outs and I
thought we were 20 behind because he's wired because we expect perfection. If
you practice perfect, you got a better chance of playing perfect.  
And we don't have a Candace Parker. Okay? We've got to do it a different way.
We don't have a Sylvia Fowles. We do it a different way. My little miniature
Danielle Gant and Takia Starks, they're pretty good imitations.  
So we have to do it by doing everything we do perfect. And when we don't do
it, they're going to hear about it.  
  
Q. What's it mean going into the next round to be able to sit your starters
basically the last ten minutes and also the reward for those substitutes
coming?  
COACH BLAIR: They've practiced so hard. I cannot remember the last game we
had. It had to have been November that we had a game like that. Those kids
work so hard and they get their shots. I was glad to see Buchanan get very
active. She was missing shots early because she was double-teamed, should have
passed out. But she was active.  
It was great to see Maryann Baker come in and do what she did. All of a sudden
we were running a little circle offense, and that's a three-point play. Hit
the cutter and she kept hitting the cutter. I said don't hit the cutter, wait
for the next screen. We still scored off of both of them.  
Those kids have waited their turn, and they realize that top six is very
special. It is like looking at LSU with nine seniors, and the same five have
started all year. They've earned that right.  
This is what my six have done. And if you want to come to A&M, you might have
to wait in line because we've got some very good players that are already in
place. And that's what kids want to do. They want to play with kids that are
fun. 25 minutes is the most anybody played in the game. And Morenike had 19
and 21 minutes. So it's not bad. We were able to rest, get a little bit of
Mike Anderson's tonight. We'll sit there and watch this ball game here, and
then we will go in to a little hole and get prepared for the game. All right?
We want to make sure that we're not sitting there going to Disneyland or
something like that.  
The first two years that was nice. It's winning time right now, and we got to
figure a way to beat one of these two teams that's fixing to be in here.  
  
Q. Coach, you said in Kansas City, I think your exact words, we need to play
Saturday, we don't need to wait until Sunday. You are on this roll 13 out of
14. Do you still have a sense of you wonder what's out there? Do you worry
about taking it from a Big 12 tournament to the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: You worry. You do not leave a single stone unturned. We had to
play this game like we were playing a Big 12 opponent. As a result, you can
see we were a little bit larger, a little bit more physical, and they were not
used to this type of pressure in their league. We were able to put the
pressure on, force 23 turnovers, ball game.  
Second half, they played well. But we didn't have the same intensity or the
same pressure and we were playing a lot of kids.  
This team is ready -- since we've never been there before, Robert, I mean,
Sweet 16 would be great. Second round is damn good. Okay? Second round is
good. And I can't wait to see what shirt you are going to wear in the next
round, because that's a blockbuster right there.  
But we're hungry. We hope you're hungry. We hope you brought a few more shirts
because we plan on dancing a while.  
By the way, my sister thought you were good. She is back home in Dallas and
she reads every one of them. When Brian doesn't write anything good, she lets
me know.  
  
Q. Could you just take us through -- I guess through a big-picture
standpoint, when did the defense kick in? It was your trademark, but early in
the season it wasn't there. What kind of jump-started things for you?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we had a lackadaisical off season. We had gone to Europe
the year before. We had played a lot of basketball. We sent kids to USA
basketball. We gave them a lot of time off during the summer. They didn't come
back in the best possible shape, or at least Aggie shape. There is no fat on
us.  
There is a difference between shape and being able to play the defense that we
want to play. And I think it just took a while. And the best thing that could
happen to us was probably those four losses. You get a little humble pie
early, you get hungry and you get better.  
And the biggest thing about this team is every ball game in February and
March, including the Oklahoma loss, we've gotten better. A lot of teams win
ball games, but we've gotten better and that's what's exciting as a coach.  
It is like being a teacher in the classroom, when you can see the kids get it
and you feel like you've done something as a teacher. That's the most
important aspect of our coaching staff, is we teach the game pretty well.  
  
Q. On behalf of the Houston Chronicle, you can get that where you live.  
COACH BLAIR: We sure can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your potential opponent, either one of these teams.  
COACH BLAIR: I told the teams in the dressing room, I want you to watch.
Eastern style of ball is a little bit different than the south. Okay? We might
run a little bit more. Hartford is a very smart team. They're a reflection of
their coach. Jen Rizzotti, I coached her in '96 in the Jones Cup team.  
The kids up east know the game very well. It is like every coach I've ever met
from Philadelphia or something, they're just junkies of the game. They're
gurus, and they talk it 24 hours a day. And when I -- I don't recruit a lot of
kids from the East Coast because they're not going to come to the south. But I
respect their brand of ball, but I respect the coaches first because of the
knowledge of the game that they have up there.  
It is old-school basketball. And then you get Q that coaches Syracuse. They're
as athletic as we are. I will find a little bit more when I see them live. I
have seen enough film on them.  
They are very athletic and they have old Moody sitting on the sidelines
helping them out, and that's like having Tex Winter over there. And they're a
good ball club. Who would we like to play? I would like the next game to go
into five overtimes and make them late for their dinner appointment. That's
what I want. I want their starters to have to play a little bit longer than
ours did.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Erica Morrow, Nicole Michael, Fantasia Goodwin, and the
head coach, Quentin Hillsman.  
Coach, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the tournament. We'd like to ask you for
any opening remarks that you'd like to give us today.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, thank you. Obviously we're very excited to be here. You
know, we've really worked hard to get our program to this level, and you know,
coming into this tournament we knew that Hartford would be a very tough game
for us. We knew that we were very good, and they've been here three out of the
last four years. Every interview that I've done, I've been very complimentary
of the things that they've done and which Coach Rissotti and has gotten them
to and the level that they're at now.  
One thing that I will say is we worked hard at our program to get to this
level, and when you read things in the paper that has you as being an underdog
or have you being an upset alert or see things that's written by your opponent
that, you know, they try to schedule you and you're going to play them, and
now the game is here, so I guess we're here. Yeah, if I seem a little
irritated, I am, because I've been reading a lot of things that they wouldn't
schedule this game. So now we're here and we're playing it.  
I'm excited because, you know, it doesn't take much to get me going and get me
motivated and ready to roll, so I'm ready to roll now. You know, they're a
very good program, and I would never say anything that would steal the thunder
from our kids. But we're ready to play, and we're very excited about the game.  
Obviously these are things that you look at and you feel that, you know, we
deserve to be here, and we're excited about being here. And all I can tell you
is that when it's time to play, that we're going to compete and we're going to
play very hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's roll with some questions.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what the scheduling -- what exactly
were you saying there? They had called to schedule -- what's the whole story
from your side so we can be clear, because I'm just finding out about this.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Sure. Well, the story is that there's a local kid from our
area that actually plays at Hartford, and they've been trying to schedule the
games to get her home. What we do in our scheduling is we put down 35, 40
teams that we intend on playing every year, and that's how we schedule. It
just never seemed to work out.  
It's been written a lot, and I know this is no secret because I know you guys
read, so it's been written a lot that we wouldn't do this game. You know, for
me, it's kind of disrespectful, I mean, it really is, because we worked hard
to be at this level for this to be just a basketball game and not to turn into
some sidebar thing. I've been really tight-lipped about it for two weeks now
-- sorry, for a week now. I've been very tight-lipped about it. But when you
keep seeing these things over and over again, it kind of, you know, gets you a
little irritated.  
My deal is, you know, I just want to play basketball. I just want to get to
this tournament and play the game, and this will be ours. So we're excited
about the basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach Q and Fantasia, you guys are always honest with me. What does it
mean to be here and be part of the NCAA Tournament for you guys?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Honestly, it means a lot. This is our fourth time in 37 years
being in the tournament, so we're excited about the game.  
When you talk about what it means to compete at this level and to have a
chance to win the national championship, I mean, that's what you strive for.
You strive to be here so you can win the national championship. I mean, we're
excited about the game. It's an honor and it's a pleasure and we've worked
very hard to get here.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I mean, it's overwhelming. We worked so hard this year, and
to finally be here is like a dream come true. We worked hard, and I'm just
happy and my team is happy and Coach is happy to be here. We worked hard. We
played hard, and we gave it all we've got.  
  
Q. This question is for all the players, starting with Erica. The chance to
do something no one else has ever done for Syracuse, win an NCAA Tournament
game, how motivating is that for you guys?  
ERICA MORROW: That's very motivating. As everyone said, we've come out and
worked hard this year, and just to be on the national stage at a national
level showcasing our talent and showingcasing how hard we can play and just
how far our program and our whole staff and all the players have come is
exciting.  
You know, just any NCAA Tournament game is exciting, and we hope to continue
and go as far in the postseason as possible.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I think a lot of people don't take us seriously as a team,
and I feel we have a lot to prove in winning this game on Saturday. So we're
just going to go out and throw the first punch and hopefully come out with a
good result.  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I just feel it's great to be a part of a team that made a lot
of history this year. I feel like we played hard and we worked for it as a
team, and together we built our confidence up, and we just played hard.  
COACH HILLSMAN: I want to follow up, too, by kind of echoing what they're
saying. This is a great tournament. You've got 64 teams in this thing, and
when you talk about from the first seeds down to the 16th seeds, they're all
very good basketball teams and they're all players and coaches that have
really sacrificed a lot to be here. So obviously there are no bad teams in
this tournament. Everybody here really deserves it, and everybody here has a
point of wanting to win these games and not just show up for one game and out.
So we're excited about that.  
  
Q. When I saw you guys last night at the hotel I was reminded just when you
guys were all dressed up and having a good time headed off to dinner of how
close you guys are as a bunch, and I was just wondering, you're obviously a
very talented team, but how much has that closeness led you to where you are
now and how much will it take you into this tournament do you think?  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I think it's amazing to have a team that's just so close.
There's not a lot of teams that are close like we are, and I feel like it's
amazing, and we play hard together and we work together, and I feel that's a
major part of our season and a major part of our record today. I feel we just
bond together and love each other, and it's great.  
ERICA MORROW: I feel we play well together as a team. We do everything
together. We all know each other's weaknesses and strengths, and that's a huge
part of the chemistry on the court, and it shows. I think we do a good job in
showing that.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: I think our closeness strengthens us because when one person
struggles we all struggle together. When we win together, we all win together.
And when we lose, we all lose together. I think our closeness, including our
staff and our coaches, I think that strengthens us going down the stretches in
tough games. And when we struggle and when we are successful I think it brings
us closer together.  
COACH HILLSMAN: We believe in what we do. We believe in each other. We just
know that every night and every day that we go out and play basketball that
we're playing for our teams. We're playing for our University. We're playing
for our conference, and we understand the responsibility and the importance it
is for us to come out and be competitive and to win basketball games and to
put a productive product on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just say, do you see a key to this game, either
something that has to happen or you have to prevent?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Oh, yes, definitely. I've watched a lot of tape on Hartford.
You talk about an amazing basketball team, great post players. Danielle Hood,
she's a senior, and she's just a very effective player from the low blocking,
from the high post, very good off the bounce. And they have very good shooters
on the perimeter, and I think that as of lately, their point guard has been
playing extremely well. They're a very good basketball team. You're talking
about 27 wins, you're talking about Coach Rissotti winning 171 games and 103
losses over the time that she's been there. I was joking earlier before we
left, I said, I'm just glad she's not playing, because if she was playing we
would have a problem (laughing).  
We have to really control their players. They have five players on the floor
that can score the basketball, and for us we've got to continue doing what
we've been doing, playing at the rim, being aggressive and making sure that we
don't take one possession off, because this is a game where I think it's going
to come down to the last two or three minutes of the basketball game, who's
going to be mentally tough, who's going to execute, and I think the team that
does that will win the basketball game.  
  
Q. I was just wondering how the loss in the Big East tournament affected
both the players and the coach, and how did that help you prepare for this
game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, one thing, it was a very tough game. I really believe
that our conference is the best in the country. And when you talk about from
top to bottom, it's just any night if you don't come out and make shots and
you don't defend up to your standards and what we've set, you can lose a
basketball game. And it happened to us. I don't feel any ill-effects from that
game, because South Florida was a very tough opponent. But I mean, it gives us
a chance to really go home and get back in the gym and work, and understand
when you have tournament-type settings and you have opportunities to win
basketball games that you've got to come out and compete to your potential. I
thought we competed to our potential, but I didn't think that we executed to
our potential.  
NICOLE MICHAEL: I just feel that loss was kind of tough for us. Our conference
is one of the toughest conferences in the country, so if we don't bring our
"A" game night in and night out, we'd lose. I just felt like that game taught
us a lot as a team, when you have to get in the gym and work together and just
work on what we had to work on to win. It was tough, but we have to move on
and focus on our next game.  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: The lesson learned was that you can never take a team for
granted no matter who you're playing or why you're playing them or anything
like that. What we did was went in the gym and cleaned up some of the things
we had to clean up and polish and make sure that we don't make the same
mistakes in the NCAA Tournament.  
ERICA MORROW: I think the loss for us gave us the opportunity to get back in
the gym that following week before selection Monday and just tweak the little
things that we needed to correct and clean up the little mistakes and just
make adjustments, because now coming into the NCAA Tournament, it's one game
you lose and you're out. I feel like it just gave us the opportunity to just
get back to focusing on details and just being competitive and playing
basketball, how we did in the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that, how do you get Shawndrea going again after the
Big East tournament and how big a factor will that be in the game with
Hartford?  
COACH HILLSMAN: That's going to be a huge factor. It's funny because it's one
of the reasons why I brought her to this press conference, because she's the
shyest kid on the planet here. She's sitting here and might freeze up on us a
little bit. We've got to continue to have her be aggressive. I mean, she's a
very explosive scorer, and we've got to continue to put the ball in her hands
and have her looking to score the basketball, because I'll tell you, the more
and more I watch Hartford's defense, they do a good job of shutting down other
teams' leading scorers, so we've got to find her ways to get her touches on
the floor so she can score the basketball, because they do a very good job
defensively of keeping you out of the lane, and they do a good job of when you
turn the corner of having second and third help, and it's a remarkable thing
when you watch them.  
You see a lot of UConn in Hartford and the way they play and their toughness
and their defensive intensity is great.  
  
Q. This is for Fantasia. Your coach mentioned about the Big East being the
toughest conference top to bottom in the country. What's it like being in the
Big East where UConn and, to a lesser extent, maybe Rutgers gets so much of
the attention? What's it like to fight your way up for recognition and so
forth in that lead?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: Can you repeat the end of your question?  
  
Q. Being in the Big East, so dominated by UConn and Rutgers, what's it like
trying to lead your own program up to that level?  
FANTASIA GOODWIN: You know, it just challenges you, and I think that a lot has
to do with it is working hard every day in and out of the gym, on your own and
stuff like that. It's a huge accomplishment, and I'm just thankful to be
playing at a level this high.  
  
Q. This is their third time in four years to be here, and this is Erica and
Tasha and Shawndrea were not here last year, so how big of an advantage is
that for Hartford?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's a huge advantage. Honestly, nothing can overcome
experience. You can't gain the experience that they've gained by being at the
tournament three out of the last four years. When you look at their program
and what they've done and the players they have, it's remarkable. They've been
here -- I think they were here and they beat Temple last time. They were here
early. It's something that I don't think you can overcome. The only thing that
you can do is get your kids prepared to play basketball.  
You look at their games, their teams when they've played, they've beaten
Michigan State, they've beat Virginia, they beat St. John's, they've beaten
Providence, so those are very good teams. So I can see why they would have
some doubts about us coming into this basketball game and being able to win
this basketball game, because they're very experienced and they've been here
and they've beaten some good teams.  
We're going to go out and do what we've been doing all year. I'm going to play
my babies (laughing), and we're going to throw them in the fire, and we're
just going to go play basketball, and hopefully they come out and play the way
they've been playing. Hopefully Erica comes out and plays like she played at
Murry Bergtraum, and hopefully Tasha comes out and plays the way she played at
St. Michael's, and we'll just go win the basketball game, because I think
you've got to keep it in perspective for your kids because you've also got to
put it in the perspective of they have a lot of experience and they know and
they've been through this three of the last four years.  
A lot of the players on this team have experienced this a couple times. We're
just going to come and play basketball and keep it simple and do the things
we've been doing all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, do you have any closing remarks?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I'll close up by just saying, obviously, we feel honored to be
here and to be competing at this level. I mean, when you talk about our
opponent, just a very, very formidable team who's been at this level for a
long time, and they win at a high level. We have a lot of respect for them,
and we are really preparing a game plan. We're going to come out and put
ourselves in the best position to win this basketball game. It's going to be a
tough game, and we are excited for the opportunity to play in the NCAA
Tournament, and hopefully we can keep things in perspective on every front on
what we need to do on the floor and the things that we need to do to win this
basketball game. So we're excited, and hopefully we come out Saturday with the
win.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Hartford, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the tournament here. We
have Katie Kelley, student athlete; student athlete, Danielle Hood; student
athlete, Lisa Etienne; and the coach, Coach Jen residing.  
Opening statements, Coach?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Thank you. We appreciate the welcome to Baton Rouge. So far so
good. We hear it's snowing up at Connecticut or close to it. Happy to be here
in the warm weather, and the hospitality has been great.  
There's nothing like playing in a NCAA tournament. We're excited about it. But
fortunately for us we have kids on the podium and a couple of kids in the
locker room that have been here before and have an understanding of what it
takes to win a game at this level and, I think, are prepared to put the work
in to try to do that.  
So we have a great first-round opponent. And the Syracuse team, they're tough,
they're athletic. They're determined after coming off the first round loss in
the Big East tournament, so we know have our work cut out for us. But we
certainly feel like we have the experience, and we're prepared for that.  
  
Q. I just wanted to talk to the players and also, Jen, about your experience
two years ago in the tournament and how much that will affect tomorrow's
game.  
KATIE KELLEY: Since it has been a year since we made the NCAA tournament, it
is really great to be here. I think the main thing we learned is keep your
composure. Anything can happen in the tournament. Just stay focused and stay
calm and just bring your A game.  
LISA ETIENNE: Well, I wasn't playing two years ago when they made it to the
NCAA tournament, but I was able to sit back and watch and it was just -- I was
very excited and anxious to get here and now that I'm here, I just want to
feel what they felt a couple years ago.  
  
Q. Katie, talk about matching up with Syracuse and what was your reaction
when the brackets came out and you saw that you guys were going to face
Syracuse.  
KATIE KELLEY: I was pretty excited. I am from Syracuse, right from in the
city. As soon as it said Syracuse-Hartford, everybody turned at looked at me
and I was like, "yes," because I have been wanting to see them since I was a
freshman. We tried to get games and stuff.  
I am excited to play them. I wish we could play Syracuse at Syracuse. It is
gorgeous down in Louisiana, so what's better? But I'm real excited. I know a
couple of girls on the team. I think it will be pretty fun.  
  
Q. She alluded to it, Coach Q was a little bit miffed that the papers had
been saying that no scheduled game in the regular season could be worked out
and that might have been noticed by you guys and this was a game that maybe
you guys would -- could get some revenge there. What do you think about
that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, I don't know where that came from. We m have called up
there to try to get a game in Syracuse for Katie for her senior year, which is
next year, and it hasn't been worked out. They're not on our schedule. So it's
not coming on our end. Let's just keep it to that.  
This has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with playing Syracuse.
It was just a matter of trying to get a home game for our seniors, which we do
every year. So whether it was just the timing thing or just wasn't right, we
just -- we couldn't work that out.  
So, you know, when it comes down to matchups, you're just -- you're more
focused on who you're playing and what you have to do to win and advance to
the next round and, you know, whether we play them at Syracuse or play them in
Baton Rouge doesn't really matter to us. We're just excited to be here and for
the opportunity to be back in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, what's it like -- you're in a state that's so dominated
by UConn. They're right next to you. Your coach is one of their most famous
players. How do you build your own identity, carve out your identity as a
program?  
KATIE KELLEY: Our coaching staff is great, and because of that, we're a pretty
good team. I feel like we have so many fans that are very supportive of us in
Hartford and just as a community.  
You would be surprised to know that there are a lot of people in Connecticut
that are Hartford fans over UConn. We do have a supporting crew behind us.  
KATIE KELLEY: I think we also make a name for ourselves by beating team that
nobody expects us to beat, like when we beat Michigan State this year, we have
gone and beat BYU and then we won the Hawaii tournament. Winning games helps
us make a name for ourselves in Connecticut.  
  
Q. Jennifer, this is a question for you. A few years ago when you were in
Syracuse playing at the Manley Fieldhouse, I think, your senior year, you came
up on the losing end.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: You really have to bring that up, right?  
  
Q. What can you tell us about that game, if you remember?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, it was one of my four losses in my entire senior year.
So when you don't lose a lot, it is not something that you forget very easily.
I just remember that the team they had was a really good team that year. They
played really well and it wasn't like it is most of the time when you go up to
Syracuse. It was rainy and sleety and snowy, and I remember we were trying to
charter home and they were having a problem deicing the plane and there was
absolutely no more miserable of a time to be sitting on a plane when we had
just lost the game waiting to go home.  
So it doesn't erase from my memory very easily. It was one of the lower points
of my senior year. But I don't think we lost after that game until the Final
Four. So every now and then -- you know, every coach will say this. Sometimes
a loss is a wake-up call and gets you prepared for what's ahead. Certainly
with this team.  
I think we understand how good Syracuse is, and I respect them a lot. This
year's team and what they've accomplished, you know, that they're pretty
hungry because it has been a while since they've been to the NCAA tournament,
so we're certainly, you know, prepared for the challenge. Like I said earlier,
we know it's going to be a tough one.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little bit on what experience does for your team
and maybe how you handle it differently now than you did when you were first
in the tournament?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah. Well, with this group, you know, Danielle was a
freshman, you know, with this group's first time in the NCAA tournament, our
second overall. I remember we were a 15 or 14 -- 14 seed. I was eight months
pregnant. I was praying they didn't send us anywhere far so I could make the
trip, and they sent us up the road to UConn.  
I remember our kids were a little disappointed because they wanted to go away.
But, you know, having to play as a 14 seed, usually you're getting a top-ten
program and Rutgers was a very formidable opponent, even at that time.  
And I think our kids were just kind of excited about being there. We were
excited about seeing our name on the screen, and it was the first time for
that group.  
And then the following year, there was just such a much bigger sense of
purpose like, "All right, last year was for fun; this year is business."  
When we went down to Trenton, it was business. We were -- we prepared for
Temple, like we were going to beat Temple. And we were preparing for the NCAA
tournament like it was another tournament we were playing in.  
As a coach, it was much more fun to be a part of that because you felt like
your kids really understood what it meant -- they appreciated being in the
tournament, but they understood what it meant putting the hard work into try
to win a game. And so I feel like those -- that nucleus of players, Danielle
was a sophomore and Erica Beverly and Katie were a freshman and MaryLynne
Schaefer, they've been here before. They understand it is fun and, yeah, the
weather's great and we're going to have a good time while we're here but
there's a sense of purpose and what we're trying to accomplish.  
We understand after last year's failure to get to the NCAA tournament that you
can never take it for granted and you can never waste an opportunity because
it's such a long time before you have a chance to get back. And so I think
this group wants to make sure that they won't waste this opportunity and that
they are ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. I want you to talk about the defensive intensity that you guys had in the
conference tournament and has that carried over this week in practices. Do you
think that will carry over until tomorrow?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I think it will. I think that's what we built the last month
of our season around, is our defense and our rebounding and trying to really
limit what people do. I think it's a little different when our players are not
as familiar with our opponent, the way that they were familiar -- we were
playing everybody in the America East tournament for the third time, so
tendencies and player personnel, it was like we didn't even have to go through
the scouting report and they knew what we were supposed to be doing.  
So tomorrow will be a little bit different. It will take us a little time to
adjust to what Syracuse players like to do. You know, they have so many good
one-on-one players that that sometimes can take you off guard in terms of
trying to figure out what players like to do best and what kind of shots we
want to force.  
And then plus they're relentless on the offensive glass. You know, that's
something that, again, you can work on it, you can tell them about it, you can
show them on film. But until you're in the heat of the battle, it is hard to
prepare for that. So I think it's going to probably take us a few minutes or
even a half to get adjusted to what Syracuse likes to do.  
Plus, I think their defensive intensity is something we will have to adjust
more so than anybody was able to do to us in our tournament. So on that end of
the floor, valuing the basketball and handling their pressure on the ball or
in a trap situation is going to be -- half to be something we adjust to as
well. It is hard to stimulate that and know what's coming until you've played
it.  
So that is a disadvantage for us and for them, when you're not as familiar.
But at the same time, I think it is exciting to finally be able to play
somebody that we haven't played three times already this year.  
  
Q. Katie, you spoke about knowing some of the girls on the Syracuse team.
Can you talk about Cintia Johnson, the matchups you had with her in high
school and maybe looking back on it a little bit.  
KATIE KELLEY: Me and Cintia are pretty close. We talked three or four times so
far. She was the cross-town rival, Corcoran-Nottingham. We were always 1-2,
2-1. Ended up she always won by one point or shot clock buzzer, usually at the
end of the year. We always won the regular season, you know, game and they
always won in the tournament. So I mean, it is going to be exciting to see
her. I know what she is all about. I am real excited to play her again.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: And they played AAU together.  
KATIE KELLEY: We played AAU. We were on the same team. We played this summer
at the Empire State Games together. It was fun.  
  
Q. Two questions, Coach, then Danielle. First, Coach, Big East tremendously
deep this year, 12 teams playing now, I think in the post-season with the NIT.
And Syracuse is a team that's just had this recent success. You alluded to it
before but, how do you kind of prepare for this team? They're very tall.
They're deep. And this is kind of a new success to the program. So, you know,
recent success Syracuse, new up-and-coming teams kind a few years ago, how
Hartford was. How has that gone?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Well, I think that, you know, it is different if you're new
and up-and-coming and you sneak into the tournament as a 14 seed and when you
have a great season, you beat -- knock off some of the best teams in the Big
East and you get in as a 7 seed.  
You know, this is not a team that's just happy to be in the NCAA tournament.
Their kids are very focused. Along the lines of what Katie said, we've watched
a lot of their players in AAU. We recruited some of their players. There's a
lot of familiarity with what they're capable of. We've seen them a lot on
film, and this isn't, like, a new bunch of freshman, an inexperienced team.  
The way they've been able to pull together as a group and play together, you
would think they've been playing together for a couple years. You know, that's
a compliment to what they've been able to accomplish in a short period of
time.  
So they're certainly going to play with a lot of intensity. They're used to
playing with intensity every single night when they have to come out in the
Big East schedule. They got West Virginia one night, Rutgers the next and
Louisville on the road. So they know what it's like to have to come out with
intensity every night.  
Our kids are going to have to challenge themselves to be able to match that.  
  
Q. For Danielle and Katie, as far as the depth in the post, they're very,
very big. Again, like a team like West Virginia or Pittsburgh or Connecticut
that they played routinely throughout the season, this is going to be, I
think, a pretty tough task and pretty demanding on Hartford's post players,
where you arguably have the most depth. That would be the biggest challenge of
the game, I would think. Danielle?  
DANIELLE HOOD: They do have good post players. At the same time we have really
good post players, too. I feel like we can go deep. There is a lot of us on
the team that Coach Rizz can turn to. When one person is tired, she takes them
out and puts in another person. I think she does a really good job of playing
everybody so we're not as tired during the game.  
I mean, there have been many teams we have played during the year where the
post players are good and we just come together and we beat them.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Once of reasons we played the nonconference schedule we did
was to prepare for this moment. Maybe the teams in the America East don't get
us ready for a first-round NCAA tournament game. But certainly Michigan State
and Virginia who is a 4 seed and Marist who is a 7 seed, those games -- UConn
who is a 1 seed overall, those are the games that prepare us for this moment.
That's why we play them. Whether we win or lose, it gives our players the
experience that they will need this time of year.  
I'm really confident that our kids will be able to handle whatever is thrown
at them because we've, you know, hopefully over the last two, three, four
years put them in a position to be successful.  
  
Q. Jen, everyone points in the women's tournament to this -- pretty much the
same cast of teams that can be contenders and stuff like that. I'm sure you
still have a soft spot in your heart for your alma mater in some ways. Is
women's basketball, to take that next step in popularity, have to have more
teams that can contend more? Or is it still get good for Tennessee and
Connecticut to carry on this Red Sox-Yankees rivalry like they have every
year?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: It definitely doesn't hurt the game when UConn and Tennessee
match up. Especially with all the tuck and the hub-bub about them not playing
in the regular season. If that were to be the national championship game, I'm
sure there wouldn't be a higher rating. No offense to anybody else, but I just
feel like that's what everybody would love to see.  
At the same time, I think when you listen to the commentators and you listen
to people around women's basketball, you know, there is a sense that there's
six, seven, eight teams maybe that have an opportunity to win. And I'm not
sure that was the case four, five years ago where it seemed like it was always
UConn or Tennessee.  
So, you know, I feel like, yeah, we are moving toward that point. I do think
it is good for the women's game to grow that there are more rivalries and
there are more players that have familiar faces around the country and it's
kind of about everybody and that people are looking forward to seeing some
upsets in the NCAA tournament because they just don't happen as frequently on
the women's side as there is on the men's side.  
  
Q. To that end, again, comparing to the men's tournament, everybody is
talking this year, who is the next George Mason, the double-digit seed that
might come out of nowhere to make the Final Four? Do you want to be in that
category of a program that's trying to improve? Do you want your players to
dream of that?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: Yeah.  
  
Q. Making it to Tampa? Do you talk about it? Do you focus on it? Obviously,
Syracuse is a big first-round game you have to win the first one. Do you want
them to dream that way?  
COACH RIZZOTTI: I don't want them to sell themselves short and think they're
not capable of beating somebody. We take one game at a time no matter what and
certainly one weekend at a time.  
But, you know, the kids are at a point now where they're confident enough to
know that we've -- like I said, we've played some of the best teams in the
country and sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we're putting ourselves
in a position to learn what we have to do to compete at that level.  
And it's much more rare to see a double-digit seed advance to the Sweet
Sixteen on the women's side. It is. But I think certainly Marist and I think
maybe Bowling Green last year -- I am not sure what seed this were -- they
proved there are some mid-major programs out there that deserve to have
respect and deserve to continuing to play in the post-season regardless if
they get an automatic bid or not.  
So I do think that the time is coming where there is more double-digit teams
upsetting first round and maybe second round opponents, but I'm not so sure
that we can get carried away at this point that they're going to be able to go
through four teams probably two of the top-ranked teams in the country and get
to a Final Four.  
But I certainly wouldn't want our kids to ever think that that wasn't possible
if we played the perfect game on the perfect night.  
  
Q. Katie, did you catch an elbow here?  
KATIE KELLEY: Yeah, I got a cut on my chin.  
  
Q. Did that happen in practice getting ready for this game?  
KATIE KELLEY: Yeah, practice.  
COACH RIZZOTTI: We've been bruising each other up, so....  
  
Q. You also understand the significance of your number in Syracuse. How did
that -- 44 is probably the most famous number at Syracuse in football. How did
that happen? How did you come to get that number?  
KATIE KELLEY: I had it in high school. I just -- it just kind of happened in
high school and I get reminded daily 44, football, all that stuff. And then
when I came to college, Liz Stitch (phonetic), she was a senior -- when I was
coming as a freshman, she graduated and I got it because I had it in high
school. I was just lucky enough to get it. So ...  
COACH RIZZOTTI: If Katie doesn't have a bruise on her face somewhere, then
that means she hasn't been playing or practicing. So we like it when she is
beat up a little bit.  
Thanks for being here and covering the team. We're looking forward to a great
weekend.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
Q. Let's talk about the matchup with A &M, Coach and players.   
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Sure. A&M I really think they're one of the hottest
things coming into the NCAA tournament. They've had a great Big 12 tournament.
The championship, I've watched them on T.V., watched a lot of game tape.  
They are very, very talented. I think their main strength is their defense.
They make you do a lot of things that you don't want to do. I think you have
to handle the ball. I know with turnovers, a lot of teams they are scoring by
35, 25, 37 points off of people's turnovers.  
That's one thing we've stressed to our team, that we got to take care of the
ball. I feel like we've got some very talented ladies in the guard position. I
think we match up there, but we will have to take it to them and handle their
full-court man.  
The other thing that I think A&M does very well is they rebound. They're a
great rebounding team. We'll have to really keep them off the boards.  
  
Q. This is for Terrie. Can you talk as a senior making it to the NCAA
tournament, especially coming from a state that's so rich in women's
basketball history, did you feel like -- was this one of your goals when you
signed with UTSA?  
TERRIE DAVIS: Yeah, of course. It was my biggest goal when I signed with UTSA.
The experience and making it is just great. It is a great experience. I'm
enjoying the moment right now and everything. So I am just ready to play
against A&M.  
  
Q. Rae, I wanted to ask you about your relationship with Gary Blair.
Obviously a Blair versus a Blair matchup is interesting. People ask you if you
are his granddaughter?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: They do ask if I am his granddaughter.  
  
Q. For someone who coaches at a school -- I won't say a small school but a
school in a Southland Conference and he has a tradition at Steven F. Austin,
can you talk about his reputation in Texas as far as basketball coaching?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Coach Blair has a great reputation. I have known him for
a long, long time. When I was at Oklahoma State and, you know, being at Steven
F., he did a great job at getting that program going, what you can do in the
Southland. He has ultimate respect. I think he is probably one of the hardest-
working coaches in the NCAA right now.  
And I really think that's why they are where they are. He's done a tremendous
job with the recruiting process and just getting them into the NCAA tournament
every year.  
We definitely have ultimate respect for him and Lynn Hickey, our A.D., came
from A&M and our associate athletic director sitting down here played soccer
at A&M. So we definitely have some ties with A&M.  
  
Q. Maybe one drawback is you said he had a lot of respect for your team and
that he wasn't going to overlook you guys. Maybe an element of surprise
tomorrow on your part?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, I hope so. I know if Belmont would have one last
night against Duke, it would have ruined everybody's bracket. But, no, our
team -- I think we're very prepared.  
Like I said, we know what we've got to do. Now it is just a matter of us
stepping on the court and going out and doing it. I know that first five
minutes is going to be very, very important tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. Amanda, your coach mentioned the Duke-Belmont game last night. I don't
know if y'all saw it. Does that show that the little guys -- in your case, the
little girls, I guess, can beat the big guys? What do you take from that?  
AMANDA FOSTER: That gives us even more hope. I don't think anybody should
overlook us or underestimate our team going into this tournament. We match up
really well with Texas A&M. They're a really good team, but I think we can get
the job done if we go in there and stick to the game plan.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Blair had mentioned that you guys have a couple of lefty
point guards and how difficult that is to practice and prepare for. Have you
noticed it being an advantage during the year?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Not really. I think people when they scout you, when you
get to this point, there's so much tape out there in scouting. I know you are
talking about Monica Gibbs and Whitney York, and Whitney is from that area,
Bryan-College Station.  
Both tremendous at getting to the hole. I think they're capable of getting --
people had a hard time guarding them. When they do come over to help, Amanda
has been able to step up and score, as well as Terrie has done a super job of
shooting a 3. She has done a great job of doing that. I think that's the one
thing that they do both a great job of, is getting to the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, I apologize if you have already been asked this, but just
wondering what kind of challenge Atunrase presents as a sixth person coming
off the bench bringing offense for A &M?   
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: She's tough. I mean, she can definitely sit in that
starting lineup for them. The one thing we will have to do is we're going to
have to guard her. We are going to have to get out. She is shooting the ball
very well. I noticed in the Big 12 championship she really stepped up.  
I think they're all playing well. I think their guards -- the strength of
their team is definitely their guards and their defense.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what has to happen for you team to pull off the
upset? We see it all the time in March Madness. What has to happen tomorrow?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, just a little bit like I said, I think those first
five minutes are going to be crucial. We've not been here before. We've got to
stay focused and stay under control and then immediately we've got to handle
their pressure.  
I anticipate a full-court press. We've not had problems with that all year,
but that's kind of what they like to do. So we'll be prepared for that. And
that's what we've got to handle. We cannot have 20, 25 turnovers. We've got to
have less than 10 turnovers and then we've got to rebound.  
I know they have been outrebounding people. We've done a lot better job on the
boards lately from the beginning of the year to now. And so those are the two
things that I think we have to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Going into a first tournament appearance for your school, what do you
tell your players? You want them to be excited, but you don't want them to be
overwhelmed. How do you handle that, I guess?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Well, you know, we've talked about it and one thing that
-- I noticed Amanda said after we won the Southland, we don't want it to end.
We want to come into this. We want to enjoy the moment.  
I think we've had our opportunities to enjoy those moments and we have enjoyed
them and now it is down to business. And we want to take advantage of this and
we want to come in and be very focused. And the main thing, stick with our
game plan. Not come out there and one person try to do it all. We've been very
team-oriented and that's what you worry about as a coach, one person trying to
take over the game. And we don't want to do that. We want to play as a team
defensively, especially on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Coach, did Lynn Hickey give you any advice going back to where she was
at? Did she give you any tips at all for the game tomorrow?  
COACH RIPPETOE-BLAIR: Just told me to win. That's all. Beat the Aggies is all
she told me (laughter).  
Appreciate everybody. It is a great opportunity. We feel very fortunate and we
are just glad to be in Baton Rouge.

### [Meg Dahlman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18377)

### [Rachele Fitz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18376)

### [Nikki Flores](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18378)

### [Brian Giorgis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18375)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start by introducing the three student athletes from
Marist: Meg Dahlman, Rachel Fitz and Nikki Flores and the head coach, Brian
Giorgis.  
Coach, would you like to open it up? And then we'll open it up for questions.  
COACH GIORGIS: Sure. It is great to be in warm weather in Baton Rouge. I hope
we're as good as the food. We're ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, the past few years you have been there, the program you built at
Marist, what does something like this mean not just for the athletic
department but for the Marist community to have the school in the national
spotlight like this?  
COACH GIORGIS: Well, it's obviously a dream of any coach to be able to have a
team that can get to the tournament more than once and to be three years in a
row and to get the highest seed we ever had is, you know -- you feel a
tremendous amount of pride and confidence in your players and your staff, you
know, for what they've accomplished.  
You know, we have a tremendous following with our school. It's kind of like
Little Hoosiers in Poughkeepsie, New York. And to treat them to something like
this, you know, is why you do it.  
  
Q. Just the past week of practice, how has it been, especially for the new
players, the freshmen? How have they done with the hoopla of being here?  
COACH GIORGIS: They've enjoyed it. The one thing that has been our motto, no
matter what happens, we are going to have fun doing it. We've had a lot of
fun.  
We have been serious. You know, DePaul does a lot of great things so we've had
a lot to focus on in practice. But in all our down time and stuff, I think our
kids are really enjoying themselves.  
And it is a great atmosphere here at LSU. They are still waiting to see Mike,
the Tiger, but we'll get that in at some point (laughter).  
  
Q. Speaking of the players, I was reading a story that you describe your
coach as "tough but fair." Can you give me an example of that, of the "tough"
part?   
MEG DAHLMAN: He expects a lot out of us. I don't really have an example per
se. But he expects to us do certain things; and when we're not doing our job,
he's going to yell at you. You're going to hear it because he knows your
potential.  
NIKKI FLORES: He treats everybody the same, no matter if you are one of the
starting five or you are the 12th or 13th girl coming off the bench.  
RACHELE FITZ: I just feel he is one person when you are on the court. When
you're off the court, it is a different story. I feel like on the court he is
our coach and that's what he is doing. He is coaching us and trying to make us
the best we can be.  
Off the court, he is our friend and he is there for us if we need him for
anything else outside of basketball.  
  
Q. Nikki and Meg, just being seniors, what does this whole experience mean
to you?  
NIKKI FLORES: It's great. I don't think anybody thought we could get back to
the tournament after losing Elise last year. So to be able to win max our
senior year and to be able to travel for the first round of the NCAA
tournament our senior year is a great way to start the beginning to the end, I
guess. Sorry, had to say it. (Laughter).  
MEG DAHLMAN: I know like going undefeated in our conference is -- it means a
lot to us and being able to finish it out by winning our conference
championship and then traveling, obviously, to Louisiana. It would have been
nice to go to Connecticut, have our fans there, but warm is always the better
way to go (laughter).  
So traveling down here and, you know, being a No. 7 seed means a lot. It is a
great way, as you said, beginning to the end, yeah.  
  
Q. Your last loss was to Hartford, and you're playing a Big East school.
They're playing a Big East school. Do you feel a certain kinship with schools
like that?  
COACH GIORGIS: I know myself I do because I'm good friends with Jen Rizzotti
and her assistant coach, Brian, and her husband. We talk all the time.  
A couple years they won their first tournament game against Temple and last
year we got to the Sweet 16. So we compare things in terms of the matchups. It
is kind of like this game, we get DePaul, which is great shooting team. They
get the more physical, rebounding, athletic group.  
Either way it is a Big East school that can play. And we know that, you know,
we've got to be at our best to be successful.  
  
Q. Leading up to the past week, what have you seen about DePaul? How do you
feel you are going to match up against them?  
RACHELE FITZ: They have great shooters, obviously, and they have really
physical post-players, too. So I think it will be a good matchup, and it will
give our defense a run for our money. But we're preparing for them. We're
watching film. We're doing scouts and practicing what we do and what we have
to do to win the game tomorrow.  
NIKKI FLORES: I think by film and stuff, they're a team that also likes to
run. Like us, they get the pass out real quick after you make a shot, so we've
been, like Meg said, practicing for that and preparing to maintain their speed
and work with that full court.  
  
Q. Brian, it wouldn't be a total shock in the men's tournament if a No. 7
seed made it to the Final Four. But in the women's tournament, it seems much
more difficult for anyone but the so-called top group, upper echelon teams to
make it there. Do you think for the women's to really grow, you need to see
more teams? Maybe the talent spread out a little more? And companion question
to that, do you want your team to dream to making it all the way to Tampa or
is that too much to focus on at this point?  
COACH GIORGIS: Our whole position, you know, we've been fortunate to be in
four out of the last five years. And our position has been always been the
same. We look at DePaul and that's what we look at.  
We don't talk about the next game or the game after that. You know the old
cliche "one game at a time" becomes old; but for us to be successful,
especially as a midmajor and you are going up against a BCS school, we know we
have our hands full with DePaul. They are a great program.  
Anybody that can, you know -- we can't say that we've led UConn with three
seconds to go. So when you are going up against somebody who has done that,
you know you are going up against a quality opponent. We've just focused on
DePaul. If we can get there, great. If we don't, I mean, it's been wonderful.
But we've focused solely on DePaul, and we don't think about the Final Four or
the Elite 8 or the Sweet 16 unless we're in that position to do it.  
  
Q. What about the game in general?  
COACH GIORGIS: The game in general -- in other words, is there parity as a 7
seed? I think it is a lot harder. And I think part of -- you know, it just
always seems to be that way. Is it getting closer? Personally, I don't think
so.  
You know, until women's start leaving after their sophomore year -- when
Candace Parker came in, she was going to be there for four years. If it was
like the men's side, she would be gone after a year and you would say phew. It
is a whole different recruiting school because when the big schools get a
quality, top-notch player like that, they have got her for four years.  
Until that starts to change or -- I don't know what else you can do, you know,
to change it. I have been at the high school level. I have been at the college
level and stuff, and there's just been that disparity for so long. It is
getting closer. But how soon, I don't know.  
THE MODERATOR: Is there anything, Coach, you would like to add or any of your
student athletes?  
COACH GIORGIS: Like I say, we're excited to be here. We know that we have an
extremely formidable opponent in DePaul and if you're lucky to get by that,
then you get, you know, more than likely LSU at home, not the easiest of
tasks; but we like those type of things.  
We've always been a group that talks about firsts. This group has had, you
know, a 30-win season, which was a first; to go undefeated in your conference,
which was a first.  
And, you know, last year I think we kind of shocked the world in Palo Alto. If
we can do that one more time here in Baton Rouge -- I know the Baton Rouge
people won't be happy but if we could do that, that just helps our school, you
know, and I've got a lot of confidence in these kids.

### [Erica Trahan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18392)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to welcome to Baton Rouge to the Maravich Center
and to the NCAA tournament Jackson State. We have three student athletes with
us today and, of course, the head coach. Student athletes are LaSharee
Christian, Carena Easley and Erica Trahan.  
And the head coach of Jackson State for an opening statement, and then we'll
throw it to the press for questions for head coach Denise Taylor.  
Coach Taylor, welcome.  
COACH TAYLOR: Thank you. I would like to say I am so proud of these young
ladies. They really deserve the credit. They persevered this year to get to
this point and I'm just very excited to get this opportunity to come and
represent our university and the state of Mississippi. Again, I'm just proud
of these young ladies because they have really persevered to get to this
point.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, you win your conference tournament. You know you're
going to the Dance. What happens then when you say, great, LSU in Baton Rouge,
does that take the bloom off the rose a little bit or does it get you more
psyched? How do you react?  
COACH TAYLOR: We're excited because this is only 64 teams that's still playing
and we played USC and we played Arkansas, so we have played SEC schools this
season. And we're just excited to get an opportunity to play. We know LSU is
great basketball team, but as I told the young ladies, there is one thing
about it: We have to play the game.  
So we have all the respect for LSU and, of course, Van Chancellor, who I've
known for a long time and coached against in the WNBA.  
But, again, I think these young ladies -- after we watched the Selection, they
was like, hey, let's go to practice because we had Monday off. We had arrived
back in town from our tournament and they were ready to go practice on Monday
night.  
  
Q. Do you guys, like Connecticut, the men just got beat, do you look at
things like that and say, "anything's possible right now"?   
CARENA EASLEY: I guess as any college athlete or basketball player, anything's
possible on any given day. Every game you have to play for that game and not
for the games ahead. So at the tip-off, the game is 0-0. Anybody can win the
game at the end, so ...  
ERICA TRAHAN: I would like to say personally I am excited because Baton Rouge
is my hometown. I didn't expect us to play here, but when they announced it, I
was like, okay, we are going to treat this game like any other game. Not
taking credit from LSU, they are a great team.  
But, like any given day, any team can get beat. We have to go out and play
this game like any game we have played this season.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the matchup problems, a lot of other coaches have
said Sylvia Fowles, maybe she doesn't average as many points as some other
players or as many rebounds, but she changes so many things. Is what she done
kind of unseen sometimes in terms of the stat sheet?  
COACH TAYLOR: Absolutely. She's a great player. It's going to be a total team
effort. You know, we know we won't stop her, but we certainly are going to
have a team effort and try to contain her. But she's a great player. First-
round WNBA pick. I've enjoyed watching her play and now getting an opportunity
to play against her, we look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have been on the doorstep of getting to the NCAA
tournament for so long. What is it finally like to be here? And what's this
week -- did you always imagine what it would be like and also kind of the
reality also?  
COACH TAYLOR: As a coach, that's why we get up every morning and spend 18, 20
hours in this job, is the opportunity to have this opportunity to play in the
NCAA tournament. So it is a great feeling to get this opportunity to play and
we're just excited and ready to go out on the hardwood to play.  
It has been a lot of hard work, a lot of sacrifices, a lot of dedication to
get to this point. But as a coach and as a player, that was our team goal from
the beginning of the season. It wasn't like, hey, we're going to win the SWAC.
Our goal from day one was we're going to the NCAA tournament. And that was our
goal.  
  
Q. Coach, do you want your players to visualize or dream about winning this
game? I mean, how important is that to try to make it happen? Two 7s beaten by
15 before. And in the women's tournament a 1 has lost to a 16. Those things
have happened.  
COACH TAYLOR: That's kind of been the personality of this team all year.
Nobody expected us to win, so we kind of been the underdog all season. So this
is just another step, and that's one thing we have talked about, being
mentally visualizing it, seeing it. Every game we go out and we have them
write down their goals. We put it in a cup and that's what we've done all
season.  
So absolutely, you know, we ask them to see themselves. As you say, we've seen
on television, there have been different games and 15s and 3s and 1s and 16s.
So all things are possible.  
I mean, we believe that this group has a lot of faith. They have a really
strong faith and they believe in themselves. They believe in their coaches.
And that's been the thing -- this team has been resilient all year long and
that has been the thing that has brought us to this point because they
believe, they see it. They trust. And they persevere.  
  
Q. I was wondering from the players' standpoint, like Coach said, your goal
was not to win the SWAC; it was to get here. Now you are at the NCAA
tournament. Do you find yourself reacting? Are you more nervous than you
thought you would be or do you think you would go out say, hey, we got nothing
to prove here, we can just go nuts? I'm wondering how mentally you guys are
reacting now that you are here like you always wanted?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: I think with this being my last year and how every year
we've tried to make it here and we failed, that from looking at my teammates,
I don't think we are nervous. We have played SEC teams before. We've had
packed-out gyms, two people at our crowd.  
It is probably going to be like a repeat for us, another chance to get out
there and be the SEC team. We really have -- I don't think it was more
nervousness of the team. I think we're all excited, because this is a new
experience for all of us. None of us have ever been here before. So I wouldn't
say we're nervous. I would just say we're excited about it.  
  
Q. LaSharee, have you been in the NIT before. What is different in preparing
for a NCAA tournament game? Anything Xs and Os or is it emotions? What's the
difference?  
LaSHAREE CHRISTIAN: Well, coming to the NCAA, it is more of a reward for us
because we got to win our tournament in order to get here. It is way more
emotional because, you know, we're glad to be here. It is an opportunity some
of us never experienced this before. And the WNIT was more -- we came off a
loss of parity last year, so it was kind of like a downward slide for us.  
And I would say the NCAA is ten times better than the WNIT. But, yeah, I mean,
both games, you know -- it's both playing basketball either way, but NCAA is
way more rewarding and fulfilling as for an athlete's standpoint.  
  
Q. When you look at your record, it seemed like you got off to kind of a
rocky start and then really sort of flicked a switch or you turned it around
or something after January 2nd. And when the new year came, did you think
you'd be sitting here right now tonight? What did you do to turn it around and
get here?  
ERICA TRAHAN: Well, we lost three starters last year. We lost player of the
year and we had seven new players coming in. So we knew we had to -- the new
players we had coming in had to buy into our philosophy and so we had to go
through those growing pains. As every year, we play a tough preseason schedule
and we do that to prepare this team.  
One of the things in the tournament, we play early games. We play, like, four
games in eight days and then we go to the tournament. So in scheduling, it was
a strategic plan to put this team in that situation. We played in a tournament
in California, two games. And then we traveled to Atlanta and we played. Also,
we played a tournament at Marshall; it was a 12 o'clock game, which those are
the times that we played in the tournament.  
So a part of our preseason schedule was to prepare us for this point in the
season.  
  
Q. Coach, what jumps out at you on film about Quianna Chaney?  
COACH TAYLOR: She shoots the 3-point very well. She is 42 percent free throw
shooter. She is quick, very athletic. She is a great guard.  
I just wanted to finish answering the question about the team and how it
changed from December to January to February. Each year we -- each month we
improved and we bought into it defensively that defense wins championships.
When we went on that winning streak, we were holding teams 50, 52, 53 points.
And so this team really bought into our system and bought into our philosophy.
And then they gelled and grew as a team. I think that was the difference,
like, each month we got better and that was the reason why.  
Again, we are just excited to be here. The NCAA is a first-class operation. We
had a great welcome coming to the hotel, and we're hoping to go out and
represent Jackson State and represent the state of Mississippi and we just ask
our young ladies to go out and give their best and leave it all out on the
floor. We wanted to congratulate everybody who has made it to this point.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have from LSU student athletes Erica White, Quianna Chaney
and Sylvia Fowles and the head coach of the LSU Tigers, Coach Van Chancellor.  
Coach, would you like to open the press conference and then we'll go to
questions.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We are thrilled to be hosting these eight teams.  
Take the questions for the players. That's what we're all about.  
  
Q. For the girls, I guess, try not to be as brief as your coach, talk about
your thoughts heading into the start of play here. Are you excited to be here?
Are you happy to see these other teams come in and know you have the home-
court advantage?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I know from me personally, I am happy to be here. I can speak
for the same for the teammates, just to be hosting these two games -- these
last two games our last time here at LSU, I think is a thrill. I will get a
kick out of it.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Sylvia. It is exciting. I can't wait for it to
get kicked off.  
ERICA WHITE: I am excited as well, and just happy for the area, the fact that
we get to host these games is good for our fans. It is good for this area to
see such good basketball and I'm really happy that we can be a part of it and
be the host.  
I think everyone is doing a great job. You know, so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Coach, you don't have any pull to get this game tipped off a little
earlier? What's up with 9:30? Does that make things more difficult to plan
for?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I said since I came to LSU I have not let age be in my
thought process. But when I was 44 years old, 9:30 at night was late. And at
64 years old, it is real late. I will probably come to the arena at halftime
of the first game to take a little nap so I can get ready to play in the
second game.  
I would like to have played at 11:00 tomorrow and get it over with and I don't
have to worry with it all day. I will say this, I did T.V. last year, I had
this team in Austin, Texas. T.V. is just like taking candy away from a baby.
It's easy. There is no pressure on you.  
Coaching, at LSU, they don't want you to win but all the games. They are with
you win or tie on the other ones. Just remember that.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It is a big adjustment for us because it is kind of late. We
just got to keep ourself occupied throughout the day. But the time, I don't
think it's going to be that big of an issue.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: 9:30 at night is perfect for players. That's when they go
out when they are not playing ball. Are you kidding me? Let's get serious. It
takes them all of that time to get ready to go out.  
You didn't know I knew that, did you, Q? I coached pro players. You forgot,
that didn't you?  
  
Q. How do you structure the day with the game being so late?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't know yet. I guess I will see tomorrow. But just try to
keep myself occupied. I mean, I know me, personally, I like to think a lot
about the game and that's not always a good thing for me. So I will probably
do something that I like doing, just to relax me for a while.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: For me, it would be the normal game-day routine, just extend
it a little bit longer.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You got a thought, Erica? You had a thought about everything
else all year; you ought to have a thought about this.  
ERICA WHITE: Thanks, Coach. We will have early-morning shoot-around. Probably
get lunch together as a team. For me, personally, just get back to my room and
probably watch some basketball, get some rest, get off my feet. You know,
probably take a little nap, like Coach said, and get up about 7:00 -- no, no,
no. I will probably head over here and watch some basketball all day. So I
will be in the stands all day. Just be ready to play at 9:00.  
  
Q. Quianna, there was a lot of talk about this when you played your last
regular season home season. But this really is coming down to the end, this is
the last weekend. Your thoughts are a lot on the NCAA tournament and trying to
advance, but are there some thoughts about this is really the last couple of
games here at LSU for you?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I guess -- I mean, I am not trying to think about it like
that. I am just going to go out there and enjoy myself. If you look at it, it
is going to be the last couple games we have here. So, I mean, just going to
go out there and have fun and play the game of basketball like it is supposed
to be played.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Q is not thinking about any of that, Scott. She is thinking
about where her next shot's coming from. You don't know Q that well. She ain't
thought about any of that.  
You know that's true, Sylvia, too.  
  
Q. You're seniors, you've been 1 or 2 seed every time, you've won these
opening round games pretty easily. You just come off an intense SEC conference
and tournament. You look ahead to the tournament. How do you get yourself
focused and so forth for a game that from the outside would look like you are
supposed to win by 30 or 40 points?  
ERICA WHITE: You get focused, because this team knows it is not about our
opponent and it is usually about us and how we play. You want to come out and
play good basketball tomorrow regardless as to who the opponent is because you
want to build that momentum throughout the tournament. That's the focus
tomorrow, to come out and play hard, play smart and play good basketball so it
will carry over game to game.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I kind of agree with Erica, too. Then you got to think about
our opponent. They are going to come out and play hard, they ain't going to
give up without a fight. So we looking forward to them coming out with a lot
of energy and be ready to play. So it is not like you overlooked the opponent,
but you got to be ready for everything that they throw at you.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with both of these ladies. Everybody is going to come
out and try to play their best, so you just got to be focused and go out there
and play.  
  
Q. Obviously in practice you are doing game awareness, clock management-type
drills, and that's been important in the bigger games you've played. Talk
about the focus on that and maybe not tore tomorrow but for the rest of the
tournament. Did you see it pay off?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: When we came back from the SEC tournament, we thought we'd
have ten practices, days off and different things. We've had game situations
every day. I think practice at this time of year, when you have off that much
can become monotonous, and especially with eight seniors. They've been down
here, done that. There's not one drill they ain't run 1,336 times. So they get
tired of it.  
So we tried to put in a lot of -- be up one with two minutes to go or be down
three with 17 seconds to go and see who could win the game. I thought that has
gone really, really well for us. I've really -- I think our team has learned
-- if I had anything, I probably would have -- I did some of it before. I
should have done more of it before. I thought during this time it worked out
really well.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree with Coach. Several times, couple games I had a chance
to either do a couple things at the end of the game and either shot the ball
too early and just wasn't -- decision-making was poorly. It was a good chance
to really see -- practice on it and see what the clock difference and just
work on the things like that. It was a pretty good idea.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, Coach, what you do -- like Ted was saying, these guys have
been so good for so long. Now right when you are about to play, ESPN says on
Selection night that they think LSU should be No. 1. And I go home, there's my
"Sports Illustrated" and there is a huge color page photo of Sylvia and a
picture of Q. Wouldn't it be easy for them to skate this weekend and look to
New Orleans?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: You know, the great advantage of playing at home -- I think
there is an advantage. The great advantage is your fans won't let you do that.
These fans are so rabid and interested in this team.  
And this team is not -- you go back and look at it, they played 14 times in
the SEC, it beat one team 50. It beat one team 41. It beat three teams more
than 30. And in those games we played everybody.  
The last problem that LSU women's basketball team is -- is to overlook
somebody. This is the most serious-minded team I've ever seen. I don't think
they'll overlook anyone. We've not had a game that I thought overlooking them
was a problem all year. We beat some teams really bad. We beat Ole Miss in the
SEC tournament after beating them here pretty good in the tournament. And
usually that doesn't happen.  
They are going to play Saturday night. They're going to play -- if they win
that game, they'll play again. They're just going to play. Just that mind-set.
They have the greatest mind-set of any team I have ever been around.  
I would like for them to have a little more fun, but I've tried all year and
that's not -- it's working to a degree, but it's a great team to be around
every day. They're going to practice today like it was the first day of
practice. They will practice for 50 minutes today. I guarantee you that.
They're going to practice hard. They will going to shoot around hard tomorrow
for 20 minutes. They don't do anything they don't do pretty hard.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the time off of the SEC game and this tournament.
You were out of the college game for so long, are there things that you are
still learning, having to come back as memory from the past experience this
year? Something like that, along that line?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It don't seem like it was as long as you seem to think it
was, okay? I don't mean that bad. It seems like it was yesterday.  
As far as the college experience, that kind of come back like if you hadn't
ridden a bike in ten years. I just jumped on the bike and started riding. The
only thing I had any trouble with was just learning this team offensively. I
left it alone defensively. I just experimented with some things, and I think
that cost us the Rutgers game, in my mind, I really do. I went with some
things that I should not have changed, I went back and rechanged.  
But as far as coming in here and being all -- I thought the best thing that
had ever happened to me at Ole Miss was the two weeks off. We had to just
struggle so hard to make it, to get in the tournament. We weren't like LSU. We
didn't have these three players all the time.  
So when we got in, we would take days off and I thought this time off just
regenerated my energy. I just loved this two weeks off. A lot of coaches gripe
about not playing. I think it is the greatest thing I could do.  
By tomorrow night, these players will have practiced so much, they will be
ready tomorrow night. Don't worry about that. I like it. It rests you. You get
to study the other teams. You get to feel better. The season -- coaching in
the SEC just drags on you. Night after night you got to go to Knoxville, you
got to play there. You got to go to Georgia, you got to play Vandy. That will
wear on you. So the two weeks off where you can prepare and don't have to play
a game is really good.  
  
Q. Girls, can you talk about this, and then, Van, I want your thoughts, your
senior season, the eight of you have been together for so long. You have been
through so much, had so much success. Along comes a 64-year-old guy, kind of
ruining --  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I was 63 at the time. I thought I would tell you.  
  
Q. Just talk about him fitting in and how did he find his way in, because
obviously with the eight of you all going through so much, you are pretty
tight. You said the year has been special because of the closeness you have
found. Talk about letting him in. And then, Van, talk about finding your way
through the waters?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You don't have to lie much, much.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It wasn't hard adjusting to him and the things that he wanted
within this program. I can remember the first time I came back from New York,
just during the tryout thing with the USA team and my first time meeting him
and everything. He explained to us what he wanted to do.  
But for the most part, I don't adjusting to him. He adjusted to us. He is not
all that kind of lame. He is a good dude. He is funny. He keep us rolling.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Like she said, he fits right in, us adjusting to him. I think
he is a good thing that has happened to this program to have Coach Chancellor
here. It has been wonderful thus far. This is a good team.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You better say something good with as much shots as I've got
you this year. Those other two, I could have understood it if they would have
held back. But I've got you every shot you could humanly get. You are firing
electrically from anywhere.  
ERICA WHITE: Coach Chancellor is a genuine guy from the day he got here. He
met with all of us individually and told us where he wanted to take the
program and what he thought we needed to do to better ourselves and to take
this program to another level. That's what he keeps saying, he wants to take
this program to another level.  
He fit right in because he was so genuine. He knew about us from day one. He
watched a lot of film on us and he is just a real caring guy. So he was great
for our group from day one.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Going back, one of the reasons I didn't have as much
adjustment to the college game -- to your question -- I did T.V. for two
people for Fox and ESPN at this time. So I was around the college game all the
time, and I did the SEC tournament. Then I was doing this team in Austin,
Texas, at this time last year, never dreaming I would be here today. I thought
I would be on a golf course.  
  
Q. Sylvia, you said on media day, though, you guys sometimes couldn't
understand him and that he once lost his temper and made you guys run
suicides. You were all looking at each other and going, we don't even know
what you said.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: This was at camp. We did camp in the summer. He told us to
demonstrate and get up to the campus. We didn't understand or react too
quickly and he did make us run in front of the campus. It has gotten better.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Sylvia, you might not be telling them in front of the NCAA
person. I'm not sure about that.  
  
Q. Erica, I was wondering about your toe and RaShonta's ankle seems a little
tweaked. How are you guys physically going into the tournament?  
ERICA WHITE: I'm fine. The injury I got in the tournament was this injury that
I needed a rest and I got a lot of rest last week. This week was testing a lot
of different things out in my shoe to make sure my toe was comfortable. I am
at about 90 percent. I am feeling good and happy that I was able to get that
rest last week and I feel better now.  
I am definitely ready to play, and I'm sure our trainer, Mickey, is doing a
great job of taking care of RaShonta's as well. I think we are both fine right
now.  
  
Q. Q, talk about what Coach was saying about the number of shots you've
gotten this year. How fun has that been and how much has that improved your
game?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I'm going to start with the confidence Coach gave me. When
first got here, he was, like, you know, you need to have the confidence you
are the best shooter in the SEC and all that type of stuff.  
Once I got the confidence thing down pat and got in the gym and try to shot
some shoots pretty early before practice and after practice, it came pretty
easily.  
With the changes he changed in the motion offense, I was able to get shots.
It's cool, I guess.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: That's the thing about Coach Chancellor, his energy level is
outrageous. He will tell you everything you want to hear to make you think you
are that thang. I think that's what he did with Q. That's why she takes as
many shots as she does.  
  
Q. Q., how did you feel about the break you y'all had?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: It was wonderful. Like Erica said, get a chance to relax with
her toe and take care of the minor things, minor aches and pains our team had.  
It was a good chance to sit back and work on the things we needed to work on
and watch a couple tapes and watch film and see what we need to work on. It
was pretty good. It was nice.  
  
Q. Do you ever just stop and, I can't believe she is shooting from there?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: No. I remember my first time meeting Q. We was at McDonald's
All-American. She got in the bleachers and she went, like, five rows up and
she was like, I bet I can make this shot. I was like, Q, you cannot shoot that
far. That was our first time meeting each other. And she shot the ball and I
ran out of the gym. I said this girl did not just shoot this ball.  
But that's Q. She does it all the time and she challenges herself. It is not a
surprise to us.  
  
Q. Did it go in?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yes.  
ERICA WHITE: It is no surprise Q pull it from long range. Usually I miss it, I
am throwing the pass. She shoots the ball so quick, I just see it going
through the net. I never really get to check where her feet are. I get to the
bench and my teammates are like, did you see what she shot?  
It is no surprise to me. She just puts it up and it usually goes in.  
  
Q. Didn't y'all practice cutting down the nets for the Final Four coming up
this year? Didn't y'all do that? It leads to my question, how long has it been
a mind-set of trying to get there and get forward, not just with this first
game, a lot of teams focus on the first game. You guys have won first games,
second, third, fourth game. How much is it part of the mind-set of getting
into the tournament and getting all the way this time?  
ERICA WHITE: Coach is a winner, he's proven that, WNBA and USA Basketball. I
think the first day he got here, like I said, he has been focused on us taking
us to the next level. Championship is the next level he is talking about.  
Like he said, from day one, he got here we cut down the nets as a team. He
said, we won't do that again unless we are cutting down the nets for the
national championship.  
In that moment he was trying to instill in us a mentality that we're here to
win this from day one. And every year, we win the regional -- we win our
regional game and we cut down the nets and we celebrate. And I pray that we
win this year. But we probably won't cut down that net. We're looking for a
national championship net this time around.  
So I think he is just trying to change our mentality about winning.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS: BATON

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Allie Quigley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18383)

### [Caprice Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18384)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's welcome our representatives from DePaul University. Our
student athletes are Allie Quigley, Missy Mitidiero, and Caprice Smith. And
the head coach for Marist, welcome to Baton Rouge and to the NCAA tournament,
Doug Bruno.  
Coach, would you like to open up and we'll go from there?  
COACH BRUNO: Somebody asked me the other day where's Marist? In Chicago,
somebody told me that. And I said, "115th and Pulaski." And I said -- That's
where Marist High School is.  
I knew it was in New York, but I wasn't sure where Poughkeepsie was. But I am
very sure that Marist is a great basketball team. The players that return --
very rarely when you prepare for a NCAA tournament can you prepare by starting
with last year's tournament games. And, yet, the experience in which this
Marist team didn't just beat Ohio State but they really kick's Ohio State's
butt pretty good last year and they kicked Middle Tennessee's butt pretty good
last year and all those players are back with that experience.  
This is just an excellent Marist basketball team. We are excited to be in the
NCAA. We are fired up to have the opportunity to play. But, boy, we really
understand just how good this Marist team is.  
  
Q. Rachele Fitz has given MAAC teams literally fits all season long. What
have you seen on her on tape and what are your thoughts on what you've seen?  
COACH BRUNO: She is an excellent basketball layer, well-deserving of her MAAC
player of the year status. She is a classic example of don't be deceived by
the looks because she's got those long arms. She's just got an uncanny ability
to get the ball to the basket and into the basket and just an excellent
player.  
We coached a player that was a three-time All-American a couple years ago
named Kyra Smith. Kyra didn't exactly look great in an airport, but she just
did it on the floor. And that's exactly what Rachele Fitz does. She is an
unbelievably productive, inside basketball player. She is not the only inside
one they got either. Dahlman and Smrdel are also excellent inside players.  
  
Q. Allie, when you were a freshman, DePaul was in its last season in
Conference USA. How much of an upgrade in the competition level have you seen
being in the Big East?  
ALLIE QUIGLEY: It was definitely, like you said, an upgrade in competition.
Every single game is you got to bring your game no matter what. From the
bottom to the top, you never know what's going to happen in the Big East. If
anything, it made us better and I think it made all the teams in the Big East
better just to have the better competition. So ...  
  
Q. Coach, your team coming in here -- the great game y'all had against UConn
at home towards the end of the year where you came up just a little bit short
playing a team like UConn, number one in the country, the No. 1 overall seed,
what have you taken from that game that maybe has helped you build, even
though you are in the Big East conference with them but a close call against
them in that type of game towards the end of the year? How does your team
build on that coming into the tournament?  
COACH BRUNO: I believe that game did give our team confidence. I think our
very tough end-of-season conference schedule was -- we looked at it coming
down the stretch. We had six games to play regular season, and those six games
included at No. 11 West Virginia, at Georgetown -- and Georgetown would be in
the NIT if they had made our tournament. That's how good Georgetown is playing
right now.  
At Rutgers -- Notre Dame was No. 14 at home. At Rutgers in the game in which
Coach Stringer was playing for Number 800; UConn at home; and at Seton Hall.
And we approached the team and said we can look at this as a death march or an
opportunity march. There aren't going to be six games in the NCAA tournament
that are going to be a lot tougher than that.  
So I think the West Virginia win at West Virginia kicked it off, and I think
all six of those games have given us confidence. One of the big criteria about
the NCAA which you see people write -- and I think the committee says they
look at -- is how you finish at the end of the year.  
If you look at our record at the end of the year, we didn't finish with a
glowing record from a numbers point of view. But just to the point of your
question, I think we did play our best ball down the stretch of the season and
the beast that is the Big East didn't let that exactly be a great record. But
I think the confidence gained by the UConn game in that stretch should have us
prepared.  
Then we went to the Big East tournament and had to play a very good Marquette
team and beat them to get into the tournament and another UConn again a week
later. So you talk about those eight games, and I just really think they
should have us prepared. Every game has a life of its own, however. Just
because we did that, played that, Marist is -- the Marist game is going to
have its own life here tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, there seems to be certainly more parity in the men's game, the
men's tournament, than the women's tournament. Do you think for the women's
game to grow, as I'm sure people like you who have been it in a long time
would like to see in grow in terms of popularity, you have to get away from it
being Tennessee or UConn all the time? Or maybe those people get more
attention than they should? What are your thoughts on that?  
COACH BRUNO: I believe we are reaching parity; and at the same time, this
season, you know, it really didn't -- UConn just did have a great year and
that's after losing two players.  
But I think the game is reaching -- is becoming a much more equal game. It is
-- there are more players and all the players can't go to just a couple
schools. The game itself is improving from top to bottom. So I just really do
think that they're -- the parity is coming into the game, and I think it will
continue to just get better as the game continues to grow. As the young women
start playing, it grows exponentially every single year.  
I can't deny the fact that there is a couple dominant teams here this year,
but at the same time I think everybody -- look at this opponent of ours, this
Marist team. I mean, it is just an unbelievably great job they're doing at
Marist. They're just an example of a team that's put themselves in the top 16
just one year ago. These three players here went to the Sweet 16 two years
ago; and, you know, I think that speaks to the parity right there.  
  
Q. Caprice, Coach kidded a little bit about not knowing where Marist is.
When you do play in a major conference like that and your opponent here in the
tournament is one school that you don't know much about, how long does it take
you to familiarize -- put it the other way, do you forget about all that once
you get into the preparation and so forth for the team and respect what
they're doing out on the court and what they can do?  
CAPRICE SMITH: The first thing that popped into my head when I heard we were
playing Marist was watching the game they play last year in the NCAA
tournament. They were a Cinderella team. I think they took their momentum from
last season and stepped it up this year and went on a great 22-game winning
streak.  
So we can't take for granted anybody's conference. We just know that they're a
great basketball team and they're ranked and we're not. We just got to go into
the game with a chip on our shoulder because we're the lower seed.  
COACH BRUNO: If they can dominate Jessica Davenport the way -- Marist
dominated Jessica Davenport a year ago. That's a State Farm All-American --
still getting used to Kodak not being here -- a State Farm All-American top
ten player in the country and Marist dominated her. It wasn't a lucky game
plan. They dominated her.  
  
Q. Coach, do you allow your team to visualize or talk about making it to the
Final Four or is this something you try to stay away from? Having that dream
of making that run that everybody wants to make?  
COACH BRUNO: You can't achieve what you don't see. But once you get here, it's
a one-in-a-row, six-time tournament. You can't get there without the focus of
one in a row. I mean, there's no way we can be sitting -- we have not even
looked at, none of us, no coach, has even looked at an LSU tape.  
Again, please forgive me, Denise Taylor, Jackson State, all right? I don't
want to assume that.  
But, again, none of us have even looked at one tape. That's how important the
one-in-a-row factor is here in this tournament. All's we've looked at is this
great team. Marist is a great -- it is a quintessential basketball team. They
play basketball the way basketball is supposed to be played; the way they
share, the way they -- they just make the extra pass; the way they have
inside-outside balance.  
And the other aspect of Marist is they don't -- when you don't have a player
as dominant as Sylvia Fowles or Candace Parker, at first glance -- or Mya
Moore or some of the great players in our league, at first glance, they might
appear not to look at that level. But when you study and continue to study,
this is an excellent basketball team and they're just -- they just play so
well together.  
I want to thank everybody, thank the committee members who are here, for all
the hard work you do to put this tournament together and just thank the media
for covering women's basketball. The question about parity and getting more
people -- getting the game covered is great.  
Ted, it is great to see you again even though we don't come down here to play
Tulane every year. It is still nice to see you down here.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our head coach of Texas A&M, welcome to Baton Rouge, Coach Gary
Blair.  
Do you have any opening comments about your team and your visit here to the
NCAA?  
COACH BLAIR: First, it is great to be back in Baton Rouge. It's been 03' since
I coached Arkansas and used to come back to play Coach Gardner. And we had a
great, great ten-year rivalry. And then eight years of Stephen F., when I
coached there.  
And Coach Gardner said, Gary, you need to come bash to Steven F. Austin. Coach
Gardner has meant so much to me being a mentor in my program. She coached my
first all-American at Steven F. Austin, Barbara Brown played for me in high
school, so Coach Gardner has meant the world to me.  
It is great to be back here. The weather is good. These three young ladies up
here, they're very, very special to me. And this is the Texas girl, the little
one that would remind you of your Erica White or Temeka Johnson that played
here at LSU. She is 5' 3", a pistol. A very, very good point guard that knows
what leadership and running a team is all about.  
LaToya, Micheaux, I believe your dad was born in Louisiana, or your mom?  
LATOYA MICHEAUX: My mom.  
COACH BLAIR: She's gonna have a lot of relatives. She is from Houston, her dad
played for Phi Slama Jama, the great teams at University of Houston back in
the day. And she is one of the best defensive players in the country, and I'm
just proud to have her.  
The next young lady is from Shreveport, Morenike Atunrase. Played for
Southwood High School. Won a number of championships there. She is a kid
that's been injured for about the last year, but she is back full strength now
and is playing very well down the stretch.  
We're happy to be here. We're a 2 seed. The highest Texas A&M has ever been,
the highest I've ever been as a coach, I believe. I haven't checked the
records. We feel like we got a fair -- very, very fair seeding. And we're
happy that we're only five hours away from College Station-Bryan area driving-
wise, and then five hours away from Oklahoma City if we could advance to the
next round.  
So we're excited to be here. I think the field is good. I think the committee
did one of their best jobs at getting the right 64 teams in, and they've
spread them out geographically, I think, very well.  
So we are hoping to win a few ball games here, and we'll be eating at Mike
Anderson's tonight. So I know where the restaurants are. We were at TJ Ribs
last night.  
  
Q. Coach Blair, I would like you and A'Quonesia to answer this. You have
momentum going in. That's all we're hearing on the national media. What are we
going to see out there on the court? Can we keep that 13 out of 14 going?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Yes. We have a lot of momentum coming into this game,
coming off a tournament championship. Before that, winning our last four
conference games, which were huge games for us.  
We have a lot of momentum coming into our first game against UTSA, and we are
just going to keep what we have been doing, basically playing intense defense
and creating offense off of our defense.  
COACH BLAIR: Momentum is a beautiful word. I cannot think of a word momentum
whether I am in a golf match or you're a NASCAR racer or basketball or
football or whatever, it's a beautiful word. And we have tremendous momentum
going right now, but I think we have tremendous leadership and chemistry and a
hunger right now.  
The first year that we went to Trenton, New Jersey, I think we were just happy
to be there, looking at the skyscrapers of New York City and going to ESPN
Zone and Times Square and all of that type of stuff.  
I didn't do a good enough job as a coach on having my team ready.  
When we went to Los Angeles last year, we faced a team that was equally as
good as us in the second round, and that was George Washington, and they
outplayed us.  
This year our team realizes the significance, the importance first of being a
No. 2 seed and living up to that, that the committee said the Big 12 should
have that No. 2 seed.  
And we feel, one, it's an honor. Two, we want to represent that 2 seed for our
whole conference. In years to come, if you've had a run like us, you should be
rewarded at the end, even if you were not round-robin conference champions but
you were tournament champions.  
I love my basketball team right now. We want to play our way through. We are
not Cinderella where we've been in years past. We're just a good, hard-working
basketball team that we're going to face some very, very good teams here. We
want to use that word, "momentum," and just keep going.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any comments from any of the student athletes that came
with you? Question here.  
  
Q. Coach, and I guess for the players, go ahead and break down UTSA for us
and what can we expect to see tomorrow?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, I love the coach's last name, Blair. That's first. We go
back a long way. Rae Rippetoe-Blair, when I was at Arkansas and she was at
Oklahoma State, she had done a tremendous job.  
I think we're intertwined so much because Lynn Hickey is the former coach at
Texas A&M when I was at Steven F. Austin, that more or less is really the
architect of the Texas A&M program.  
I mean, there's been other coaches since, but she's the one that's really
built the program and took it to a Sweet 16, I believe, in '96. You are
looking at a point guard, Whitney York, that has been to our camps a number of
time. She would go in there and do an excellent job against us.  
But last year, we had already had our mind made up on Sydney Colson and we
didn't need an extra point guard. Amber Gregg is another young lady that has
been to a number of our camps. Amanda Foster is a kid we played against. She
was at Oklahoma State and then transferred to get a little bit more playing
time.  
Coach Luby, the assistant coach, used to be at A&M with Coach Hickey. I am not
sure if she was with Coach Harvey or not. The schools are very close.  
I am a product of the Southland Conference. Ms. Donahoe right over there is a
product of the Southland Conference. We're very proud of our roots, but we
will never, never underestimate a Southland Conference school. Because when we
coach there, some teams underestimated us and we would beat their butts, okay?
And it's not going to happen here.  
UT-San Antonio is has an excellent school. They have earned their way. They
won 23 ball games. I liked their style. They are very similar to the UTA team
we faced last year. They might not be as good defensively as UTA was last
year, but they're better offensively because they have a lot more balance.  
They have two left-handed guards, and we are going to have to get used to that
because we can't simulate that in practice. The only left-hander we have has
an ACL injury and can't play. We're not used to going against two lefties out
there.  
  
Q. For Coach, for Morenike, can you just talk about Morenike's role, the
come-back and especially the boost she's given you now in the second half of
the season.  
COACH BLAIR: Chuck, I would like for you to send this to your managing editor
there at the Dallas Morning News. There is no reason that the Dallas Morning
News should not be delivered in College Station-Bryan anymore. I'm serious
about that. I read five a day, and I don't know how to use a computer to pull
you up online. So we need it delivered back.  
Okay. Work on that. I mean -- I'm serious as can be. It is just a small piece
of heaven that I like. I want my Dallas Morning News, since I used to throw
the Dallas Times Herald as a kid growing up.  
Morenike, she was the face of the basketball team her freshman and her
sophomore years. First, once everybody learned how to pronounce her name, it
just sort of flowed like she did. She was like a deer running through a
basketball court. She's the most well-conditioned athlete that I've ever had a
chance to coach.  
The game came easy to her as far as the conditioning part and running and just
being able to make plays. The fundamentals of the game, we're still teaching
her, even sometimes now as a senior. She's getting better and better.  
At the junior year and now as a senior, how many athletes could come back and
accept the role of coming off the bench? Accept the role of saying, hey, our
starting five's pretty good even though you were freshman of the year and you
were All-Big 12 First Team and you won the John Wooten list.  
The other player I can think of that accepted that role is a couple years ago
when Cappie Pondexter did that from Rutgers. But her role wasn't like hers
coming off injuries. This kid has had three different significant injuries in
a period of 12 months. And she's come back from them like a champion. She's
playing as good as she was when she was a sophomore. She's going to get better
and better.  
But no one in the country has a sixth man that can come off like she can and
produce.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: Following Coach Blair, I would just like to say, it has
been -- well, last season was different for me. I had to go about it a
different way, and being a basketball player, but this season I have learned
how to do that with the help of Coach Blair and the rest of our coaching
staff.  
But I think that injuries do help you in the long run. Everyone doesn't go
injury-free throughout their season. I think it's something that I have had to
adjust to. I have learned how to accept my role. I have no problem coming off
the bench and just playing my part. Everyone on the team has a different part,
so I look at my role on, I guess, the defense is just rebounding, getting the
little boards and blocking shots like I've always done in my career.  
  
Q. Morenike, can you talk about the significance of playing back in
Louisiana? Does that hold anything for you?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: It is nice to finally come back home after four years. I
have a lot of family here. New Orleans and Shreveport and I look forward to
that. I have also played here my senior year in the all-star game. So it's fun
to be back home.  
  
Q. LaToya, how much of your family will be here for the game? Second of all,
you look at the No. 2 seeds in the tournament, LSU have been to four straight
Final Fours, Rutgers won the National Title game last year, Stanford has won a
couple of national titles, and Texas A &M. Do you have to make yourselves
believe that you belong in that group and have the confidence to advance like
the other teams expect you to advance? Or is that already instilled from the
Big 12 tournament or from what you did last year? Where does the confidence
come from and how important is that?   
LATOYA MICHEAUX: I don't think that we necessarily believe. We already do
believe. We're here. We made that step by coming -- we won the championship
last year and we just won our tournament championship. I think that the
confidence of this team with the momentum is sky high.  
And you just have to take the game by game and hopefully we'll get to that
Final Four and get to that championship. I think right now the focus is on
UTSA and then we can look forward after we get a victory with that.  
To answer your question on the family, I'm looking at about 25 right now
coming through. A lot from Franklin and New Orleans. It is just my mom's side,
her family.  
  
Q. Ladies, this run has been really -- your defense has been out there.
Obviously Coach Schaefer handles the defense. Coach Blair handles the offense.
I wonder if you ladies could tell me how is it playing for each of them?
What's the difference between Coach Blair and Coach Schaefer? Give me your
synopsis, please.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Yes. Like Coach said, it is like night and day. Coach
Blair, he's soft. He's a sweet guy. Coach Schaefer is just -- he's hard-nosed.
He's so adamant about everything that he does, especially on defense. And he
wants things perfect and try to play perfect.  
Coach Blair will go ahead and let us slip away with little mistakes here and
there. He is the one that will pat you on your back. If you can just pay
attention when you come out of the game and look at Coach Schaefer and see his
actions, there's nothing negative about it. He loves the game and he wears his
passion on his shoulders. That's one thing I like about him.  
And Coach Blair, he is the head coach. He is over everything. And I just think
that they play a good role. Like I said, night and day.  
COACH BLAIR: I think a good comparison would be Chancellor and Bob Starkey.
I'm probably closer to Chancellor, not just because of our age but because of
how we talk. I mean, I think we both went to the Dale Brown school of BS, but
we're very similar. We've got a story to tell. We've got kids to coach. We've
got kids to love. And that's what we do.  
I'm looking forward to next year -- correct me if I'm wrong -- seeing that the
tournament will be held a week later. Is it next year? I think for the growth
of women's basketball, particularly in the media, I was reading an article in
there yesterday that they wanted us in the same dog-gone city. We're not a
stepchild of the men's game. We are -- we can carry ourselves.  
I'm looking forward to going back to the 16 sites while we're still in the
growth stages of building fans and attendance even though it is a huge
advantage for the team that does host.  
But I am looking forward to going to the weekend afterwards. People say, well,
how can you compete against the Masters? The last time I played golf, I played
golf in the daytime. So we can compete against the Masters. We can compete
against anything because women's basketball is the fastest growing big sport.
You had over 110 schools that had crowds of -- not 110 schools, 110 games that
had crowds of over 9,000 at their game this we are. Wisconsin does that. You
can pull it up on the Web.  
But that's mind boggling. Compared to when I coached at Louisiana Tech, there
might have been three crowds in the '80s over 9,000 in a regular season. And
we had over 110. It is going to continue to grow.  
I am just glad to be a part of it. Our product is in good hands, but we need
to tweak it a little to make sure it grows in the right way and the stories
need to be about the student athletes, not about us coaches when we screw up.
It needs to be about the student athletes and all the great human-interest
stories there are out there, including these three up here.  
So hopefully we'll continue to grow the right way and the media will report
the story instead of looking for the negative.  
Thank you, y'all.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 8, 2008

  

### [Jayne Appel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18464)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Candice Wiggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18463)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined up here on the podium by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, as well as student-athletes Candice Wiggins and Jayne Appel.  
Following a brief opening statement, we'll entertain questions for the
student-athletes for probably about eight minutes, and at that point we'll let
them go back to the locker room and take questions for Coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First I want to compliment and congratulate Tennessee on a
national championship. And I thought they came out, they were extremely
aggressive, and they were a very physical team.  
And, secondly, I'd like to compliment and congratulate Stanford and Jayne and
Candice for a fabulous season, playing their hearts out. Doing the very best
they could and taking us to the Final Four and this championship game.  
The game itself was I don't think indicative of the great season we've had. We
did not play well. We did not handle the pressure well. Obviously the
turnovers absolutely killed us.  
But I'm so proud of Candice and so proud of Jayne and just really enjoyed
working with this team all year. And it doesn't change tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Again, questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice and Jayne, how did you guys feel going into the game? Tennessee
came out really aggressive. Did you guys feel like energy-wise you were in
good shape and they just really came at you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, we knew they were going to be pressuring us and
that's their style of play. They really rely a lot on their defense to get
them going. And they're big. They're in passing lanes. So you can't have any
sloppy passes. And I think that's what happened in the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Candice, no matter what you guys tried, you didn't seem to have an
answer. You had trouble getting the ball in bounds. Had trouble -- back on
your heels against the press. Is that as ferocious as a defensive effort as
anybody has thrown at you this season?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: They were just as aggressive when we played them in December.
But I think the national championship is at stake. Of course, they're going to
be, go really hard and go all out. You have Nicky in the top and she's just
really big at the top of the press and really aggressive.  
  
Q. Candice, can you talk about it's over, your career's over and how you
feel emotionally?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I don't think it maybe has set in yet. But I just know that I
told the guys in the locker room that I couldn't be any prouder of them. I
wouldn't want to be on any other team in the country, any other team. And it
happens that we ended our season with a loss and that hurts. Because we wanted
it. And this team is a special team. And just beautiful people. And I've been
so honored just to be on this team.  
So I think it maybe hasn't quite hit me yet. But I think we should celebrate
our season. I think to win the way we did, we did it right, and I'm so proud
of this group.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk a little bit about the pressure and what was going on
in the post and how you think you guys responded offensively things weren't
clicking like they had been clicking like in games coming into this?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we just had a tough time matching up with their size and
the back court with Nicky, like Candice said up front is really tough.  
They're a really very athletic team and I thought we hung with them until they
made a little run. They got up 9 or 10 on us. We stuck with them I think with
that 9 or 10 gap for pretty much the rest of the game until the end. So I
think we were just kind of playing catch-up since that run.  
  
Q. This is for both of you ladies. I know this is a fresh, tough loss.
Candice, you mentioned it was a little bit -- you were seeing turnovers and
sloppy passes. Where do you think the breakdown happened in this game? It
doesn't seem indicative of your last 23 wins. What do you think was the
breakdown?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think just really aggressive. They were jumping, they were
in passing lanes. You have to credit their defense. And usually when people
are pressuring you you have to be able to get by them. I think we didn't
really start attacking the pressure until later in the game. I think it would
have really helped us if we started attacking maybe a little bit earlier.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you follow up on that?  
JAYNE APPEL: I feel the same way in the sense that we needed to attack them a
little bit more and take it to the basket. And obviously break their press,
first of all. And I think that was just -- they were very aggressive coming
out and we didn't have much to counter it.  
  
Q. Candice, to what degree do you think there were missed shots, missed
opportunities?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think looking at shooting percentage, it was not a terrible
shooting night, but I just think we were not really -- we didn't really have
-- our tempo wasn't in our favor. It wasn't at our pace. And for whatever
reason, you know, we just -- I think we could have controlled it better.  
  
Q. For both of you, did they show you anything that surprised you or did you
expect them to try to choke off the high post, low post and do the trap? Were
you expecting all that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: We were very well prepared for this game. I think our coaches
did an excellent job in scouting them. Nothing was really new. You just get in
the game and you've got to play. And I think you can't second-guess your
passes. You can't second-guess yourselves and they just did a great job on
defense.  
  
Q. Candice, were you trying to get to the free throw line at all? You never
-- you didn't take any shouts from the free throw line tonight. That's got to
be pretty unusual for you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.  
  
Q. Were you thinking strategically aggressively --  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Oh, I mean, yeah. I was thinking to attack, I wanted to
attack off the dribble. They were really pressuring me, just trying to find
gaps and make contact, yes, absolutely.  
  
Q. Candice, I just want to ask you about this sway of emotions losing this
game and maybe just in a few hours a dream of yours will come true with the
WNBA draft and possibly being taken pretty high?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Sorry, what's the question?  
  
Q. Just the swing of emotions from this game and another dream of yours
coming true in a few hours?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think I'm just trying to cope with just what
transpired. So I haven't really thought about that yet. Obviously it's a new
start for me and a new career.  
  
Q. For either of you, you came back in December, you were down 11, and did
you keep that in the back of your head? Did this game feel at all like the
December game or did it just from the start feel like Tennessee was playing at
a different level?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that we came out and, you know, like what I said before,
they made that 9-, 10-point run on us. I remember Candace Parker hit the layup
and then she got another steal. We kept reminding ourselves we were down 11
last time. At halftime we said we just played a really horrible half, let's
start the second half and get it going and kind of fight back the second half.  
So we definitely kept that in mind. Like I said, we had to weather the storm a
little bit better.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had success against them earlier in the season. Did
you notice them do anything different offensively and defensively on the
court?  
JAYNE APPEL: You know, I think they did the same thing. I think we just
handled it a little bit better in the first game. We played a lot better. It's
kind of tough having a bad night on a night like this.  
But I think they played a great game and they played a great game in December,
also.  
  
Q. Candice, before the game, from across the way it was fun to kind of watch
you guys sit around on the floor there and huddle. Were you guys kind of
sharing some memories and talking about the special season or what was going
on?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, you know, it kind of became a ritual since the Maryland
game. We just gathered together and really just reflected on such a great
season and, more importantly, it's like we wanted to just enjoy the moment.
And, just like I said, I'm just crying and things like that, it's because I'm
so happy -- I'm sad it's over because of how much I love this program, this
institution, this team and my coaches and teammates. It's that amazing.  
This season, I could not ever have dreamed of this. So it's more than I could
ever ask for. I think everyone kind of felt the same way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how prepared your team looked for the pressure to
start the game. You said they came out really aggressive. I asked the girls
how you felt they came out. What was your impression?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, we know -- we know what to expect. We can't
simulate that in practice. They were extremely aggressive. It was a much more
physical game than the game in December.  
I mean, bodies were all over the floor the whole night. And I think just a lot
of our -- I thought we made a lot of uncharacteristic turnovers and some very
bad decisions.  
I mean, defensively, you know, I thought we actually did a decent job. Scoring
64 points was good, but we just had -- we were not able to run anything
offensively. People could not get open, whether it was against their press or
whether it was against their half court defense. You know, just the ability to
put the ball on the floor and go by someone. There were times I thought we got
it into Jayne. I thought we did miss some shots, and we missed some free
throws.  
In order for us to win this game, we had to play a lot better. And we didn't
play well enough to win and I thought they did the things that give us
trouble. And they have the bodies and they have the experience to do that. And
a lot of teams don't.  
  
Q. The last few minutes of the game, it seemed like the team wasn't really
fouling on purpose, but then when they did it was when the shot clock was
almost down.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, that was a bad one.  
  
Q. What was going on there?  
COACH VANDERVEER: The whole game was not one where there was -- we struggled
in basically every facet of the game. I mean, we wanted to foul sooner. And
then when we didn't, we didn't want to foul late. Candice's foul, I think
you're talking about.  
I think their pressure and their aggressiveness, the number of turnovers that
we had, really took us out of everything we were trying to do.  
  
Q. Did you feel like Tennessee was playing any differently this game than
earlier in the season, and if so, how?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm sorry, can you rephrase that for me?  
  
Q. You had success earlier in the season against the Vols. So I'm wondering
if you felt like their game was different, if they were able to capitalize on
their play a little bit different in this game versus earlier in the season,
or if it was the same type of play. Just wondered what your feelings were on
that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Like we just -- their pressure was much more intense this
time. They pressed and trapped basically the whole game this time, which they
didn't do at all. We didn't have trouble with -- their full court press was
minimal last time. Their three-quarter trap was pretty minimal.  
I think that in a way what really hurt us was how we finished the Connecticut
game. And it was like Tennessee just picked up where Connecticut left off. The
clock ran out in the Connecticut game, but Tennessee is actually bigger and
more athletic and could get hands on balls. And we just really -- we just made
too many mistakes to give ourselves a chance. Our turnovers were -- just too
many of them.  
And I just think that if you want to know, a lot of the difference, this was a
much more physical game than the December game, just in terms of how the game
was played.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of kids back. How valuable is this experience you've had
through this weekend all ends of the spectrum?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think this is really hard. It will hit our team and I know
it will hit Candice and it will hit me probably more tomorrow. I mean, to have
a chance to win a national championship and you just feel like, well, we
wasted an opportunity.  
But there's 300 and how many other teams, coaches that would like to be
sitting here. And I have thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of working
with this team, including tonight, when we were not playing well, when
everything was going wrong, people really worked hard to just kind of stay
together and not get upset with themselves or their teammates or their
coaches. And it was very frustrating. But I'm really proud.  
And for our young players, you know, we needed to play better. We needed to
handle the ball better. We needed to rebound better. We needed to make our
free throws. We needed to be able to execute offensively. We didn't do all
those things.  
But for Jayne -- I looked out there and I saw a lot of seniors for Tennessee.
We have one senior that plays a lot. We have basically freshmen and sophomores
who can only look back and say wow. It was awesome. And they learned how to do
things. And to get to the Final Four and play in this game, I'm thrilled for
our team.  
  
Q. In that vein, do you think their experience of knowing how to win a
national championship, the intensity level it takes to win, do you think that
might have been the difference tonight that they've been here before?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I definitely think that Tennessee has more experience, and
they have seniors that this is their last game too. We have one senior that
this is her last game and multiply that times five. Bobbitt is a senior.
Hornbuckle. Anosike. Parker. They played really well.  
And I think defensively I thought we played well. Offensively, it was
extremely frustrating. But a credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. I'm going to do a quick introduction, and then we'll
start with an opening statement. We're joined up on the dais by Tennessee head
coach Pat Summitt as well as student-athletes Shannon Bobbitt, who will be
here momentarily, and Candace Parker and Nicky Anosike.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously this is a very special night for our program and for
our basketball team. Extremely excited for what these seniors left. They put
obviously up another championship win, back to back, which is certainly no
easy task.  
And I particularly like the way they committed to each other on the defensive
end. I thought our defense, this is one of our best defensive efforts, which
gave us a chance, obviously, to beat an outstanding Stanford team.  
I'm just really proud, and obviously it's a happy but sad time with the
seniors leaving. But I will always have tremendous respect for the mark they
left on our basketball program.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, it seems like your intensity level, your team's intensity level
picked up another notch. And they just weren't prepared for that. Was your
experience in a game like this a key here, and did you guys actually turn it
up a notch tonight?  
CANDACE PARKER: I believe it was experience, but I also believe that a lot of
people underestimate our defense. And when you get on the court with us it's a
little bit different than what you see on TV or anything like that. So I think
we did a good job collectively defensively, just making them work for shots.  
And then we knew that our full court press really would bother them and take
some time off the clock. So they had to rush into their sets.  
  
Q. Candace, can you just sum it all up, now that two national championships,
two most outstanding player awards, this is your last game unless you change
your mind between now and tomorrow, sort of sum up what you're feeling, what
the whole experience has been like?  
CANDACE PARKER: My experience here at Tennessee has been great. I look back at
my growth, not only as a player but also just as a person. And I feel like
it's been the best four years of my life. I wouldn't change anything about it.
I love my teammates, and I'm just very, very fortunate to have won two
national championships. But we worked hard for it. And we deserved it.  
  
Q. Candace, early in the second half you missed a shot. You thought you were
probably fouled. Felt you were probably fouled but your team got the rebound
you went out to the free throw line, got the ball, went to the basket, made a
3-point play. It almost seemed like you were imposing your will on the game at
that point; that you really wanted the ball and nothing was going to stop you.
Did you have that feeling that you really wanted to do something to make a
statement at that point?  
CANDACE PARKER: Well, I feel like, you know, our team does a good job moving
the ball and getting in sets and all of that, but when the girl to my right
whispers in my ear I need to take over, that's what I do. I just try to get my
team -- bring energy offensively, whether I'm scoring or whatever. But it's
just making the defense take me away or -- and I kick out and my teammates hit
a nice shot. So that's just what I try to do.  
  
Q. Nicky, can you talk about particularly the early going for you in the
first half, the six steals and just your thought process coming into the game,
with defense, you talked about yesterday how that was going to be so critical.
And, Shannon, can you also talk about a big girl taking, getting those steals
the way she was doing it in that game?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I just know for me my mind-set coming into the game, I wasn't
going home without a championship. If we lost, I was going to live here,
because I wasn't going back home. (Laughter). No one was going to deny me a
national championship. And I did whatever I needed to do to make sure that we
won.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I thought you forgot about me.  
Nicky did a great job, and she's one of our best defensive players. And like
she said, nothing was going to stop her. Nothing was going to prevent her from
winning this national title. And she showed it tonight. And got after it and
got six steals. I'm proud of her.  
  
Q. Nicky, did you think right away they were just unnerved because they
couldn't get into their triangle? I mean, you pushed them out so far beyond
mid-court that they could never -- did you feel they were unnerved from the
beginning?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think our defense takes a lot of people out of their sets
when we decide to play. And tonight we had no choice but to decide to play
defense. So we took them out of everything they wanted to do and they just
didn't know what to do against our defense.  
  
Q. Candace, you guys are the defending national champions and seemed like a
lot of people today were picking Stanford to win. How did you take that and
was that an extra motivation?  
CANDACE PARKER: It's been our motivation all year to be honest with you. All
year, somehow as defending national champions we've flown under the radar, not
lived up to expectations and been criticized for not playing a 40-minute game.
But all of that stuff doesn't matter as long as you pull it together at the
end and we did that, and I think that we used our criticism as motivation and
it fueled our fire and I think the reason why we're here today is because of
that criticism.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the scoring from your teammates early, get the two 3s
from Shannon and the points from Nicky and what that did? This is a game where
you only had to take 10 shots.  
CANDACE PARKER: I feel like Shannon did a great job of stretching the defense
early and just looking for her shot. And obviously Nicky, you know, she's a
capable scorer. She had one-on-one defense, and she's capable of scoring all
the time from the high post, from the block. And just getting her to do that
and getting her to be confident in that, and I feel like she came out ready to
play and she was the reason why we won the national championship, because we
looked at her eyes and we knew we weren't going to lose after that.  
  
Q. Candace, now that it's over, how much was your shoulder bothering you?
Was there any point where you wondered about getting through this and were you
more comfortable tonight than you were Sunday night, because you looked that
way?  
CANDACE PARKER: You know, obviously my shoulder is a little sore. But winning
the national championship is making it better. So obviously I've been
rehabbing, had a lot of time in between the games to rehab. Spent a lot of
time with Jenny Moshak. She's the healer, and I'm just happy. From here I just
wanted to get past these two games and deal with my shoulder later.  
  
Q. Nicky, Candace said that when you whisper in her ear she has to take
over. What exactly do you say? Was that what you said?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think Candace has a lot of respect for me because she knows I
want the best for her. And I'm not going to tell you exactly what I said. But
whatever I said it worked. And we just try to inspire each other throughout
the game and I think it's worked.  
  
Q. Shannon, why is that corner so comfortable for you to shoot the 3?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I have no idea. I have no idea. My teammates think it's the
hardest shot to make. I actually think the top of the key is the hardest for
me. But I master it. In practice I shoot it. And I don't know, I just got
comfortable with it. I have a lot of confidence in my shot so every time I
release it --  
COACH SUMMITT: Go hide in the corner.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I try to hide in the corner so the opponent can't see me, but
I just master the shot and been good at it ever since.  
  
Q. Candace, when you were taken out of the game with a minute to go, you
were yelling eight, eight, eight (titles), holding up your fingers and sharing
a long hug with Pat Summit. What's the moment like that like and can you just
describe the joy that you feel kind of capping your career with a moment like
that?  
CANDACE PARKER: I think all of us put our trust in Pat Summit when we came to
the University of Tennessee, and she's been obviously more than a coach to us
and she'll be more than a coach to me for the rest of my life.  
And I think it just -- you play for her, you know what I mean? Because she's
been such an inspiration and just for the game of women's basketball. She's
been there for the growth. And I just feel like it summed it all up. We got
two championships together. And it's a remarkable feeling to walk off the
court for the last time and hug your coach. I'm completely different than I
was when I came in. And I feel like she's a real big part of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Congratulations.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Nicky brings a lot of energy to the court almost every time now. But
tonight she never seemed more energetic than that. Do you think the game plan,
knowing the role she would play and how much you would press got her all
psyched up?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think this game inspired her. She's one of the most fierce
competitors I've ever coached. She works hard on every possession. Probably
takes very few possessions off. And tonight I don't know that she took more
than one.  
But she inspires this team. And she's the one that gets them together. She's
the one that comes up with our plan of attack a lot. And I know they meet a
lot. And she's the one that's always calling the meetings and really holding
people accountable. I think that's what she does. I don't care if it's Alexis
or Candace. If she thinks we're jump shooting too much, she's going to express
it.  
I just have so much respect for Nicky because of just the commitment she makes
every day to getting better and she is one of the most fierce competitors, as
I said, that I've ever coached.  
She's going to be very successful in life because that's who she is.  
  
Q. Shannon Bobbitt was obviously the smallest player on the court by a large
margin. What was your plan for her defensively tonight to make sure she didn't
become a defensive liability due to her lack of height?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, one thing we wanted to do, we wanted to switch a lot on
their screening action, and I was a little concerned that Shannon might get
caught in a mismatch. But I never thought it was really a factor.  
We used a lot of our switches, and there were times when she was on Wiggins.
The one thing I said is you're going to have to hard hedge on the post action,
because I didn't want her to obviously guard Jayne Appel.  
But she really did a nice job, I thought, of putting pressure on the
basketball. And while she's small, that seemed to be effective for her. I
don't think there was really a situation that she was taken advantage of, just
because of the pressure that she applied. Even if she had a height
disadvantage.  
  
Q. Pat, watching the end of the UConn-Stanford game when Stanford struggled
against that press, did that make you more confident coming into this game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. You know, I thought as soon as Connecticut went to
the press, it really bothered them. And, you know, I felt like that our size
and just having Nicky on the ball and being able to extend our defense would
be a good option for us. Not only when we pressed in the full court, we went a
little bit more -- we gambled a little bit more.  
When we dropped it back to a half court or three-quarter, we really just
wanted to take time off the clock because they are such a pattern-oriented
team and they do a great job. They've got a lot of great sets, and obviously a
lot of people that can make shots.  
But I thought we did a nice job of taking some time off the shot clock, which
I thought was effective for us. I'll have to watch the tape. But that was the
feeling I had throughout the game.  
  
Q. Over the last three games you haven't given up 50 points, but tonight you
went over -- your defense went over seven minutes with only giving up four
points over the last second half of the game. Just talk about what rotations
and all worked for you as far as finishing?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think the big thing was changing our defense. And
obviously we all talk about playing in four-minute segments, and we had a
four-minute segment right at the beginning of the second half, I think it was,
and they only maybe scored only two points.  
But we're always talking in our huddle about what we did in that segment and
what we have to do that might be a change-up in the next four minutes.  
And I thought that we did a pretty good job of keeping them off balance by
changing, switching up our defenses. But our man defense was the best thing we
had going for us.  
And I anticipated playing a lot of zone. But it was quite the opposite.  
  
Q. Did you press them the first time?  
COACH SUMMITT: We pressed them at their place, yes.  
  
Q. It wasn't effective, though?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was not as effective. I think probably our defense was not
as strong that night. That was the night we didn't defend the high-low. You
know, we gambled a lot, even in our press. And they got inside of us. They got
inside of our defense. I thought their post game played really, really well.  
They had a sell-out crowd. Great environment. You know, we had been on the
road, played at UCLA. Went in -- I'm not making any excuses -- they were a
better team than we were that night. They definitely executed better on the
offensive end than we did. And we didn't close out the first half. That's why
I was just -- I was so concerned that we close out the first half, and we did
that in the game tonight. Because that really wound up costing us in the end.  
  
Q. I'm not sure how often you've been able to use the underdog speech lately
in your career, but when everybody picked Stanford, did you use that as
motivation for your team? Did they take that to heart?  
COACH SUMMITT: I'm telling you, they took it -- it was a personal thing for
them. The fact that all of the ESPN talent, we got Kara Lawson who played at
Tennessee, not giving us a chance, really. I mean, that just really -- that
fired them up. And it was probably the best thing that could happen to us, if
you think about it. Because it wasn't like they felt pressure to win. They
just had a little chip on their shoulder and they said we're not leaving out
here without a championship.  
And I just sensed that that took the pressure off of, oh, we gotta win back to
back. No, we gotta show everybody that didn't pick us that they should have
picked us. So from a psychological standpoint, it worked well in our favor.  
  
Q. After Sunday's game, you mentioned that Candace was emotionally
exhausted. What's the difference between the emotional exhaustion and physical
exhaustion for her?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think she was really worried. That was the emotional part,
and I think that that drained her emotionally. Worried if I could play,
worried what if it goes back out. You know, she's like, I finally get here and
now I'm dealing with this.  
And I think she just was worried about that as opposed to physical exhaustion
or emotion. You know, she can fight through that. She can fight through that
because she mentally is very tough. But when you're dealing with something
that's emotional, sometimes that really zaps your energy. And it did. At
halftime she said, Coach, I gotta have your help. I'm really -- I just need
help. Emotionally, I'm just really drained.  
And I knew it. And Dean was great with her. Dean Lockwood, who coaches our
post, he stayed in her ear the whole time and we just kept encouraging her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Vicki Baugh's game and also her status?  
COACH SUMMITT: She was terrific for us tonight. I mean, she was the player
that came off the bench and gave us the biggest spark and was very efficient
in what she did. I loved her aggressiveness. And, obviously, if you look at
her stat line, she's 3-for-4, 2-for-2 from the line, has four rebounds. Eight
points. That's a matter of 13 minutes. She made the very best and got the most
out of her minutes.  
Don't know the status right now on Vicki's injury. Did not look good. But I
just hope and pray that she's healthy and doesn't have to deal with anything
serious.  
  
Q. Do you think there's girls who watch this game tonight that have been
told they're too small to play and they see Shannon Bobbitt not only playing
but playing for Tennessee in a national championship game and five-foot-two or
whatever and playing so well?  
COACH SUMMITT: I'll tell you, Shannon has changed my mind. I'm sure she
probably has changed some kids out there watching that may only be five-two or
five-three or -four. I've got a freshman coming in that's five-two. Reminds me
a lot of Shannon. And one thing I've learned from Shannon, size is not really
that much of a factor.  
I don't know of anyone in any of our games in the last two years that have
taken advantage of her size, which has surprised me. But they haven't gone in
and tried to post her up. It's been amazing. But she's so tough-minded. She
thinks she's about six-five the way she plays.  
And she's been a joy to coach. She and Alberta. We don't beat LSU if we don't
have those two junior college players. And what they did to come into our
program and be willing to learn and compete and the team embrace them, they've
really been significant in this championship run.  
  
Q. You've obviously coached a lot of great players at Tennessee. Can you
talk a little bit about Candace Parker and what she brought to the program?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Candace, she's the best all-around offensive player I've
coached. She makes everyone else on the floor better because of all the double
teams that she's had to play out of. She's become a better passer. More
composure. Worked on her face-up game. The versatility -- and I've said she's
got the best skill set of any six-four player out there.  
And I think that makes her much more effective in being able to play off the
dribble, shoot the hook shot. And she was limited here in going left. But I
was just really proud of her for not getting frustrated with the injury and
just really staying focused and getting other players involved as well.  
The balance that we had tonight was key to our victory.  
  
Q. Coach, you now have eight national championships, congratulations. That's
only two away from tying John Wooden's record of 10 with UCLA. Does that
milestone ever reach your thoughts? Could you talk about your thoughts on
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I hadn't really thought that much about it. People
will say all the time -- it is so hard to win a championship. Last year was
hard. This year it was hard. I just feel I've been so blessed to have an
opportunity to coach at a university that really cares about our program, all
the programs. Dr. Petersen is here, Joan Cronan, our athletics director, Mike
Hamilton, the men's athletic director, the commitment they make and the
resources in place has allowed us to obviously recruit nationally and to build
a great program.  
Our fan support is awesome. I think about things like that and how that has
allowed so many of these student-athletes come here because of the environment
they know they can play in at Tennessee and Thompson-Boling Arena.  
I guess I'm along for the ride. They took me on a great one this time. And as
long as I love the game, I'll stay in it. Do I have a desire to try to beat
Coach Wooden's record? No. I just want to help the next team, next year, get
back to the Final Four. That's always our goal every year.  
And as long as I can be effective as a teacher and coach, that's what I want
to do. The day I walk in the gym and I don't have the passion is the day I
give it up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2008

  

### [Sue Donohoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15066)

### [Judy Southard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16910)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up here by Judy Southard, the chair of the NCAA Division
I Women's Basketball Committee, as well as Sue Donohoe who is with the NCAA
staff and her title is vice president for Division I Women's Basketball.  
Judy, when you're ready, I'll let you give your opening thoughts while people
are coming in.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Thank you very much. If I was worried about being awake during
this, I'm not anymore because of these lights. And, first of all, I'll
apologize for Sue and I being a few seconds late, but we were upstairs on the
upper level with an executive women's luncheon, very, very fine group of women
that have been very involved and very instrumental in the process of hosting
this event this year.  
In my real life I'm senior associate athletic director at LSU, and this time
of year I work for Sue, our vice president.  
I would say to you, to open up, that we are extremely excited about the state
of our game at this particular juncture and its history. We are watching a
tremendous growth in the skill level of our young women, the number of
participants who are taking part in our game and the excitement that is being
generated on our campuses for the women's game.  
We had several things this past year that were extremely exciting to all of
us. First of all, of course, our "Think Pink" initiative was a resounding
success this year.  
Our "Pack the House" challenges, which were directly related to trying to
improve attendance on our college campuses, was a tremendous success.  
And then we also, of course, announced our first-ever "Grow the Game"
marketing grant program that the recipients of those grants have been
announced for next year. And those monies will be used by the recipients to
help find a way to market and promote the women's game at even a greater
level.  
As always I would be remiss if I didn't speak to the importance of our
student-athletes. Our women in college basketball are tremendous role models
for the young people in our society, not only with the way they behave and
conduct themselves on the court, but in the classroom, and certainly what they
contribute to our communities in their community services.  
Academically the news is very good in women's basketball. We are graduating 81
percent of our women student-athletes in the sport of women's basketball,
which compares most favorably with a rate of 77 percent for the general
student body, the women in the general student body.  
Finally, I would say to you, this year's championship has just been a
tremendous event. We have watched our attendance grow at every level as we've
moved through the first, second rounds and into the regional semifinals and
finals. And we'll be very excited to see what has happened with our attendance
figures when we get all the final totals in at the end of this event. And hand
in hand with that, our TV ratings have gone up tremendously over the TV
ratings of 2007.  
And so we are extremely excited about where we are right now. We know that we
still have a long ways to go in some regard. But certainly our game is very
healthy, and it is improving daily and annually. And we're very, very excited
about our championship game tomorrow evening.  
At this point in time, I will open it up if there are any questions.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll give you the opportunity to ask both Judy questions as
well as Sue.  
  
Q. I know some people were surprised to see Tina Napier officiating
yesterday. Can you go over how the officials are chosen for the Final Four,
what the criteria are.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: I think the most important thing I would say to you up front is
there's a great need to understand that the regular season competition is
governed by conferences. Our conferences train and put together their own core
of officials. They all have their own conference coordinators of officials who
do the assignments for their conference events. And, in most cases, and I
would say it may be unanimous in cases, they also control the assignment for
officials for nonconference games for their membership.  
As far as the championship is concerned, we have a national coordinator of
officials who reaches down at the conference level to conference coordinators
and she requests recommendations for those individuals who should be advanced
forward to post-season competition.  
There are 31 conferences, so we receive a recommended slate of candidates for
officiating in the national championship from each of those conference
coordinators. We have a number of officials, a great deal of our officials
call for multiple conferences. They're not affiliated with one conference or
only two conferences and in many cases they'll officiate three, four, five
different conferences across the board.  
Our national coordinator received a slate from each conference coordinator.
That list was pared down. It was brought forward to our officiating
subcommittee for the committee, and then a slate was advanced for the
officiating. I would tell you that we considered Tina Napier, along with all
the individuals who came into our championship, to be outstanding officials.  
They are advanced based on their merit as they move through the tournament.
And, again, I would tell you that both the Big East and the SEC had an
opportunity to move forward a slate of candidates.  
The other thing I would say to you, and I'm sure the reference as it relates
to the question, would go back to the issues that happened in the Tennessee-
Rutgers game. I don't think there's any secret we can read between the lines
there. The one thing I would tell you is the officials that were involved in
that basketball game continued to call both Big East and SEC games throughout
the regular season and throughout their conference championship season before
many of them and, in the case of the ones that have been moved forward, were
moved forward by various conference commissions for consideration for
championship play.  
  
Q. I know you just love it, but I want to follow up on that, and if both of
you want to comment on this. The SEC did not give a satisfactory explanation
for what happened with that clock. Everybody was watching. Something happened.
Sue, did you feel like the NCAA -- were you powerless to step in and say
here's what happened? Because Rutgers and Rutgers fans and other fans still
just want to know what happened there.  
SUE DONOHOE: Yeah, thanks for the question. When the situation occurred as it
did, certainly within 24 hours our office and myself had an opportunity to
visit with both Commissioner Slive and Commissioner Trangese. As Judy
mentioned a few minutes ago, regular season officiating is -- the oversight of
that lies within our Conference Commissioners Association. So we felt like
from an NCAA perspective that our responsibility was to communicate with those
two commissioners to ensure that we were there to assist and support in any
way that we could.  
Also, we felt like our responsibility was to respond to any and all inquiries
that we received. And I have to tell you I had a great time doing that. I
spent a couple of days just responding to emails and explaining the position
of the NCAA in this regard.  
I think the thing that I would tell you that our most important role in this,
and what should be our primary role, is to take a situation that we certainly
know was unfortunate and turn it into a teaching tool.  
And from our national officiating program perspective, that's exactly what
we're doing. We did it immediately, within just a few hours of the game we had
a clip posted.  
We talked about how it was managed. We gave recommendations about ways that it
may be could be managed in a better way. So our primary responsibility from an
NCAA perspective was, one, being in communication with the conferences, being
in communication with the commissioners who have oversight for regular season
officiating, but our primary role was to take this and turn it into an
educational tool.  
In regard to how the committee looked at it during the selection process, I
know that's been a question that we've received a lot of, and I think Judy can
speak to it from a committee perspective. But within our principles and
procedures, we talk about unusual game circumstances. We talk about injured or
unavailable players and certainly during the process the committee took note
of that game and the results and it was a part of their dialogue as they were
deliberating on the selection seeding and bracketing process.  
And, Judy, you may want to touch on that.  
JUDY SOUTHARD: And I think probably, Michelle, you were at the mock selections
with us in February, so you were probably aware of this, but just to follow up
or just to kind of put a punctuation mark to what Sue said, there are 10
members of our committee, and we each one have different ways of analyzing the
information. We had lengthy dialogue about the situation that occurred.  
As we would and as we did with some situations with teams that had injured or
unavailable players and what would the roles of those players be when they
came back and were available for post season play, how it might affect
seeding, how it might affect placements of teams in the bracket.  
So we analyze all of that information and at the end of the day it's 10 people
casting 10 votes, so each individual on our committee had to take and balance
what that situation personally meant to them and the process of trying to
determine how they were going to vote as it related to the seeding of Rutgers.  
I think the selection of Rutgers was a no-brainer. So we were basically
dealing with where to seed them and then at that point our principles and
procedures kick in as it relates to placing them in the bracket.  
  
Q. One thing I want to follow up, I don't mean to belabor the point, but I
guess to get to the heart of the matter: Was this human error, technological
error, a combination of both, and why wasn't there an announcement explaining
here's what happened last night. Because I still think people want to know why
did the clock stop and then start again and what happened?  
SUE DONOHOE: I think that's a fair question. And, again, I'd go back to the
conference level. It's not about passing the buck. That's their oversight
responsibility. I think all of us know something happened. I think that if you
went and asked the officiating crew what happened, I think that there was
information that they had and didn't have at the time and they were living in
the moment.  
And they were in an arena with 20,000 people there on top of them. I think
that they managed the situation to the best of their knowledge at the time.  
Now, in hindsight, probably would they go back and take a little bit more time
to review and to assess, I think they would say, yeah, we would do that. And I
think that's the message that from a national officiating perspective that
we've tried to deliver is in a situation like that, take the time that you
need to make it right.  
And I think the officials, if they were sitting here with us today, would say:
If they did anything, if they could do anything differently, it would be
making sure and taking the time to do it. Did they miss a play or rule?
Absolutely not. Did they go through protocol? They absolutely did. Could they
have taken more time? I think they would say yes.  
And you're talking about three individuals that quite candidly are some of the
best of the best in the officiating world. You've got individuals that have
given and contributed to this game in a very positive manner. We all have
moments in time where we wish that we could do things a little bit
differently. But you had three individuals there that have served this game
well. They've served the student-athletes well. And it was an unfortunate
situation.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Oklahoma City, they lost what was the regional draw,
and still had, I believe, 10,000 and 9,000, what your thoughts were. I think
that was the best drawing region. And I guess a little beyond that, you gave
Greensboro two regionals in a row. Do you see that trend continuing especially
for someplace like Oklahoma City that performed so well?  
JUDY SOUTHARD: Yes, and I had an opportunity to be in Oklahoma City. I was in
a lot of places, as a matter of fact, but I was very delighted to have an
opportunity to be in Oklahoma City. The first thing I would do I would really
credit their local organizing community with what they did to really get out
and push that event.  
The bracket was set such that had Oklahoma advanced, they would have been in
that particular regional championship. As it worked out, they were -- if you
want to call it an upset, they were a 4 seed beat by a 5 seed in the second
round.  
But the thing that was very, very -- and I have to take my hat off to Sherri
Coale and the other coaches in the Big 12. They really got out and promoted
that event from a Big 12 perspective and then tied themselves to the Oklahoma
City community and really got out and pushed for the people to come out and
support that event.  
I was sitting in the arena for the first -- for the semifinal games that
evening, and it was absolutely unbelievable to me to look around and see the
number of head coaches from the Big 12 that came to Oklahoma City to support
their conference affiliation, which was of course Texas A&M.  
The people from Oklahoma State, the people from Oklahoma, who put on their
orange and put on their crimson and came out and filled the stands with their
university colors on but supported the Big 12, their Big 12 colleague in that
tournament.  
I think it's a real testament to the Oklahoma City community. I believe I'm
correct, Sue, Oklahoma City is hosting again next year.  
To answer the second part of your question, we have as a committee tried to
identify strong basketball supporting communities and give them opportunities
to host two years in a row. I know myself as a former athletic director on the
Division II level hosting a major event, I always wanted the opportunity for
the second year around because I knew once I built the base of support that it
would be a very successful event. And I think you're going to see Oklahoma
City will do that with the event next year also.  
So my hat's off to them. And this is just another quick example of how it
goes. I was interviewed in New Orleans, because I was also at the New Orleans
regional. I was interviewed there from a gentleman from the local newspaper.
He asked me if I was disappointed that the LSU people didn't come out to
support the event in New Orleans. My answer was to them was, well, the LSU
people came out, those were the 5,000 people that were in the arena.  
The problem was that we -- in some communities we do a tremendous job with the
local organizing committee, and that I would use as the example to go back to
what happened at Oklahoma City. Their local organizing committee just did an
absolutely magnificent job supporting that event.  
  
Q. Sue, there was a little bit of a clock issue last night with one of the
clocks. They had to stop the Connecticut game. And can you explain what
happened there and how it's been resolved?  
SUE DONOHOE: Absolutely, I think that's a great question. We had a couple of
issues last night. And let me just give credit to the St. Pete Times Forum.
Here's what I know. You're going to have issues along the way. What's
important is do you solve the issues before they become problems. And
certainly the St. Pete Times Forum and their staff did that last night.  
On the clock issue, when we went to tip in the first game, we had some sort of
short in the clock. And it impacted the way it was running down. And so we
were in communication with the officials on the floor, with our standby
officials, and those officials were in communication with the two head coaches
ensuring that they know which was the real clock to work on, to view and play
off of.  
When we got between the two games last night, we had an opportunity where we
could have brought that clock down, powered it down and put two temporary
clocks up on the sideline. And we went to our officiating crew for the second
game and talked to them about that.  
That crew went to the two head coaches in the second game and told them what
the situation was and they told them if we do that, we're going to bring down
the clock. You're going to lose the 30-second clock that's up above the back
board, but we'll have two game clocks down on the floor.  
And the coaches said we'd rather maintain and have the opportunity to have the
30-second clock up there, understanding that the timing may be off. And they
always knew throughout the game that they should refer to the one clock that
we knew was in good functional order.  
Every time we went to a media timeout last night, in both games, at the 16,
12, 8 and 4 mark, our officials went back to the huddle, said, coaches, let us
remind you, here's the clock that we're looking at. Student-athletes, here's
the clock that we're looking at.  
Coaches felt more comfortable managing it that way than they did with taking
down that clock and losing the 30-second shot clock.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both for being with us.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: So we're joined up here on the dais by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Candice Wiggins, Kayla Pedersen, Jayne
Appel, JJ Hones and Rosalyn Gold-Onwude.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Obviously, we're really just ecstatic to be here this
morning. And we're really excited about how our team played last night. We
felt it was a total team effort. Obviously, we were led by Candice with her 25
points and 13 rebounds. Our whole team really stepped up. Kayla making big
plays, JJ, Ros, Jayne. I thought it was a great game for Jillian Harmon and
Jeanette Pohlen came in and made some big plays for us.  
But at this point we couldn't be happier and we know we have a lot of work to
get ready to play tomorrow night. But we're really excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, there's been a lot of sort of we want to play a few more games,
there's one more game. How are you feeling?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, this is the biggest game of my entire life so far.
So I'm just so excited I get to share this experience with my teammates and my
coaches. And it is one game, and that's sad. But I think it's such a great
game that I can't even tell you how much it means.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players that want to answer. I hope a couple of
them will. You've already played Tennessee and you've had this story line
about being the underdog, being the underdog, we haven't beat Connecticut, we
haven't beat this or that. You've beaten Tennessee. Is that going to be a
disadvantage or an advantage?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I would say at this point in the season it's the last
game. We're playing for a national championship. And, of course, there is that
sort of probably for them they want to avenge a loss. But at this point it's
the national championship game. So I think that a lot is on the line there.
And I think both teams are going to be playing hard because of that, and it's
not really necessarily about -- it's not like middle of the season. This is
it.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, going along with what Candice said, once the ball is
thrown up, it's just the championship game. Of course, they're going to be
motivated that we beat them before. But I also think we know them and we know
that we can beat them.  
But I think both teams are just going to play their hardest and realize it's
going to be for a championship.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we've gone off the thing where the pressure has been on
the other team to perform the best, and we kind of just had a mentality of
going out and relaxing, having fun.  
And I think that still stands true for this game. I think the pressure is more
on them again since they have to come out and try and defend their national
title against a team that I think is playing very well.  
JJ HONES: I agree with what Jayne said. I feel like people still look at us as
the underdog, we're the 2 seed where they're the 1 seed. I mean, maybe that
will give us a little extra motivation. But, I mean, we did beat them. And
it's a national championship game. So I feel like everything is even.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Yeah, I agree with JJ and the rest of my teammates in
that it is a championship game and we'll look for motivation. Everybody is
going to be trying to find motivation wherever they can. Tennessee's been here
before. They won a national championship last year. And they have theirs.
There's going to be one game left. Why shouldn't we win? Just go for it. It's
our turn.  
  
Q. Candice, Tara has expressed over the last week how happy she is and she
said she's in such a good place right now and that you've been a big part of
that and she's happier than she's been in about a decade. Can you speak to
that and maybe what you've seen from Tara and maybe a couple other players,
talk about that also?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Tara has been great for us this season. She's believed in us
from day one, and is really the force that has made us the team we are.
Because she never accepted us being less than the best. And she's been our
main supporter, and I think that to see her happy, see her proud of us, I
think that makes us all proud because we worked really hard for her and I
think this is a special team. And I think with a special team, special
coaching staff. You can just tell. They're a tight-knit group, and we love all
of them.  
  
Q. Candice, you've had a long history with Candace Parker, do you find it
appropriate that your careers are coming down to the last game against each
other?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I mean, she's a great player and a great, great team. And I'm
just excited to be able to play in a national championship game as my last
game. And I'm sure she is, too.  
The thing is, we both realize we've got great support around us, and I think
that's really what it comes down to. And so it's not me versus her; it's
Stanford versus Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma made a point that he thinks your strong play during this
tournament is a function of you guys becoming more of a team where every
player has to be defended. Have you noticed a difference in how defenses
approach you and handle you since maybe what they did in November or
December?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. I think, even Connecticut, they might have like
went a box and 1 even in November. This time they can't do that. And I think a
lot of teams are realizing we've had great talent. You can't count on one
person on this team or not one player on a team at all. That's helped us. It's
been great because we've all been at each other's backs, we've supported each
other. It's not like the pressure is on one person.  
  
Q. Candice, can you kind of reflect back on when you first met Candace
Parker and how great players can sort of maintain a friendly respect for each
other even though you guys are competing for the same thing, you still can be
friends with somebody like that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, the first time I guess I saw Candace, it was at -- we
were in 13 and under AAU tournament in Florida, actually. And she was like
six-two at 12. And our team -- and so I didn't get a chance, we didn't play
against her because her team was like third place and we were playing the
championship game. I remember being like just wow, because she was different
then. Then I got a chance to play with her on a lot of teams, or the U.S.A.
team, and kind of got to know her.  
She's really a nice person. What can you say? There's nobody in the game like
her. And I think she's carrying all the pressure and all of that really well
and I really respect her for that.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. Because it's been such a while --
Stanford's tradition is there, but it's been a long time since they've been to
a national championship game. Have you all heard from any of the alumnus and
what have they said, what have they said to you all about getting Stanford
back to this level?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Yeah, we've heard from them. We actually had an ice cream
social with them the day before the UConn game, and it was -- we've seen a
couple of them around. But to see maybe 10 or 12 of the past players from
Stanford meeting with us to talk with us and give us words of wisdom and
support and that was a really amazing feeling. We got some great words of
advice.  
I think I'll just talk on words of advice from Jennifer Azzi. She won a
national championship here. These were some of the best players that Stanford
ever had coming back talking to us. She said we're part of a Stanford family,
Stanford tradition. It's not something that we have to feel that we have to --
like something looming over us, rather it's something that should be with us,
beside us, and that we are all together. And they're just bringing that
positive energy for us and have pride in our uniform and our jersey.  
JJ HONES: Going along the same lines as Ros, talking about Jennifer Azzi, she
told us, yeah, she may have been extremely nervous before some games, but then
once she stepped out on the court, that was her home. She was comfortable
there, felt like everyone on the team was comfortable.  
I can take that to heart. I've been kind of extremely nervous before a game
and then go onto the court, and I just know my teammates had my back, and kind
of what all the alumni were talking about.  
And it's very exciting to see their support and knowing like Jamila Wideman
and Vanessa Nygaard are watching, from Portland Fire, and they're watching our
game, I don't know, it's just kind of weird.  
JAYNE APPEL: I was going to quote Jennifer Azzi but I think I'll move on.  
We also, I think, read -- Heather gave us some good advice. We call her red.
But she told us she's been watching us all year, told us how we've developed
as a team and pointing out some good characteristics to us that we might not
have known about or have been stated to us directly.  
And we also had -- it was kind of a weird feeling but we had Charmin come back
and having her coach against us, you know, I think we got some points from
her, how tough we were on the court from the second we stepped out.  
I think they really just gave us a lot more confidence and just really helped
us relax before the game and they told us to go out there and have fun.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think the thing I remember from that meeting was Vanessa
Nygaard saying sit back and take a couple minutes before the game, soak it all
in. Study the whole gym. See all the people in the rafters. I did that before
the UConn game. I think that really helped me loosen up.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I don't want to misquote anyone so I'm not going to say -- I
forget who it was, but what I remembered most from what the alum told us was
that just that you're going to remember more than anything, a lot of them,
what they took from their Stanford experience wasn't necessarily the wins or
the scores all that stuff, it was just about how they felt when they played
with each other.  
And I think I'm starting to realize like what they mean by that and how that
is Stanford basketball. It's not winning the game, but it's how you win the
game.  
And I think hearing that from them is really what touched me the most, because
I completely can understand where they're coming from.  
  
Q. You guys have traveled the farthest of all the teams, obviously the
schedule is different here at the tournament. Yet your energy seems very high.
What have you guys done to maintain your endurance at this point?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, we've worked all season for this moment. So we're not
letting a single day pass by. And I think preseason -- our conditioning has
been great the whole entire year. But more than anything it's look where we
are. We know the stage is the biggest. And we just give each other energy with
how excited we are to play with each other.  
JJ HONES: Going along those lines, how can we not be excited. We're playing in
the Final Four. I feel like if anyone is tired, you just have to think like
we're in Tampa Bay, we're in the Final Four. We might be a little tired from
the game yesterday. We're playing in the national championship game; don't be
tired yet. You can be tired on Wednesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, all of you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you, Tara, to have all these former players coming
back for this and to see these old faces coming together and what does that
say about your program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, it's really fun to see everyone, and we did -- I think
we'll actually do probably something again. But just listening to Jamila
Wideman talk and the things like Jennifer said, all these different players,
they're so happy for our team and our program. They're so proud of this group
and it is very meaningful. And, I mean, it's just kind of -- it feels a little
surreal.  
I'm looking at people that I coached like 17, 18 years ago and 20 years ago,
and they really appreciate and they really have great memories of playing at
Stanford. And that's what I want them to have as a coach.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk during this tournament about even from other
coaches about how they've seen your personality change over the years and more
mellow, smiling more. Do you think your personality has changed that much in
recent years and if so why?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that we all probably change. We're affected by
our experiences. I think that I probably have changed. But a lot of it may be
also I maybe haven't changed as much as people might say because a lot of
people maybe don't know me.  
But I think for me personally I've always had a lot of interests, and, I mean,
basketball has always been a passion of mine, but different -- and I think
that different groups allow you to be certain ways with them. This particular
team allows me to be very relaxed. There's not an undercurrent or drama about
this team. Kind of what you see is what you get.  
I can be very direct and I don't have to sugar coat things when I talk to the
players. And we have -- I have great rapport with basically everyone on our
team. And I love that. And it's a really great place to be.  
And I think that any coach would really love to coach this team. It's that
much fun.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask you about the scoring balance you have on your team
now and how much that's helped just from a game planning standpoint. Have you
had a team with this much scoring balance in recent years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, in the beginning of the year you wouldn't really
be saying that about our team. We kind of had the big three and no one else.
It was always about Jayne and Kayla and Candice. But probably the reason that
we're here is because we do have that balance and the improvement of Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude, the improvement of JJ Hones, the contributions that Jillian
Harmon is able to make and Jeanette Pohlen.  
So that is -- I think that has been really key to our team's improvement and
development. We have had that in past years. That hasn't -- some of the things
that we haven't had, we have had that. But we haven't had some other things
that we have on this team.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Parker and Wiggins beyond their playing ability, how
they've led their teams here?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I can speak about Candice with an "i" because I really
know Candice. Candice Wiggins really loves to play. I think she's a really
humble person and she really -- she'll do anything for our team, whether like
last night rebounding, there have been games where if we're up, she will sit.
And she just will do anything for her team and she really as a player that
just has total confidence in me as her coach.  
And it's mutual. So I couldn't ask any more from our Candice. And obviously
Candace Parker does great things for their team. But I think they do come from
kind of different places, you know, in that a lot of this stuff is brand new
for Candice Wiggins. And she almost acts so surprised about everything, to be
U.S.A. Basketball player of the year. And if anyone saw her when she got her
Wade, she was shocked. She just -- she really is just very real and down to
earth and it's really fun to see someone with that kind of demeanor to have
all these great things happen to them.  
  
Q. Back in '90 and '92 in the early '90s your program was on such a roll and
such a high. Can you think back then if at that time what your thoughts were
about how this was going to continue, and then when it took so long to get
back to this game, did you think it was going to take this long and was there
ever a time where you thought, well, maybe this isn't going to happen for my
program again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: When I first went to Stanford, it was in a different time in
women's basketball. And I felt really -- it was really fortunate to be able to
build a program that like Jennifer Azzi, when she was a freshman, she was in
the first recruiting class with Katy Steding. When Jennifer Azzi was a
freshman, we were a .500 team. We won a national championship.  
And when you are kind of in the Final Four and win a national championship,
and we were able to recruit I think some really quality players, and since
then a lot of other schools have made commitments to having great women's
basketball teams.  
And the competition is much different than it was in 1990 and 1992. Also I
think that for our team, the three years we went to the Elite Eight, we could
just as easily have been here as this year. Comes down to a couple of plays, a
foul here or a basket here.  
So I never felt that we were -- I didn't feel like we, like, dropped off the
map. I felt we were right there.  
But it did take some special things in terms of just little things that maybe
really made a difference for us this year. I think some of it, too, I really
felt fortunate to have gone to five Final Fours before. And Stanford I just
felt we just would continue to work to recruit the type of player that could
play at Stanford and that we would have a shot to be here.  
And we have had to play very, very well to be here. And obviously once you get
here you just have to enjoy it. You never know if you're ever coming back. I
hope I do, but who knows.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, you played Tennessee once already. We talked to the
kids about sort of being in that underdog role. Do you feel like you guys sort
of maybe -- the tables are turned a bit and how hard is it to beat Tennessee
twice in a year when you beat them once in 11 years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Takes us 11 years to beat them, and now we have to play them
again. They're a great team and a great program. Obviously, it was hard like
last night. Who do you want to play? You're watching LSU and you're watching
Tennessee. And I guess I like familiarity. I like the fact -- we had played
LSU two years ago. But I like the fact that we kind of had -- I've seen our
players against Tennessee. I've seen them matched up.  
So I'm excited that we're playing Tennessee. And for us, honestly, I think the
fact that we did beat them earlier is for our -- it's to our team's advantage
in that confidence that our players know that that's possible. With the
Connecticut situation, you know, things changed a lot for Connecticut, with
their two players being hurt. They're a totally different team.  
This is the same Tennessee team. And for our team, I think it works for us
better that we have been successful, that it's not like, oh, God, we haven't
beaten them in 11 or 12 years.  
For them it might be to their advantage, also, that we beat them and this is a
payback game. But I think as our players kind of said for the most part, once
that ball goes up, we're going to give it our absolute best shot. They're
going to give it their absolute best shot and let's just see what happens.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the game, the strategy, the matchups,
what you guys need to do to beat a team that you did get by in Maples but now
you're on the national stage?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There are certain things you have to do against Tennessee
whether you're playing in Maples, Knoxville or Tampa. You have to rebound.
They're a great rebounding team. You have to take care of the ball.  
I asked Kate Paye, who scouts them, she scouts Connecticut, what do we have to
do against Tennessee? She goes, it's the same stuff you have to do against
Connecticut. To beat great teams, you have to execute offensively, you have to
rebound and you have to defend. Those are things we'll have to do tomorrow
night.  
And they give you a challenge because they're big. They're athletic, they're
very experienced, and they're confident coming into this game.  
  
Q. Have you approached this weekend any differently than you did 15 years
ago when you won a Final Four and is that because of your change and the way
you want the kids to remember?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We are doing some things different. Actually the last time I
was coaching in Final Four you played back to back. Today would be the game.
So that does change your strategy a little bit.  
We're just trying to -- we're keeping kind of our group tight and we just --
we're not out doing a whole lot of stuff. We're just together and we watch
video. We're just trying to make things fun and have it be great memories for
them.  
Coming into the Final Four, we also -- we just said, hey, we're in it to win
it. We came here on a mission and we just want to keep it going.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No, not here, just in Spokane.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the other day about how some of these
freshmen and sophomores aren't playing like freshmen and sophomores, they're a
little fearless. Can you touch on that going into the national championship
game and how they've stepped up into this tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We are a young team in a lot of ways. Candice is a senior,
obviously, but in our starting lineup we have one freshman and three
sophomores. And we bring in a junior. We bring in a freshman, basically,
that's our top seven player rotation.  
And these are just kids that have grown up playing basketball. And like
Jeanette Pohlen comes in. She's played against Maya Moore in All-Star games or
in AAU. They go playing against each other since they were 13 years old.  
At this point it's not about the age of players, it's more about their
maturity and their poise and their ability just to relax and play on the big
stage. And that's so far -- I mean, I think like last night's game, I think
you saw a team that was for the most part very poised.  
We kind of got flustered for a little bit when we got pressed and we were
throwing the ball in the popcorn stand. But for the most part I think we did
show good poise and got the shots that we wanted and made the plays we needed
to defensively and rebounded the ball well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes first. After
about 15 minutes we'll let them head to their breakout rooms, and then we'll
entertain questions for the coach.  
We're joined up here by Tennessee head coach Pat Summitt as well as student-
athletes Candace Parker, Alberta Auguste, Nicky Anosike, Shannon Bobbitt and
Alexis Hornbuckle.  
When you're ready, Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, we're excited to be in the position to play in a
national championship game. This group has -- they've been there before and we
know it's going to be against a great Stanford team. Obviously a team we lost
to earlier in the year at Stanford, and I thought that was probably a defining
moment for us in terms of making a commitment to our scouting report defense
and stepping up and making plays.  
And I think it's going to be two great teams going at it. Hopefully we'll be a
little better on the offensive end. But I'll let you hear from the players and
I'll talk to you afterwards.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, I'll start with you. As efficient as Stanford has been
offensively, Coach just said you need to be better offensively. Do you feel
like you need to put some more points to keep up with the way Stanford has
been playing offensively?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I think it's definitely important to be efficient on
offense and put up more points. But at the same time it comes down to defense
and boards. So we just have to step up our defense in case our shots are not
falling in.  
  
Q. Candace, did you ever in the past year have, for better or worse, a Matt
Leinart moment where you thought maybe I'll stay at Tennessee, take a couple
of grad courses and finish out my final year of eligibility?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously I've talked about living in the moment and just
staying day-to-day. That's what I'm trying to do now. I'm focusing on that. I
haven't had time to really think about it.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about your relationship with Candice Wiggins. I
know you guys have spent a lot of time together with U.S.A. teams. And I had
heard that somebody showed you a box score from when she put up the 44 against
UTEP, you smiled and shook your head. Have you smiled and shook your head at
what Candice has done through this whole tournament?  
CANDACE PARKER: Candice is a great player. I remember watching her play when
we were in eighth grade and we were watching the championship national game.
Nicky Anosike was playing her team in Orlando, Florida, and she was a ball of
energy, always moving.  
She's progressed and gotten better every year. I think she's a great leader
for her team and she really inspires by her play. She inspires her teammates.
Obviously we're great friends. We've played on a lot of the same U.S.A. teams
and things like that. She's a great person as well.  
  
Q. Shannon, that first meeting with Stanford, I think Wiggins only took 12
shots in that game. I want to ask you about the supporting cast and the other
players at Stanford and maybe what the toughest aspects of defending the rest
of their players will be tomorrow night.  
SHANNON BOBBITT: Yeah, she only took 12 shots and Tennessee players did a
great job limiting her touches and making all her shots tough. And she has a
great supporting cast and they can all shoot the 3 ball as well. Stanford is a
great team. So we all have to compete and guard all of them.  
  
Q. Alexis, JJ Hones wasn't in the rotation when you played them the first
time. From what you've seen of them since then, what has she added to the
dynamic, particularly with her size and particularly as a defensive player?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: She's stepping up, hitting big shots, whether it's going to
the basket, hitting pullups, knocking down the 3 ball. She's adding a new
dynamic to their offense. So we have to be ready to defend not only Candice
and Jayne Appel but the other three as well. It's going to be 1 through 5 is
good, and they're playing together, so we've got to defend 1 through 5.  
  
Q. Alexis, Candice Wiggins singled you out as one of the better defensive
players she's gone up against. I wondered what your feelings were going into
that matchup against her?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I know I have a tough defensive assignment. Like Candace
said, she's a big ball of energy, never stops moving, she hunts for her shot.
They do a great job of getting her open, running off screen. She's going to
get handoffs, so I know I have a tough defensive assignment. I can't rest and
I can't take a possession off.  
  
Q. Nicky, you're wearing a T-shirt that says "Touching Third Base," I don't
think that's a softball shirt. Can you tell us what that means?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We all just kind of made promises to each other we would touch
third base, which basically means you don't make it to the finish line unless
you do what's necessary beforehand to be successful at the end. So just
focusing on the little things. You can't get a home run unless you touch third
base, which is what we've been focusing on the whole season.  
So our strength and conditioning coach made these shirts up for us and we wear
them to bed every night just to remind us that it's the little things that
count and we can't get to our ultimate goal without doing those little things.
So it's really helped us just reiterate what we want to do.  
  
Q. Candace, what do you remember from Kayla Pedersen from that first game?
And, secondly, she says that their plan is to force you to your left tomorrow
because your left-handed shots appear to be short. Do you think that's a
dangerous tactic for them to attempt?  
CANDACE PARKER: (Laughter) obviously I remember the Stanford game in my mind
like it was yesterday. We talk about how it ruined our Christmas and ending
the year on a loss. Obviously Kayla has really stepped up her play throughout
the NCAA tournament. Glad I got some insight on what they're planning on
doing. And obviously I'm just going to continue to try to play my game, and
obviously if I step out on the court, then all's fair.  
  
Q. Candace, I'm sure you're getting really tired about talking about this,
but how is your shoulder feeling now and what have you done between the time
the game ended last night as far as rehab and getting rest?  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in America. She obviously has
me on rehab programs, just do going strengthening exercising, stim, ice,
getting circulation back. Obviously the stiffness from yesterday was tough
this morning, but it feels great. One more game. Just get through it and worry
about it later.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. They've played two beautiful basketball games the last two games, that
two good teams made runs at them, they never got rattled. How much better do
you think they are from what you've seen in these last two games and what you
saw on December 22nd? And the other question would be: They played you man to
man pretty much straight up. A lot of teams don't dare do that because of
Candace. What do you think is it about them that allows them to do that?  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, I think Stanford is a much better basketball
team. They're running their offense with great efficiency and getting great
looks. And I think the question about the defensive part of it, I think they
have the size to match up with us. And I think that's what allows them to be
able to defend us in man to man.  
And Jayne Appel has got a great presence inside. But if you just look at our
two teams, it's not like we have a distinct advantage from the standpoint of
our size.  
  
Q. Pat, I know earlier in the year out of frustration at times you compared
this team maybe to the '99 team, not playing 40 minutes. Have you changed your
opinion somewhat of this team now that you're at the Final Four?  
COACH SUMMITT: This team has changed my opinion of them. And this started
after our loss to LSU. When the wheels came off in Knoxville and the next day
we went into our conference room and had a board meeting, coaches and players,
and just pretty much laid out what they would have to do and expressed to them
how mad I was. I was mad at them, real mad, and disappointed in how they -- I
thought they quit in that game. And that's the first time I really felt that
about this team.  
But once the coaches expressed how we felt, we left the room and they had
their own meeting. We got to Nashville. We went to play Vanderbilt. I was
really concerned about what might happen. And that's when Alex Fuller dropped
a note in my lap when she got off the bus. When I read it, she said: Coach,
everything is going to be okay. We've had a meeting, we're ready to play. This
won't happen again.  
I felt better. I knew when it's their idea it works a lot better. And I knew
that they were embarrassed and I think from that moment on we've been a
different basketball team.  
  
Q. Pat, could you comment a little bit on the contrasting styles between
Candace Parker and Wiggins, but also their similarity in being great leaders
and getting their teams to this point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, with Candice Wiggins, I mean, she's got great skill set.
Obviously a player that can shoot the 3, that can create off the dribble,
makes everybody else on the floor better. She's a big play person. She steps
up and provides great energy.  
I think she brings a lot of energy to her team. She's very positive, a very
positive leader. And she just -- she's one of the best players in the country,
there's no doubt about it. And what she brings to her team, I think, gives
them a lot of confidence and keeps them motivated.  
When you have a player with that kind of energy, it filters throughout your
team. We get that from Alexis. But I think Candice is such a skilled offensive
player and a player that makes good decisions on the floor, she makes everyone
else better.  
Candace Parker, obviously very similar in what she brings as far as the
points, the contributions, her passing skills. Much like Candice Wiggins,
Candace Parker is very unselfish.  
Even last night when she came down the floor and hit Nicky Anosike, when I
anticipated Candace would take that shot, she saw the opening and made the
great pass. But with Candace, I think that Candace Parker is just a great all-
around offensive player because she has been in the gym and expanding what she
can do with the basketball, meaning going left, going right. Unfortunately,
the shoulder's preventing her from going left as much as I wish she could go
left, because she is very strong in that regard.  
Hook shot, left, right. Pull up, 3 ball. Just the versatility of a six-four
player in this game, you don't see that very often.  
And I have great respect for what Candace has done in terms of getting in the
gym to expand her game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your history with Tara. You've known her
for a long time. She hasn't been here for 11 years. Did you think the game had
passed her by?  
COACH SUMMITT: I didn't know it had been 11 years. No, I never think the game
will pass Tara by. Tara VanDerveer, she's a great teacher. Great coach.
Obviously she's showing more emotion than I've seen her show in post season.  
And I think that's been a good thing for her team. Typically she doesn't get
up. It's good to see her get out of her chair and encourage her team. When you
talk about the great coaches in the game, I mean, she is someone that I have
felt was one of the very best at her teaching of the game and just game
management. And doesn't surprise me that she's back here. It surprises me that
it's been that long.  
  
Q. A lot of the talk has been about Wiggins. I wanted to talk about their
front court, Appel and Pedersen. Having two six-four players like that, is
there another front court you guys have seen this season that has that kind of
size from two players and how would you compare those two with the front
courts you've faced this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously Appel and Pedersen, they've got great size, and we
typically have faced teams that have one six-four post player. We haven't
really had to face two as skilled, as talented as they are. They're
aggressive, play well together.  
Their high-low game is one of the best in the country. It beat us when we went
to Palo Alto and played them. There's no doubt in my mind the high-low game
beat us. Because we did not defend it well. They can stretch you out.  
Their spacing on offense is obviously very, very good but particularly in the
high-low action with those two.  
  
Q. Just to continue that a little bit, can you talk about Pedersen,
specifically your impressions of her, and if indeed they do try to force
Candace to her left, what are the dangers of spending so much energy trying to
force a player to go one particular way?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I recruited Kayla. Went out and watched her
practice and loved her game. And I thought that she was very, very skilled as
a high school player and just had a great stroke, which she obviously has
demonstrated and fit in extremely well with the Stanford team.  
But what was the second part of --  
  
Q. If they do really try to force Candace to her left, what are the risks of
doing that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I mean, we've been in situations where we've tried to
force players left, not because of an injury, but because they didn't have a
good left hand. I think Candace can -- I think she can go left. I don't think
that's a problem as far as taking the ball off the dribble.  
Will she shoot the ball left-handed? Probably not. But with her size and
obviously she's going against size, I still think she can make shots going
either way.  
And I've had situations where I thought we had to do that. You know, even in
national championship playoffs, and if that's what it takes, that's what you
do. I guess I go back to our first championship, and I thought our scouting
defense of forcing them left, we went and played Long Beach State, I think
that was key to our victory. So it can be effective.  
  
Q. Do you think that you've ever had a player that's come to Tennessee and
really fully understood the expectations there? Because realistically you
never find too many coaches who say I found a fault with a team going a 34-2
season, a Final Four season. At what point do they start really understanding
what it means to play for your program?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I try to explain it in the recruiting process. And I
start by saying: If you're not a great competitor and you're not committed to
hard work, and there's a reason they call it hard work, don't come here.
Because you'll be miserable and I'll be miserable. And when I ain't happy,
ain't nobody in the camp happy.  
And, I mean, I've had a lot of one-on-one conversations. And even with the
parents. I've had players that I've said: I like your game in terms of how
skilled you are. But I don't like the way that you take possessions off, you
don't bring the intensity all the time. I like to watch them practice more
than watch them in the game because you learn so much more about players when
you watch them practice every day. I mean, you see who they really are and
what they're willing to bring, to get better.  
And I've made some mistakes, obviously, in players. And it was a long four
years. And they didn't play a whole lot.  
  
Q. This team's confidence obviously has served it well in the last couple of
games. Do you think earlier in the year, when you weren't so happy with them,
that overconfidence might have been an issue with this team?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, definitely. I mean, they thought they were going to win
every game. They thought they were real good. I'm not sure they thought they
had to work as hard as they worked the previous year. I think that goes with
winning a championship. It's tough. That's one reason I want to go back to
touching third base. I asked Larry Pratt when we donated or dedicated the
Pratt Pavilion, which he obviously committed to significantly.  
I asked him if he would speak to my team before we played. And he came in and
he talked about touching third base and there being no shortcuts to success.
Of course, I spent a lot of time with him telling him how this team was
driving me nuts and that they really needed to understand attention to details
matter.  
And he did a phenomenal job. And I think that had a great impact on them, just
knowing there's obviously -- always say there's no shortcuts to success, and
we took a lot of them. But I think that was also something that helped us be
more attentive, and also realize that we're not as good as we really thought
we were.  
  
Q. When did he talk to them?  
COACH SUMMITT: The day after the dedication.  
  
Q. If my short memory doesn't let me down here, you were talking a lot about
paint points in Oklahoma City. Looking at the stat sheet from last night, you
guys only went to the line seven times. Are those two numbers related, and
what's the focus? Maybe is there a focus on getting both of those up Tuesday
night?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, we win in the paint. We win in the paint over and over
and over. I thought Candace settled for too many jumpers early and shied away
from the contact. And once she started going inside, and obviously I thought
Alexis and Alberta, if you look at what Alberta and Shannon brought to our
team last night, without those two, we don't win.  
I just go back and thank my staff for bringing those two in. But we win in the
paint, we couldn't, for whatever reason, could not get to the line very often.
And then we didn't make free throws.  
  
Q. Is it just a little bit of you that's happy that this whole press
conference is not Pat and Geno and the whole feud?  
COACH SUMMITT: I would say I didn't want any -- I wouldn't want any of that as
far as being a distraction. It's not about the coaches. This is all about
players. And unfortunately I think some of the media folks out there wanted to
make it about Pat and Geno. And it's all about the players.  
  
Q. You talked about Stanford being an even better team now than when you
originally played them earlier in the season around Christmas. What is it
going to take to beat them now at this point? Can you talk about the play of
the game?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's going to take a tremendous defensive effort. It's going to
take control in the boards better than we have. They're such a great passing
team. They run the triangle offense with great efficiency, because they're so
skilled and they pass and they read and they make shots.  
And they've got people, obviously, that can make plays. Create. So we've got
our hands full. We have a great challenge. But I have a lot of confidence in
this team. They've been on this stage. They understand what it's going to take
and they just have to bring it. It's not a time to do anything other than step
up and bring your A game, individually and collectively we have to be on.  
  
Q. Along that line, do you guys have to score more tomorrow night than you
have been to win this game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. We've got to make shots. Alexis Hornbuckle has got
to score for us. I challenged both those guards last night. Alberta made
shots, made plays. Shannon. I gave Shannon the green light. I was in her ear
constantly telling her get in the corner, look for the 3 ball. I thought she
and Alberta responded really, really well.  
For whatever reason, Alexis just couldn't make shots. I don't know if she put
too much pressure on herself. Hopefully we get in the national championship
game and we can be a little relaxed, a little more relaxed with certain
players.  
I thought Vicki Baugh played with a lot of freedom last night. We had Alex
Fuller come in, she's been shooting the ball great. Rushed. I would have said
that she would be a player that would come in and help settle us down.  
So we were overanxious. We were really overanxious offensively. And after
watching the tape, I'm even more convinced of that. So we've got to have some
composure and be more relaxed offensively.  
  
Q. What do you remember about recruiting Shannon and Nicky?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, with Nicky, obviously I just remember going up and going
to school with her and going and just sitting on a bench with Nikki Caldwell
and just getting to know her a lot better.  
We went over to visit with Nicky and her coaches and her mom came, Ngozi.
She's about five-foot-four. That may be stretching it a little bit. Ngozi came
in and sat down and she goes, oh, Pat Summitt -- she said, I just want you to
know that my daughter's going to play for you. And Nicky was sitting between
us and she punched her mother, like, Mom, because she already set up visits to
go to Georgia and Duke, and come to Tennessee and her mother was a big reason
she came here.  
And I asked her mother why. And she just said, I have watched you coach for
many years. I think you're a strong role model for women and I want my
daughter to be in that setting.  
And even when Nicky came on a visit and she called her mother, she said, put
Pat on the phone, and she goes: She's coming there, don't worry. (Laughter).
So Ngozi, I don't know if you know the story, but when she came from Africa to
New York, and they lived in the Projects. She had Nicky and some of the older
children help raise the younger son. And she went back to get her degree and
she -- her first classroom she walked in was in the sixth grade. And she went
on to graduate from high school and go to nursing school. She's a self-made
woman and a woman I have tremendous respect for.  
And Shannon, I never actually went to New York and visited with her family.
They came on an official visit. Her mom and dad were very supportive. Rutgers
got involved late. I thought there was a good possibility there that we might
lose out in the end. But I think the fact that they had so many guards, and I
said: Shannon, look, just look around. It's not a matter of will you play,
it's a matter of you've got to come and play a lot of minutes here at
Tennessee. And I think in the end I think her parents and her high school
coach, they were very instrumental in helping us seal the deal in the end.  
  
Q. Do you remember sitting on a bench with Nicky?  
COACH SUMMITT: Yeah, it was out on Staten Island overlooking the water.  
  
Q. I know you have family here, Mom's here, and others who helped teach you
basketball. Everyone knows it's competitive. Where does that drive come in
you, the drive that makes you swing at a raccoon and try to put your own
shoulder back in place?  
COACH SUMMITT: I grew up on a dairy farm and cows don't take a day off. You
milk twice a day. Fortunately we were in school. I didn't have to milk in the
morning. But I went and helped my mother and my dad. My parents are the
hardest working people I've ever known in my life.  
And I just remember my dad taking me out to a hay field and leaving me there
and saying, you need to bale this hay. And I said, Dad, I've never done that.
Or actually rake it. I said, I've never done that. He said, well, you're going
to do it today.  
So I got on the tractor. He drove off. And I got it done. And he came back in
about four hours. And I said, how does it look? He said, it's fine. Got in the
truck, took off. And we raised tobacco. I was in the tobacco fields early and
stayed there late. Typically if I was going to plow tobacco, I would take a
sack lunch with me. And I did that for hours upon hours.  
And as far as the basketball part of it, at night, after we finished all of
our chores, we went and played in a hay loft. We had lights. And we had the
neighborhood kids come over and we had some knock-down, drag-out, one-on-one,
two-on-two. My brother Tommy, who played at Austin Peay, I'm still mad at him
because he didn't go to Tennessee, because he was recruited to play at the
University of Tennessee. He chose a different route.  
But he was just tough and they didn't take it easy on me. They just would run
over me. But that was okay. So that's just a little bit of background on how I
grew up and I just -- I admire my parents so much. My mother, she's here.
She's 84 years old. She's had seven ankle operations. She's had all kinds of
-- she had to have her knee fixed, her shoulders. She just keeps going. She's
my inspiration.  
  
Q. In your time, in all the NCAA tournaments, can you remember anybody
having a tournament like Candice Wiggins has had carrying her team, scoring
over 40 points twice, putting up the 25 last night? Anyone you can remember
coming close to that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Sheryl Swoopes. Texas Tech. I don't know how many points she
put up. I know in that championship game she dominated when they played Ohio
State, I believe it was, in Atlanta.  
That would be the only person that comes to my mind right off. And I don't
know her stat line. But what Candice did in the regionals and what she did
here, it's just so impressive. And obviously just the confidence that she's
playing with and the efficiency.  
  
Q. I'm not trying to be antagonistic and I hope you don't take it this way,
but is it fair to blame the media for the feud angle when you and Geno have
been going tit-for-tat back at that end. When the series got cancelled, you've
been around long enough to know that this was going to be a story, and when
there's been no definitive definition before, can you really say it's unfair
that this story is still around?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I think it's fair to say that because of all the unknown,
that people are still digging and interested and writing about it. I can
respect that from the media. It doesn't mean that I'm going to reveal
anything. But that's just -- when I make my mind up, I'm as stubborn as my
father was.  
  
Q. You say your mom's your inspiration. How does it feel to have her here at
the games? And then also how important is the role of the fans at these games?
How do those two things tie together? One, your mom, how do you feel about
that, and how important are the fans?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it's great to have my mom with me. She's spent a lot of
time with me in the last couple of years after the death of my dad. Everyone
else lives at home. She's got 18 grandkids and great grandkids combined. So I
brought my whole family here. My brothers, their wives, kids, everybody. I
said, I hope I get a good bonus. But my family is just -- they're just so
important.  
And our fans are amazing. It's like senior night, I'm standing out there with
those seniors and there's probably 22,000 people in the gym, and, I mean, we
had the best attendance we've ever had this year.  
And just seeing all the orange when I walked out last night, it was amazing. I
had no idea that we'd have as many people here. I know we had about six
charter flights come in on private planes, which was great. Bruce Pearl was
here. I didn't get to see him. But I just appreciate the relationship I have
with Bruce and obviously Dr. Petersen and his wife Carol. And our
administration is there to support us in a huge way. But our fans, a lot of
these fans come are from all over the country.  
Nashville I had a lady walk up and say that she was from Montana. And I'm
like: What are you doing here? And she said: I've just been a Tennessee fan
forever. So I just appreciate all of our fans.  
  
Q. I wanted to get you to talk a little bit about your starting five,
because it seems like the more you talk about the way they come through for
you, it seems like -- that last play in the game last night, it's like they do
exactly what you need them to do in those crucial situations. Kind of like an
autopilot situation for you almost.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, just like what we did last night, we flattened out, and
we've practiced this, late-game situations. Probably not as much as I should.
Because we haven't had the close games in the regular season at times that
you're going to have when you get into post season play.  
But I think that the composure comes from the experience and the confidence
that they have. They're a team that -- I don't think people like appreciate
how they play defense. And you really -- it's hard to explain it until you go
against it. And like our practice guys have made us so much better. They go
against our practice guys, it's brutal. It's like we got in post season, I
tell the practice guys, don't foul anyone, don't touch anyone.  
They were I'm sure they felt like little sissies out there standing around.
Because of how our team, they know one way to play on the defensive end when
they're in their man to man, and that's just to go after it. And coming down
the stretch last night, the composure they had I think is because they've been
there. They've been there. They were there a year ago. And I think the fact
that they've been to Final Fours and they have a lot of confidence in each
other, I think that really helps us.  
  
Q. How do they rate against past teams?  
COACH SUMMITT: The Holdsclaw, Catchings, Jolly, Randall group, that group was
a great starting five.  
I think if you compare, the Holdsclaw group was -- that they were a better
offensive team. Not necessarily a better defensive team. But they were a
better offensive team from all spots.  
  
Q. To follow up on the comment about Coach Auriemma, did you anticipate if
the game had come to play that you were going to have to answer the questions
about the series, what was your tact going to be? And, secondly, can you give
us an indication of what it's going to take to mend the fences from your point
of view, if in fact there's a rift that needs to be mended?  
COACH SUMMITT: I hadn't really thought about the questions that I might get
asked, because I wasn't going to really talk about anything, other than
players. I have tremendous respect for Geno's coaching skills and abilities
and I think he made us better. They beat us enough that it made us better.  
And the fact that we're not both here today, it's not going to change what I
want to say or talk or what it takes to mend it. I haven't even gone there. My
mind right now is on trying to figure out how we can win one more game against
a great basketball team. And that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. A moment ago you talked about the composure your team has shown. Can you
talk about Stanford's composure, especially since, aside from Wiggins, they're
a pretty young roster and what they've done in this tournament to this
point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Great composure. Well-oiled machine. They are clicking on all
cylinders. They have great composure. They answer runs. They make plays. I'm
just totally impressed with their team and how they all fit together and play
together.  
  
Q. Candace Parker has been through a lot. Are you worried about how much she
has left?  
COACH SUMMITT: Her tank was just about empty last night emotionally. I think
it's more the emotional part of it than anything. I'm hopeful that she can get
some rest. That's a key thing. I think she's spent a lot of time with Jenny in
rehabbing, but I think her shoulder responded and hopefully that time won't be
as extensive now that she is in a better place.  
But she needs rest. She needs rest. I mean, Candace Parker was not Candace
Parker last night, in terms of offensively. And I think she'll be much better
on Tuesday night.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you the same question I asked Candace. To what extent
was there any conversation in terms of maybe allowing her to stay another year
or did she just come in and say: Coach, I've made up my mind, I'm going even
though I've got eligibility left?  
COACH SUMMITT: Candace, I didn't know what she was going to do. There's always
rumors flying all around, until she said she was going to go through senior
night, and she did ask me, why haven't you asked me to stay? And I said, well,
Candace, I would love for you to stay, but it's strictly your decision. She's
a very bright student. If she stayed she'd be in grad school.  
But I think Candace has mapped out everything from wanting to win a national
championship to then playing in the Olympics and the WNBA. She kind of mapped
out her path or the path she wanted to take for the next couple of years at
least.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you to look back a little bit and forward a little bit,
if you don't mind. You talked about Tara changing as a coach. Can you think
about the coach you were in your formative years and how you might have
changed? And then looking forward a little bit, have you thought about how
much more time you want to give to this crazy sport, how many more titles you
want to win?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've changed so much, I don't even know myself at times. I
think when I started out coaching I think I was so tough on players and so
demanding and I think I've come to realize that they really don't care how
much you know until they know how much you care.  
And it wasn't that I didn't care about them, I just don't think -- probably
this is how I grew up -- that I had the skills of sitting down and
communicating and knowing when to raise my voice and when to be soft, and I
think I treated every player about the same.  
And that was just my inexperience. I took the job when I was 22 years old. I
had four players 21. I thought I was going to be a graduate assistant. Well, I
made a stipend of $250 a month. And not having ever coached a day in my life,
I was just trying to get through it. I was reading books. I was calling
people. Coach Moore, who is my Olympic coach, my mentor, helped me
tremendously. My brother, Tommy, who also coached high school basketball. I
went home. I met with him about what are we going to do here, what am I going
to run on offense, what am I going to run on defense.  
I remember I coached my first game. I call home and my mother, my sweet
mother, answers the phone. She didn't even ask me if we won. And all she
wanted to do: How are you doing? Are you enjoying it? How's your team? I was
like, oh, just put Dad on the phone, let's get this over with.  
So my father, who never has said hello in his life, he goes: All right. And I
was waiting for it. And he goes: Did you win? I said, no, sir, we got beat.
And he goes: By how much? And I go: One point. Long pause. I knew he was going
to blame me. Long, long pause. And he goes: Well, let me just tell you one
thing, Trisha. Don't take donkeys to the Kentucky Derby.  
And I knew what he was telling me. You gotta get players. I thought I had a
pretty good team. But that stuck with me.  
And it's all about recruiting great players and having the talent. And I think
I learned so much in those first years about myself and I've changed because I
want these student-athletes to know they are family to me and they're
daughters to me and they will to be for the rest of their lives.  
How long am I going to do this? I don't know. When I walk on the court for
practice, I love practice. I mean, I love practice. I can't wait to go to
practice. It's like the highlight of my day.  
When I go to practice and I step on the court and I don't have that in my
heart, I'm not going to cheat the players. I'll walk away. I don't think I'll
do it in the middle of the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Quianna Chaney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18071)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined at the podium by LSU head coach Van Chancellor,
Quianna Chaney and Erica white.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Tough way to lose a basketball game. I really feel for our
seniors. They have done everything I've asked them to do since I was appointed
LSU coach. And they've done so much and overcome so much and I'm really proud
of them graduating. They do such a great job. And I am sorry I couldn't help
them win.  
Ask the players questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Erica and Q, if you could just sort of say what was going on on that last
play?  
ERICA WHITE: Candace Parker took the ball, drove it the length of the floor,
and I think someone came over to double. She ditched the ball to a teammate,
missed an open layup. They got the rebound and got a second chance at it.
That's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Can you tell me what was going through your mind as it happened and as it
unfolded?  
ERICA WHITE: Personally I was thinking just trying to keep the ball in front
of us, try to stop the ball. That's something that we didn't do. We let
Candace Parker drive the ball the length of the floor. And I was just thinking
just block out, try to get a rebound. And that's something else that we didn't
do.  
  
Q. After you made the two free throws, Erica, to put you all up, did you
feel pretty good about your chances if you all could play some defense
there?  
ERICA WHITE: Yeah, I definitely felt good about our chances. I knew I'd knock
it down. And I felt confident in our defense. But we just didn't make a play.
We failed to make a play at the end and I think with seven seconds to go, we
turned Tennessee one time, if we made Candace Parker just cross the ball over
one time, I think we'd win. But we failed to do that and so we lost.  
  
Q. Could both of you talk about the game that Sylvia played today and what
that says about her?  
ERICA WHITE: I think that it says that Sylvia's a competitor and that she's
not going to back down from any challenge. She's been hearing about Candace
Parker all week, and she knew that she was going to go up against a tough
player. But at the same time she knows what she brings to the game, and 20
rebounds and 24 points is a heck of a game for anyone to have one time, but
Sylvia's done that many times in her career.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree. She came out. She did the best she can do. Like Erica
said, 20 points and got a lot of rebounds, 24 points and 20 rebounds, what
more could you ask for?  
  
Q. I realize it's fresh, but I'm not going to get a chance to ask you
tomorrow, can you reflect a little bit on your careers and how you're seniors
and this was your last game for LSU?  
ERICA WHITE: I think we've had an awesome career here. For any team to make it
to the Final Four one time, I don't care what anyone says, is an
accomplishment. For us to get here every year is definitely something that no
one can discredit. We have done some amazing things here.  
I think that one thing, we just lacked in confidence on the offensive end. And
Coach Van has done an excellent job in helping us with that this year, but for
whatever reason we just weren't confident tonight.  
But I think our legacy will be one that definitely did the job in building up
the LSU program and giving it -- putting the LSU program on the national
stage.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I agree. As a senior, the things that we've done -- we've done
some great things that a lot of teams haven't done, five straight Final Fours,
who wouldn't love to be here.  
So I will say that I enjoy my years here at LSU.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is this the toughest loss you've experienced in your career?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, especially when I thought we had it won, and I had it
won, but had a great shot. Up 1, they've got to go the full length of the
court. And it's really a tough loss when I think about these kids and what all
they have gone through for four years. I really feel for them.  
  
Q. Did you see where Sylvia was when the last bucket was made? Could you see
where she was?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Yeah, she had gone over to help double-team Parker. That
wasn't Sylvia's fault.  
  
Q. Just on that play, was that a problem that Candace was able to get that
far down court that quickly, did you see that?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought the problem was we were wanting to turn her, never
did turn her one time. She got down to the other end on the basket. In seven
seconds she had time to get the ball to the other end, missed a shot and pass
it, miss a shot and get a rebound. That's a lot of time.  
  
Q. This might be too fresh, but where does LSU go from here?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: That would be about the least concern that I have in the
whole world. I don't mean that bad, it's just how I see it.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at the game as a whole, you guys really battled
back, especially at the end. Do you feel like this is a game that you deserve
to win?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Not the way we played. I thought it was a game we could have
won. I think when you shoot 30-something percent, 11 percent and 38 percent
from the free throw line, you have a chance to win it at the end. You're lucky
you had a shot.  
Offensively, all the things I've been trying to instill in this team and I
thought I had, they all came back tonight. We didn't play with the confidence
offensively. We played with it defensively.  
  
Q. Sylvia looked like she was playing hurt. At the end was she hurt?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: The reason she's not here. She's bad cramping, it was all we
could do to keep her in the game at the end.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team in the locker room after the game?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I felt bad for them. I told them, I feel bad in some way,
somehow, I was unable to help them win. I can't explain to you what all this
team has gone through in the last year and a half. And I just wanted them to
experience winning a game at the Final Four, and I just felt bad because some
way, somehow, I couldn't help them get there.  
  
Q. Did you feel they were doing -- you've played them twice this year
before, did you feel they were doing something different against Sylvia,
trying to keep her off her spots early in the game anyway?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: If you want my honest opinion, we got her 24 shots. We
haven't got her 24 shots all year. We were getting the ball to Sylvia right
where we wanted it. That was not our problem. Then they doubled us because we
couldn't make a shot from anywhere else.  
  
Q. Coach, can you describe who was supposed to be on that side with
Hornbuckle? Seemed like everybody went to Parker.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I don't think it's fair to the player. I won't describe
that. You want to describe it, you can. I'm not one of those who is going to
blame players. I should have done something different to help my players to
not have been in that position. I was trying to turn Parker and I couldn't get
that done and that cost a mismatch.  
  
Q. How affected by the harness do you think that Parker was?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: How what?  
  
Q. How affected by the apparatus, by the --  
COACH CHANCELLOR: No question, she ain't never been 6 for 27 in her life. She
had a gutted performance tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll do some opening statements, and questions for the
student-athletes. We're joined up here by Tennessee head coach Pat Summitt, as
well as student-athletes Candace Parker, Shannon Bobbitt and Alexis
Hornbuckle.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously I'm very proud of our basketball team, because we
fought through a lot of adversity tonight. Did not shoot the ball particularly
well, and that really at times I thought could have affected our defense.  
But I thought our defense, for the most part, had some great stops and stands,
and that's what you have to have when you're shooting the ball poorly. And
obviously we couldn't figure out how to get to the free throw line. When I
look at those two things, just thinking that it was difficult for us. I mean,
we were 2 for 7 from the line. Obviously they got to the line a lot more than
we did.  
But I'm just proud of our team for fighting through some adversity, when
things wouldn't go our way, for whatever reason. I thought our defense did
step up and also I thought we had different players step up and help us out
tonight, and that was huge for us.  
A little bit more balance, at least in terms of trying to get people involved.
Obviously, Alberta did a great job for us in that regard. I just thought we
hung tough. Shannon had some big plays for us, and obviously Candace was a
target and had a target on her back all night. But she stood tough as well.  
So a good win for us, just proud of this team. We're back where we wanted to
be and it's because they fought through adversity and never quit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, could you kind of go over that last shot and did you realize you
hadn't made a shot all night before the last few seconds?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I mean, of course I realized I didn't make a shot all
night. It was frustrating, but at the same time I knew I couldn't give up on
myself and my team. It's bigger than yourself when you come to the Final Four.
I just wanted to stay positive and I crashed the boards and I looked up and I
said, I don't want to pull this down; with my luck, I might as well try to tip
it in. And luckily it went in.  
  
Q. Can you describe what your limitations were? Seemed like you weren't
running the court with the same ferocity but you went to the boards after an
initial hesitation. Can you talk about that?  
CANDACE PARKER: First, I want to say how proud I am of my team. They really
stepped up and gutted it out and were great teammates. And, secondly, I feel
like early on I was a little hesitant. I feel like in the game I was a little
hesitant to go to my counter and be able to go to my left hand. But Coach got
in my ear about rebounding midway through the first half, and I just went in
there and just wanted to give it everything I had.  
  
Q. Could you guys just talk about the defensive effort tonight on your side
of -- both sides, for that matter?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously LSU is a very defensive team, as are we. And we just
knew that we couldn't let them get easy looks. Coach talked about the high-
low. And we really looked at the North Carolina game that they played in and
we realized that they did a good job of working the high-low. So we knew we
had to take that away.  
And obviously get out on Quianna Chaney, she's a great 3-point shooter. Those
are the two things we looked at. I think we did a really good job of -- we
held them to 18 points in the first half.  
  
Q. Candace, could you talk about the last play, what was going through your
mind? Were you told to pass, because you've had a tough shooting night or what
was your strategy on that last play?  
CANDACE PARKER: No, I really want to say I'm happy my team still had
confidence in me after this game, shooting as poorly as I did, to put the ball
in my hands at the end of the game. That's what I wanted. I knew I wanted to
just come down and create, whether it was a shot or a pass, whatever it was. I
just wanted to come down. We've worked on that in practice a number of times
and been in those situations. So I was just going to take what the defense
gave me.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about your shoulder, how it might have affected you
throughout the game? I saw you wince a couple of times. And if you changed
anything from the last round until tonight's game, knowing that it might be a
different game for you?  
CANDACE PARKER: I made the decision to step out on the court. I'm not going to
make any excuses about my shoulder or anything like that. It's fine. I'm going
to continue with the same rehab process. And just go from there. I'm really
excited that we're in Tuesday's game.  
  
Q. Shannon, don't look shocked that someone's asking you a question. I saw
that. Several times during the night Pat would pull you aside and talk to you
by yourself. What would she say to you and how would you assess how you ran
your team tonight?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: At times when we were in the clutch times, she would tell me
keep my composure and be the great point guard that I am and make sure I get
my teammates involved and stay positive throughout the whole game.  
COACH SUMMITT: And hunt shots (laughter).  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about Sylvia Fowles today and the effort she gave?
Obviously she doesn't want to go out with a loss.  
CANDACE PARKER: She's a great player. She's really improved every year and I
think that's what makes her special. Obviously having led her team to the
Final Four four times that she's been on here. And I really just think that
she's going to do great things at the next level and obviously, you know, we
were competitors when we step on the court. But off the court she's a great
person and I'm really excited about what she's done in her career.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Pat, did you get the sense that running the floor hard was bothering
Candace's arm, because the last couple of games she's been flying down to the
low post and she wasn't doing that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I really thought tonight just watching Candace, I thought
Candace's emotionally struggling. Just what she's been through and also I
don't think Candace has had a lot of sleep. She's spent a tremendous amount of
hours in her rehab.  
First thing I ask her pregame today is did you sleep. She said -- I guess she
had taken about a two-hour nap. But I think just what she went through
emotionally, can I play? Is my shoulder going to come out again? And I think
she was a little emotionally spent.  
But I just kept trying to be positive with her. And encourage her. But I think
there were times early on she took some possessions off on the defensive end
because of fatigue. And she needs a lot of rest between now and Tuesday night.  
  
Q. Seemed though in spite of all that her ferocity as a competitor still
came out?  
COACH SUMMITT: It did. I mean, I was probably a little demanding on her in the
first half. I knew at halftime I needed to switch my approach and just really
be positive with her, because I realized that she was a little emotionally
whipped, and that she was a little frustrated, too.  
We weren't getting any opportunities to go to the free throw line, and she was
taking it hard to the basket. And obviously Sylvia, she's a tough defender,
and so I think Candace got a little frustrated.  
In the second half I realized for the whole team that my role was one of a
cheerleader. And I compliment my assistants, they gave me a lot of good
suggestions, what to run offensively and defensively. And for the most part I
was really just trying to be very engaged with the emotional level of our team
and keep things positive.  
  
Q. Pat, still with everything that was going on with Candace, you still put
it in her hands for the last play. What was your strategy? What did you tell
your team right before then? What did you want her to do?  
COACH SUMMITT: I mean, the first thing that Nikki Caldwell says is we gotta
get the ball to Candace. I didn't disagree with her. I think when you have the
best player in the game, the best player needs to have the ball in her hands
when the game's on the line.  
And I trusted Candace to make the play for us, and I thought it might also
draw attention and we might be able to get someone else an open look if they
decided to double. But as things turned out, obviously you gotta give Alexis a
lot of credit. She's come up with some big plays for us in late seconds.  
But I still -- I'd do it over and over and over. You give your best player,
your best offensive player the ball.  
  
Q. Pat, could you just kind of go over from your viewpoint, watching that
last few seconds on that last possession, what you saw and did you think it
was over with when Anosike missed the first shot?  
COACH SUMMITT: I was fearful it was over with just because of the clock. And
then Alexis comes up and makes a tremendous play. If you look at Alexis, and
I've said this, she's one of the most athletic guards I've ever coached. She
struggled tonight. I just really felt like it would be hard for us to win if
Alexis didn't play well offensively.  
But at that time when she went up, I went straight to the clock, and I
realized then that we had time to get the shot off when I saw her go up. I
looked up at the time and the next thing I know it's going in.  
  
Q. Pat, you mentioned that Candace was tired there in the second half. You
took her out for a while, maybe a couple minutes or so there. Decent stretch.
What's the risk and reward to keeping her out or putting her back in?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I mean, it's really kind of a guessing game. But I think
just knowing Candace as well as I do, I thought, you know, Candace just needs
a little breather, because she was fatigued.  
But I really -- I firmly believe it was more emotional than anything. She
wanted to help her team. She was willing to lay things on the line. But I just
-- as I said, she's been through a lot emotionally in the last couple of days.
And I just -- I felt like if I could get her just a little bit of rest, it
might give her two or three quality possessions after she went back in the
game. And she did some good things.  
  
Q. Pat, could you just give your impressions of Stanford?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, we lost to Stanford earlier in the year. And they're
a great basketball team. They're a team that plays very well together. I just
-- I didn't get to watch all the game tonight. But what I saw, I just think
that they have a lot of offensive weapons. They have more offensive weapons
than we've shown we have. We're going to have to have a little more balance.  
And having played them at Stanford -- and I know they're a much better team
now -- but I think I'm glad that we've played them, because we at least know
their personnel. We know some of just some of their tendencies.  
But they're a great basketball team. And Candice Wiggins is playing terrific
for them and providing the kind of leadership by example and vocally that you
need if you're going to be a championship team. We've got our work cut out for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, knowing your history with Connecticut and the big rivalry you've
had for years with them, is there any love loss that you won't be able to play
them in the final game?  
COACH SUMMITT: I haven't even thought about it. All I did was watched to see
who was going to win that game. And my mind was on LSU the whole way. I have a
tremendous amount of respect for Tara VanDerveer and what she's done. And
right now I think her basketball team, they definitely showed they could play
at this level and be a championship level team. So we just gotta get ready.  
  
Q. Anything you're going to specifically try to overcome and work on before
Tuesday?  
COACH SUMMITT: We will. I'll go back and meet with our staff. And they've done
a lot of scouting. At this time of the year, I'm more into letting them do the
scouting and trying to get our team prepared in what sets we want to run and
they tell me what action we have to defend.  
But I will definitely, in the next 24 hours, learn a lot more about the action
that Stanford runs. But bottom line, they just -- they're a skilled basketball
team that shares the ball very well. They're tough on the defensive end and on
the boards.  
So it's going to be a big challenge for us, but I'm just excited that we put
ourselves in the position to be in the national championship game.  
  
Q. What did you tell Van after the game after a game like that and how do
you think LSU played late?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I told Van that obviously they played a great game and
it's a tough way to lose a game like that. And he had done a great job. I just
wanted to compliment him and get a chance to say something to Sylvia and what
a great game she had and what a great player she is.  
And I had some tough losses. I don't remember having one quite like the way
the game ended tonight. I'm sure I did, as long as I've been in the game. But
I knew when it came down to the wire that whatever happened, it was going to
be tough.  
And I'm just thankful that Alexis came up and made a big play and we hung in
there and found a way to win. I'm not sure how, by looking at this stat sheet.
It's confusing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2008

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

### [Ketia Swanier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18486)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined up here by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma,
as well as student-athletes Ketia Swanier and Renee Montgomery.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement. We'll take questions for the
student-athletes, and then back to you.  
COACH AURIEMMA: At this time of the year, especially in this environment,
unless you win, there's really not a lot that you can say that's going to make
any of the players up here, any of the players in the locker room feel any
better.  
There's no words to describe what it means to put everything, your heart and
soul into something and come up short.  
The one thing I will say is it's unfortunate that the season comes down to one
weekend and if it doesn't go your way, the other five months seem to have no
meaning. And that's why this is such a difficult game to lose, or the next
game if you lose that one, because all you remember now, today, at this point,
is what happened in those 40 minutes. You don't remember all the things that
led to getting here.  
So I want them to remember the things that they did to get here and what our
seniors accomplished. And life's thrown a lot of things at us this particular
season. Took away two of our players. Limited one of them. And now the
fairytale didn't have a happy ending. But that's life.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ketia, you got into foul trouble early in this one on Candice, how much
do you think that played a role in not being able to come back there at the
end?  
KETIA SWANIER: I mean, I thought Lorin came in and did what she had to do.
Stanford just executed their offense very well and we didn't hit shots. We
lost to a really good team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, you broke with tradition this year cutting down the
nets at the regional finals, getting the seniors here. Do you think you were
too focused on getting to the Final Four and not winning the national
championship?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: No, our ultimate goal was to win a national championship. I
think the Final Four was just a hurdle that we had to overcome.  
  
Q. How much better was Stanford this time around?  
KETIA SWANIER: They were a lot better. They just didn't have a key focus on
one or two players. Everybody on our team stepped up and instead of having to
guard only two players, you have to guard all five players on the floor. And
they executed their offense really well. They move around a lot. And that's
the big difference, just everybody pretty much stepping up on their team than
at the beginning of the year.  
  
Q. Stanford was able to contain Maya it seemed like a lot in the first half
but in the second half she really started going. How much confidence did you
have in her and your team and thinking you were going to be able to come back
when she started hitting the 3s and everything else she did in the second
half?  
KETIA SWANIER: I don't think our team just relies on Maya Moore. The whole
time I never doubted everybody on the floor thought we were going to lose,
even when Maya was missing shots. There was never a point in time we thought
we were going to lose. We played hard the whole way through and you can't
depend on one player hitting shots. Everybody has to do their part, especially
this time of the year.  
  
Q. Obviously the first time you played them you had Mel and Kalana and
Kalana is such a great defensive player, how much did you miss them this time
around?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: A lot. I think we missed them all year, but this game it
really showed. We had to have shorter people guarding Candice a lot. She was
able to get her shot off pretty much any time she wanted. In the beginning in
the Virgin Islands when we had Kalana and Mel, it was tougher for her to get
shots off. We missed them all year, but yeah, definitely it showed up tonight.  
  
Q. Can you pinpoint just a couple of areas where you think if maybe we could
have done this or done that, you might have been able win?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: If we could have executed better on offense, I think really
if we could have made some more shots. We really got a lot of open looks and
pretty much throughout the season we've made the majority of those shots and
it's gotten us momentum, then we continue to make more shots. But I think when
we were getting wide open looks and we were missing them, it was just tough
because it's shots that we usually make and it's part of our offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, both of you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Do you think they beat you the way you beat a lot of teams by being
really smart? You've been on the other end of that a lot.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Oh, yeah. Yeah. They didn't make too many mistakes today. And
I think the first ten minutes of the game kind of set the tone for the game.
And one of the things that happened during that first ten minutes was, you
know, the way we play that got us here and just really would kind of stun
people, you know, with the runs that we would go on, bad coaching. We
shouldn't have played like that today.  
Now, you hate to say you want to change the way you play when you get to the
Final Four, but as Renee said, this is the one team we can't match up with
without the two guys that were hurt. Like any other team, you don't
necessarily have to guard all five of them. And they don't guard you. So we
were caught in a situation where they were able to do things to us that we
couldn't do to them. And we needed them to miss some shots and they didn't,
which is what they did in the Virgin Islands.  
Every shot they missed in the Virgin Islands they made it today. Every one.
And that first ten minutes, I'll bet you we spent nine minutes on defense that
first ten minutes. They would come down, run their stuff for about 25 seconds,
get the shot they wanted. We run down, make a pass, sometimes we'd stall and
make two passes. Every once in a while it would be a full-blown delay and we'd
get three passes and somebody would take an open shot. Now, if those go in
like they did for the majority of the season, then it's a different ball game.
But they didn't.  
In retrospect, we didn't do enough to make them play more defense than they
had to. And the thing that got us here hurt us in the end. And when we cut it
to 47-46, I think it was, Wiggins made two straight 3s. Then Pedersen makes
one. They didn't make those in November.  
Stanford played a lot better today. They're a lot better team than they were
back in November and they played the game today the way we usually play it. We
got done in by our own stuff.  
As Tara said, they changed some things after they played us. They added a
couple of things that we did to them and they did them better than we did
today.  
  
Q. When you say bad coaching, what would you have done differently?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I would have used up all five of my timeouts in the first half
to slow our guys down. We couldn't slow them down. They just want to go.
That's the kind of team we are. That's the kind of people we have. They just
want to go.  
They get an open shot, they want to take it. And you can't -- at this time of
the year, you don't want to be tentative. You never want to be tentative. You
never want to be second-guessing yourself, should I shoot it, should I not
shoot it.  
So the way we play the game, when we're open, we shoot it. Well, they weren't
going in. And it was one and done and it was a constant struggle on the
defensive end, because we were down, it seemed like, the majority of the game.  
If we could have stayed on offense a little bit longer, we could have caught
our breath a little bit. Renee's probably a little bit worn out right now
since Mel got hurt. It caught up to her, the 40 minutes, 40 minutes, 40
minutes.  
And we couldn't press. I had this grand strategy. At the 10-minute mark we're
going to press the hell out of these guys. Well, got us to within 1, but we
couldn't.  
And we talked about it at halftime. The way you play Stanford you have to play
them full court. You can't play them half court. It's too much of a mismatch
for us.  
  
Q. You talked about what you had built all season and to have something kind
of just blow up in one game. Could you talk about the hurt of that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't think there's any way that you can explain the
feeling that you have when you lose this game or the national championship
game for that matter.  
Just sitting right here listening to the kids talk, you say to yourself: Man,
when we go back, you know -- somebody asked me, what are you going to tell
your players? I'm going to tell them we'll be back here next year, you can
count on that. Then you sit here and it hits you that's 365 days from now.
That's a lot of practices. That's a lot of drills. That's a lot of games.
That's a lot of travel. That's a lot of injuries, no injuries, good luck, bad
luck.  
The incredible effort that it takes to get here and in a span of 40 minutes
it's gone. And for a player -- I think that's a good word, you're walking
along great and it just blows up and it's gone. It's gone. And it's a stunned
feeling that you have to be there to experience it. You have to have been in
that situation to experience it.  
And all year long, you know, we were holding out hope that it wouldn't catch
up to us. Don't worry about it, we can do it. I heard coaches talk about it on
scouting reports. You have to get to Connecticut's guards, they don't have any
depth in the guard spot, nobody's ever tried to do that to them, gotta get
them, gotta get them, get them in foul trouble, wear them out.  
I thought they better hurry up. We only have two games left. And they got us
today.  
  
Q. Will you watch Tuesday's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I have to, I'm on the WBCA's board of directors. So I
was told I have to be here for that game. But I would watch it anyway. I would
watch it anyway. And I'm sure my players will watch it. It's part of who you
are. It's part of what you do. It's our game.  
  
Q. The people back home might have been sitting there asking: Well, why
didn't they play the pressure defense the whole game. I think I know the
answer. But you gotta say it.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. When the game started, the plan was that we would
alternate between some pressure. And if we had some success with it, we would
do more. The problem was, you don't make enough shots, so you can't get into
your pressure. You don't get to the free throw line, so you can't set up your
pressure. Your starting point guard goes down with two fouls. So now you're
really short on bodies. And I think we would have lost worse if we would have
played like that from the beginning.  
But I'm sure there's a lot of coaches out there right now that watched the
game, real and imaginary coaches, that have a lot of ideas that we could have
done differently.  
  
Q. Is it possible that you guys just ran into a team that's on a magical
run?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's always possible. And that's always the case when a team
has a really hot player. I think Candice Wiggins has been the best player in
this tournament from the very first game. And I said this yesterday, or the
day before, actually, when we had a press conference about the game, that when
the other players are making shots like they are right now for Stanford, it
gives Candice a lot more room to maneuver and a lot more room to do what she
wants to do. And then she's a really tough matchup.  
Those kids knocked in shots today that didn't even come close to going in in
November. But now they're going in. I watched the Maryland game, and they went
in in the Maryland game. And I talked to a couple friends of mine, and they
said you know what the key to beating Stanford is? I said, all right, what?
Well, Kayla Pedersen has to go one for something and Hones has to go one for
something and the other perimeter player has to go one for something and then
Wiggins and Jayne Appel can have whatever they want.  
Well, that didn't happen. And that's what makes them the team that they are
right now. They're a very difficult team to play right now. Very difficult.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined at the podium by Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel, Candice Wiggins and Kayla
Pedersen.  
Coach, when you're ready, an opening statement and we'll get started.  
COACH VANDERVEER: This is a great win for our team, our program. I'm just so
proud of all of our team. Everyone really worked hard. Connecticut is a great
team, and obviously with their success, Geno is a great coach, so we knew we
would have to play our absolute A game.  
And I think what we were able to do was we were able to keep them off the O
boards. We boxed out pretty well. We took care of the ball, especially in the
first half, not turning it over. And we didn't take -- our shot selection was
good. And I think people worked really, really hard on defense. And we had to,
because they have great talent.  
And I'm just really excited to see the improvement in our team, and I just --
we want to keep it going, obviously just one more game.  
But this is thrilling for me, personally, and for our team.  
  
Q. Candice, it was such a hurdle to get back to the Final Four, can you just
talk about the team's focus and sort of coming into this game, you know, what
everybody's mind-set was?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think, first of all, we were just -- the thing that's
driving this team is the fact we don't want to stop playing with each other.
Me especially, this is my last time I'll be able to play with this group. And
everyone, they just don't want it to end. We don't want the season to end. I
think that's what's driving this team.  
And especially you look at we lost to Connecticut. We got killed by
Connecticut back in November, just absolutely killed. And, you know, they
changed the whole dynamic of our team. And so we grouped before the game and
we said: Let's see how much better we've gotten. This is a test for ourselves
to see, you know, we're not the same team we were in November. I think that's
what we really wanted to prove to ourselves and then the country, too.  
  
Q. Jayne, about six -- I think I wrote it down in my notes -- I don't have
it here -- 6:33 left, looked like you got a little tired. Were you feeling a
little bit down and UConn seemed to have energy, but then you guys came
back?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think going into the game, UConn is a good team. They're going
to make their runs and it's a lot easier to run when you have a lot of
momentum and everything. It's how you counter those runs, I think.  
I think that we did pretty well, when they went on a run we kind of picked it
up on our end and countered that back.  
  
Q. Candice, they got within one there early in the second half and you hit
the two 3s on the wing there. What did that do to help the momentum for you
guys to never let them get the lead back?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I was kind of struggling in the beginning of the second half.
And they went to a zone. And just caught it and just made a few 3s, I think
that really helped our team's confidence, where the pressure wasn't really on
us.  
And I think just our drive and our will not to let them come back. And we
stuck together. They had runs. They're going to -- teams are going to make
runs, but I think what our team is best at is not letting that discourage us
and pulling ourselves together and saying, okay, let's stop it.  
  
Q. Kayla, at least two or three different people had part of the time on
Maya Moore, and everybody did a pretty effective job. Can you just talk about
the rotating defense that you used on her?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well, I think that our guards did a great job switching. At
the end there we switched 1 through 4, so just whoever was guarding. I think
we did a great job contesting all of her 3s and a great job, like, Jayne
helping making our layups.  
  
Q. Candice and Jayne, Kayla was so consistent, probably the most consistent
player on the floor tonight until you two got going. Freshman coming out here
playing like that in a national semifinals, what did that mean to you?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: First of all, Kayla is not a freshman. She hasn't played like
that since the first game she played in a Stanford uniform. I think it gives
us so much confidence as teammates to look at Kayla and know that every single
game she's going to go her hardest and she's got this focus and this will to
win. And Kayla might be quiet. You know inside she's so fierce and just not
going to let up for anything.  
And I think the best thing about Kayla, personally, is that, you know, she
does something, she makes any kind of mistake, you look at her, she's like:
All right, all right, I got it. She doesn't get down and hang her head. Which
I think is a rare quality, I think, to have in a freshman.  
  
Q. Candice, you guys, there was so much talk about Geno and Pat and what the
Final was going to be like. Did you feel like you guys were a little bit of a
stealth candidate here, and are you happy to disrupt the story line?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, I think we were probably slept on a little bit. A lot
of people didn't have us coming to the Final Four in the first place. I think
we've being on the West Coast we haven't been in the Final Four in a while and
we understand that maybe our names aren't as big. But that just -- that feeds
us and we have a lot of motivation behind that.  
  
Q. I haven't seen the final box scores, so I don't know your total tally,
but how important, I guess, for any of you ladies, were your rebounds,
Candice, especially with how you were able to get your defensive rebounds?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think I was sort of not necessarily a helper. But I wasn't
really focused on Maya Moore, so kind of able to let me go in there and help
the posts box out and rebound. I think rebounding in general is important. And
I think we won the rebounding margin. I think that really helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about the minute you guys got off the bench from
Jillian tonight?  
JAYNE APPEL: Tara called it. She said she was -- Jill's game in the beginning.
Jill I think has been due for a really good game. And Jill's, if you sleep --
we felt like our team was slept on, but Jill kind of had a feeling they were
sleeping on her, you know. But I think she really came off the bench and she
really got us going and had some really key plays for us and rebounds. And
Jill's just a tougher player and she's the kind of player that's really hard
to scout on her.  
  
Q. For any of the players, there's been talk of a Big East kind of bias.
Obviously, all people East Coast in general, Maryland getting the No. 1 seed,
I know you were a little disappointed with that. How much does this disrupt
the bias about East Coast women's basketball?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that from the very beginning everyone saw our faces
plastered all over ESPN at the seeding show when we got the No. 2 seed. But I
think it almost drives us more to prove not only to ourselves but to everyone
else that we can play out with the East Coast teams and just because we're on
the West Coast we have a lot of talent out there. And I think it will be a lot
more to come in the years.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: And just to add to that, I think the biggest thing is winning
games and winning games like this to show in the past maybe in these kind of
games we lose, but just I think it was important for us to show through our
play instead of through words. So that's really also another thing.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I think that them giving us a No. 2 seed they could have
done for us, because that just motivated us and gave us that extra push to
show the East Coast what we're all about.  
  
Q. Candice, what's the magic behind this year's team that has made you guys
be able to get to the Final Four and now a championship game?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know, it's the type of chemistry that you cannot fake.
You can't try to create. It just happens. And I just think it just happened
from day one. We knew this group was special. We went out to the East Coast.
We played Rutgers in our second game.  
And just those moments, we knew that this was the team. And we had two losses
to UCLA and USC earlier, and I think the biggest thing that showed me that
this team was special after the UCLA and USC losses nothing changed. We didn't
say we're not a good team anymore. We knew we were still a good team and we
just had two bad games and I think that's the best thing that happened to us
this season, too. We kept it going. We didn't let that make us crumble.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, student-athletes.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jumping forward here, who would you like to play in two days?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I have no choice. I mean, we are so excited to be playing in
the championship game. We play Tennessee -- we've played Tennessee the last
two years and we played LSU in the regional final two years ago. So we're
semi-familiar with both teams, and I'm just more concerned about our team and
us playing well.  
And our team is really excited.  
  
Q. Is there any particular way that you're going to change your game plan
heading into the next ball game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No way. We're just going to come out and do what we've been
doing all year and just absolutely -- just do the best that we can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the advantage from playing the earlier game and maybe
having a chance to go out at least in the second half and look at both teams
and seeing which ones you might be facing in the next round?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I love playing the first game. Just such a long day anyway.
And to sit there and just to play the first game is great. And as soon as I
can, I'll be out there watching the tip-off and try to just figure out who
we're going to play and what we need to do.  
  
Q. I asked them about Kayla and just to see what she did until Candice and
Jayne found their touch a little bit. How important was that in her
performance?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought it was huge. I think that was the real key for us.
I thought we were working hard defensively, but Kayla hitting her outside
shot, Kayla hitting her high post shot, it didn't allow them to stay in that
extended two-three defense.  
I think actually the fact that they had -- Swanier was in foul trouble in the
first half, might have been really the thing that hurt them the most.  
But with the two fouls, they were out of their rhythm a little bit. But Kayla
made big plays. Obviously then Jayne and Candice had huge plays.  
  
Q. Couple of questions. One, Connecticut is known for their come-backs and
having big runs, but your team looked very confident. What did you tell your
girls to keep them confident the whole time and not rattled? And, two,
Stanford has obviously had the longest wait to get back to the Final Four
stage. Is a championship going to mean more to your program than any of the
other teams here?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, as far as I really didn't tell our team anything
special. I just said these are things we need to do. And our team really takes
a game plan to heart. And they really worked hard at not allowing Connecticut
to do the things that Connecticut does so well and is so good at. They love to
run. They love to get on the O glass.  
So we really worked hard at that. The fact that we played Connecticut earlier
in the season helped us and helped people's confidence. And I think people
were upset with how we played the first time and we learned a lot from
Connecticut. They have been both Tennessee and Connecticut have been the gold
standard for women's basketball. And so they both have helped us get here.  
As far as the second question was what?  
  
Q. Is it going to mean more to your program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Will it mean more to us? A national championship would mean
-- I mean, it would just be awesome for any team. I think that you look at
LSU. They've been here five times and haven't won. I know it would mean a lot
to them.  
With Tennessee, I'm sure it would mean a lot to them. But, you know, we're
just going to give it our absolute best effort. And it would be very
meaningful to our team and to me personally.  
  
Q. Was there a point in the season where you knew that your team was capable
of making it to the Final Four and even advancing to the championship game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I never thought about it. I never looked forward.
I just focused on what we were doing in practice every day, and I think that I
really focused on enjoying the journey with a special player like Candice. Not
wanting any day to be a bad day in practice. Tried to just keep it fun. Have
people relaxed and enjoying playing. And identifying things that we need to
improve on.  
And I think our perimeter shooting, our guard play, trying to keep people
healthy. I think Jill coming back was huge for us, the fact -- she was out for
basically seven weeks. But we never talked about it with our team. We never
talked to our team going to the Final Four, winning a national championship,
but when it happened, we've enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Jayne's vision and how that affected the outcome
tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think Jayne started a little bit slow, but she made
some amazing shots in there, I mean, finishing. And I think our team has great
confidence in Jayne, and she's a big target for us. She gets in deep and
scores. And I think she's an absolute franchise player. And I am just really
proud of her development. She's come a long way from her freshman year. In her
development and along with other player's development is the reason we're
here.  
Our team has improved. I made the point I think when we were -- I can't
remember what press conference it was, but we do a lot of video presentations
with our team. And this is a team that's gone from a caterpillar to a
butterfly. We have totally transformed how we've played.  
And Jayne is part of that transformation.  
  
Q. Have you had any time to sit back and reflect on what your team's been
able to accomplish, or is it just moving at lightning pace at this point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know how sometimes baseball players or basketball
players, they see the game in slow motion? To me, I'm seeing it in slow
motion. I'm thoroughly enjoying the journey.  
I think that for me personally the experiences of whether it's coaching the
Olympics or being in the Final Four before, I feel very comfortable being here
with this team and kind of helping them along, saying this is what's coming
next. And it's very different than the regular season with the press
obligations, the practices, all the excitement.  
But our team has really kept a very level head, and I think our coaching staff
has done a fabulous job. And honestly when you have leadership like Candice
Wiggins, Kayla Pedersen, very low maintenance kids, it's a fabulous
opportunity and fabulous job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2008

  

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Quianna Chaney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18071)

### [Sylvia Fowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15650)

### [Erica White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16371)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have LSU head coach Van Chancellor as well as student-
athletes Quianna Chaney, Erica White and Sylvia Fowles.  
Coach, we're going to take an opening statement from you when you're ready,
questions for the student-athletes only, and then following those we'll resume
questions for you.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: It's been an amazing deal for me. I'm amazed that a team
that's been to five Final Fours in a row has very little respect for its team.  
I get here, I turn on the television and I see you outside the lines with ESPN
and I see a guy saying it's going to be -- welcome to Monday's press
conference between Pat Summitt and Geno. Like LSU's not playing. I pick up
today's paper and I see where a coach says it's going to be a great game
between LSU and -- between Tennessee and Connecticut Tuesday.  
So I hope all of you enjoy the game. But our team's pretty good. Our team has
done some pretty nice things and I'm proud of them for what they've
accomplished. They beat a fine Oklahoma State basketball team and a great
North Carolina team.  
And so we're excited to be here. I just think this team deserves a little more
respect than what it's getting.  
Fire away at these players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Any of the players, it's being billed as the Sylvia versus Candace
matchup. When you played them both times this year, the first game it was
Quianna, Erica stepped up, scored 41 points combined. Second game in the NCAA
finals you only scored 27. How important is it going to be for the other
players besides Sylvia to step up and score on tomorrow night?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I think it's going to be very important. We don't want Sylvia
carrying the load by herself. I can say it's very important for everybody else
to step up and give us some help.  
ERICA WHITE: I agree with Quianna. It's important for us to step up. In our
program we never key in on one certain matchup. We're not looking at it as
Sylvia Fowles versus Parker. It's LSU versus Tennessee. We'll go out, compete
as a team and win as a team.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It will be extremely important. And I don't think that comes
down to a problem. My teammates have stepped up throughout the whole season
when I wasn't getting shots or things weren't going my way. So I'm pretty sure
they will step up when time needs it.  
  
Q. Sylvia, LSU has a very unusual advantage of knowing that one of their
opponents' stars is injured, which is something most teams go to great length
to prevent going into games like this. How do you think the knowledge that
Candace is injured and what the nature of her injury is will affect the
game?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: I don't know how badly she's hurt or what hurts her at this
point. But I'm pretty sure she's going to come out. She's going to be fired
and be motivated and she's going to play her game. We're looking at it as if
she's 100 percent and she's going to play well that's how we are taking
things.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the experience that you now have coming into
this weekend and if you're able to draw on experience from the past three
years?  
ERICA WHITE: Well, I definitely will say our experience is a factor, both good
and bad. Coach is talking about this. We faced elimination many times
throughout this NCAA tournament and every year we've been able to fight and
get to this point.  
And at the same time we've gotten here and kind of had a let-down, but I don't
necessarily see that happening this year because we're still a very hungry
team and our goal wasn't just to get to the Final Four again. Our goal was to
win a national championship. So we're still not satisfied. It gives us a lot
of motivation and hunger.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It has been different, but we have prepared ourselves in a
different way this year. And it has been great having Coach Chancellor on our
side, letting us see the big picture. In previous years we always had
something to play for or play against. This year we've just been free. So I'll
say it's been different coming into the tournament this year.  
QUIANNA CHANEY: I have to agree with both of these ladies. We have a new
coach, we just have new things this year.  
  
Q. Erica, to elaborate on that idea that you had so many things happen over
a four-year period: A coach with cancer and another coach who was asked to
leave, interim coach and then a new coach. How hard has it been to go through
that and how great is the stability then this season?  
ERICA WHITE: The stability has been great. But looking at all those things
we've gone through, that's really just -- that's how life is. Everyone goes
through different things. And I think what made us unique was that us being so
young, we just knew that in order to make it we were going to need to stick
together. So we're just a very resilient group.  
But Coach Gunter leaving, Hurricane Katrina, Coach Chatman leaving, Coach
Starkey being the head coach for a short period of time, then Coach Van in
here. It's a lot of different things, but that's how life is. You're going to
go through things and you just have to be able to adapt, and I think that's
what my teammates and I have been able to do.  
  
Q. Quianna, Coach Chancellor was teasing you about defense after you guys
beat North Carolina. But he's been very complimentary about you as a shooter
and how important it is for you to be able to shoot well and it seems like
your confidence has gained a lot this season. Can you talk about how he's
helped with that and how confident you are now as a shooter?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: When he first took the job he kept telling me I'm going to be
the best shooter in the SEC, the country, the world, and it made me feel good.
He would come in say I'm the best shooter. And so I start acting like I'm the
best shooter. That's how I end up getting the confidence, give me the ball I'm
going to shoot it.  
  
Q. What have you all been doing to stay relaxed this weekend? Is that a
focus? I know Coach Chancellor stresses the importance of having fun. He's
called you all the most serious-minded team I think that he's seen before. Can
you elaborate a little bit on what kind of mental focus there has been this
weekend?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Mental focus? It's there. Our mental focus is there and we're
ready to play. But outside of that, Coach Van has seen a different team since
he first got here. Yes, he said we're the up tightest team he's ever seen, but
I think yesterday we showed him a little side that he's never seen before
which was always there but we never acted that way around him. Our mental
focus has always been there and it's been there since we entered the
tournament.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate what you showed him yesterday?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: Showed him a little dance moves and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Did you teach him a few pointers?  
QUIANNA CHANEY: Nah.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: You're not supposed to tell everything that goes on down
there. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Erica, can you talk about the other two senior starters that aren't on
the podium with you, Ashley and RaShonta and how they've been role players and
doing what they needed to do during all these Final Four runs for all of you
guys?  
ERICA WHITE: I think Ashley does a tremendous job for us because she's so
smart. She's an undersized post player, but every game we usually stick her on
the best post player on the other team and she always holds her own. And I
think that's because she's so smart.  
RaShonta is an excellent defender, and so we're one of the best defenses in
the country, but that's definitely because she's on the floor as much as she
is. And I think that all five starters play a certain role. But for years
we've all accepted it and played together. I think that's why we all play so
well together and have been able to have so much success and get to the Final
Fours.  
So Ashley and RaShonta are huge for us, as well as our bench who may not play
a lot but they do a great job of encouraging us. I don't want to leave them
out.  
  
Q. Sylvia, can you talk a little bit more about competing against the likes
of Candace Parker. Obviously even this morning you guys are both up for the
Wade Trophy. It went to Stanford's fine player. Talk about being very familiar
with Candace Parker over the years and competing on and off the court.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: First and foremost, I think we're both blessed with tremendous
talent. But going up against her, she only make you better. I'm pretty sure
it's the same way for me. But just to have to challenge her on the floor make
you step the game up somewhat. You just have to go at her and do all the
things that you're capable of doing. On the defensive end you've got to do
everything that's possible to slow her down.  
So it will be a great challenge.  
  
Q. Sylvia, a male player with your combination of size and ability probably
would have been gone after a year. Certainly at most after two years. How is
the experience of staying and playing your entire college career helped you
develop not only as an athlete but also as an individual?  
SYLVIA FOWLES: It's helped me just because academic-wise, just staying in
school, getting as much education as possible, and then all the stuff that we
went through, it made me a better player and made me stronger. And with that
going through all that stuff that we went through, I think it helped me grow
for the real world once I leave college.  
  
Q. Sylvia and Erica, you're both Florida natives. Can you tell us about the
cheering sections you'll have in the arena tomorrow and who is coming, any
family coming up?  
ERICA WHITE: You know, playing the Final Four here is great that it's so close
to home. But it's also just a little bit of a burden. Everyone is calling you
and texting you saying, I only need about four tickets, I just need four
tickets. And in actuality I only got eight. I ended up with eight tickets. I
have my mother and all my sisters coming and a couple of uncles. That was the
best I could do.  
So the section will be pretty small. But I just told the rest of my family to
go catch a sports bar or something.  
SYLVIA FOWLES: For me, it will be great. It will feel good to come back home,
your last year. And to let people see what you've been doing over the past
four years at college while you were away from home. It feels good to see
where it actually started from.  
And I have my mom, my brothers, uncles and cousins coming up so I have a
little fan club.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Van, each one of these teams has a really great player. You've got Moore,
Fowles, Wiggins, Parker. Can you recall a Final Four with so many outstanding
players on each team?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I was thinking about that the other day. I think this is the
greatest star power we've had in our game. I think if you went out and asked
the average fan to name four players, they could name all four players. And I
think that's great for our game. It's truly outstanding. And I think it's very
good for the Final Four. You're going to see some players do some exceptional
things in this tournament.  
  
Q. Van, since you have now operated at the top level, Olympic-wise, NBA-
wise, and now here, can you compare your experience here now that you finally
got here with your first WNBAs and your Olympics?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Well, first of all, this has been like a kid at
Christmastime, Mel, for me, to finally make it to a Final Four with a great
group of kids to beat a great North Carolina team.  
The WNBA experiences were great but they were different. And the Olympic goal
is just unbelievable when you coach that team. But for me right now it can't
get any better than this. To have this opportunity, to finally arrive here as
a coach. But to arrive here with players you truly, really like.  
Sometimes you coach players that you can't wait until the season gets over
with. This has been a special, special year, and I've really enjoyed every
minute. So that makes that moment special.  
  
Q. Someone mentioned earlier that -- well, Pat Summitt actually mentioned
that it took her teams I believe seven Final Fours to get a national title.
You guys have been to five in a row. You obviously split the two meetings
between the teams this year. I was wondering if you can just talk about do you
find irony in that, that you have to get over Tennessee in the Final Four now
to get over that hump?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought this was ironic that everybody said the SEC was
down this year, but I didn't agree with them. I think you measure the strength
of a conference by how many teams is in the Final Four and how many teams are
in the final eight. And then I look up and LSU's trying to win their first
game at the Final Four, and you gotta beat Tennessee to do it, that's pretty
ironic, in my mind.  
I didn't sleep a wink Monday night because we qualified for the Final Four.
And I slept very little Tuesday night because I thought I was going to have to
play Pat Summitt.  
  
Q. When a team has not been to the Final Four and the coach has, the coach
can kind of let them know what to expect. But this is a unique situation where
they've been and you haven't. Have they told you what to expect?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Bob Starkey has told me what to do. I tried to coach this
team just like we were playing Tennessee in Knoxville. I've not tried to make
a big deal that we're at the Final Four. We're just playing a game.  
I think I have enough experience in other situations. I don't think my
experience at the Final Four will be a factor whatsoever. I'm more worried
about getting our players to relax and really play. We're trying to get them
to relax and play as good as they're capable of playing. I don't think LSU's
played its best games in Final Fours in the past.  
  
Q. I look at all four teams in this Final Four and I see the front courts
are excellent. I mean, the post players in this Final Four are really, really
good. Do you see rebounding and just overall post play as the key to any team
winning in this Final Four?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I think you've hit up on the key. The team that rebounds the
best probably wins the national championship. But not many shots that you miss
when Parker shoots and Wiggins shoots or Maya Moore shoots or fouls for that
matter.  
I think it comes down to making shots. But there's a lot of good power
players. But there's also a lot of good guards.  
  
Q. Van, I'm sure you watched the A &M-Tennessee game and saw Tennessee
struggling without Candace Parker. As a coach do you ever think about, like,
if you would have to play without Fowles for an extended period of time, how
you would handle that situation?   
COACH CHANCELLOR: I never thought about that because I didn't want to go over
there to that bridge that comes in on I-10 and jump off of it, if you want to
know the truth. If I would have thought that very much, I would have been
driving over in the car. Somebody said, What if she would have graduated and
come out early? I told them it wouldn't have been my problem. Judy Southard
could not have hired me. That's not a big deal. I'm not going to think about
that because I want to be able to sleep tonight, eat a little bite.  
I did think this, I did think the coaching staff at Tennessee did a marvelous
job to lose a player before the game is one thing, to lose a player during the
game and to be able to adjust. And that's what separates Pat from a lot of
coaches, great job of being down five and Parker in the locker room and
finding a way to win.  
Of course, let's understand something. Pat deserves a lot of credit, but they
don't recruit anything but All-Americans at Tennessee, so the other players
are pretty nice too. They've got pretty good players to fall back on when
Parker gets hurt.  
I could have told you Amy from our student newspaper is always going to be --
when you think there's a last question, she has a knack at that. The last time
she used the wrong end of the microphone. I'll tell you that. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Pat Summitt was asked earlier today if she expects LSU to throw any
intentionally hard screens on Parker or what she expects the nature of the
game to be like. She said: Maybe I'm not naive, but I don't expect to see any
intentional hard screens. How do you react knowing a lot of people are going
to be looking closely at the type of screens that LSU will be running on
Parker?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We're not mentioning that, that's not the way I coach. I
don't want to win a championship by hurting a athlete. I'd rather lose. I
don't believe in that. That's not our coaching style. That's not the way LSU
will ever play. We'll play a good hard game and we'll play it to the end.  
  
Q. You said during the season that you got thrown a wrinkle here, wrinkle
there, that the team hasn't seen. In this situation, there probably isn't much
the other hasn't seen. You can't change much at this point to surprise them.
What will it take to win for both teams?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We won't change anything. We would not dare think about
changing anything, not at this stage of the game. You run what you run and try
to work it. I don't think there's any doubt. Tennessee has built a national
reputation of being over a period of years -- I said this when I worked for
TV, the best offensive rebounding team to ever play the women's game. I think
you have to keep Tennessee off the offensive boards. If you don't, you can't
beat them.  
  
Q. Since the players brought it up earlier, tell us about the yacht last
night and what went on. I heard there was some dancing going on?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Amy, everything I've done is try to help our team relax and
have fun. I've been wearing shades around the lobby. I don't normally wear sun
shades and all different kinds of things. I was just -- anything -- I want
them to come here and enjoy it and get all this pressure off their back.
That's my job as their coach. Let them enjoy it. When the game gets here,
let's play. Let's get serious and let's play.  
All this worrying and listening to how many times we failed here is not
healthy for us. I told them what went on before I got to LSU does not count.
That's how I see it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2008

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Renee Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18485)

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up on the dais by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma
as well as Ketia Swanier and Renee Montgomery. Coach.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. If you're not careful when you get out to this
place, it's easy to get caught up in all the things that you have to do and
all the obligations that you have and it becomes about everything except
basketball.  
And we're all anxious to get through today and finish this part of it and
start worrying about actually playing the game tomorrow. And it's been a long
time for us to get back here, and for these players it's been something that
they've wanted to do. Ketia, since she was a freshman and obviously Renee for
the last three years.  
I think tomorrow night can't come soon enough for all of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Renee, it was written in the paper how there were six minutes to go in
the Rutgers game she looked and saw a look in your eye that said this team is
not going to lose. Is that the first time that someone has made a comment
similar about that about you, and is there something that clicks in your head
and you say I'm going to put the team on my back now and is that how you've
always been?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think it's realizing how the game is on the line, think
back how hard you've worked in the past and everything you've been through and
you look at the clock and you realize you've got this much time to get it
right and win the game. I think that's what clicks in my head. I don't think
anyone wants to lose. I think as a clique as a whole, we realize now is the
time.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this first Final Four experience, what it's been
like so far and what you want to get from it?  
KETIA SWANIER: It's great. It took all my years in college to get here and
just to know what this team has been through, the adversity we've came through
and the ups and downs and how hard we've worked.  
It's exciting to be here and I can't wait to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Renee, can you talk about being an All-American this morning and what
that meant to you?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: It's a tremendous honor. You grow up working hard to try to
be all these things, and when you actually get chosen for something of that --
something that prestigious, it's overwhelming. It's hard to realize -- it's
surreal. It's a blessing. I'm very honored to be put in that category.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've seen a lot of film on Candice at this point, what have
you seen that you can do to stop her, slow her down a little bit?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: Somebody of her caliber you're not really going to stop
them. You want to try to contain them. I think as long as we can limit her
open looks and make her have to work for everything she's going to get, that
would be the best we could do. She's a tremendous player and she goes hard all
the time. And I think there's no stopping Candice Wiggins, but we want to try
to contain her and limit her touches.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much different the Stanford team you see on film
now is from the team you played back in November?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I think they're different because they're more mature.
They've gotten more patient in their offense. I think in the beginning of the
year they really focused a lot on Jayne Appel and Candice Wiggins, getting the
majority of their points. Now they have a lot of other players that are
contributing, people are stepping up and making big shots in the games now. I
think throughout the year everyone's gotten confidence. And now everyone's
playing at the same level instead of just depending on two people to carry the
team.  
  
Q. Renee, you're a very underrated defender. Coach talked about it in the
conference call that you're usually assigned to the star player in the back
court which is really hard because you are also responsible for a lot of the
offense. So you're kind of on both ends working very, very hard every single
game. Can you talk about how comfortable you feel with that role and how it's
brought you here?  
RENEE MONTGOMERY: I feel very comfortable because I know it's not just me
against another player. I know even if I am guarding their best offensive
player that my teammates, if I get beat, are going to be there. I don't feel
like it's just me against her.  
And on offense, we're so balanced that they don't depend on me for a lot of
scoring. I wouldn't even have to score a point, we can still maybe win the
game. I don't think it's that much pressure on me on either end because I know
I have my teammates.  
  
Q. They talked about how Stanford was different from last time you played.
You guys have obviously lost two players since then. Can you talk about how
your team is different and are you better? Have you matured since then?  
KETIA SWANIER: I think we're a whole different team. Like you said, we lost
two key players. And we pretty much had to become a different team and people
had to step into different roles. And I think we've gotten smarter and more
comfortable with each other, and we feed off of each other.  
At this point in time it's just whoever is on the floor, I think we feed off
of each other well and just mesh well with each other.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all very much.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Having had the full week to look at tape and sort of break everything
down, what are the keys to this matchup, what do you guys need to do, what do
you need to avoid doing?  
COACH AURIEMMA: At this point in the season, when you get down to the last
weekend, the only teams that are left are teams that are really, really hard
to play against. So to be able to sit there and watch a lot of film and say,
okay, we can exploit this weakness, this weakness and this weakness and we can
take advantage of these areas that are strengths, that's not easy to do at
this point in the year, because if a team had a lot of weaknesses, they
wouldn't be here.  
So what you have to hope to do is play to your strengths, and that's what
we've always done when we've been in this situation. And obviously Stanford's
team is a reflection of Candice and the energy level that she brings and the
fact that she can single-handedly keep them in the game when everyone else may
be playing poorly. But if it was just the one-man operation, then it would be
a lot easier.  
But I think that beyond Candice, I think the keys to Stanford are how much
balance they have now and how much they've grown since November when I saw
them.  
It's funny to say this, but the reason why Candice is scoring so much is
because the other guys are better. And back in November, I don't think she was
able to score a lot of points against us because we didn't have to guard the
other guys as well as we're going to have to guard them tomorrow.  
  
Q. When Baylor and Maryland won in consecutive years, there was reason to
believe that parity had come finally to women's college basketball. I'm sure
you're going to tell me or likely to tell me the fact it took you four years
to get back here, that it's harder than ever to get here. But Moore, Parker,
Wiggins and Fowles are probably four of the top six or seven players, are all
here right now on perennial powerhouses. So are the best players still coming
to the same powerhouses?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. The best players are still going to similar
schools that they went to five, six, seven, ten years ago. But I don't think
we're that much different over the long haul. Other than Memphis, there's
three schools in the Final Four this year on the men's side that are no
strangers to the Final Four. This is UCLA's, what, third in a row. Carolina
won it a couple of years ago.  
And I'll bet you of the 20 kids that are starting for those guys, I'll bet you
15 of them were First Team All-Americans coming out of high school. So it's
like that in just about every sport.  
The problem that we have in women's basketball is that there isn't a big
enough group to choose from for more teams on a regular basis to put
themselves in this situation. And that may take a little more time.  
But certainly, given where it was 10 years ago, 10 years ago you wouldn't have
had the run that a Maryland or a Baylor or North Carolina or Duke has had in
the last five, six, seven years. That wouldn't have been possible. And now it
is. But just because that's possible for them, that doesn't mean that
Connecticut and Tennessee are all of a sudden going to be worse.  
We're still going to be who we are; it's just that other people now are
catching up. How much are they catching up? That depends right now.  
  
Q. It's been a long time since you've been to a Final Four with players that
haven't already been to a Final Four. What kind of things have you done to try
and prepare them and keep them from getting distracted from, like you said,
all the peripheral events, all the other things besides the game you have
tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Can you give me a little bit of that question again? Just a
little bit of it.  
  
Q. Since this is the first time in a long time you've been here with players
that haven't been to a Final Four, what you can do to keep them from getting
distracted by all the other things than the game you have tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I got distracted. (Laughter).  
It's virtually impossible. It's impossible not to be distracted. And we've
been here since Thursday -- we got here Thursday night and I'll bet you since
all that time we've spent three, four hours actually working on the game of
basketball to prepare for tomorrow. It's neither here nor there. We're outside
in the sunshine today for 40 minutes signing autographs and kids are sweating
and getting sunburned. And you have to do it. And went to a dinner last night.
We got there at 6:00 and left at 10:00.  
So there's a lot of things that go on as part of this that you have to be able
to handle it -- I think we're a little more fortunate because the kind of
three-ring circus atmosphere surrounds our program on a daily basis. So this
is not that far removed from what we deal with on a regular basis.  
So all you can hope for is that your team is mature enough and you'll know
that, unfortunately, after the fact. But I think the 37 games that we've
played up to this point, or 36, whatever we've played, if they're any
indication, I think we'll handle it pretty well.  
  
Q. Have you ever had to put together or kind of reconfigure a team in the
middle of a season with losing a couple of key players the way you had to do
it with this team? And how do you prevent the kids from getting the "woe is
us" look on their face when they lose two players like you lost?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Never had to do it in this scenario. In 2001, I thought we had
the best team ever to play college basketball. Our guards were so good, Diana
Taurasi was coming off the bench, she couldn't crack the starting lineup, and
neither could Tamika Williams or Asjha Jones, Kelly Schumacher, the guys that
went in the top 15 in the draft the following year or two years later.
Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea Ralph both went down, one in January and one in
March, and we got to the Final Four and we're up 15 against Notre Dame and we
lose the game.  
There's just some things you can't overcome. There's just some things that
they hit your team so hard that you can mask it and camouflage it and put some
makeup on it, but sometimes you just can't get over that hump.  
This year it happened early enough that it did allow us a chance to regroup.
But we've been hiding it and we've been masking it and we've been covering it
up. Hoping that it would never catch up to us.  
So far it hasn't. But, no, I don't like any of my players, so when a couple of
them can't play, they don't necessarily feel like, wow, we just lost two of
Coach Auriemma's favorites, now they're going to pout. They know I don't like
any of them during the season. So when those two kids got hurt, I went up to
the guys already playing. Well, I said, by the way, the way you've been
playing is lousy; you need to play a lot better.  
Fortunately Renee, Ketia, Tina, Maya, all the kids that were already playing
really, really well, we just somehow or another got them to play a little bit
better.  
  
Q. In the story about Maya Moore, I saw a, quote, tribute to you saying that
in some ways "I've met my match in her." And I was wondering what you meant by
that.   
COACH AURIEMMA: She's just so different that it's hard to pinpoint what it is
that you have to do on a regular basis to keep the motor running. And I don't
ever let kids drive their own car, you know what I mean. I feel like I have to
be there to kind of kick the tires once in a while most every day and fool
around with the car.  
And with people like Diana and Svetlana and some of those guys, I knew what I
had to do to get them, because I knew that they would want to punch me and it
was really cool. It was a lot of fun. It was a great way to get through the
season. But with Maya, she just kind of looks at you and just gives you that
smile and nods her head a little bit and I just keep going. I'm waiting for a
reaction. I'm trying to get something. Because once I get a little bit of a
reaction it will give me something to go on.  
Just smile and nod her head. And it bothers me because I'm thinking: This kid
is so smart. In the back of her head she's thinking: This idiot actually
thinks he has anything to do with what I'm going to do. I'm just going to do
what I'm going to do and I'm going to let him think that he does. And she just
(smiling) goes (smiling) uh-huh, uh-huh. And today I even tried -- what's this
world coming to that a kid has to stand out there, become First Team All-
American as a freshman WBCA and she can't put two dribbles together with her
head up. She has to constantly look down at the ball and she turned around and
looked at me and said, That's not true, and just like walked away. What are
you supposed to say to that? You're supposed to get an argument. She won't
argue with you. I can't stand her. (Laughter).  
  
Q. When Michael Jordan was a freshman, Dean Smith wouldn't let him pose with
his teammates for the cover of Sports Illustrated. I can't help but notice
that Maya Moore is not up there right now. Why is that? Do you find yourself
nurturing her along in terms of that or do you think she has to earn something
in terms of publicity? How do you handle that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never liked the idea of freshmen being exposed to having
to represent your program in a public forum without them having complete
understanding of what your program really is.  
And I think Maya probably understands and grasps it and can articulate it like
she did today at the All-American press conference as well if not better than
anybody else.  
But I guarantee if Maya Moore was right here right now with Ketia and Renee,
there wouldn't be anybody in our locker room. So part of me thinks that she
needs to be like all the other kids on the team, because that's what she
wants. Otherwise she wouldn't have come to Connecticut. She would have gone to
someplace else.  
She wants to be treated like everybody else and at some day, some point,
she'll be up here representing us but right now the two guys that I brought up
here are the ones that know what it's like to not be here. So it's fitting
that they come and answer the questions as to what it means to be here.  
  
Q. As the previous two questions have shown, the second Rutgers game you
said has been Maya, Maya, Maya, all year, referring to Lorin and how she did
in that game. But Renee is so much of your floor general, she kind of steers
the car, if you will. She kind of -- you've said that all year long and Chris
Dailey has said that, too. Could you talk about what she brings to this team
and how you've seen that, how that's led you to the Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never been in a Final Four situation or had a team that
was capable of winning the national championship where you didn't have the
best guard in the country. I think that's almost impossible to do, unless you
get lucky.  
But at some point if you want a legitimate chance to win this thing, in my
mind, the way we play anyway, when you're getting great, great guard play and
great leadership from that position, I think everything and anything is
possible.  
And the last three years, 2005, 2006, 2007 after Diana left, we didn't have
that. It's no coincidence we're here and I think Renee is as good if not
better than any guard in America in every area. And maybe what she needed to
prove herself was one more player that could take some of the pressure off of
her.  
It's not unlike when we had Jen Rizzotti, who I thought was the best guard in
America. But once we added -- once we surrounded her with Rebecca and Jamelle
and Kara Woelters and Carla Berube and Nykesha Sales, once we put these people
around her, it came together.  
But without that person there, it's not going to happen. And not for us,
anyway. It might happen for other people. So we're here because Renee
Montgomery got us here with a lot of help.  
  
Q. Because of your exalted position as vice president of the WBCA, you would
have had to come here even if Rutgers had beaten you. I'm wondering what
you're going to miss the most about your administrative duties. Would you
rather do that or coach in the Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I used to come to the Final Four all the time and always
dreamed of what it would be like to coach at the Final Four. Then when we came
here I thought, wow, I never saw this side of it. And then you come five years
in a row and seven out of like nine or ten, whatever it was, you forget what
the other half is like. And then last three years I was with the other guys
and not playing.  
And it just felt weird. It felt like you had nothing to do. You didn't want to
talk to anybody. You had no friends. You had no direction. You were just here
wandering around the place.  
And then you get involved in this WBCA and now all of a sudden it's one
meeting, one press conference, one dinner, one luncheon, one thing, one thing,
one thing, and I thought, you know, the only thing worse than not playing in
the Final Four is having to be on these committees at the Final Four.  
So I'm excited about being a vice president. I'm excited about becoming
president next year. And it's a two-year run. But I hope in the next two years
I miss every single solitary thing that they have going on this weekend and
that I'm playing. I will physically threaten my players in that final eight
game if they force me to go to those meetings at the Final Four.  
  
Q. Can you tell us about recruiting Maya and how you think you got her and
what made her decide to come to UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: See, all that time at Philadelphia served you well. Don't ask
the rest of the question.  
Recruiting Maya Moore. I think the number one reason why Maya Moore came to
Connecticut is beyond a shadow of a doubt, and she'll tell you this, Maya
Moore came to Connecticut because she's smarter than the average kid. And she
doesn't buy into the recruiting nonsense. She doesn't buy into recruiting
pitches. She doesn't buy into the flash and the glitz and the glitter and she
doesn't allow you to recruit her mother, her coach, her boyfriend. She doesn't
get into all that.  
Maya Moore came to Connecticut because I got to know one person during the
recruiting process, and that was Maya Moore. And that's all I ever wanted to
know and that's all I ever wanted to show her. All I ever wanted to let her
know is what Connecticut had to offer her and what her four years at
Connecticut would reward her with.  
And I told her that nothing else was ever going to matter. It doesn't. It
won't, and it never will.  
  
Q. You saw her in high school, was it the same level of excitement with
Taurasi or anybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, because she wasn't like that. As a matter of fact, this is
how ironic this is. I went down to the Georgia State championships to see
Ketia Swanier play in the state championship game, after we had already signed
her. And as I'm in the building I'm watching one of the other games and I said
to somebody sitting, I said, Who is that kid? Her kneepads were bigger than
her legs and she looked like this gangly ninth grader. I said, Who is that
kid? They said that's Maya Moore. Is she any good? She's unbelievable. Do you
know her? Ninth grader. I'm not one of these guys that goes to seventh grade
and rates the top seventh graders in America.  
And so I got back home and I said you're allowed to send a thing as long as
you don't -- I don't think we started cheating then. I think that was after
that. (Laughter). Probably get in trouble for sending a letter when we were in
ninth grade. But I remember contacting the school and before you even know it,
a newspaper article in an envelope arrived on my desk and it was from Maya's
mom with two pictures of Maya inside talking about the state championship and
all that and said, Coach, just want you to be aware there's a great player
down here; her name is Maya Moore and you might want to keep an eye on her in
the next couple of years.  
Maya doesn't know this. I have that in my desk a picture of her in ninth grade
like (grinning) like you get in ninth grade. At some point in time when she
thinks she's really hot stuff, I'm going to pull it out and show it to her.
But no more complicated than that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement and then entertain questions
for student-athletes first. Once all the questions for the student-athletes
are answered, then we'll excuse them and take questions for Coach.  
So I am joined up here on the podium by Stanford University's head coach,
Coach Tara VanDerveer, as well as student athletes Candice Wiggins, Jayne
Appel and Kayla Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our team is very excited to be here. It's been a great
season, and we just really want to keep it going for two more games. We're
working very hard and we just, I feel like we're playing well and we played
great opponents to get here.  
And I'm really proud of our team to this point, and we just want to continue
enjoying this wonderful opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the first matchup with Connecticut. You
said you're a different team, how you're different.  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Jayne, will you talk about the first matchup with Connecticut and how you
guys are different?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we're playing a lot different, different pace than the
beginning of the year. I think our game against them at the beginning of the
year helped us to really realize how much work we needed to do. And it should
be a good game.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about how Candice's game has blossomed? Tara said on
the conference call you've gone from caterpillars to butterflies. Can you talk
about how Candice's game has gone to the next level.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that Candice is really -- through experience, I think
especially this summer when she played with older players on the national
team, I think that she really took a lot from that and she's told us that
playing with those elite players gave her a lot of experience. And I think
that she's taken that and brought it to our team and I think it's what's
helped us improve a lot.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I feel the same way. I think that Candice has become
more of a leader, as the season goes on. Right now she really drives our team.
And of course it comes from experience. But I think she has a natural ability
to lead us. I think that's the main way she's helped us.  
  
Q. Candice, I understand you got a little award this morning. Can you talk
about the reaction and what it means to be bestowed with this?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, the Wade Trophy. This morning, I was very shocked and
elated and so honored to receive this award. I've been, you know, at this
presentation for three past years and great phenomenal players have received
it. I think Simone got it twice and Candace last year. And I was not expecting
to -- I was just going to sit back and just -- but to get the award it's so
amazing.  
I think just to have it this year, my last year with this team, that I just so
desperately love, and a coach that I just absolutely love playing for. I think
that's what makes it the most special, is because I can share it with the team
and with that experience and I'll never forget this this season.  
  
Q. Candice, you just talked about, your teammates talked about how you
blossomed as a player. Could you talk about your other starters. You're the
lone senior in that starting group. Talk about the younger players and how
they've blossomed.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Okay. So this group is amazing. I think the best thing I love
about Jayne and Kayla and the team is that they're so young but they're not,
you know, afraid of anything. I think the biggest thing I've seen they've
always had that just sort of fierce mentality. When you look at Kayla and her
game against Rutgers, she was not even fazed by the situation.  
And Jayne has improved even from her freshman year and to this year, she's
become a leader on the court. And she's getting everybody together. Technical
things like their actual game have improved. But I just really love their
mind-set and how that's maintained the same throughout the whole entire year.
And they just have the biggest, brightest futures. You're going to be seeing
them for the next years to come. I'm so excited to them when they're seniors.  
  
Q. A lot's been made in Connecticut about the fact that their senior class
had not been to a Final Four and this is going to be their first. Stanford's
wait has been much longer than this Connecticut drought. Can you talk about
how playing in this Final Four is going to fill that void for you and in your
career?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: It's going to do wonders. This is, like you said, my first
Final Four. I'm really soaking in the experience. And we're here to play.
We're here to win, here to compete. But it's also a wonderful celebration of
women's basketball.  
And I think I would have been happy with the end of the season whether we went
to the Final Four or not because I love this team so much. But to have this as
my last memory of Stanford is astounding.  
  
Q. Candice, along those lines, earlier in the week you were saying "what do
I do, what do I do, this is so new to me," and to be in uniform here, I guess
what does that feel like and how are you sharing that with your teammates?   
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, we're all kind of -- you experience the new experience
together. I think the craziest part is just even looking at those signs up
there and seeing the Stanford S.  
I've come to Final Fours, but I've been on the outside looking in. Now to be
on the inside, know, that is what is different and is so much fun, because
you're able to showcase -- like people are going to see our team play. That's
the best part of it, because even if you come here alone, you have your team
with you; it's cool.  
  
Q. If you were a guy playing men's basketball, you in all likelihood would
have been long gone by now with never having the chance to see your game and
your team blossom to this extent in your senior year. Could you address a
little bit what that means and how the experience of playing for four years
with this team, with this coach has helped you as a player and an
individual?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, being here four years, I think, it's just -- it seems
like a long time. But it really goes by really fast. And I think the biggest
thing is the person that I've been able to become. I think that I owe a lot to
Tara. She's never allowed me to not be the best I can be. And I just thank her
for that, for not letting me settle, to be the best person I can be, the best
teammate I can be. The best anything I can be.  
So it's just to be able to look back at my career and just see the progress
that I've made as a person and as a player, it's great.  
  
Q. Candice, I know that Tara said she wants to tell you each game or each
day how special a player you are. What has that meant to you along the way,
and will you tell us a few things that she's shared with you each game like
that?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yes, it means a lot, because it makes me so happy that she
wants to appreciate every moment. I think it allows me to appreciate every
moment, too.  
Over the course of the year, I can just remember, you know -- I think after
maybe it was the Utah game I struggled shooting and before the next game she
was like, I still have confidence -- just basically putting me up, don't worry
about it, I still have confidence in you. I remember before the Baylor game, I
think I was also going through like maybe a bad shooting slump. We were about
to play Baylor. Before the game she's like: Listen, you're allowed to take
three bad shots, so don't worry about it. Just take three bad shots, that's
fine, you're allowed that. That really helped because I was like: Okay, I can
take three bad shots. And it kind of got me back -- got my confidence back.  
Then the Pac-10 tournament, she just said nice things about over the course of
the years of that.  
  
Q. Kayla, if I'm not mistaken you spent the last two years playing with Maya
on the national teams. Talk about your relationship, if you had a chance to
bond with her, and if her success this year being Big East player of the year
has surprised you?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Maya is a great player and a great person, especially the
first year. I think we got to bond a little bit and we hung out with each
other a lot. I'm not surprised by her success this season. She's a great
player. She's a great leader, and she's extremely talented. But I think it
comes mostly from her work ethic. That's what I respect about her, is how hard
she works.  
  
Q. Candice, could you talk about the quality of this Final Four field with
four First Team All-Americans appearing and obviously a lot of great story
lines, how attractive an event you think this could be?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think this is a great Final Four. I've seen a lot of them.
And I'm just so honored to be a part of this, our whole school is.  
And I think you look at the history behind Tennessee and Connecticut and that
says enough. And then LSU coming for the fourth consecutive Final Four and us
coming back, I think it's great.  
And the players, I know Sylvia and Candace, they are just the top, the highest
at our level. And we've got great players here, too.  
So I just hope the country can see that, can see how much the women's game has
advanced and what's to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the matchup with Connecticut, how you're a
different team, what you anticipate tomorrow to be some of the keys for the
game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, Connecticut has a great team and a great
program, and they have -- as Candice and Kayla and Jayne talked about, they
have terrific players and they really play with a purpose.  
I think they're fun to watch because they run. They really play up tempo. They
shoot the ball really well. They have an inside and outside game. They
rebound. There's really not anything they don't do.  
I think, unfortunately for them, and unfortunately for us, with the two ACLs,
that affects their depth and I think it affects our depth, too, although our
injuries were earlier than theirs.  
But there are certain things I think that you have to do and you have to
really try. You have to rebound well. They get a lot of second and third
shots. I think you have to do kind of what Rutgers did and get out on key
players.  
You can't let whether it's Renee Montgomery or Swanier or obviously Maya Moore
knock down open shots.  
For our team, when we played them for the first time, we did not make open
shots. And Connecticut, in November, to me was a November machine. They played
like an incredible pace and they were way ahead of us.  
And I'm really thankful for that game and our team is, too, that by playing
them I think we've really improved. We actually made some significant changes
in our offense since then and I think that our team, we could always look at
that game and just say, you know, this is how we have to practice in order to
ever play them again.  
  
Q. I think Connecticut has won their last four national championships since
Stanford had the last opportunity to be in the Final Four. What's that time
been like for you? Your program is so well established, nationally known.
Before Connecticut's roll started, what's the last 10 years been like?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that Geno talked a little bit about this at
the salute dinner, the fact that maybe in the early '90s for both Stanford and
Connecticut and Tennessee, that maybe players thought they were getting a full
scholarship that included a trip to the Final Four.  
And it's been hard to be as close as we have been, being at the Elite Eight
through the last four years before this year.  
And to be that close. But in some ways, when you have something taken away
from you, you really -- maybe it makes you appreciate it more. So maybe for
both ourselves maybe, Connecticut hasn't been here, and you call it a drought.
I mean, that's because the standard is so high. And for Stanford, we haven't
been here in 11 years.  
And I think we as coaches and our players truly are -- we're thrilled to be
here and are thoroughly enjoying the experience and we want to keep it going.
A lot of it also, I think Geno referred too, is just sometimes with certain
teams, you really -- teams allow you to enjoy it more. And both our teams are
allowing us as coaches to really enjoy it.  
  
Q. Tara, with an NCAA tournament, you would think that Candice would be more
of a priority for defense than ever before. So how do you explain those
40-point games she's managed?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, honestly, there's sometimes where players get in a
zone. And I think she definitely got into one of those zones at Maples with 44
points. Easily she could have had 50, missed some layups and some free throws.
We had the lead and I took her out. And the basket got big for her.  
But she is the focus of defenses. I know she'll be the focus in Connecticut's
defense, but we also have other players stepped up for her. JJ Hones shooting
well, playing well against Maryland. Ros Gold-Onwude against Pittsburgh, and
Kayla and Jayne have been really steady inside.  
And I think we have some other people that will be ready for this semifinal
game with Connecticut. It's not all about Candice. Candice is happy to not
score a point and have her team win. That's what I think is really special
about her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Candice winning the Wade Trophy?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, for everyone, I think everyone in that room,
including Candice, it was a shock I think that in some ways I just kind of
thought it was going to be Candace Parker. And I was kind of given a tip
before the announcement and so I was watching Candice Wiggins. She was kind of
chitchatting with Kristi Toliver next to her and she heard Stanford. And she
was in shock. She heard her name and she was, "oh, my God." It was hysterical
to watch her. But we're so excited for Candice.  
Not because -- I mean, she's a four-time All-American. She has really put her
team on her back to get here. But she's just really a special person. And I'm
really excited for her. I think she's -- we probably don't like using this
word, but she's a great role model for young women and she's so honest with
her emotions.  
That seems to be a big part of what makes basketball so special, is that she
shows her emotion and she shows it so honestly. So I'm really happy for her.
And, I don't know, our team was giving me a hard time. I was standing up
clapping. It's like I'm so proud of her.  
  
Q. Could you talk specifically how your offense has changed since that game
in November?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Specifically, for the past -- I want to say we've run our
triangle offense for four years. And over the first three years, we basically
ran it as a four-round-one, where basically we put Jayne Appel on the block
and had four people doing the same things in the same positions around her.  
And after playing Connecticut, we changed it to a three-around-two. It changed
significantly. I think we're running it a lot better. And it made me a little
mad because I think we should have made the change probably two years ago. But
it allows us to put players maybe in positions where they're more comfortable.  
Some of my ideas about basketball, I want players sometimes to do things maybe
that they can't do. I want them all to be versatile facing up, shooting 3s, a
little bit of an international way of looking at the game when in reality a
lot of our post players are comfortable in two places: high and low.  
So we've pretty much moved our post players back into those traditional
places.  
  
Q. I'm curious what you think it's going to take for there to be more parity
in the sport of women's college basketball from top to bottom? Because you
look at this year where it's all 1s and 2s in the Elite Eight and the
Tennessees and UConns that are always kind of the top level?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, it's -- maybe a couple of things. There are some 2s at
our Final Four and the men's is all 1s. But I think it is happening. But a lot
of it will be institutionally. When institutions throughout the country
prioritize women's basketball and put the resources and higher-experienced
coaches for positions and say we want to be a player in this game.  
I don't think it's honestly that hard to do. I mean, it does cost some money
and you have to have it a priority. But Stanford made the commitment to
women's basketball I think 20 years ago in hiring me from Ohio State.
Connecticut made the commitment in hiring Geno. He's done a fabulous job. Pat
Summitt has obviously been there a long time but she's really grown to go to
18 Final Fours is incredible.  
Different places throughout the country are saying women's basketball is a
priority and we're going to -- as they put more resources then I think that
they'll work harder to win. And there's more pressure on coaches, which
personally I think is a good thing.  
Also I think the woman's game is like this way with talent and we need it to
be this way (demonstrating), more opportunities for young girls to play.
Better coaching, better out of season growth. And I think as that happens I
think you will see more and more parity.  
Although, I think we are seeing it with first teams first getting into their
first Sweet 16s, more teams going to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of the focus on Connecticut has been on Maya Moore but
you mentioned the guards. Could you talk about Renee Montgomery what she
brings to that team and what you have to do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Maybe Sheryl Swoopes and her team, I can't name any other of
the teammates on her team. She was a phenomenal player.  
Maya Moore is going to be a four-time All-American. I believe she'll be a Wade
Trophy winner. She's a phenomenal player. But she has a great cast. And Renee
Montgomery, I think, has probably been a real key for their team because when
Mel Thomas went down, Renee's role has changed.  
And she is extremely talented. She plays at both ends of the floor
defensively, offensively, she's obviously a leader for them on the court. She
has exceptional skills. And personally I'm really impressed with just the
development of all their guards. I think Swanier has improved a lot since we
played them the last time. Renee Montgomery has helped her. Looks like they
have great competition in practice. They really push each other.  
But she's a real key to their team. And obviously being an upper classman and
being a guard, she passes well. She shoots well. She defends well. I think she
has a great future. And she'll be a very tough matchup for us.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined up here at the podium by Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt as well as student-athletes Candace Parker, Nicky Anosike and Alexis
Hornbuckle. Coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, really excited about what our basketball team
accomplished in a tough regional final to get us to the Final Four. It was a
courageous effort by our basketball team, through a lot of adversity.
Obviously with Candace dealing with her shoulder, and just really proud of how
the team stepped up. And certainly Nicky and Alexis provided tremendous
leadership and obviously some big plays for us at both ends of the floor.  
So looking forward to getting started in this tournament. LSU, we're very,
very familiar with them. They're very familiar with us, have tremendous
respect for their basketball team and obviously the personnel and the coaches
and I'll just turn it over to the players now.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, what do you and Sylvia have going, do you take the competition
more seriously if it's LSU? Are you and Sylvia friends off the court or is it
only on the court and you always look at each other as going after the same
thing?  
CANDACE PARKER: We've played against Sylvia for a long time going back to
obviously high school. And we played on various U.S.A. basketball teams and
things like that.  
But I think it's really just about LSU and Tennessee. I think we bring a lot
to our teams, both of us, and I think we know each other very well being in
the same conference and things like that. So we played them two times already
this year and it's going to be a third. So I think we're just familiar with
one another.  
  
Q. Candace, could you just update us on your physical condition, how
effective you expect to be tonight?  
CANDACE PARKER: I have all the confidence in the world in the medical staff.
Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in the world. We've been doing rehab around
the clock. My shoulder feels strong. It's getting better every day. And I'm
happy we played the late game on Sunday because it gives us more time to
rehab.  
  
Q. Candace, can you talk about what you mean by 24-hour rehab? What's the
process been like for you? How often are you icing it or putting stim on it?  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak's philosophy is the more the better. She works
around our schedule. Obviously we have commitments being at the Final Four
with different events we have to go to. But any 15-minute segment we get, we
do stim, ice, shoulder exercises, strengthening, things like that.  
  
Q. Candace, you had mentioned yesterday that you were about 80 percent, your
shoulder was about 80 percent. What percentage is it today, do you think? Has
it gone up? Is it about the same?  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously I feel confident in my shoulder. I don't know
percentage-wise, but I feel confident that I'm going to go tomorrow and just
play as hard as I can. So obviously it's gone up. It's getting better every
day, more rest, more stim.  
  
Q. Alexis and Nicky, obviously you're very familiar with LSU being in the
same conference. Could you talk about the dynamics of that when you play at
this level, playing a team that you're that familiar with or the advantages or
things you have to guard against when you're playing with a team you're so
familiar with?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Obviously when you're familiar with the team it gives --
it's a little bit easier when you go over the scouting report. But at the same
time, when it comes down to the game, you have to execute. And it's the team
that's going to execute their offense the best and who is going to play the
most defense and control the boards.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: We don't really plan on changing up the game plan. Obviously we
know them and they know us. But we know from being here, three times since
I've been here, that defense and rebounding is something that stays constant
no matter who you play in the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I have to ask you about Angie Bjorklund and her progress?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think Angie has had a really strong freshman year. Obviously
we've relied on her to stretch the defense and make some shots for us. I
thought in our A&M game, that was probably the best defensive segment that she
has played for us. And I know that they ran -- as soon as Angie went in the
game, they started running isolations and clearing out.  
And I think that probably inspired her more than anything I've said to her all
year. At least that's what she shared with me. I think she took that as a
challenge.  
But obviously we are a better basketball team when Angie's knocking down
shots, because of what it does to open up our inside game. And, again, forces
us to put a little more pressure on the defense and stretch the defense to
open up opportunities for our post game.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about just the strength of the individual
players in this Final Four with Wiggins, Moore, Parker and Fowles? In terms of
individual stories, it seems like it's one of the best Final Fours ever.  
COACH SUMMITT: I would agree with you. As you look at each team, as you look
at obviously what Candice Wiggins did in the regional finals and how she
played in both of those games and what she brought to the team and I think you
have a player like that, other players respond around you.  
And I thought her team responded very well to her play and it gave them a lot
of confidence. Certainly when you look at Maya Moore and what she's meant to
Connecticut and just the explosiveness of her game and obviously the toughness
and the ability to stretch the defense and make really a lot of big plays, you
know, that certainly has been a tremendous asset for them.  
And Sylvia Fowles, seems like she and Candace have been going at it for a
long, long time but her presence inside, and obviously all of these teams have
great supporting casts. But with Sylvia, just her ability to block shots and
also to get position, they do a tremendous job of getting her great looks in
the paint and at the rim, which is it's hard to defend just one-on-one.  
And so I think with that said, you take Candace Parker for Tennessee and you
have a player that obviously is playing a big role for us offensively. I think
Candace's offensive package has expanded throughout her career at Tennessee.
And I think that's been an advantage for us. But certainly we expect her to
get paint points for us as well.  
  
Q. Considering an injury like Candace's it can become more chronic the more
it happens. And all the basketball she has in front of her. Is there a
scenario tomorrow night where you can envision saying to her you're not going
out there again or would you be afraid she might go after your shoulder if you
try to take her out?  
COACH SUMMITT: (Chuckling) she'd probably come after me. I've told her, I've
made it very clear, unless the orthopedic doctor and the trainers are
comfortable, I don't want her to play. But they have assured me that she is
doing great and her shoulder has responded.  
I'll be anxious to see today -- and I'm assuming that she's going to go
through a shoot-around with us. I told Jenny she didn't have to. If she wanted
to rehab her during that time, I'm fine with it. I haven't spoken with her
because she's been with Candace here in the training room pretty much all
morning.  
So, no, I don't want to do anything that -- if there's a question mark there,
obviously with the support, the brace she has on, that's going to limit a lot
of what she can do with her left shoulder. But with one hand she's better than
a lot of players. So we'll let the doctor and the trainers make that decision,
and I trust their judgment and their professionalism.  
  
Q. When Maryland and Baylor won in successive years, there was a lot of
reason to believe that parity had really come to women's basketball. Now you
again, UConn again, LSU has been here five straight years. Stanford's back and
two-time champion. Plus with Moore, Parker, Wiggins, Fowles, probably four of
the top seven or eight players all on the four teams are here. What does that
say about parity? Has there been a setback for that?  
COACH SUMMITT: It says a lot of the powerhouses managed to recruit some of the
best players in the game, because that's what this is all relative to is
success in recruiting. And certainly I don't expect these programs to go away.  
I do think there's more -- the numbers of recruits are greater now of better
high school recruiting opportunities are out there. So I think that has
allowed some teams to step up and improve their programs. I think that will
continue to happen because of the state of women's basketball and because of
our AAU programs and we have a lot of kids that are playing year-round. Not
that I'm crazy about that idea.  
But I think that just because of the stage of women's basketball has been on
in the last few years, it's inspired a lot of young people to want to be a
part of it. And you only have so many spots to fill. But I think what you have
here this weekend, you understand that the people that have been in this game
for a long time may have missed a few opportunities to get back to a Final
Four, but it didn't mean that they didn't have a great program or a Final Four
caliber team.  
Sometimes you've just got to get some breaks along the way. So we're just
excited to be here. I said last night at the salute dinner, I never want to
take for granted -- that's our 18th team to make it to a Final Four. But every
year it seems so hard and it's getting harder all the time, because of the
parity in the game.  
  
Q. Probably nobody in this sport understands and appreciates the concept of
competition better than you do. That being the case, what is acceptable in
your opinion in the way LSU will approach Candace tomorrow? Are hard screens
acceptable? Are hard fouls acceptable? What goes over the line of
sportsmanship at that point?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously I expect to see hard screens out of LSU because in
their motion offense, they are athletic, they're aggressive. But I don't
expect to see a hard foul from LSU intentionally. I just don't see as that as
who they are. I think they'll come and play a very aggressive, competitive
game. But that's the only way that I've seen them play over the years and
certainly Van coming in is -- to me he's going to have his team ready to play.  
But I would -- that thought has never crossed my mind. Maybe I'm naive, but
the only thing Van told me when I got here yesterday is that he had never
cheered so hard in his life for Texas A&M. So I had to laugh. I said only Van
would tell me that. I said, Van I cheered for you.  
But we won't be cheering for each other, trust me. It will be intense. It
should be a great matchup, and obviously a hard-fought game on the part of
both teams.  
  
Q. Pat, I guess at some point either Thursday or Friday Candace was doing
left-handed layups and you were trying to discourage her from that?  
COACH SUMMITT: We go to practice, first time Candace has been back out on the
floor, and she comes in shooting left-handed layups. I said, Candace, stick
with the right hand for now.  
But that's Candace. I'm sure she just wanted to test it out and see how she
felt. And she did go through most of our practice that day.  
  
Q. Thursday or Friday?  
COACH SUMMITT: That would have been on Thursday. And then she finished out
practice shooting right-handed, fortunately.  
  
Q. What do you think of the Wade Trophy not going to Candace Parker?  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously you had a lot of great players on that stage. Candice
Wiggins has had a great run at Stanford and obviously did a tremendous job in
helping get her teammates, her coaches right here to the Final Four.  
And, you know, I'm obviously partial to Candace. And I hated it for Candace. I
think she missed out on being the player of the year in the SEC, as voted on
by the coaches, and also by Associated Press.  
And that's part of the game. I think for Candace it's more about the team and
trying to win here, and that's our focus as well. And I congratulate,
obviously, Candice Wiggins and the Stanford program. Tremendous honor for
both.  
  
Q. Van has said from time to time during the season that they'll have thrown
in a new play or this or that, some new wrinkle the other team hasn't seen.
Aside from that, you guys again know each other so well. Teams have
tendencies. Aside from maybe one or two new wrinkles, can there be much that
either team doesn't know what to anticipate from the other?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I don't think there will be a lot of surprises. I think
that we know them and they know us. One thing Van has brought to this LSU team
is just a variety of sets that allows for Chaney, getting Chaney more involved
offensively. Looks to me like he's running a couple of the pro sets that he
ran for Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper in terms of the baseline action and
coming off the screens.  
And I think this team plays with a little more freedom, which has given them a
chance to be a little bit more creative, if you will. And I think that's
really enhanced their play. So less predictable. And I think that's been a
good thing for LSU and it's also a challenge for us.  
We have to defend the high-low. We have to defend the dribble drives, and we
have to do a better job of really denying and contesting the 3 ball.  
  
Q. First off, really been enjoying the spot with you and Kenny Mayne on the
SportsCenter spot, one of the funnier ones I've seen?  
COACH SUMMITT: Such a goober. Hard for me to look at it.  
  
Q. Most people look at this as you guys have dominated SEC for all of these
years. LSU's been good and gotten here but not quite been able to get over the
hump. How would you look at it against the irony of you're the team that they
have to beat to finally do that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, considering we went to seven Final Fours and played in
four national championship games before we won one, I know how they feel. It
was like: Are we ever going to get there?  
But I think if you get there enough times, eventually you're going to be able
to get a break or make your own breaks, if you will. And the fact that they've
had this consistency, you know, it speaks volumes for who they are, how
competitive they are and how driven they are to get back and give themselves
an opportunity to perhaps win a championship.  
And I think from my experiences, for me, it was -- I almost felt like will it
ever happen. And I can tell you that the year that it happened, it was
probably the year that I finally relaxed and thought, well, you know what, one
of these days Tennessee's going to win a national championship. And we just
happened to do it in '87. And I think you never know.  
It may be their turn. It may be someone else's turn. But you just have to keep
going there and playing your game and not putting the pressure on yourselves
or your players. I think that's key. I think Van keeps them loose. He makes me
laugh all the time. I'm sure they laugh, too.  
  
Q. If Candace were to go out in this game because of her injury, do you
think your players would respond better this time because they've been through
a situation where they were without her?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think so. I think they gained a lot of confidence from what
they did in the A&M game. And obviously Candace came back in that game.  
But I think we -- in particular, I thought Alexis really stepped up. We
struggled there. We struggled to make shots for a while. And, as I said,
Alexis couldn't make a layup but she could hit a 40-footer. Go figure that one
out.  
But I think that they were really pressing when Alexis missed those layups. I
think she was like: Oh, I can't make a shot. And just trying to get them to
calm down and relax. You've got to be relaxed on offense. That's not where you
tense up. I think when Candace came back in they relaxed even more.  
But I think having gone through that, hopefully, if we're faced with that
situation, that they will be a little more relaxed offensively and a little
more focused on the execution part of it.  
  
Q. How will you and your staff monitor Candace's shoulder throughout the
game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Jenny Moshak will monitor the shoulder. That's our right-hand
person and obviously she's had a lot of experience in dealing with injuries
and unfortunately shoulder injuries have been a part of the game for us that
we've had to deal with.  
And I think Jenny has to listen to Candace and Candace has to listen to Jenny.
And I think their communication is such that we're going to get the right
results in the end, whether that's play her or sit her.  
I think that between the two of them, they will determine what is best.  
  
Q. Just because you're a better story-teller than you are a coach, please
tell us the raccoon story. And was it like a Wade Trophy winning raccoon or
was it a walk-on raccoon?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it wasn't a Wade Trophy winner. Actually, I just went out
on the back deck. Had my two labs with me, took some trash out. I was going to
take the dogs out. And when I turned around to get the two dogs, my oldest lab
was almost about -- I'd say about that far (indicating) from the raccoon, who
was sitting -- the raccoon was sitting up on the deck and she was on the
bottom. He was actually up on the top. All I knew -- I heard raccoons go
obviously for the eyes, they're vicious.  
I didn't know they carried rabies until someone told me after I hit it. But I
just reacted. Fortunately I've never done this with a player; I wouldn't be
here. I just reacted the raccoon was looking at Sally and they were there and
I just came from the side and I hit it and then I opened my arm up to push it
off the top deck, and when I did I dislocated my shoulder.  
So when I saw Candace dislocated her shoulder, I knew her pain. Fortunately
Dr. Becky Morgan came over to the house and she and Tyler put it back in at
about 1:30 in the morning.  
  
Q. How long did you have it out?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was out -- because this is my personality, I thought I could
get it back in myself. I went and sat in the recliner and sat there and moved
my arm. I probably sat there, I don't know, 30, 45 minutes. I decided, well,
go take a hot shower and maybe that will help.  
So I took a shower. And that didn't help. So I went in and I decided I'll just
lay down and see if I could get it back in by putting a pillow under it. That
didn't work. So finally I called Dr. Morgan, I don't know, an hour and a half,
hour 45 minutes later. And I wish I would have called her right away. But she
came over and she -- between Tyler and Dr. Morgan, it went back in.  
  
Q. How was the raccoon?  
COACH SUMMITT: Never saw the raccoon again. He's probably thinking that's the
craziest woman I've ever met. I'm out of here (laughter).  
  
Q. There's six girls that played New York City high school basketball that
are at the Final Four. And Nicky Anosike said there's a reason those six
girls: Because of the way they played. You've had some experience with them.
Could you explain what it is about them?  
COACH SUMMITT: One thing is a lot of them just grew up on the play grounds and
went to the park and played with the guys and played up and down and played
for hours. I know Shannon Bobbitt had to bring me a videotape of when she was
playing in New York and playing with all the guys. And it was amazing, just to
see the talent level.  
And obviously Nicky is -- that's what they did. I mean, they went to school
and they played basketball and they liked to compete and they liked to hang
out and play against the best players and a lot of times it would be the guys
that would go to the park. We've got some special players out of New York.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The student-athletes have arrived. We'll take questions for the
student-athletes first.  
Coach, your thoughts on this evening's game.  
COACH BLAIR: For the die-hard out there, you might have wanted offense. But
for the basketball purists out there, it was great defense from both teams.
Their perimeter defense was a lot better than we expected, and they -- Bobbitt
in the first half controlled their defense.  
The second half we did a better job of sometimes running our stuff, but we
couldn't score! We scored six baskets, they scored five. Is that good for
women's basketball? Damn straight, if you can appreciate defense, but you have
to appreciate that.  
But we did some things to take them deep into the shot clock; I thought we did
a great job of backgrounding the ball, except for two or three offensive
possessions, but other than that, they were one and out. I thought there was a
couple of times in the second half where we had the right play called, we
didn't execute or we had Bobbitt isolated on Gant and we quit shooting the
15-footer over her, which was open.  
It would be just like Alexis Hornbuckle shooting a 15-footer over her on the
mismatch. You've got to take what the defense gives, and you when the defense
gives you something, you've got to exploit it.  
There is not much more that I can say. I'm just so proud of this basketball
team. The score was 42-39 or something like that. We missed the front-end of a
1-1, that was huge. But we missed so many shots in the second half, which one
did you want to look at that was more important?  
We turned the ball over than we normally did, and that was because of our
passing skills and our ball handling, and Tennessee is a very good perimeter
defense. I thought the post players neutralized themselves very well. I
thought La Toya Micheaux played a very good second half, and I thought she
neutralized Anosike very well.  
Parker is Parker, and we did as well as we could. And I thought she showed a
lot of effort playing with that shoulder of hers, because I know she was in a
lot of pain, but we were in a lot of pain trying to guard her, too.  
This basketball team, you look at the eight scorers that were left, the 2 seed
won the first two and almost won this one. This is the way it should be. You
shouldn't predetermine before the year starts who is going to be the national
champion.  
There's clairity out there, and it's coming. We need more Texas A&M's out
there that's going to pay the price and move up their product to get the job
done. I'm proud of our conference. I'm proud of the Big 12 for hosting the
best and most well-attended regional of all four of 'em. That's what we do
here in the Big 12, we did it right.  
This is a great basketball country, and I'm hoping the recruits all over the
country will say, hey, I want to play for a Big 12 school, preferably somebody
in maroon. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. A'Quo, if you and Mo could address this. How difficult were the shots
down the stretch? You guys only got 3 points in the last six minutes. While
the defense was there, it ultimately comes down on making shots, doesn't it?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: You've got to give credit to Tennessee. They did a
tremendous job guarding us on the perimeter.  
Yes, Tennessee, the defending national champs, holding them to five buckets in
the second half. Like Coach said, it was a great defensive game, and Alexis
Hornbuckle stepped up and had a big shot for them down the stretch.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think whenever you play the style of defense like we
play, it's going to be hard day in and day out to create shots and get open
plays, and that's what we saw tonight.  
  
Q. A'quonesia, can you talk about before you arrived from when you guys came
in as freshman to running all the way to the Elite Eight?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Coming here as a freshman -- the year before I got there,
Texas A&M was losing close, and once I got there, we were winning, you know,
big games, advanced to the NIT. The next two years we advanced to the NCAA and
this year making it to the Elite Eight is showing that the program has turned
around. Texas A&M is back on the map!  
  
Q. Takia, when Parker goes out, did anybody have to remind you guys not to
think, now we're going to run them off the floor? We timely got her out of
there? Is there a tendency to think, now we've got them where we want them?  
TAKIA STARKS: Kind of sort of. We were paying attention to when she was in and
out of the game. And when she was out, we wanted to push the tempo more and
attack the basket more with her absence.  
  
Q. Takia and A'Quo, the first half, talk about the outside pressure for
them, you were 5 of 10 on three-pointers, and what changed from the first half
to the second half, do you feel?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: In the first half, like Coach said, Bobbitt did a great
job of mixing up our offense, getting our timing off, putting more pressure on
me. And in the first half, we were moving. And the next time we went down the
shot clock was running down and it was one-on-one.  
In the second half they were switching from man to zone and doing a tremendous
job of keep us away from the three-point line and keeping us away from the
perimeter. And they did a tremendous job of stepping up their perimeter
defense.  
TAKIA STARKS: Their defense got better in the second half. And I know they
were with me whenever I went and didn't have too many open shots, and our
passes got sloppy and we were kind of throwing it around all over the place.  
  
Q. Okay, ladies, we're going to let you return to the locker room.
Congratulations on a great season.  
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, were you disappointed not to be able to stretch that lead while
Parker was out of the game? Is that something that you thought was a good
opportunity?  
And second, what went through your mind when she hit that shot from, you know,
mid-court?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, it felt like it was Andrea Reilly all over hitting one, but
that shot was further out than Andrea's at the end of the game, but that
didn't beat us. I think it made it a 5-point game, and we still had shots.  
We missed layups and outside shots and didn't hit it, but great players make
great plays at the end of the game. You've got to want the ball. She was the
only starter, really, besides Parker, that was doing anything on the offensive
end.  
Bobbitt was doing a good job of running her team, but she was turning it over
just like my guards were turning it over. So though I believe that was the
only field goal for her in the second half, that was a dagger that hurt.  
We were taking them deep into the shot clock, and I think that's good defense.
That's not poor offense, that's good defense first, but they were doing the
same thing to us.  
We were not doing a good job when the ball stopped. I don't know if I answered
that or not, but just make up a couple things. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BLAIR: We went to a press. When she came back into the ballgame, Reado
fouled her once on the open court thing, and we told her to back off of that.
We felt like we could pressure the rest of them like we press everybody else
in the country.  
Our job is to turn the ball over and get easy transition baskets. I think one
of those six baskets was a wide-open layup by us. Other than that, we didn't
run the offense well enough.  
It's all about execution, but if the defense takes away your options, then
you've got to be creative enough to score off of the dribble, and that's where
we were turning the ball over. We were not creating off of the dribble when
the shot clock went down. Good defense, bad ball handling.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your senior class, what they meant not only during
their four years, but what they will mean to the future of this program?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope seniors all over the country realize, go to the school
that best fits your talent and your opportunity.  
There is a lot of schools that you can live your dream out; Texas A&M is just
one of them. But these seniors have been so special. They believed in us
first. They said, hey, we'll only come to a program that's not winning, and
I'm going to believe in the coaching staff and I'm going to believe in the
quality of education. We can get it at Texas A&M. They're special.  
I hope a couple of them get next-level opportunities. But if not, I want them
to be successful in life. Use this as a learning experience. Sometimes you
have to fail before you can succeed. I think that's what we did tonight. But
we had every intention of winning this basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a five-point lead with six minutes to go; crowd is into
it, everything seems to be working. Do you feel like at that point it was your
game to win? That was the way you wanted everything to go at that point?  
COACH BLAIR: I'm glad you reminded me of that, Robert; I didn't realize it was
five with six, but that hurts, yeah. Give credit to Tennessee for winning it.  
I don't think we lost it, I think Tennessee won it down the stretch. They made
the plays, the defensive plays and the offensive plays and knocked down a
couple of free-throws and that was it.  
Neither team can look back at one particular play that just made it, because
even if Hornbuckle would have missed that shot from 40 feet, Batman could have
come in and got the rebound and dunked on us. We never know, because she can
make that many plays, but we were doing a pretty good job on her.  
  
Q. Gary, when you go back home, will you -- how -- what will you think about
how this team came here, and after all this program has been and where it's
been, y'all are one or two breaks away from getting to the Final Four, and
just how much growth of the program is it until y'all get to that point?  
COACH BLAIR: The last two years we didn't leave our best game on the floor. In
the first round or the second round. I think we left our best game on the
floor. We didn't leave our best execution, but we gave people all across the
country a new team to root for. Okay? A new team to root for. I mean, it's
great.  
I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan, as you know, but sometimes it's time for other teams
to win in football besides the Cowboys all the time. And maybe it's time for
other teams in women's basketball besides, what, Tennessee and Connecticut and
the Dukes of the world have done. It's time to spread it around, but to do
that, we've got to spread around the recruiting a little, too.  
  
Q. Gary, I think you said the other day you weren't playing unless Danielle
played. She played tonight. Can you talk about her and the kids you have
coming back next year?  
COACH BLAIR: This was not Danielle's best game, but defensively she was as
solid as she ever was. On offense, she missed some opportunities that she
normally knocks down and she's got to shoot the mid-range game against this
team because they're not going to let you get to the basket.  
We ran a couple of set plays where we had her matched up with Bobbitt, and
those are her plays and she's got to shoot over her, just like she would shoot
over A'Quo, you can't get to the rim on those.  
I don't know if there's a 5'10" player in the country that plays harder than
her on both ends of the floor. Somebody might play better than her on a
consistent basis on the offensive end, but nobody plays harder than her.  
And when you play harder, you work on your skills over the summer, there is no
telling how good she's going to become. She's a special player, comes from a
great state and we're just lucky to have her for one more year.  
  
Q. I wonder if you watched last night's LSU game?  
COACH BLAIR: Sure did.  
  
Q. And you know what it's like to coach for a long time, and your thoughts
on Van getting his first Final Four and the LSU/Tennessee rematch?  
COACH BLAIR: First on the rematches and opponents playing each other, I think
all of us need to realize that the Big East has 8 teams in and the Big 12 has
8 teams in. You're going to see somebody in a regional final or first round,
so get over it.  
I think that's what the coaches need to do. We should be rewarded because both
of us have 8 teams. I just think, be happy where you are right now, because I
think the quality of the teams, particularly these schools at the top eight or
through the top 16, that's the heart and the soul of women's basketball right
now.  
I'm just glad to be a part of it right now, glad to have the Big 12 be part of
it. That was the first -- give me that first part again, Michelle.  
  
Q. Van?  
COACH BLAIR: Van, I wanted so bad to get to the Final Four and play Van,
because he would have been the oldest coach to coach in the Final Four, not
me. And he was a lot older than me! (Chuckles.)  
But I'm happy for Van because you're sort of in a no-win situation. You take
somebody else's kids, particularly older kids that are set in their ways, but
he was smart enough to keep Bob Starkey and bring in Travis and Yolanda.  
He's got a great staff and he's a defensive-minded coach, just like I am, and
I think it will be a great match-up. I think we were probably able to show a
lot of people some things that might hurt Tennessee, but some of the things we
did might hurt a Connecticut or an LSU, too.  
But some of the things they did to us hurt us. We've got to get better on both
ends of the court. But LSU getting there, I think that's special. Those are my
old buddies from the SEC, and I'm happy to see both of them there.  
Pat has meant so much to this game, okay? She has meant so much -- she
deserves everything that she is getting. I just wish she would give me a few
of her recruits sometimes, but I'm not going to give up any of mine, though. I
love what I have.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments and best of luck.  
COACH BLAIR: Last thing, it was my wife's birthday today, and I did get her a
pretty doggone good present back there, and my grandson right there is pretty
special. That's Logan, he's 4 years old. Give 'em a wave there, Logan.  
Thanks to Big 12 for running a great tournament.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Lady Vols and Head Coach Pat Summitt, along
with the student-athletes.  
Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH SUMMITT: I've got a lot of thoughts on the team. It was a hard-fought
game, and basically when Candace's shoulder went out, it was something you're
not ready for, and we faced adversity, but I thought our basketball team came
through.  
I thought Alexis and Nicky, they were key for us, and we didn't shoot the ball
well, and when you struggle offensively, as in our first game here, sometimes
it affects your defense. But I'm proud of this team for just the grit and the
determination that they had on the defensive end when things were not going
well for us offensively, and with Candace obviously on the court, and just the
extent of her injury unknown at the time, and pleased with how we fought
through.  
And certainly down the stretch we did a much better job with controlling the
defensive boards; I thought that was key for us. Our basketball team, it's
something we talked about, when you're not shooting the ball particularly well
you've got to get to the glass, and obviously on the defensive end it's got to
be a one-and-done mentality.  
I'm really proud that we didn't give up. We fought through and found a way to
win, and Alexis couldn't make a layup, but she made a shot from, I don't know,
seemed to be almost half-court. So that wasn't planned but it certainly -- it
was huge at the time because that put us up by five and, again, I think that
took a little pressure off of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for our student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about that three. Have you hit one that big in your
career, and did you know it was going in when you let go of it?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I haven't hit a shot that big in my career yet. When I let
it go, honestly, I didn't think I was going to miss it, but I'm not going to
sit here and say I knew it was in. I was going to give it a chance to go in. I
stayed with my follow-through and just stayed with the ball.  
  
Q. Alexis, as you took that shot, were you aware there was no time on the
shot clock, too? Or did you figure it was an open shot, you should take it?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: When the ball was kicked out, if I tried to put the ball on
the ground it was a contested jumper.  
  
Q. Alexis, did you feel like it was the dagger it seemed to be?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I don't know. Ask my teammates. It relieved a lot of
pressure. I knew if we came down and gave them a three, it would have been
void.  
  
Q. Could you take us through the sequence when you hurt the shoulder going
back, hurting it again, your thoughts, getting it wrapped up. What was going
through your mind and how much pain you were?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, when my shoulder went out the first time, it was the
-- I couldn't get it back in myself, and that's the first time that has ever
happened, so I was just trying to find somebody to give the ball to.  
Alexis is running after me trying to get it, and I was trying to find somebody
to give it to. Then I kinda rushed the recovery and came back in and reinjured
it, and it came out again, so the second time she put it back in, and they
found a sleeve, and I was able to find my muscle and things like that, but I
just want to reiterate how proud I am of my team. They held it down, and
obviously our shots weren't falling, but defensively that's something that we
brought to this tournament and that's something we need and that's the reason
why we won.  
  
Q. Candace, 10:39 to go you were sort of reluctant to kind of mix it up, and
all of a sudden you just sort of let it hang out; were you in pain? Did you
decide, "I've got to go for it now because we're getting down here and we may
lose"? What was your thinking?   
CANDACE PARKER: Our starting lineup is obviously filled with five seniors, and
I just remember sitting on the bench, watching them play and just thinking to
myself that I was just -- if I got out there again, then I was going to play
as hard as I could and not think about, you know, my shoulder and my
situation, because I didn't want this to be the last time that we played
together.  
So that was just -- and then my teammates, we just kept talking and kept just
getting energy, and I think I just fed off of that.  
  
Q. Nicky, the team huddled up to start the second half when you were going
to have to start with Candace in the locker room.  
Can you talk about what you guys were saying in the huddle?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: When what?  
  
Q. Before the second half started, you guys huddled up. Candace was still in
the locker room. What were you guys saying to each other in that huddle?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Nicky was doing all the talking, I don't know how she
doesn't remember. Basically she looked all of us in the eyes and said, you
know, "We're not going home. And the only way we can do this is with defense,
and we have to stay positive," and everyone responded well.  
  
Q. You guys, as Candace said, held things together when she was out, but how
much of a relief was it to see her on the side lines? You guys as a class are
so close.  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: It's always a relief when you have a teammate go out; it's
like one of your sisters, so when she came out of the locker room, we were
relieved that she was okay.  
And we know she is a tough soldier, so we knew she would be back. And she's
able to play through pain and we never doubted her return.  
  
Q. Nicky, how excited is this team to get to Tampa? I know it was your
season-long goal.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think we're definitely excited to get to Tampa, but we're not
satisfied yet, and we know we have a lot of work ahead of us.  
You know, we have to play a great team on Sunday. But we're definitely
excited; we just know that it's not the end and we have to keep pressing
forward.  
  
Q. Candace, I know you said before that your shoulder subluxes a lot, and I
can't imagine that being a normal thing. Were you freaked out by this, or is
this a normal course of action?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, when it subluxes, it's all right. I'm like,
whatever, but it actually went out and stayed out, so I was a little worried,
but Jenny Moshak is the best trainer in the world and, you know, so I wasn't
worried after that.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you sort of tell when -- you know, Texas A &M has never been
here before as a program, is that something that kicks in with you guys? Those
of us who followed Tennessee back when you were a baby watched Tennessee do
this to people, but did something kick in with you guys where you're not going
to lose the game and maybe a program that hasn't been there doubts themselves?
  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: If they were doubting themselves, they didn't show that at
all. They're a great team, and they showed no quit at all. And as far as being
there before, we had this attitude that we don't want to go home. I've fallen
short twice, I didn't want to do it again.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on tonight's game, best of luck.  
  
Q. In the back of your mind, are you worried about Candace, and trying to be
focused on the kids on the court? How focused were you?  
COACH SUMMITT: When it first happened, as soon as I saw it, it was like, this
is not good timing, and I did -- I did feel like at that time she would be
back, just knowing I dislocated my shoulder a couple weeks ago trying to knock
a raccoon off the back deck, and mine went right back in.  
So I thought, at my age if I can come back, she'll be back. It was
interesting, because that flashed through my head, she'll be back. I didn't
have Jenny Moshak there, but I did have a team physician come put mine in.  
So when I saw Jenny go right to Candace, I felt like she would be able to
return. What bothered me was when it went out the second time. That really
scared me and I thought, well, she may be finished for the game. I really
liked just the mentality of our team. I can't say enough about Nicky Anosike.
When you face adversity or when the game is tight, she's just got a warrior's
mentality. She just fights to the end, and she challenges everyone on the
court to step up.  
You know, she's the best coach we have in adversity, and I just saw her step
up and, you know, I felt much better just knowing that the message was being
delivered, that there's not going to be any quit in this group, and there
hasn't been.  
I mean, we've had some tough games, and even in our last with Stanford out
there, I thought we fought to the end. The only game we crumbled was against
LSU, and that was a valuable lesson for us. I was worried, but who is not
going to be when the best player in the country goes out and, you know, you've
got to get everyone else focused, and I tried to stay as positive as I could.  
My coaching staff did a great job, because in the back of my mind I kept
thinking about it. But between Nicky, Holly and Dean, they were so positive it
was good for our bench.  
  
Q. Pat, with your experience with the raccoon, can you kinda go through what
level of pain Candace might have been going through tonight? And second
question, with all of the stuff that she does, is her toughness maybe one of
those things that gets overlooked in her game?  
COACH SUMMITT: First of all, let me tell you, it is very, very painful! I
can't imagine the fact that, you know, she went through that twice tonight.
But obviously she's a lot stronger than Coach Summitt, and so she's got
something to protect her a little bit better, I'm sure, just from all the
weight-lifting that she does.  
But it was hard to, you know, just move forward, and I didn't want to do
anything that was going to be detrimental to Candace, but at the same time I
trust Jenny Moshak. I think she's the best in her profession, and I had a lot
of confidence and I felt like once she got the sleeve, which was another
interesting story.  
I think they were under the bus, going through laundry to find the sleeve, and
I'm like, about to have a fit as to why we don't have it right there, but at
any rate when I saw the sleeve on her I felt like she would have the
protection she needed.  
Then she shoots that air ball, and I'm a little doubtful about what's going
on. But she goes to the free-throw line and makes a free-throw so, yes, people
sometimes they see Candace as more of a finesse player but I think sometimes
when you see finesse players, you don't realize just how mentally tough they
are until you see them fight through the adversity that she fought through
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, your players mentioned that they thought A &M fought to the very
end, and Gary said he thought your team won the game tonight rather than his
team losing the game. Would you agree with that?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we closed out the game, and I think when Candace
came back, I thought we made some big shots and big plays. But, of course, I
do think when Candace returned, we were more confident and had more composure
offensively and made some shots to win the game. Take nothing away from Texas
A&M.  
I'm very impressed with their team. I've known Gary for years, I respect him,
I respect how he can -- no matter where he goes, where he coaches, he always
assembles a very strong program and a team that can fight you to the end. What
he's done here in the amount of time is very, very impressive.  
I knew it was going to be a really tough game for us to win. We came in with
tremendous respect for their basketball team, and I think that helped us in
the end.  
  
Q. Coach, you said that you were a little worried after the second time it
dislocated. Were you at all reluctant to put her back in, perhaps, with the
risk of something else happening? At that point what was your game plan going
forward? Were you trying to formulate something without Parker in the game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, my first response was when I saw -- when I saw the
sleeve, I felt better, but I had to hear from Jenny. Candace, I knew the
answer she would give me, but I asked Jenny, and she felt like that she could
go. What was the last part of your question?  
  
Q. Just if your mind maybe was spinning.  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely!  
  
Q. Trying to find a game plan --  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely because, you know, Vicki Baugh came in and couldn't
seem to get on track. I went with Alex for the beginning of the second half,
and we were struggling, struggling offensively, and at that point in time I
was thinking probably more about what we wanted to do defensively.  
And that's when we put our heads together as a coaching staff and decided that
we would extend our defense a little bit more and try and take a little more
time off the clock, more of a delay-and-disrupt type of pressure in the three-
quarter, because I was thinking, I'm not sure we can open up man-to-man and go
at 'em the way we want to. We need a different presence on the inside.  
So probably just more what we wanted to do defensively. Offensively I thought
we would -- we would have to get paint points, and we would have to get our
guards to penetrate more, and that's where I challenged Alexis and she had
gone -- she went to the paint but didn't score in the paint. I think of the
layups that we missed there, and she got frustrated, so I felt more like a
cheerleader tonight at times than a coach, but that's okay, if that works,
that works.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little more about Alexis' shot? She released that
in front of you, dunk it was good?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was interesting, no, I had no idea that shot was going to go
in. I was just hoping it would hit the rim so it would have a chance to
rebound and put it back. She released it in my view of it, I thought, you
know, it could go in, but it wasn't the shot that I was counting on.  
  
Q. You're about to go play in the Final Four in a city that's never hosted
it before. How good is the diversity of the local for the women's game and
after being here in Oklahoma City, do you think Oklahoma City could host a
Final Four?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, to answer your second question first I definitely think
Oklahoma City could host a Final Four. I'm impressed with the people that came
out and supported this. With Oklahoma not coming back, and like I said, I've
been in that situation when we were hosting the Final Four, and our fans came
out, Oklahoma fans came out as well.  
I just think when you can find locations, where they support women's
basketball, it's a place that can, having been to Tampa and played earlier in
the year, what a great place, and it's a great venue, and obviously the Final
Four is the biggest stage for women's basketball, and I'm really excited.  
I was excited when Tampa became the host for our Final Four, and I think the
people that go there, they're going to have a great time, it's a great area
and I think there will be a lot of excitement for women's basketball there. I
appreciate what the fans did here.  
THE MODERATOR: Pat Summitt congratulations to you and best of luck to you in
the Final Four.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas A&M University Aggies, and Head Coach
Gary Blair. Comments, Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: First it's great to be playing March 30th, you're going to play
your next ballgame April 1st. It's away it's been a long season but in another
way it's been the most rewarding season that I've been a part of. These kids
have played their hearts out. The kids have overcome diversities, due to
injuries during the year, and when the injuries happen, we don't dwell on
them, we just put another person in place and we go on.  
And this is what this team is about. If Starks is having a bad game, then
Morenike Atunrase picks her up. If A'Quo is having a bad game, the freshman,
Sidney Colson comes in. If we need to move Gant to the 4 position because
Morenike is hot, Reado comes out. If we have Micheaux in foul trouble, Reado
goes to the 5 and we play "small ball."  
It's been fun coaching this team because we have interchangeable parts. Our
egos are all in check, we're on the same page, and these kids really like each
other off the court. I think that's a whole lot easier to coach. I've got a
tremendous staff, I've got a tremendous support staff, and when you're all on
the same page, that's why you're playing late in the season. The game last
night, I thought we just hooked up and we played as hard as we could.  
We had great defense, great transition in the first half, in the second half I
thought our half-court offense and our press-breaking was excellent. That's
why we won the game, and we're still going. Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. A'Quo, how do you put that game behind? It's so vivid, the biggest win in
school history, how do you go about putting that go game behind and focus on
Tennessee?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Just that we got the "W" and we have to look forward to
our next opponent. We did a tremendous job of pressuring the ball and causing
tremendous defense and making them uncomfortable, and we're going to go into
the next game and keep our same game plan and pressure up on defense.  
  
Q. La Toya, Tennessee has seems like 6-3 after 6-3, you guys are going to be
busy. How are you going to stop 'em inside?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: We faced that in this whole conference, Courtney Parish and
Oklahoma and Colorado, we did that last night. We have to keep battling and we
fight and don't stop, so that will continue on for tomorrow.  
  
Q. T.K., Patrice, could you answer this? Could y'all talk about Vic and what
has your defensive coordinator meant to this team and how much does he ride
you when things aren't going good, and how much does he praise you, which
doesn't seem to be very often, unless the game is over and you win by 30 or
40. Is there ever a perfect defensive game for coach Schafer?  
PATRICE READO: I don't know. It doesn't matter if you're up by 20 or down by
20, he's going to be the same. He's a defensive coordinator, he wants us to
play his style of defense. He wants us in the passing lanes and covering the
post and defending and everything else. So we just have to give him our best
and try to play the type of defense that he wants us to play every game.  
TAKIA STARKS: You know, just to echo what Reado said. He just wants us to get
out and deny, do all the fundamentals of his style of defense. He did praise
me in the shootaround today. He said he did a great job of defense and also
the team last night in the game. He's always going to push us to do better and
be the best that we can be.  
  
Q. Explain to me why is y'all's defense so different than everyone else's?
Why is it different than what everyone in the Big 12 does, and why is it
different than what everybody in the country does?  
TAKIA STARKS: Everybody plays hard, as Coach says all the time, but you've got
to play hard and smart and I think that's where we've really gotten better
this year, being smart and making smart plays and making game-changing plays
at that.  
PATRICE READO: I think we play very hard, we pressure-up on the defensive end,
and we stay in the passing lanes.  
  
Q. A'Quo, you're sitting next to him, but I wonder, you get the intensity
from Coach Schaefer, but do you ever see that from Coach Blair or is he always
Mr. Nice Guy for you guys?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: He's the soft one, but he has his days where he's very
tough on us, but he's a little teddy bear.  
(Coach hugged player.)  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, are you supposed to do that?  
COACH BLAIR: Probably not; it's an NCAA violation. I'm sure it is! Hopefully
the recruits will notice that I do hug and kiss my players.  
  
Q. Takia, can you talk about the challenges -- you guys obviously relish the
defensive -- playing defense and getting in people's face, pressure, trapping.
Talk about the challenges Tennessee presents to doing that kinda thing.  
TAKIA STARKS: We are just going to go into it like we went into the game
yesterday, just playing our game on defense and playing our game on offense,
just making smart plays, and I think we did a great job last night with Reado
not getting into foul trouble as much as she usually does. That was big for
us, and, Micheaux, she was out for a minute but came in and was productive,
staying out of foul trouble and making smart plays and playing with pressure
as we usually do.  
  
Q. For A'Quo and Takia, Takia, you talked yesterday about there not being so
much pressure or more of a chip on the shoulders for the bigger names. You
guys are a No. 2 seed. I wonder where the disrespect or the lack of
acknowledgment comes from considering you're a No. 2 seed.  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: Just coming out of high school, most of those Duke and
Tennessee girls were Parade All-Americans. Here at A&M there's no Parade All-
Americans, I think we have one All-American, which is Tyra White, the
freshman, but we just come out and play hard day in and day out. The other
girls with the names, the Duke's and Tennessee's with the names, they are
expected to play that way every game.  
So I feel like they have the chip on their shoulder simply because they have
the -- their names are out there, and we're making names for ourselves.  
  
Q. Morenike, if you look at the starting lineups for tomorrow night's game,
it's all juniors and seniors, a lot of experience. What do you expect out of a
game like that?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I think the same thing with both of us, because we are --
they've been to the big games, and we're headed there, so there will be a lot
of competition and a lot of just scratching and clawing out there. We know
what to expect, and you'll see a lot of hustle plays and playing hard and
making spectacular plays.  
  
Q. Morenike, you've been known lately as instant offense, but last night you
had four key offensive rebounds. Do you see your role changing? Talk about
your role on this team.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: My role hasn't changed since before my surgery. I don't
think it has changed much. I've gotten back to -- into an offensive state of
mind and that has come with me feeling better physically and mentally on the
court, but I don't think my role has changed that much. When Danielle or Reado
are out of the game, I stick to the game plan, go in and get rebounds or
blocked shots and that's been my game plan since I've been at A&M.  
  
Q. For the three seniors, can you talk about how much this is -- you guys
aren't ready to quit playing college basketball and what that does to keep you
going in these games? And a shot at Tennessee! I mean, what you guys have
built this program up from to where you are now, and what this game means to
you?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: I think that's one of the reasons why we came to Texas
A&M, you know, is to be able to be at a program that's on the rise and not a
program that already had a name for itself. And just to play against
Tennessee, being in the Elite Eight is an honor to us, and we're really
excited to be here. We made it this far, why stop now?  
PATRICE READO: Like A'Quo said, that's one of the reasons we came to A&M to
bring the program up. I think we're excited to be here in the Elite Eight, and
we're going to continue with the pace and right now we just are one of the
best right now.  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: We've worked hard for it. Coming to A&M, there was no doubt
in my mind that we can't reach the highs that we are at right now. The
coaching staff that Coach Blair had, I knew coming here he knew how to coach
and what type of players to go after, so there was no doubt in my mind that we
wouldn't reach the goals we have reached.  
  
Q. A'Quo, Coach Blair mentioned last night the second half of you showing
what you can do for the WNBA and trying to get invited to the Combine. How big
is that for you, trying to show what you can do and go to the next level?  
MORENIKE ATUNRASE: I did what I could for my team. First half Coach brought me
to the sidelines and said, "I need a couple of shots out of you and I need you
to lead this team." I think I was 0 for something in the first half and had
two back-to-back turnovers on Duke's press, so in the second half I wanted to
do what I had to do for my team, hit the open shots, break the press and lead
the team to a "W!"  
Q. La Toya, can you talk about the challenge of playing an all-around talent
such as Candace Parker?  
LA TOYA MICHEAUX: It's a challenge every time you step out on the court, no
matter who you're playing, but, of course, her name is everywhere, and it's an
honor to play against her and honor to play against Tennessee. They've won 7
National Championships, so what can you say. It is a challenge for our team.
Like Coach said, against Duke, we were on a high, and if we get the win over
Tennessee, it's just something that we have been asking our Coach, give us a
nice schedule. Well, we made our own schedule this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, athletes. Good luck, ladies. Okay, questions for
Coach Blair. What did you see out of Sam Houston in the early 90s, and what is
it you learned about Vic on the golf course that made you like this guy, and
think you've got to get him on your staff and the bond you have formed?  
COACH BLAIR: To be honest, the first time I met him, Gary Wideman was our
Converse rep, and he said I want you to meet the new coach at Steven F., so we
went over to Water Wood, the golf course, met him at about high noon. It's
about 100 degrees, here I am in shorts and looking good as usual, and here
comes Vic out there in polyester long pants, with sunglasses hanging down, you
know the guys that have the straps over 'em, his hair slicked back like that,
and I thought he was salesman or something like that.  
And all of the sudden we started playing, and we developed a very good bond of
a friendship, because our program was at the top of the Southland conference,
and his was at the bottom.  
I would try to share a lot of recruiting ideas or knowledge with him, because
they didn't have the budget to get out to some of the places, and if I could
see a kid that we couldn't use that he could use, I would give him that
information and just try to help him along. Then, you know, it's funny, he was
too proud to take any strokes from me. And at the time I was about a 7, 8, 9,
handicapper, and he was probably about a 12, 13, 14, but all of the sudden as
time went on, his basketball teams started getting better and better.  
His golf game started getting better and better. Then he met Holly, his wife
who was the women's assistant coach at UTA; they never could beat UTA until he
married Holly.  
He married Holly, she gave up coaching and that's the only way -- Vic never
beat UTA when Holly was the assistant over there. But a lot of things changed.
He started dressing better, his golf game got a whole lot better, and we
became friends. When I had the chance -- when Tom Collin got the head job at
Colorado State, Vic was the only person I wanted. Not just because of our
friendship, because he could do a lot with nothing. He could sit there and
take the two twins, Amy and Andi Sheridan, who was his guards out there, and
he could take a lot of cast-offs from other programs, develop them, and he
could find the sleepers and develop kids.  
That was the type of coach I was looking for, somebody that was passionate
about the game of basketball and passionate about life.  
The only bad thing is now I can beat him in golf 1 out of 10 now, because I'm
still the 7, 8, 9, and he's a 3 handicapper now.  
  
Q. What's the secret to his defense?  
COACH BLAIR: Because he's the 12th man, if you go by Aggie terms. He's the
12th man, because it's his passion for the game than when they're playing
defense, they're either hearing him or feeling him out there as part of that
defense. And that's a little bit of an Aggie thing but that's how there's
always somebody there to step in and help. Defense is about trust. You've got
to trust the people behind you, because we're fronting the post. You've got to
trust the people that's guarding the ball because we're going to be in your
shorts, and you're going to beat us by dribble penetration. And that's what
happened last night with Duke, and as soon as they beat us on dribble
penetration, we were there to take three charges.  
We work a lot of the same drills we've been working on for years. We tweak
'em, they get better and better, the personnel gets better, and I've told
people before this team is better than the '98 team I took to the Final Four,
and a lot of that is because our system is better. I'm a better offensive
coach, and he's a better defensive coach, and our personnel seems to be
executing better right now.  
  
Q. Coach, Daniel Gant's condition and whether you expect her to be full
strength tomorrow? Second, like a lot of coaches and fans, you've seen plenty
of Candace Parker on TV. Is it a dream come true or a nightmare come true to
stop her?  
COACH BLAIR: First, on Danielle Gant, she was able to walk through our stuff
today. She had stomach problems again this morning after breakfast, but if I'm
going to be there, she's going to be there. And I plan on playing, and she's
going to play; somehow, some way.  
There is no tomorrow, okay? If you've got the flu, you play. If you've got
stomach problems or something, you play. And she will find a way. Our trainer
will make sure she's ready to go. If not, I'll be looking for a new trainer.
But other than that, she will find a way. The kid's got a lot of heart. It was
pretty scary yesterday when that trainer comes down and says, "Danielle Gant
cannot go." You don't understand, that's like saying Candace Parker can't go.
It's not going to happen, because Gant goes every day, and nobody plays harder
in practice or in games than Gant, but she will be out there.  
Now on Candace Parker. You know, right now what's going on in the hotel;
they're showing all the games of the National Championships and semifinals for
25, 27 years. I'm a part of every one of those. Every game you see on TV, I've
either been a part of it or been to -- I've been to every Final Four, I've
played against every one of those kids, and this is the best. This is the
best, and she's proving it. She doesn't have to wait until her career is over.  
I've seen Liebermann, I've sheen Cheryl Miller, played against her, she cost
us a couple of National Championships when she beat us in '83, '84; we won the
two before that. Tamika Catchings, Holsclaw was a genuine talent that could
change the game, Lynette Woodard, Kansas; Janice Lawrence, Louisiana Tech, who
we helped coach and everything like that.  
I didn't get a chance to go against Ann Meyers; it was right after that I got
into the college game, and she was a great one. Carol Blaskowski was a little
bit before my time, but Candace Parker is the best one I've seen. She can play
all five positions, she is 6-4 or -5, and she's exactly what the WNBA needs
right now, because she's going to go to a media capital.  
And I know you would love to have her in Chicago, but LA would be awfully
stupid not to take her because of what she can bring back to the league. But
Candace Parker's just special.  
  
Q. How are you going to neutralize Candace Parker?  
COACH BLAIR: I think you got to give help -- we cannot play like Notre Dame
did. That's their style. Notre Dame had a tremendous game plan. They ran a
three-quarter press to take time off the court, see if they would throw it
away or see if they would disrupt them a little.  
You've got to take those backdoor lobs when she goes flying in the area;
hopefully she will be under the charge, or whatever, you're going to have to
keep her off the free-throw line, like we tried to with Chante Black and make
sure if Chante Black is going to beat us, it's going to be with a two-point
play not a three-point play. Try to limit her touches, because she can jump
over everybody. And the key is keeping her off the offensive boards, but at
the same time you've got to do the same thick with Nicky as well.  
We're going to have our work cutout for us. So a lot of times we might be able
to front her and get backside help, and she still might be able to jump over
and catch and finish at the same time. Sometimes you pat her on the back and
try to shutdown the others, but the "others" are pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Summitt said she missed you at the conferences, and she gave
us her best imitation of you. I was curious about your relationship with her
and maybe give us your best impression of her.  
COACH BLAIR: Pat is special. I met her in 1977 working a basketball camp at
North Texas. Sara Rappe was the coach there, one of her teammates in the Pan
American Games and Pat and Billy Moore came down to work, and I was a high
school coach, just won my first state championship, and I thought I was
somebody until I met Pat. And Pat was young, just really getting started
there. I played pick-up with her one day and she tore me another one, okay?  
In my eyes, she was Candace Parker! (Laughter.) And she would throw the elbow,
she'd do this, behind the back passes, the whole nine yards, and I thought,
golly, who is this? It was funny. We developed a friendship, and later on I
went to LA Tech, and as an assistant we played Tennessee every year in the
regular season game, or we would play them in the NCAA Tournament.  
So you would just get used to it. Then when I got to the SEC, she was -- Pat
can walk into this room here and make every person in this room feel
important, and not too many people can do that. She can walk into a reception,
and whether you're a junior high coach or college coach, whether you're Nancy
Lieberman or Debbie Antonelli, she gives time to everybody, it's a special
trait that she has. Our families I wouldn't say were real close, because we've
been competitors, but we were at Sandestin together, always at the SEC
tournaments and her son, Tyler, when I was at Arkansas, I sent him a "Hog" hat
and Pat said, "My God, the kid wears it all around the house."  
So two days ago I saw him over at the marble slab creamery, and my wife was
over there, and he's a junior in high school looking like a great young man.
Pat is special because of what she's meant to the game. Because she has
mentored a lot of young coaches that are now out there coaching. She's doing
it the right way, she recruits the right way, she coaches hard, and she
prepares well, and she always has a good staff.  
To me that's someone you should look up to, both on and off the court. I tell
you one thing, she is not going to me out there singing "Rocky Top" in some
little short skirt like she had to do there. I don't know who sounded worse,
her singing or Bruce Pearl with no shirt on. That's not going to happen for me
either way.  
  
Q. Any memorable games between you and her in the SEC, and are you hoping
for the most memorable tomorrow?  
COACH BLAIR: 77-75 we beat her for the only time at Arkansas, December 29th.
My two little guards, Christy Smith, my point guard, and Kim Wilson, my sixth-
footer, had 42 points against Tennessee, and we won 77-75. And that was the
year they had 10 losses and still won the National Championship. That one
meant a whole lot. The next year we go to the Final Four, we beat Duke. We
lose to her in the semifinal game. '98, in my estimation, was the best team
she ever had. The chemistry, she didn't just have one Candace Parker. She had
Holsclaw, she had Jolly, she had Catchings in her rookie year, and that team
was just very good. Probably the biggest thing I think a year later or two
years later, we're playing at Knoxville, I'm up by 13 at half.  
Normally I have a halftime speech when we're down by 13, if you're getting
blown out, hey, get ready for the next game, which was usually LSU, and they
weren't quite as good as they are right now, or they were close. But I didn't
have the speech ready to be up by 13. She kicked me in the second half. I
think we lost by 10, but I learned a lesson there; I better have that speech
ready in case we were up, and we were up.  
We played well, but Tennessee did sort of like what they did to Notre Dame in
the second half. And at their place, it's hard to win. They have great crowds
and just a tremendous following there.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you have a load of experience playing against Coach
Summitt and Tennessee, but your players don't. What do you say to them to
overcome maybe the intimidation factor or just to get them motivated -- to get
them geared up for it?  
COACH BLAIR: This is one thing about these kids right here. They watch ESPN
Monday night games, all the television games. This one right next to me, a
junky, she's going to be a great coach, A'Quonesia is. Right now our kids are
not household names like they are. There's not much you can do about that. I'm
sure Candace probably didn't know all the names of Davidson when they were
playing 'em, but the difference between Davidson and us, we're not David and
Tennessee is Goliath. We're a No. 2 seed that has earned our way up there, and
right now all the 1's and the 2's have advanced.  
Maybe that's good for women's basketball, maybe that's bad, but we're not the
Cinderella team we were in '98, when we were just happy to be here. We're
getting a chance to play against -- she's the legend, she's the best. When you
start looking at her and Geno and Leon Barmore and Tara VanDerveer and Vivian
and Theresa Grentz, there has been a lot of great ones out there, but our kids
do not get caught up in that.  
That's what is good about this team; most of them cannot pronounce Nicky's
last name. They know who she is, they know that she's very good. Bobbitt, the
kid winked at me when we were going off the court, because she's from Trintity
Valley; that's right down the road. That was one of the first junior college
kids that Pat has ever signed, and they made a recruit in her finding somebody
that can direct an offense and still score for her as well.  
I'm familiar with all their kids. Most of them didn't answer my recruiting
letters or my phone calls, but I'm familiar with them. But our kids play for
what's on our jersey at Texas A&M. They don't play for the headlines or who
they can be. In years to come, hopefully, they'll remember our names, but
right now we're having the time of our life right now. We're playing and
having fun, and that's just so important right now. Can you have fun when
you're still winning and losing? And that's what we're doing.  
  
Q. I wonder if you would talk about the team's effort and just how big
that's been in terms of what you've been able to accomplish this season.  
COACH BLAIR: Dan, you've seen my ball clubs over the years, and it's -- this
team is a lot more physical than my Arkansas teams, a lot more physical, but
what we're not is what I've seen in the paper a couple times, "bully"! I mean,
why do you get that term? We're not a bully out there how we play defense.
I've never heard Vivian's team be called bullies, okay? I've seen that in a
couple of newspaper columns, and that's called "defense"! It's called great
dense! When Parker slaps one of our shots down, that's not her intimidating,
that's just good defense.  
And that's how we have to play, because we do have some limitations out there.
We try to hide our weaknesses, we try to use our weaknesses to become
strengths. La Toya Micheaux sets better screens than anybody in the college
game, I believe, and she's very proud of that, because she might not be as
efficient on the offensive end as some of those kids that are still left
playing in the tournament, but she's getting the job done. Little A'Quonesia
-- you could have given me Bobbitt and you could have given Tennessee
A'Quonesia, and Pat would have been just as happy with A'Quonesia, and I
probably would have been just as happy with Shannon, but it's working for both
of us.  
A girl like Morenike should have been recruited by the top 10 teams in the
country. She might not have been on the right AAU teams to get noticed.
Danielle Gant, she's the hardest working kid I've ever had, and that goes all
the way back to Louisiana Tech when I was the assistant coach. That is the
hardest working kid, and she has to find ways to score because of her size.
She's 5-10, and she just keeps coming at ya and coming at ya, and most kids
will not play that hard. A guy asked a while ago on our defensive style, why
doesn't everybody else play our defensive style? Because they won't commit to
it.  
They want to get back on offense as quick as they can. Our style means we want
to keep you on offense for 25 to 28 seconds. We want to take you deep into the
count to wear you out a little bit, and most kids don't want to do that.
Remember what Rick Pitino went to the Celtics, and he says, boys, we're going
to press, we're going to get all over the court. Those pros weren't going to
commit to that, and he's back in the college game where they will commit to
that.  
We play a little bit sort of like what Billy Gillespie did at A&M when he was
coaching there with his defensive style. I think defense wins when you do not
have the Candace Parker's, the Courtney Paris's, you can win by putting four
to five people in double figures, and in case some kid is having a bad night,
somebody else will step up.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are being joined by the University of Tennessee Volunteers.
We're glad to have you here, Coach, congratulations on your win yesterday.  
PAT SUMMITT: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about last night's game?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was two different halves for us. I thought the first half we
really didn't step up with our defensive game plan and execute the way that we
had hoped going into the game, which obviously put us in a tough situation.  
I thought the second half was a much better game. Obviously a much stronger
commitment to our defense, our board play, and I just think our basketball
team knows what they have to do, and you just leave that behind and move
forward, and that's exactly what we're going to do and then get prepared for
Texas A&M in the next couple of days.  
  
Q. Shannon, when you were playing in the JUCO ranks and understood that
Tennessee was thinking you're a good fit, did you ever think you would be
sitting here talking to us about this kinda run in the NCAA Tournament?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: No. I did not think I was going to play for Ms. Pat Summit,
but I'm so happy that I made this decision. I'm happy I'm here, and if I
wasn't at this program, I was cheering for Tennessee. I'm just glad I'm here
and playing for Ms. Pat Summit.  
  
Q. If anybody wants to weigh in on the documented stare of the coach to your
immediate left, that would be wonderful, because she sure as heck was giving
it to you last night, until that second half, of course.  
COACH SUMMITT: I want to hear.  
CANDACE PARKER: It's not so fun now that she's sitting here. Obviously she had
a reason to stare at us, stare through us yesterday. In the first half we
didn't come out ready to play, but we regrouped because of the stare, and came
back in the second half and played a lot better as a team.  
  
Q. Nicky, you have played so many teams, but this team has never played
Texas A &M; I think the last time was 1997. Are you looking forward to seeing
a new opponent?   
NICKY ANOSIKE: Yes, it's fun when we get to play a different team. Sometimes
during the season you play a team two and three times, and it's harder because
you pick up each other's habits. But we're definitely ready for a challenge.
They're a great team. It will be fun to play someone new.  
  
Q. Candace and Alexis, the Texas A &M players yesterday felt like Duke
didn't take them serious at all. They thought that Duke thought they would
roll through them. What do you think of A&M, a team that's not on TV very
much, a team that isn't shown on the east coast hardly at all, really. What do
you think about the Aggies?   
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think that they're a team that gets up and down the court,
they're aggressive, they get into the passing lanes, and you have to respect
every opponent, and that's what we try to do here at Tennessee, because we
realize we have a target on our back. We have to respect them; they didn't get
here by luck.  
CANDACE PARKER: Obviously you can't overlook a 2-seed. They were a 2-seed for
a reason. They finished up the season very well, the regular season. We're not
going to overlook them, and we know that they play with a lot of energy, and
we have to match that.  
  
Q. Candace, you've played with Alexis for quite a while. What does having a
guard like that mean for a player who predominantly played on the inside?  
CANDACE PARKER: It means a lot. Playing with Alexis, she is obviously a great
penetrating guard. She stepped out and hit the three this year. She is just an
energizer, she is always going to bring a lot of energy to our team, and I've
enjoyed playing with her for three years.  
  
Q. Alberta, you moved into the starting lineup for the postseason. Can you
talk about your role and how you're approaching that this time?  
ALBERTA AUGUSTE: I think my role is the same as when I'm coming off the bench,
bring the defensive intensity, contribute to the ball pressure and also on the
offensive end, getting offensive rebounds and driving into the paint.  
  
Q. Shannon, have you had a chance to look at the play of their guard, A'Quo,
No. 10? You guys have similar styles. She is very aggressive and spirited out
there. Have you had a chance to see any film on her?  
SHANNON BOBBITT: I have not watched film with the team, but I have seen her
play, and she is very aggressive, quick, and their emotional leader. And she
definitely can step out and shoot the three-ball. It's going to be a great
game plan against them, and I just look forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for COACH SUMMIT?  
  
Q. Pat, Big 12 teams always do much better the second time around against
each other in conference play, because they've seen it and they know what to
expect with their defense. As you look at Texas A &M film, what is so special
about Vic Schaefer's defense? They do a good job of harassing people and
making them uncomfortable.   
COACH SUMMITT: It all starts with their defense, and they're high-energy
players, obviously athletic, they're committed to playing hard. They're
committed to supporting each other. To me, you know, they -- they just bring a
type of defense that makes a lot of teams uncomfortable, and obviously they
score off of their turnovers.  
They play a lot faster defensively than they do offensively. What happens is
their defensive pressure generates opportunities for them in the open court.  
You know, I think Franklin is obviously a key. Not only is she super quick,
but she's the player that I think just leads by example and what they want to
do. She's the one that makes them go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Gant? She sat out the whole second half last
night, but talk about her and the challenges she presents.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously she can post up, she's a catch-and-shoot player, she
can do a lot of things; she can bring the ball up. When you talk about
versatility, I think you're talking about a player -- there is more than one
dimension to her game. For that, obviously, just her ability to lead a team --
you know, you look at the board play, she contributes in a lot of different
ways.  
Some players you can count on to score, but are they going to do the other
aspects of the game, and obviously she's very, very committed. I think that
brings some stability to their team.  
  
Q. Pat, Candace suffered 12 fouls last night, which is among the high --
among the highs that she's had this year. Was that kind of a "hack-a-Shaq"
mentality, you think? And how has the opponent sort of defended her over the
past three years?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think last night Candace recognized that we were not
executing as well offensively, and I think the team recognized that. And when
I got so upset was when I just thought we were just jump-shooting the
basketball, and we were careless. We let our offense affect our defense. That
was the worst half of defense I've had to sit and watch in a long time. It was
ugly.  
Yet, at the same time, I thought the team recognized the fact that we were
struggling, and they got the ball inside to Candace. I say, we want "paint
points," whether you get there off the dribble or off of Candace getting
touches, but we've got to get paint points. And that allowed us to go in at
halftime not feeling like we had dug ourselves a deep hole.  
You know, we were supposed to trap ball screens, and I think it was 16 times
maybe that they set ball screens or maybe 13 times, but we just went over this
in our scouting report, because it was 13 possessions in the first half, that
we were supposed to trap, and we only trapped twice.  
That's a glaring lack of discipline to your system, and we pointed that out
because that can't happen against Texas A&M, no matter what our scheme is. If
we're hedging, if we run a Velcro, whatever our action is, we've got to be
very disciplined on the defensive end and not let our offense affect our
offense. Because this Texas A&M team is going to turn you over and get into
you, and we've got to be really efficient offensively and be mindful of taking
care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your experience, will it be a factor tomorrow?
You've been here so many times and Texas A &M is playing in their first Elite
8 game.   
COACH SUMMITT: I've never scored a basket in postseason. Gary Blair is a great
coach, I played against him in the league and now we're meeting in this
setting, but I do feel like we have a veteran team. I'll be disappointed if
our seniors are not on top of their game and the leadership is not in place. I
expect us to play a much better game, because I think we learned from our
first half last night.  
We're always learning, continuing to try and get better and be more efficient.
But I don't know that me being on the bench is going to make a difference at
all. I feel like sometimes I'm more of a cheerleader at this point. You want
them to feel good, you want to keep them focused, and that's my job.  
I can get their attention when I need to; it seems to happen at times that you
need to. But I told them today, I've got three great assistants, and we're
going to work hard and we're going to prepare them for this game, but
ultimately the players have to play the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I watched Duke and A &M play yesterday. It was interesting to me
because Duke came out with an enormous amount of pressure. They both, did but
Duke seemed to have more to me, and throughout the game A&M seemed to wear
them down. At the end they seemed to be completely fatigued. At this stage of
the game, how concerning is that for you and how do you balance that out?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think you -- there will be spurts, Lisa, that's part of
the game. That's what happens with the changes and who has the momentum. I
always believe the way to put the brakes on is with your defense and your
board play, to influence. Fatigue does not concern me with this team. I think
we're one of the most well-conditioned teams in the country. You look how many
minutes that a lot of our players play, and the one thing that I have learned
throughout my career is, you know, what you do in preparation now is -- we
won't spend much time in practice today doing anything other than walking
through.  
Between our Purdue game and coming here, we never went full court. Everything
was half-court, most everything was walk-through. We kept our offense sharp in
that regard. Same thing will happen here, because we will meet our legs
against Texas A&M, and I think last night was a good indication that we had
our legs. We were sharp in the second half, and typically we are a second half
team.  
  
Q. You mentioned Gary Blair. I wonder if you would comment on his unique
personality and any experiences you have had with him.  
COACH SUMMITT: Gary is always whining, they're not a very good team, not sure
how he got here! That's how he was in the conference, you know, he was always,
"I don't know about this team," but you know you can't believe a word he says
in that regard, because he knows he's got a great team, he really does. This
team is -- it's fun to watch just the energy level that they play with.  
And, you know, I have tremendous respect for Gary. I consider him a friend in
this profession, and you don't have a lot of 'em. So Gary certainly is someone
that I consider a friend. I miss him being in the conference because of all
the meetings that -- he was always one to speak up, and it took him quite a
while to get everything said, but that was okay.  
  
Q. Talk about Candace and the fact that she has so many, I guess, pressures
of being a face and name for this game right now, and yet when the clock is
running, she plays like those things don't even matter. Can you talk about the
balance she strikes that way?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, first thing I want to say is Candace Parker is the best
player in the women's game, and there has been a lot of questions or
suggestions who is the best player. My comment on that is, the big question
should be who is the best player in the world? Is it Candace Parker or is it
Lauren Jackson?  
I don't think in the college game, if you watch Candace play and what she
brings, and to get to what she does bring, obviously she brings a game of
being able to post up, being able to score in transition by running the floor,
being able to score off the dribble. I think, you know, her skill set is so
strong, and how many 6-5 players have you seen ever in the women's game play
the way Candace Parker plays?  
She brought a whole different dimension and package. So what she does for us
is -- you know, it's so significant because I think she brings so much
attention that her teammates benefit from that, but she also is unselfish and
wants to be a great teammate, sometimes to a fault. Is there anything else in
that question you want to know?  
  
Q. Just how she balances the off court, questions, autographs, all of this,
being the face of the game right now?  
COACH SUMMITT: We try to protect our players, and certainly with Candace after
games, you know, she'll have an autograph night, as every player does at our
home contest, but aside from that, just trying to protect her. We have open
practices -- sometimes we may have 100 people come watch practice. After
practice, I just let 'em know that the players have class, so they're not
going to be able to sign.  
I've been really sensitive to the demands on Candace, and Shannon has been a
very popular player, Alexis is a popular player. So that's something we're
mindful of -- not being disrespectful to our fans. We love our fans. I think a
lot of times I try to step up and help out in that regard.  
  
Q. Notre Dame said yesterday that your transition is one of the things that
shut them down. How are you guys going to address that coming against an
aggressive A &M defense?   
COACH SUMMITT: I don't think we'll change what we do in our transition. I
think identifying the ball is a priority, always, for us. Doing what we can do
to slow the ball down -- it's slowing the ball down and always use the concept
of our team, it's all about what the ball can see in transition. If we do a
great job of matching up and not letting them see someone sprinting to the
paint, not allowing the long passes.  
It takes a the lot longer to dribble the ball the length of floor than it does
to pass it, so we have to be mindful of pressuring the basketball and
extending our defense and taking away long passes.  
  
Q. A lots been made of preparing for A &M's defense and trying to simulate
that in practice. I think Coach McCallie mentioned it was tough to simulate
that. Have you prepared for that style of defense this year, and how do you
intend to simulate it going into tomorrow?   
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we're a decent defensive team, and the one way we
prepared before we caught our plane to come here was with our practice guys,
just overplaying us. And as I said, we didn't go full court, just worked in
the half-court. I think our schedule has been such that we've gone against a
lot of athletic teams. Obviously playing LSU twice was good preparation
because they have size and they also get after you, not only in the half-court
game but the full court game.  
Looking at our schedule overall and the number of athletic teams we have faced
-- now, have we faced someone that is as relentless on defense as A&M?
Probably not.  
But, you know, I think that, again, there's similarities in the two teams.
Just taking care of the basketball is going to be very important for us.  
  
Q. Speaking of defense, I wonder if you would talk about the impact Alexis
has on your defense, the number of steals she had in the previous round game
and then a couple more last night?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, Alexis, I think her game starts with defense, and just
her commitment to get in the passing lanes. She's great on the ball. She is
even more dangerous off the ball because she does have great awareness, great
anticipation, and she is a risk taker. I think she's constantly look and
she'll gamble, but for the most part, she's so heady in making those reads and
one of the best all-around guards I've coached at Tennessee.  
She obviously, you know, just gets out and gambles and gets after it and she's
passionate about defense. Last night she didn't shoot the ball well, of
course, she is wanting to settle for three-balls, and she needs to get paint
points, so she'll do that tomorrow. At the same time you look at her, I think
she had nine boards, she was all over the glass, so the thing about Alexis is
she's going to do the dirty work, and it's hard to get sometimes great
athletes, high-profile players that say, "Hey, Coach, let me guard the best
player," or "I'll get to the glass. I'll get to the boards!"  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. Your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, actually I thought we opened up the game and just missed
a lot of easy shots. I thought we let our offense affect our defense.  
I want to give a lot of credit to Notre Dame. I thought that they did a great
job, as they did in their first game that we played them, playing off the
dribble. I thought that was really part of our game that we were not as
committed to.  
We didn't force them into the weak end enough, and that may be my fault for
not making that a point of emphasis. But I thought at halftime we regrouped
and talked about what we had to do and came out and played much better on the
defensive end, also just changing up our defense and extending our full court
and our three-quarter court. I thought we managed to get them a little bit
later in the clock and managed to do a little bit better job with coverage
overall out of our match-up defense.  
I'm proud of our team overall. Notre Dame played us tough. They obviously --
from the time we played them before until now, they've improved tremendously,
and I was very impressed with what I saw and how tough they played us tonight.  
We're excited to move on and play in the regional finals. That's exactly where
you want to be because the ultimate goal is a Final Four and a National
Championship, but you can't do it unless you win that game. So that's going to
be a big test for us and obviously against a really tough opponent.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student athletes.  
  
Q. Candace, this game kind of felt a little bit like the Oral Roberts game,
a little bit maybe of a slow start and then Coach kind of laid the law at the
half asking for the defense and intensity to pick up. Just wondering how you
felt about that, if that was kind of the case here?  
CANDACE PARKER: I felt like in the first half we were just -- like Coach said,
letting our offense affect our defense, and we had a slow start, and you can't
do that in postseason. I don't know what it is, but we need to fix it.  
We regrouped at halftime, and I guess that's why there's two halves in
basketball.  
  
Q. Shannon or Candace, either one, talking about that lull that you had in
the first half, I never saw anybody panic or even seem concerned like you felt
like eventually things were going to come around. Is that how you all felt
collectively out there, that this is just a lull and this is going to end
quickly, because it did pretty fast, midway through the first half.  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, this team is full of seniors, and we've been in the
same position that we've been in before. North Carolina we were down by 12
with eight minutes to go, so there's no panic. I mean, we just come together
and we figure out what's broken and we fix it.  
  
Q. Candace, you had a career high matching 34, plus 13 rebounds, four
blocks, three assists, three steals. Is this as good a game as you've
played?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, I think defensively I did have lapses, and Coach
reminded me of those lapses several times. I mean, honestly in postseason
you've got to come through. That's what great players do.  
  
Q. Candace, I saw Coach pull you over, kind of you were sitting there on the
bench by yourself at halftime. What did she say to you at that point about the
second half?  
CANDACE PARKER: Honestly, she just told me that I need to come through on both
ends for my team and that I can't let my offense affect my defense and that I
need to own the paint and just control the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let our student athletes go back to the locker room.
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Would you mind talking about what Candace did? Actually she seemed
happiest sitting on the bench watching her teammates cut that eight-point lead
down to two when she was high-fiving and hip-bumping. She basically was your
whole offense in the first half. Is this as good a game as she's played given
the circumstances?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think this is certainly one of her better games in the
paint. Candace is obviously -- she's scored a lot in a lot of different
positions, but tonight I really wanted to see her get paint points. I did not
feel like she could be stopped unless say they wanted to double-team her.  
She did a great job of establishing position and finishing shots. She missed
some early, but the good thing is she didn't let that affect her.  
When we talked at halftime I thought Candace really took to heart the fact
that she could not let her offense affect her defense, and she has to have a
great presence for us on defense in order for us to survive and advance.  
I think she's the best that she's been defensively, but I think we put so much
responsibility on her shoulders offensively that somewhere she's trying to
catch a break. So I do understand it. But I just hope we get to the free-throw
line and she'll get some rest there.  
  
Q. You haven't talked about it yet, but what will you say to your team about
the disruptive type of defense you're getting ready to face in A & M?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think Texas A & M, they do a great job of turning it
over and they're just relentless on the defensive end. I think we'll have to
have a lot of composure. We definitely have to be aggressive and attack. I
haven't seen them in person, so I haven't really talked to my staff to know if
we're going to be able to go inside and establish our post game. That's always
a priority for us.  
But it's our type of schedule that's allowed us to go against a lot of great
teams. North Carolina is one of the best aggressive defensive teams, which we
faced obviously earlier in the year; LSU, it's not like we haven't seen a lot
of great defensive teams. But I think the fact that this A & M team, it looks
like to me they just get after it and they'll take chances, and we just have
to take care of the basketball so we can be efficient offensively.  
  
Q. Candace said great players have to do this in the postseason. Did you
sense that she felt she had to produce more because her teammates weren't
early on?  
COACH SUMMITT: I just think she knows what her role is on our team. She is our
best offensive player. She has the size, she has the skills, she has the
mindset to take over a game. You know, as a coach you don't always have that
on your basketball team, and when you do have it, you just hope that they have
Candace's mentality. She wants it. I mean, she's willing to step up and make
the plays for us, and she's obviously talented enough and has the size inside
to be able to make the type of plays that obviously you have to have at
certain moments.  
When we've gone on a long dry spell then we usually run something to Candace.  
Other players -- I was pleased with what Nicky Anosike did and just -- I
didn't have to tell her to shoot that high shot, and her guard play was not
great. And I think we need to get more out of Alexis Hornbuckle, but instead
of really settling for the three ball, she's got to play off the dribble.
That's when she's at her best.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the atmosphere tonight, over 10,000 attendance,
and the biggest of all the regional semifinals out there this year?  
COACH SUMMITT: I do think it speaks volumes to this area and the fact that the
people in Oklahoma came out, obviously the Texas A & M fans, there were a lot
of Tennessee fans here. It's a type of environment that's good for the game.
Obviously for us it was exciting when we walked out and I saw the amount of
people that came to watch our game.  
I don't know who promoted that. I'm sure Gary Blair. I've been around him long
enough to know he can sell an Eskimo ice. He's quite an interesting guy.  
But the fact that they came is good, and I'm sure they had something to do
with it and Oklahoma fans just appreciating women's basketball and what the
Oklahoma team has meant to this area of the country. And when you have
basketball fans, I mean, it's really -- it's good to see that even though the
team that they're prepared to root for is not here, they're still supporting
women's basketball. That's something that's huge for our game because the men
have had that for years, and we're trying to establish that.  
  
Q. Going back to the confidence factor, you guys really seemed to have a lot
of that out there today, and I think it showed more when you weren't playing
well than when you were playing well. Can you just talk about that, the
seniors and the amount of confidence that you all are carrying right now?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we do have great senior leadership. We have
obviously a team that is very confident. But also they know when they're not
playing well, and our first time-out -- we talked about it, and as time went
on there was a greater sense of urgency, and at halftime I thought we really
managed to get some important information to them about what we have to do. I
don't think they went out there really focused -- with the type of defensive
intensity that they should have.  
I told them, maybe it's because the first time we played Notre Dame we
obviously played very, very well and we were up in that game in a big way
early. It's a different game. I told them postseason is entirely different,
and you have to be aware of that and you have to answer runs. We did a good
job of that in the first half but a lot better in the second half, and I give
the senior leadership a lot of credit for how we responded at halftime.  
  
End of FastScripts  
  
  
  
  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on tonight's game, Coach.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm disappointed for the seniors. They got us here. They
got us to the Sweet 16. I thought they had a tremendous effort all year, and
it's disappointing to end on a game like this. We played really well in the
first half. I thought we played well for a lot of the game.  
We had a couple stretches defensively, I think they hit a couple threes, we
missed some easy shots, a couple of lay-ups, and it went from close to ten. I
thought that was the difference. I thought Bobbitt's threes were really kind
of like daggers for us.  
Great career for Charel Allen. She did just a great job for four years. It's
been such a pleasure to coach her. I thought Becca Bruszewski had an
outstanding game, tied her career high. She'll be great for the future.  
Lindsay Schrader played well. I think we've got a lot of good players coming
back. I think we'll be back. I'm just disappointed for the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. This is for either of you guys. It seemed like on the offensive end it
seemed like things were going fairly slowly for a good portion of the game,
but when you guys were on defense they proved to be pretty powerful. What was
the main difference when you guys were on defense? What was so difficult to
stop for them?  
CHAREL ALLEN: Well, I mean, Candace was a big presence inside. She's so long
and athletic, we just gave up too many points to her. For the most part I felt
like we played well on defense. We had a couple mental lapses that we couldn't
fix.  
  
Q. Charel, could you talk about how you guys felt going into halftime, going
up ahead on Tennessee and where you felt coming into that second half?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We felt great. We felt we could play with them. We believed in
each other, we believed in ourselves, and we just fought to the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student athletes go. We'll take
questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the game Candace had tonight and to run into
that and trying to stop her?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought she played well. 11 for 18, she scored a lot
around the basket. I thought we were probably -- probably should have looked
at doubling her a little bit more, especially when she was dribbling. I
thought we could have trapped her a little bit more. She's a difficult match-
up for us. And I thought we did a little better in the zone than we did man-
to-man.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dynamic they had working with Candace down in the
low post? What problems did that present for you on defense?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, when we went to the 1-3-1, we could go to the high post
but then we need a smaller person in the back line. But I didn't think that
was as big a problem as Anosike at the high post making the jumpers. We were
giving them to her at the beginning of the game and she started hitting them,
and I thought, we're going to have to change defenses to be able to guard her
at the high post, so we went to the 1-3-1 for that.  
And Parker, she's going to score no matter what defense you're in when she's
on the block. She's a tough match-up inside with her size, and with Erica
getting into quick foul trouble, we really didn't have the size to combat her.  
  
Q. Despite the night that she was having, you guys obviously were ahead of
them for the most part. Did you have a different plan this time than last
time? Did you want to let her do her damage and prevent everybody else?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we were trying to guard the three-point line this time. We
didn't really think that she would get that many because we did want to guard
her inside. We did a really good job the first half guarding the three-point
line. I was really pleased with that. I think they were 1 for 5. That was the
key to our game was really getting out in the zone on the wings and I thought
we did that for the most part.  
Overall, considering the last game we had with them, we've come a long way
since January 5th. We definitely got a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go. Congratulations on a great
season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on this evening's game.  
COACH McCALLIE: I thought it was a well-fought game. I thought both teams
played hard. It was a very physical game. You know, our nemesis crept up
again, which has done so in the past when I look at the assist-to-turnover
ratio. We've been problematic in terms of where we need to get the ball at
times, as well.  
I thought we fought hard. I was proud of our team's effort. I thought that we
started to come back in the second half, but I thought there were some serious
losses of poise and composure at critical junctures, which you cannot afford
in this environment against a team like Texas A & M.  
I give a lot of credit to them. They had some players do some things that were
outstanding, in particular 51 scoring seven points in six minutes. That's not
something she normally does, but obviously she rose to the occasion there. And
I thought 24 really hurt us, a player who played above her averages and did a
nice job for them.  
I would have liked to see us play more from the inside out, the physical
nature of the game block to block. We did some nice things in rebounding,
seeing some of our guards like Abby rebound and Jasmine rebound, those were
things that we needed to occur, as well.  
But I think basically we had some free throw misses that would have been
helpful, but at the same time it was more a creation situation of assist-to-
turnovers, too many turnovers in a game like this against a very good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your thoughts. We'll take the student athlete
questions first.  
  
Q. Wanisha, how much in the first half was it their defense that caused the
turnovers, or was there something else at work there?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think a lot of our turnovers came from trying to make a tough
pass inside the lane or -- their defense was really good. They pressured the
ball, they pressured the lane, but a lot of it just came from us trying to
make the big play.  
  
Q. Abby, were you guys surprised or taken off guard by the pressure at the
beginning of the game?  
ABBY WANER: We expected pressure like that, I just don't think we handled it
well. Our coaches covered that in the scouting and we were prepared for that
kind of pressure, we just didn't handle it the way we should.  
  
Q. Abby, was it frustrating when the three-pointers just wouldn't go down
for you until the later stages when you were already behind by double
digits?  
ABBY WANER: You're never happy when your shot doesn't fall, so yeah, it gets
frustrating. I think Coach was right that we needed to go inside out more.
Yeah, it does get frustrating when they don't fall.  
  
Q. Abby and Wanisha, when your shots just weren't falling, was that
something to do with Texas A & M's defense or just one of those nights?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think a lot of my shots came from just rushing, not taking my
time going up. They weren't falling like I wanted them to.  
ABBY WANER: They're a good defensive team, so I'm not going to take credit
away from them, but I'm also not going to place blame on their defense for a
lot of the shots that I should normally hit.  
  
Q. For Wanisha, how would you characterize this team your senior year? What
were the high points of the season for you?  
WANISHA SMITH: One of the highlights talking in the locker room was just our
ability to fight through adversity. I think that was one of the biggest things
that brought us together, and unfortunately this loss, it doesn't characterize
our season, how we've become a team and bonded with each other, my teammates
and coaches, also. Hopefully next year they'll pull together and have more
success.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to the locker room. We'll
take Coach McCallie's questions.  
  
Q. Joanne, was there something going on with their defense, or why do you
think there was not a whole lot of offense going on in the perimeter or the
mid-range jumpers? It seemed like everything was going through the paint
early.  
COACH McCALLIE: Yeah, I think early on I thought we did -- to be down four
with the turnovers that we had was very outstanding.  
The second half I think we got away from what we had been doing, which was to
get the ball inside out. We had to work a little bit harder tonight to get the
ball inside out because they were fronting on the low block, and when they do
that you can't enter directly from the lane, you have to enter from the top
and you have to create ball screen situations. We needed a little bit more
patience overall in handling that pressure.  
We give credit to Texas A & M. They had a great year and they did a great job
with their defensive pressure. At the same time this was a lesson, freshman
point guard versus senior point guard, five seniors versus one senior.
Sometimes there's experience out there, but there's a lot of things. It's not
a simple answer.  
But shooting 66 percent from the line at this level, that's not going to help
you as much. The turnovers, those are the team points you give up, and that's
huge. That's a 20-point turnaround if you look at the fact that we had 19
turnovers number of turnovers. We had eight more turnovers than they did in
the game. That's an enormous turnaround in offensive possibilities. So it's a
combination of all those things. It's not only one thing.  
'Te showed that she was ready to play. 'Te had a strong game and she did some
really nice things. We just have to continue to show patience in getting the
ball inside and then attacking, and it just -- it's an easy thing to talk
about. It's a lot harder to do when there's a lot of pressure out there.  
  
Q. Everybody would love to win a national championship and there are about
300 teams to didn't get to this point. Is Sweet 16 a pretty fair assessment of
where your team is at this point?  
COACH McCALLIE: It's hard to say on this night, but I really believe in our
team's ability to beat any team, I really do. I'm very proud of this team.
They've worked very hard. For a first-year situation, I don't know how many
first-year situations have gone to the Sweet 16. I'd have to look that up.  
But I will say that -- I can't really agree with you totally because I really
believe that we could beat these teams, A & M or Notre Dame or Tennessee or
whomever. We did not pull it all together tonight, that's true, but I have a
great belief in this team. It leaves you very sad, it also leaves you very
motivated for the lessons we can take from this experience.  
  
Q. Danielle Gant goes out at halftime and doesn't play again. They almost
seemed to draw on that really. And then talk about Franklin. She almost goes
against what you think she should do, going to the corner. Talk about her,
too.  
COACH McCALLIE: Well, she's a senior point guard who's started practically
every game, I think, at Texas A & M. She plays with a great deal of
confidence. She plays low to the ground. We're a guard short of having the
ability to handle somebody like her, as small as she is. She's very effective,
she's very mature on the floor. She plays 35 minutes. When you see her assist-
to-turnover ratio -- we had Wanisha with 42, but that's all we had there.  
I think we're a growing team; that's a seasoned team. We are a growing team
trying to win championships. First year, coaches, changes, one senior, all
those things. That's a fifth-year team, and I think you saw some fifth-year
experience on the floor, and it would be very unfair to talk about that
because I've been a fifth-year before, too, and a fifth-year is a lot better
than a first-year in terms of philosophy and trying to be all together.  
Getting back to your question, she's outstanding and makes the most of her
size. She's very creative and she's smart, and she plays an excellent game.  
  
Q. Back to free throws, typically when you guys are able to limit your
opponent's chances and take 30 yourself, you guys have success. At one point
in the second half you guys were 5 of 12 from the line. What did you attribute
those struggles to?  
COACH McCALLIE: As a coach you can't really attribute. We've had great games
and not-so-good games. You know your team is getting to the line 30 times, but
at that point there's nothing you can be concerned about, you just have to
coach in the moment and worry about what the whole team concept is. We have to
become a better shooting team just generally speaking in the off-season.
Again, there are tremendous lessons here for us.  
  
Q. Chante Black this season kind of proved she's a big-time player. How
confident are you knowing she's going to be back next year? And also Wanisha
Smith, what are you going to miss about her?  
COACH McCALLIE: Chante, she's had an incredible year. She's worked very, very
hard. She's been an incredible leader for us. She's demanded the ball, she's
made big plays, and without question she's a tremendous player. It's very
exciting to think of her as a senior with more strength and more timing and
all the things that she had to do with this year coming back from not playing
the year prior. The sky is the limit for 'Te. She's one of our better shooters
on the team, period.  
To go to Wanisha, we're going to miss an awful lot from Wanisha. She's the
energizer. Wanisha is the kid who's played hard and aggressive and demanding
intensity. She just is such a tough competitor, can pull off the balance and
do different things. You never replace people, and we won't replace Wanisha.
You sort of evolve as a new team. Every year is new, without question.  
I'm excited for Wanisha. I want her to have an opportunity to play
professionally if that's what she wants to do, and I think it is, and I think
she's somebody who can really continue to grow her game.  
  
Q. Are you surprised they didn't seem to miss Gant any more than they did in
the second half?  
COACH McCALLIE: You know, that can really trigger a team. I mean, she's a
great player, and I see that people were triggered. People played great.
There's a lot of balance on the team. I'm not surprised at all. When a
teammate goes down, usually -- it's one of these things. In the short-term
it's beneficial. In the long-term if she would be out it's not beneficial. But
in the moment I've found that players rally. She did pretty well before she
was out anyway. She still played a great game, and the other girls really
stepped it up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, and congratulations on a great season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, would you make some opening comments about tonight's
game, and congratulations.  
COACH BLAIR: I just got a bunch of warriors out there, a bunch of warriors.
You know, isn't it nice to be able to compliment the team that you play in
because those kids are all such all-Americans and AAU and all-conference
performers, but you want to compliment Duke for everything that they do.
Chante Black is a load. We had as much trouble with her as we did with
Courtney Parrish. But then we tightened it up in the second half and when we
went to a zone a little bit in the first half.  
But our program has dealt with Texas kids first. We might not be the national
power to be able to recruit nationally like Duke or Stanford or some of those
other teams right now. But we're built with kids right here that were good,
solid players, but I am so happy for my staff because the best thing we do in
coaching is we develop players. When you develop players, it's such a
satisfaction for the coaching staff and these players here to see how far
they've come.  
The defensive effort was outstanding. We got in a little bit of foul trouble
with Micheaux and we were able to play Reado and Buchanan and then we had to
go small when Buchanan got in foul trouble we were 5'11" and below but we held
on because we had a lot of good transition baskets.  
Gant was playing out of sight like she always does. At halftime she came out
and she felt dizzy on the bench. Radar, our trainer, came up and said, Coach,
I think you need to hold her out for a minute. And then I said, Radar, if
she's dizzy, I'm sick (laughter).  
But she had to come out of the ballgame. Mo came in and made a couple of great
baskets early because they had started taking control to start the second
half, but all of a sudden Radar came back. He said, we have to put a second IV
in. I said, all right, Radar, hurry. He came back in about five, six more
minutes. He said, we'll have to put a third IV in. I was about to fire my
trainer then. Finally he came back and said we're going to have to put a
fourth IV in, and I don't think you're going to have her.  
By then this little band right here did one heck of a job. I got on Reado at
halftime there. I can get on her more than any other kid on this team because
she's a Houston kid that can handle anything that I can give her or her mama
can give her, right, Reado? And she had zero points and zero rebounds at half,
and came out there and gave me the game of a lifetime for her at 5'11",
handling her business.  
I'm so happy for her and I'm so happy for these two guards here, my little
general and my scorer right there. They're excellent ball players.  
I'll open it for questions.  
  
Q. How much did -- I think it was a mid-range jumper and the two back-to-
back lay-ups, how much did your confidence go in and get you rolling?  
PATRICE READO: My confidence went way up, but it was my teammates who
contributed the ball. They set up the shots for me and gave me two easy
buckets to give me the confidence to have a decent game.  
  
Q. Takia, it seemed like Duke was kind of knocked back a little bit at the
beginning with y'all's pressure. Did you sense that? What were y'all able to
do with them early?  
TAKIA STARKS: I really just wanted to get after them early and put as much
pressure on them as we could. We started off with our defense and we pressed
them. We felt we had the momentum, and for a second the game was going back
and forth, score for score. But we basically just took control, we stepped up
and got stops on defense and scored on offense.  
  
Q. A'Qua, an advantage you think playing here in Oklahoma City? Did you
notice more of your fans here? Just talk about that.  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: Yes, sir. When we came out of the huddle -- when we came
out for warm-ups, he turned to the crowd once we came out. He said, we want to
thank the Oklahoma people that were behind us and our fans that came from
College Station to be with us and support us.  
TAKIA STARKS: Like A'Qua said, the fans supported us, they travelled with us.
Earlier this year it was hard to get any fans to travel with us, but we were
just amazed at how many showed today. We thank the state of Oklahoma and the
big 12 for supporting us, also.  
PATRICE READO: Same thing they just said.  
  
Q. For A'Qua, can you talk about what's going through your mind, just talk
about the second half when Danielle had such a big half and she doesn't come
out. Just talk about what's going through your mind at that point.  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: When Danielle came out she came over to the bench and he
said, I don't think that she can go right now. I wanted to fire myself
(laughter). She did a great job of stepping up, coming in. I think she buckled
down the court and scored a driving lay-up. She stepped up really big for us
in the second half, and Patrice stepped up hitting a couple of jump shots. We
just did a great job of scoring without Danielle.  
  
Q. Takia, Coach made a point of saying you're all Texas kids, you're playing
against these kids with these big national reputations. Do you sort of have a
chip on your shoulder a little bit that we couldn't get in with those big
names and big reps, but we can play with them, too?  
TAKIA STARKS: I think it's a chip on their shoulders for having big names and
being all-Americans. Us, we come out and play how we play our game. It's not
really pressure on us. There's a lot of doubters out there because we don't
have big names, but we're right here proving it right now.  
  
Q. A'Qua, can you talk about their full-court press the whole game? Why in
the first half did you want to get the ball inbounds and let the trap come as
opposed to just blowing right by them like a bit more the second half without
letting them get set up?  
A'QUONESHIA FRANKLIN: The first half -- I think the first shots I didn't
expect them to come up as quick, and it was hard for me to see being smaller
-- it was hard for me to see Morenike on the other side. So once we adjusted
to it before the trap got to me I got the ball out of my hands and made the
pass. In the second half we tried to get the ball in quicker. We were running
different press attacks to apply pressure.  
  
Q. Patrice, can you talk about the spark A'Qua provides when you see her
knocking down three-pointers and coming down, taking charge as her shoe falls
off?  
PATRICE READO: A'Qua is the leader of the team so we know once A'Qua was ready
to play she can come out on offense and we can go back on defense and we can
get the momentum. She's the scorer on the team.  
  
Q. Patrice, Takia was leading in rebounds by eight at half. You were leading
everything else. Coach talked to you about the rebounds. What was the
difference for this team rebounding in the second half?  
PATRICE READO: I just think we just went ahead and tried to take control of
the rebounding. At halftime Coach Blair kind of chewed me out because I had no
rebounds, so I felt like I had to come out and help my team because Danielle
Gant wasn't in the second half and she's usually the one in there getting the
rebounds. I just tried to take control and Micheaux got me in and got some
rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to dismiss our student athletes, and we'll ask
Coach Blair to take his questions.  
COACH BLAIR: On your stat sheet here they made a mistake. The ghost of
Danielle Gant did not play in the second half. They've got her for 25 minutes,
so if you will get that changed on the final book.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to think about this right now because y'all are still
going, but this tonight will go down as the biggest win in A & M women's
basketball history as of today. There could be another one two days from now,
but do you think about that? Are you too much in the moment to think about
what this team is doing right now?  
COACH BLAIR: My biggest win at Arkansas was against Duke in '98 to go to the
Final Four, and this has been our biggest win right now. But we didn't come
here to just win one ballgame. We came here because we've earned the right,
and I think our style of defense -- everybody plays good defense, but our
style bothers a lot of teams because it's hard to prepare for us because a lot
of times they cannot simulate it during practice. You think you can, but give
Coach Schaefer a lot of credit because he is passionate about that defense and
the different ways we disguise it a lot of times.  
But we're generally going to stop a team from shooting threes on us or at
least contested, and I think they started shooting threes a little bit too
quick for them because they were beating us in the first half by going inside
or dribble penetration, which they were doing a great job. We wanted them to
shoot threes because we just felt like they had been shooting 27 percent but
then Waner got hot and hit a couple of them. She's a great player, plays with
so much passion.  
  
Q. We know your seniors are a great group, but when you look at the stats,
three in double figures and a lot of rebounds. Do you recall a better group
performance that you've seen from them?  
COACH BLAIR: No, and I cannot remember a post player since I've been at A & M
that gave me 17 points and eight rebounds and a couple of steals like Reado
did.  
That's pressure because nobody has ever heard of Patrice Reado except the
people in Houston, and look what she did. She's the most unheralded out of my
five starters, but she took up for Danielle Gant and gave us that extra
scorer.  
But I'm so happy for those seniors who believed in me first to say I want to
come to Texas A & M, and this was after a lot of losing seasons in a row. It
was Reado, Purdue and us, and then Takia it was Auburn and us, and A'Qua it
was us and nobody. Nobody wanted A'Qua, and she just decided to come with us.  
  
Q. I'll ask you what I asked your players. Before you got started you said
we hope we can borrow some of those Oklahoma fans. Did you notice any
advantage with the fans here in this game?  
COACH BLAIR: I noticed there was a lot of crimson. A lot of them came over to
our pep rally over there at Sheraton. I invite them back on Tuesday night
because the pep rally will even be larger, and then we're going to import some
more Aggies in. They're not all going to come from Texas but we've got Aggies
all over that Big 12.  
That means so much, but this is Big 12 area because we were an Aggie and
Oklahoma was playing Oklahoma State, we would be here for our Big 12 team, and
it's very special. I think Kansas on the men's side and us on the women's side
and Colorado in the WNIT, I'm proud of all three of us, and we're going to
represent our conference very well.  
  
Q. After the first half ended, it was a pretty tight game and you really
couldn't tell which way it was going to go. What did you think were the main
differences for your team the second half that you were able to pull away and
win pretty big?  
COACH BLAIR: I think one thing, we were not ready to start the second half. I
was looking over there feeling sorry for myself because of Gant. Next they ran
an inbounds play and we were standing around and they scored over Gant real
quick and then you come away on a breakaway and miss the lay-up. That was
huge. That would have tied the ballgame, I believe, and then we got our second
wind, A'Qua started finding the right people, Morenike, we did a better job on
the boards, and A'Qua's three threes in the second half was huge, particularly
the one that went down on the shot clock.  
A lot of kids don't want that shot because their statistics go down when
they're taking that last-second shot, but she wants it, and that's what makes
her so special, all 5'3" of her.  
  
Q. Speaking of Danielle, do you have any kind of update on her? Is she going
to be available for Tuesday?  
COACH BLAIR: She'd better be available or I'm not going to be available
(laughter).  
She'll be fine. She's over there smiling and encouraging her teammates.
They're probably going to have to take her to the hospital now, and the same
thing, A'Qua, we're probably going to have to get an IV in her. She was
cramping during the ballgame. It was so hot in there. That second half lasted
forever, particularly the last eight minutes. For precautionary we'll get
A'Qua and DG a bag, but they'll be there Tuesday.  
  
Q. Just about your defense, it seemed like your girls were -- maybe they're
always that relentless, but it seemed like maybe they had a little extra fire
tonight, and why was it so effective?  
COACH BLAIR: Because of the respect we have for Duke. They are the best team
we play that put the ball on the floor, and you saw that in the first half.
They put the ball on the floor and they were going to the hole on us because
we were taking the three away. Black got four fouls real quick on both of my
five players, and I think that was the difference. But we had to hit the
transition in the first half to be able to separate ourselves.  
Then the second half I ran everything I had when they ran man, and almost
every set we kept executing and executing and executing. But Duke was also
playing very good defense, particularly I thought their man was a little bit
more effective than their zone. But then we made plays, and our defense is
just pretty special, but it's carried us all year, so that's nothing new for
us.  
  
Q. I almost hate to ask you this in the middle of a celebration, but your
thoughts on Tennessee for Tuesday night?  
COACH BLAIR: You want all of Notre Dame? Is that what you said? The luck of
the Irish are staying at our hotel and we've become good friends. I had
breakfast with Muffet over there. She was at the table next to me.  
We're just pulling for a good basketball game out there, one that will go into
five overtimes and wear somebody down.  
I can't give a lot of thoughts right now because we haven't watched one film
on -- maybe my assistant coaches have but I haven't, on either team. And we'll
get back to the drawing board tonight and we'll pull an all-nighter and we'll
break down a lot of film, but then film doesn't break down effort.  
Our game is all about effort. Effort, effort, effort. And when we can play
with that type of effort, it doesn't matter if it's Candace Parker or Charel
Allen or whoever we're trying to stop.  
You've got to play that effort and you've got to have trust in your teammates
because it's not one-on-one ball, it is a team coming over to help because if
you're 5'11" and you're fronting the post, you realize right quick you're
fixing your butt to get in there and there's somebody on that other side there
to help you, and we do a very good job of that.  
When you don't have tremendous egos it's easier to play team defense. That's
what we try to do.  
Before I leave here, I told my wife, her birthday is Tuesday. She's got to go
back and teach over there at Arkansas. We're doing a commuter marriage. So she
gets to be back here for her birthday on Tuesday and I'll get a chance to give
her a present on Tuesday.  
I have a whole lot of pressure on me because she said, hey, if you're good
enough, you'll be there on your birthday. So honey, I guess I'm good enough,
and we'll see you on Tuesday, and we're going to teach those Arkansas kids
over there a thing about nursing, all right? I'll see you on Tuesday.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, we appreciate that.

### [Charel Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18454)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Your thoughts on tonight's game, Coach.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I'm disappointed for the seniors. They got us here. They
got us to the Sweet 16. I thought they had a tremendous effort all year, and
it's disappointing to end on a game like this. We played really well in the
first half. I thought we played well for a lot of the game.  
We had a couple stretches defensively, I think they hit a couple threes, we
missed some easy shots, a couple of lay-ups, and it went from close to ten. I
thought that was the difference. I thought Bobbitt's threes were really kind
of like daggers for us.  
Great career for Charel Allen. She did just a great job for four years. It's
been such a pleasure to coach her. I thought Becca Bruszewski had an
outstanding game, tied her career high. She'll be great for the future.  
Lindsay Schrader played well. I think we've got a lot of good players coming
back. I think we'll be back. I'm just disappointed for the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. This is for either of you guys. It seemed like on the offensive end it
seemed like things were going fairly slowly for a good portion of the game,
but when you guys were on defense they proved to be pretty powerful. What was
the main difference when you guys were on defense? What was so difficult to
stop for them?  
CHAREL ALLEN: Well, I mean, Candace was a big presence inside. She's so long
and athletic, we just gave up too many points to her. For the most part I felt
like we played well on defense. We had a couple mental lapses that we couldn't
fix.  
  
Q. Charel, could you talk about how you guys felt going into halftime, going
up ahead on Tennessee and where you felt coming into that second half?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We felt great. We felt we could play with them. We believed in
each other, we believed in ourselves, and we just fought to the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let our student athletes go. We'll take
questions now for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the game Candace had tonight and to run into
that and trying to stop her?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought she played well. 11 for 18, she scored a lot
around the basket. I thought we were probably -- probably should have looked
at doubling her a little bit more, especially when she was dribbling. I
thought we could have trapped her a little bit more. She's a difficult match-
up for us. And I thought we did a little better in the zone than we did man-
to-man.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dynamic they had working with Candace down in the
low post? What problems did that present for you on defense?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, when we went to the 1-3-1, we could go to the high post
but then we need a smaller person in the back line. But I didn't think that
was as big a problem as Anosike at the high post making the jumpers. We were
giving them to her at the beginning of the game and she started hitting them,
and I thought, we're going to have to change defenses to be able to guard her
at the high post, so we went to the 1-3-1 for that.  
And Parker, she's going to score no matter what defense you're in when she's
on the block. She's a tough match-up inside with her size, and with Erica
getting into quick foul trouble, we really didn't have the size to combat her.  
  
Q. Despite the night that she was having, you guys obviously were ahead of
them for the most part. Did you have a different plan this time than last
time? Did you want to let her do her damage and prevent everybody else?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we were trying to guard the three-point line this time. We
didn't really think that she would get that many because we did want to guard
her inside. We did a really good job the first half guarding the three-point
line. I was really pleased with that. I think they were 1 for 5. That was the
key to our game was really getting out in the zone on the wings and I thought
we did that for the most part.  
Overall, considering the last game we had with them, we've come a long way
since January 5th. We definitely got a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to let you go. Congratulations on a great
season.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. Your thoughts?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: We're still dancing. Good to be here. Good to see all the
media here and we just appreciate the coverage we've been getting. If your per
diem is good enough, go to Mickey Mantle's to eat. It was very good last
night.  
I had no idea, we couldn't figure who was playing minor league baseball, my
Rangers was playing there last night and it was a little too cold for me to
get over there to see 'em and Chicago beat 'em. That's not good.  
We're happy to be here. You look at the history of women's basketball and
that's Tennessee, that's Duke, and that's Notre Dame. And we're trying to
become part of history. We're not a Cinderella team. We're a good basketball
team that earned our No. 2 seed, but we have a lot of respect for the teams
that are here. I know 'em all, I've played 'em all in past years and they're
very well coached. I think you have one of the most balanced regions right
here. If you look by RPIs, I think the four of us RPI-wise is the highest of
the four regions.  
Back in 1998, as some of you know, we had to beat Kansas at San Jose and then
played Duke to get to the Final Four and then play Tennessee. And that was a
special time for us, and all of the sudden you look up, here is Duke again.
And all of the sudden you know who is waiting in the wings, either Notre Dame
or Tennessee. And we're just ready to play basketball. I'll open it up for
questions right now.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were here last year, for the Big 12 tournament and you
got to know the territory a little bit. Is that an advantage to you at all?
And Danielle is coming home this week and what kind of crowd support do you
think she's going to have?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think she's going to have tremendous crowd support because
she's an Oklahoma kid, there was a great story in The Oklahoman today and in
the Dallas Morning News today about Danielle Gant. Two very well written
stories.  
This is a kid, it's just a feel-good story. She was a great player in high
school, but look at the obstacles that she's overcome to get to where she is
today. I don't believe in all my years I've ever coached a kid that plays as
hard as her every possession, every time down the court. I could go back to
Arkansas and say Christy Smith, my point guard was similar to that, but this
is a kid that makes all of us push ourselves just a little bit harder, as
coaches and as players. And if somebody it is trying to guard her, if you're
guarding Danielle Gant you're going to get embarrassed in a heartbeat if you
don't go hard in practice.  
Is it an advantage being the only Big 12 school? Sure, I'd love to Sherri
Coale here, too, and we had have 12,000 fans here, but at the same time Texas
A&M is representing the Big 12. The Big 12 is putting on this regional. We
want to be able to put our best foot forward and show you everything about the
Big 12. We are disappointed that there are only two teams left out of the
eight, but I think we've had a very good year and we shouldn't be ashamed
about the six schools that did lose because all of 'em won over 20 games this
year. We're just ready to play ball and we hope to recruit the Oklahoma and
Oklahoma State fans that didn't go to New Orleans. And I think that's what
you're supposed to do is you cheer for your conference.  
  
Q. Coach, your initial thoughts on Duke, your opponent tomorrow.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: First, when you look at the ACC, it is the most high-octane,
offensive conference in the country, because of the style of ball they play.
When you look at North Carolina, Maryland and Duke and Virginia and Florida
State, go all the way down the line, it's the most offensive conference in the
country. You have teams loaded with All-Americans. You have kids who handle
the ball well, 4 and 5 players handle the ball as well on Duke as well as 2 or
3 players on other teams. They all are coming from McDonald's All-American
games. They've been everywhere. They're high-profile kids. What I like about
Duke is all of 'em can put the ball on the floor and score. They change up
their defenses, they're not afraid of turnovers, because they want you to play
their style of ball, a fast style. And they realize they're going to turn the
ball over as well as you're going to turn the ball over. They just believe
they have more offensive fire power than whoever they're playing.  
I think I heard once that North Carolina was trying to get 110 possessions a
ballgame. That's mind boggling to me. We like to take a team deep into the
shot clock if we're playing on the defensive end and that's going to be a
little bit different, because in the ACC I don't believe they need a shot
clock because that sucker is going up pretty quick.  
I like Chante Black. If she plays as well against us as she played against
Arizona State, we're going to have a long night. We've got to keep her away
from the offensive boards, keep her away from the free-throw lines. Waner,
I've been recruiting and watching for seems like eight years. She's always
been that great of a player, all the way when she was a seventh, and eighth-
grader. You knew about the Waners coming up.  
The point guard reminds me of Danielle Robinson. She is that quick and that's
just like Robinson for Oklahoma is what Thomas is doing for them. What we've
got to do is take her layups away because she can get by you so quick.  
Now, the Gay kid coming off the bench, she is an offensive firepower kid, she
comes up puts the ball in the hole, sort of like what we have with Morenike
coming off to give us instant offense. Very, very good offensive player.  
They came through a tremendous conference. When you have to play North
Carolina twice, and Maryland twice and the other teams up in their little pod
that they have to play twice, it's similar to us playing Baylor, Texas and
Oklahoma twice. I think our league is just as good, top to bottom. Theirs
might be a little stronger at the very, very top. I think ours 1 through 12 is
as good or better than anybody in the country right now.  
  
Q. You've spoken fondly of Oklahoma and the players. What is it that lures
you to this place and how important have their players been in your rebuilding
process and where you are right now?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: What lures me to Oklahoma is a name you haven't heard,
Hattie Colbert who played for me in high school at South Oak Cliff. Played I
believe for Wayne Merriman. Michelle Packer and Stephanie Bloomer, who I
inherited at Arkansas, two very good players who played six-on-six ball, that
developed into solid players. And then Wendi Willits and Kamara Stancle, who
took me to the Final Four. And Stancle from Muskogee, went to Connors and
here. And then you come back and throw in a Danielle Gant. And I'm missing
somebody, and I'll be hung if I forget her name. But I think I'm 7 for 7. How
about Tasha Brown at Louisiana Tech, first six-on-six player.  
This is one of the most underrated coaching states in the country. Whether it
was six or four-on-four or five-on-five, they know how to teach the game here.
That's why you saw Connecticut come down here and get Hansmeyer and Sauer.
Earnesia Williams goes to Texas. Liz Lay fixing to go out to Washington. It's
a very good state for basketball. And I will always recruit this state.  
  
Q. Do you see any difference in this team than in the way Gail's teams
played?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Yes. I think the personnel is the same, because most of the
personnel was recruited by Gail. Sometimes it's very hard, like we're going
through this with our men's team at A&M right now, going from the Gillespie
style to the Turgeon style, and both teams are already at the top. Usually
when a coach comes in, the team is at the bottom. Rarely does that happen that
Gillespie and Turgeon coming in and then the coaches coming in, you're never
in a win-win situation, it's somebody else's kids or this style or they were
recruited to play a different style.  
But one thing she has added is the match-up zone. The match-up zone is what
she was known for at Michigan State. The other thing is Al Brown. I've known
him since the Tennessee days when he was with Pat for so long. Great tactician
of the game and he's like having a Tex Winter on your bench to help you out as
the head coach. The personnel is very much Gail driven because she recruited
it. Now it's up to Joanne to blend her system in. You can win with a lot of
different systems. And she's doing very well with her system right there.  
  
Q. Gary, do you have any concern or fear that your team will think, you
know, oh my God, Duke, Tennessee, Notre Dame and wilt because they've never
been on this stage before? Or do you like that, that you are the underdog, out
of these four.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I can promise you one thing, they're not going to wilt,
okay? We're going to give it everything we have. We've been playing and
practicing so hard, and the kids just have so much confidence in themselves
right now, and maybe our kids haven't been on the grand stage before but this
isn't my first rodeo. And coach Schaefer, we've been there. So has Coach Bond.
The thing is I've got a basketball team, until it's proven different, is as
good as the team I took to the Final Four in '98. It is every bit as good
defensively and the only way you can prove that is to win, okay? If not,
you're yesterday's heroes or something like that, it doesn't work. We're going
to go out there and we're going to change out -- not change our, we're going
to be in a zone, we're going to man to man. We're going to pressure. We'll mix
in our full-court press with our half-court defense. And Joanne is not going
to change anything for me, either.  
You don't change at this stage, you have confidence and as a head coach you
have to wear that confidence into the locker room. You've got to get your kids
to believe that. Hey, we're not up here for the tee shirts that we're going to
get as we go, we're going to have to pay $25 for 'em, but (Chuckles.) Hey,
somebody's making money! What about tee shirts for our teams? We want to buy
the tee shirts in Tampa, okay?  
But this region is going to be very, very good because of how teams attack.
There's no slow-down team here at all. I mean, we're all going to get after
it. Duke is one of the highest-scoring teams in the country, and we're just
going to have to be ready for it. We need to keep the score in the 50s and us
in the 60s, and they probably want the score in the 80s and us in the 70s. If
that happens, that's to their advantage, if it stays in the 50s, 60s, it's to
our advantage.  
  
Q. Gary, obviously the other teams here all have great names, great
traditions, but in the Big 12 it's not like you guys go up against a bunch of
puds; you're playing Texas, Baylor, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. How well does
that prepare you in your regular season to get into something like that?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: You know, I was doing blogs, I'm just like everybody else I
try to write like you guys and do a column. I hadn't written one since the
middle of December when a good friend of mine in the media passed away, Joe
Smith. I wrote one on him, but my next one was going to be 60 long days and 60
short nights. That's what you go through in January and February. Now you add
30 more days to that in March. You try like this to get to April. And to keep
playing, and the Big 12 gets you ready for everything because of the different
styles of ball that you see. You can go play a Bill Fennelly in a match-up
zone, a Mulkey in-your-face defensive style like us, or you play Kansas State
where they're going to hold the ball to the last 5 seconds and see if you're
going to make a mistake, or then you've got to play Sherri Coale with the
twins inside and great personnel. It gets you ready.  
I think we have more different styles than the Big 12. Most of styles I've
seen in the ACC are very similar, because of their skill players. They have
some very, very well skilled players that can put the ball on the floor. I'm
trying two get to Tuesday. Why? Because it's my wife's birthday. April the
first. And she said she would like to see me on my birthday. And I'm doing a
commuter marriage and it's hard to get to Fayetteville and back, so that's
what I'm trying to do is be able to give a birthday present to her in person
instead of having to mail it. To do that, we need to be playing somehow, some
way, and you're at the point now, whatever it takes.  
I will have a talk with my players and make them realize that if there is
somebody that's hot and it's not Starks or Gant, we will go with that person
and everybody better be on the same page. If I've got a kid that's going to
come off the bench that might be better at guarding Chante Black, whatever it
takes at this stage, put your egos aside and put the team first. Put the team
first in whatever it is going to take, because they're doing the same thing
with us.  
Always, always give respect to your opponent. And Duke is a very good
basketball team. And the Black kid, we haven't faced anybody of that magnitude
at the post position since Courtney Paris and they're complete opposites. It's
like someone guarding Shaq and then guarding Tim Duncan; two different
preparations that you've got to do.  
So we're going to have a good time and, remember, if you've got per diem get
to Mickey Mantle's.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, you're back home, is that a distraction or is that a positive
thing this week?  
DANIELLE GANT: No, it's not a distraction at all. I think I play well in front
of my family and friends, so just coming back home and being able to play in
front of them is just a great feeling.  
  
Q. A'Quo and Takia, can you talk about the fact that y'all are here for the
first time, while these other programs are used to this. Do you like that
role, no one knows much about A &M, doesn't know what to expect?   
TAKIA STARKS: Yes, we like it. Being a freshman and become at the bottom of
the Big 12, we were out to get people and now in the Big 12 we were kinda like
the target. So now the target is off our back and we're out to get other
people, even though that Duke has the name and Texas A&M don't. But we're
going to try and go out and make a name for ourselves.  
DANIELLE GANT: Just to elaborate on what A'Quo said, personally I think we
play better when we're the go-getters and we're the underdog. That's a role we
play very well, but I promise you this year it hasn't been our role but we
expect great things in this next game.  
  
Q. Danielle, Coach Blair came up here and said until this team loses, this
team is every bit as good as the Final Four team he had before. That speaks
great to your tenacity out front. Just your thoughts that you may be the
hunter yet you have no loss of confidence against the big programs in women's
basketball.  
DANIELLE GANT: Our confidence, since we've been on this winning streak, our
confidence has been extremely well. We're not going to be, you know, just
because we're Texas A&M we're not going to go out and play -- because they
have Duke on their shirt doesn't mean we're not going to play our game. We're
going to play good defense.  
  
Q. A'Quo, can you talk about you mentioned your freshman year and where this
program has come and now to be on this stage, you know, with some of the elite
names in women's college basketball and what this experience is like for you
guys this week?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: It's been a great experience. One of the reasons why most
of the senior class now came to Texas is because it was a program that was on
the rise. So this is what eventually why people are going to be coming to
Texas A&M, and we're just really happy to be in the position that we are in.  
  
Q. A'Quo, can you talk about the match-ups tomorrow, what can we expect to
see?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: The match-ups we're going to have Takia Starks on Waner,
trying to pressure her, not let her get off great shots. We know she can shoot
from deep. Gant will probably be on Smith, she is an athletic kid and she can
stretch the defense. And basically we'll all match up with the same positions,
and just try to keep 'em in front and try to limit the touches.  
  
Q. A'Quo, do you guys watch much ACC ball during the regular season or are
you strictly focused on taking care of the next Big 12 opponent?  
A'QUONESIA FRANKLIN: We love basketball. We watch basketball no matter who it
is, guys, girls. So, yeah, we are aware of ACC-style basketball. We're just
going to treat it just like it's another game, and go out and play and try to
do what we do in the Big 12 basically and play pressure defense. We're not
going to change anything just because they're ACC.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on your season, best of luck.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONALS SEMIFINALS & FINALS: OKLAHOMA

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Joanne McCallie. Coach, thoughts about
the tournament?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Thank you. We're just working hard, excited to get
better. We did that in the first couple of games and just trying to grow
things a bit. Rebounding-wise and defensively and offensively, I guess all
those things and we're just real excited. A&M is a terrific team, and all the
teams to this point are absolutely excellent. And we're looking forward to the
opportunity and getting through this day. Looking forward to getting through
the playing day.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Chante's performance, her improvement from the
beginning of the season up until now.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Chante is a tremendous person, spectacular player and
she has gotten better every practice, every game. She's very steady, works
very, very hard, and I just think that she has, you know, a desire to compete.
And the most important thing for us is for her to be aggressive and dangerous
and working the ball. Regardless of whether it's her or somebody else who
benefits from that, that's the role she needs to play for us. She is
continuing to get better.  
For her we talked about it, it took a while timing-wise after sitting out a
year, what that was like to come back. It's taken her a while to feel as
though her timing was there, but there is no doubt that she feels better about
that now and is continuing to get better.  
  
Q. Nationally people are going to look at this regional and see Duke, Notre
Dame, Tennessee, and then Texas A &M as the different team here and this is
new for Texas A&M to come to this regional, but can you talk about you and
Michigan State and Duke as a program, you expect to be here and you expect to
go further and how much does that play into the mindset of the type of match-
ups tomorrow?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think every team is really hungry. I think this is a
hungry time of year. I don't think you can put all of these teams collectively
together. These are teams that represent this year and only this year. I know
for us we're extremely hungry because we've been getting better and now
getting to know each other still. Look at Texas A&M, they've got five seniors.
You know, this is where they should expect to be based on the fact that
they've spent a lot of time together.  
So I think each team is different. I'm just not one of those people that looks
to other teams, you know, you have to stay in the moment. So whatever has been
done in the past is not relevant to now, it's just not. What's relevant is
now, and what we can do together as a team. I think that we have a chance to
play a better game. We're for a little bit better game. Maybe we have two or
three guards that have seven rebounds for us, you know, or more balance across
the board. There are so many things that we still have yet to do. That's what
we're trying to work towards.  
So it's not about any kind of name or seed. Everybody here is very, very good.
None of that matters. It matters which team has their act together.  
  
Q. Joanne, what is it that you've seen the most growth in Abby? Her shooting
hasn't been quite there but she is learning so much. Is it her passing, her
leadership?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think it's a combination. I think Abby has grown, you
can look at statistically the rebounding and assists she creates, but I think
it's her leadership and poise, and her sense of calm and her ability to do so
many different parts of the game. You know, and go with the flow of the game.
I'm excited about her game because of all those developments, and that would
probably hold true for some of our other girls that are older, the poise,
leadership and calm that is so important to have at this time of year. I think
Abby has been working hard, and it's been fun to see her grow in all those
areas.  
  
Q. When you first saw Chante on the court did you anticipate she could be as
dominate as she's been lately? And is there anybody you've played that as a
similar style to Texas A &M?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yes, because of her athleticism and her pride. There is
an awful lot of pride in Tay. You've got this athletic post player with great
quickness and a shooting touch that most guards want to have. So that's pretty
exceptional for Tay. And then you've got that pride factor that she has in
wanting to be so very good. So it's been easy to watch Tay and doing so many
things because really from the beginning she's shown every sign of that.  
With A&M, I don't know, Virginia is a team that comes to mind because of the
athleticism. I felt Virginia was extremely athletic in the ACC. Of course we
played great teams. Carolina is pretty good. They're as athletic as anybody.
Maryland as well, Tennessee, all those teams, but I guess the thing is A&M is
a quick and athletic team, and Virginia comes to mind. But we played Rutgers
as well you know, and we feel like we've played everybody, and some teams
we've played many, many times, over and over and over again. So I feel like
there is a plethora of teams that we have played that would have us prepared
for a great team like A&M.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what this first year has been like for you at
Duke and some of the ways following in Gail's footsteps how you just kind of
worked your way through that?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Well, it's been very, very interesting and I think,
again, it's been an everyday process in trying to get to know the team, having
the team get to know us better. I think it's been made very easy by the team
in terms of their openness. This is a great group of women and they want to do
well. So as a group they've made it very easy for me and my staff in getting
to know them and trying to help out as much as possible.  
But a first year is an exciting year. I think the thing that I'm so impressed
with is the trust factor. Because at this point in time in the tournament,
that's truly a critical factor. As you know, many teams in this tournament, I
guess with the exception of Louisville, I mean, coaches have been with their
team multiple years, five years, ten years, a long, long time. So I think
what's fabulous about this group is they've been able to really just come
together as a group and keep that trust factor alive, because that's really
what can be the difference down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Takia Starks and Danielle Gant and the individual
match-ups?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Do I have to? Absolutely, they're fantastic players.
Takia Starks to me is an excellent guard. She's got this shake-and-bake move,
but she's got this pull-up J, she can go on the rack. She pull up a three.
She's complicated because she can change her speed. Obviously plays with a
great deal of confidence. No. 55 as you suggest, she's just a tough match-up
because she can play inside and out, she can play the 4, the 3, she puts the
ball on the floor, she is great at offensive and defensive rebounds. She's the
heart and soul of that team, a lot like No. 10 is. She is their go-to guard.
They rely on her greatly and she does a great job organizing, and just when
you think you've got her, she gets out there and hits a three.  
The X factor is No. 21, coming off the bench. Probably a starter, really. But
she's an incredible player. Can shoot off the pass, has her range, has a great
deal of confidence right now, given what she's doing in the tournament, given
her stats.  
So they have a lot of great players, without question. Like I said a bunch of
seniors, a whole lot of seniors, a whole lot of experience and they're very,
very good.  
  
Q. Wanisha, has tried to put out of her mind what she is going through for
the last time this year, what kind of a leader is she?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: She is a great leader, brings enthusiasm to the team,
and she isn't afraid to say things when necessary. I think she is a deserving
person, I think she should get everything that she deserves. I tell her, get
everything you possibly can, this is not the time to worry about scrap books
and play sad songs and memories, this is a time to go after what you deserve.
I think she is an incredible player. She feels like she has her best game
ahead of her. She wants to be sure she plays her best games, plural, and
that's something you earn every game, you earn that. And I think she has a bit
of an time to do that.  
Wanisha is a great player. I think she would be a fabulous WNBA player, her
body type, quickness, speed, versatility. She can play the wing spot, the 2-3,
she can play the 1, and she's very, very smart. She picks up things quickly.
So if I were a WNBA coach I would being looking at her. She is not the top
echelon in the draft because of stats and things of that nature, but, boy,
she's right in there.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive style of Texas A &M and the pressure
they put on you guys and is there a team that you faced like that or that
you've seen like that?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, we've faced some pressure, we've got some that?
(Chuckles.)  
A&M has excellent pressure. Again, I would go back to Carolina and the
pressure they like to put on you. I thought Virginia at times had some great
pressure. I thought when we played Tennessee. Again, when we played
Connecticut, I felt we got a lot of great pressure there. I think A&M has
their own great pressure and whether they deny the wings or front the post,
the way they get in your face and cut through lanes, and I think that, you
know, our job is to be attacking and keep our poise and composure at times as
well.  
So I feel like we play a lot of big teams, I feel like we've been in a lot of
situations, but at the same time, you know, everything you've got -- every day
you've got to come out there and execute and get it done against excellent
ball pressure.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, best of luck tomorrow afternoon. We're now joined by
Chante Black, Wanisha Smith and Abby Waner.  
  
Q. Chante, what's the difference between Coach and Gail?  
CHANTE BLACK: They're two different people. I don't really know any specifics
that would point out to say differences between the coaches, maybe
personality, I would say. I know that Coach McCallie is a more energetic
coach. She's always in the game, you see her hands going on the sidelines, but
I don't have too many specifics.  
  
Q. What's been the difference in the style of play that you guys have played
coming into that tournament? How has that been different?  
WANISHA SMITH: Just the same mentality, just to try and win games. The major
difference is we had run a match-up, that's one of the only differences.  
  
Q. Abby, who does Texas A &M mostly remind you of that you've played that
year?   
ABBY WANER: Um, I don't want to say a specific team but the ACC, I think, has
that style of play, which would be athleticism, outside of me (Chuckles.) And
run and gun, get up the score, defense, in the lanes, high pressure D, so I
think A&M does fit that mold if you want to call them an ACC-type team.  
But they're athletic, they have great perimeter play, we've faced a lot of
teams like that, that all posed their dangers.  
  
Q. Abby and Wanisha, what did you guys know about A &M before Monday or
Tuesday?   
ABBY WANER: We watched them play in the Virgin Islands back in November but,
you know, they lost to Wake Forest and we got killed by UConn by 26. So we
would like to think we're a different team then, and now they're a different
team. And it's hard to catch games on the east coast, so we haven't been able
to watch them too much outside of that game.  
CHANTE BLACK: Basically the same.  
  
Q. Talk about Wanisha's senior leadership?  
CHANTE BLACK: Nish is a great leader for this team, only senior on the team
that's played a complete four years for Duke. So she always knows what to do
when we get into tough situations and the tempo -- Coach always talks about
poise and Nish knows how to maintain poise for this team. So it's good we have
her on this team.  
  
Q. Wanisha, could you talk about what experience does the program have when
they make so many Sweet 16 appearances? What factor do you think that
experience has?  
WANISHA SMITH: I think it has a major experience, not only for the players but
the coaches as well. Our coaches have had great success, and just being able
to translate that to us we get into the tournament and into different
situations, just being able to communicate to us what to do and what not to
do.  
  
Q. For Wanisha and then Abby, Coach McCallie was in here earlier talking
about how you have a huge trust factor and how critical that is in the
tournament, and obviously she's new. Can you talk about that trust and how
it's built over time?  
WANISHA SMITH: The transition has gotten smoother toward the middle of the
season. I think that's normal to have a new team with a new coaching staff and
just really knowing what they expect and, you know, just trying to do what
they want us to do. I think right now the trust issue is not an issue anymore.
We're completely comfortable with each and every one of our players and our
coaches. So I mean I think that's going to work well for us in tournament.  
ABBY WANER: I think the fact that we have established a level of trust says a
lot about the team that we have. I think it takes a certain level of maturity
and being able to accept adversity and move on from it, and our team does
trust each other, and that makes it easier for us to trust and develop a new
relationship with our coach.  
  
Q. Wanisha and Abby, can you talk about Chante's dominance in recent games
and how long have you seen that coming?  
WANISHA SMITH: Chante has been phenomenal. I think her last game, it was
really good to see her play against posts that were her height and being
physical with her and her being able to withstand the physicalness and still
dominate with the number of points she had and the 16 rebounds. I'm sure that
will carry over.  
ABBY WANER: There has been a lot of talk about how great Chante is playing,
but it's not a surprise to us. All along we've thought she was one of the best
post players in the country, and she makes it fun for a guard to play because
she doesn't play like a low-post player. She makes us look good and we'll get
her the ball.  
  
Q. Chante, how do you expect A &M to defend you?   
CHANTE BLACK: Texas A&M likes to front the post, but I expect their post to
come out and deny a lot, put a lot of pressure on our guards, and you know,
just go from there. That's what we've seen so far.  
  
Q. Chante, you talked about tapes. Did you watch them versus the Paris
twins? Them against Shaunte Smith of OSU? Which ones?  
CHANTE BLACK: We've seen the combination of films, we break it down pretty
well, so we know they like to front a lot.  
  
Q. Chante, can you talk about your plans to defend any of the post players,
Danielle Gant specifically, I don't know if you're assigned to her or not but
what y'all's plans are for those players?  
CHANTE BLACK: We're just going to go out and defend them.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow afternoon and we'll see
you then. Thanks.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Summitt. Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously we're really excited to be in Oklahoma
City, and just excited about our first game with Notre Dame. Fortunately, you
know, both teams are obviously familiar with each other, having played them. I
think just being able to look at their game when we were obviously at Purdue,
got to see a little bit of them. But very impressed with their play from the
time we played them at Notre Dame to the time we saw them on the court against
Purdue.  
We know that their play is going to be key for us, because their guards are
all very much involved in playing off the dribble and running the team, and I
just think just watching obviously Tulyah Gaines and Ashley Barlow and Charel
Allen, the three of them, to me, set the tone for how they want to play. And
they refuse to lose against, obviously, Oklahoma in a very tough, close game.  
So our players understand the challenge, but at this time of the year it's
never going to be easy. So we certainly have to step up our defensive play and
particularly in the one-on-one game.  
  
Q. Coach, this season looking back at the January 5th game, have you all
shot the ball any better than the game against Notre Dame?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: I don't know percentage-wise, but it was a good game for
us. I thought in that particular game our transition, just our board play, I
thought was one of our better games. It was late going into it, us coaches
have to find something to worry about, because I thought at DePaul we played
one of our best games. And, you know, coming off of that game I thought we
might have a let-down, but fortunately for us we played very well.  
  
Q. I know people around the country like to watch you and your intensity on
the court, but your players love to talk about how sweet you are, now nice you
are.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: What do they want? (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Have you changed over the years in that way? If so or if not, has
anything impacted that over the years?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I think you have to change. Because I
think that obviously just looking at when I started my career, and I'm not
saying I'm not demanding, but I think my communication skills are quite
different. And just getting to know each student-athlete that I coach, that
starts in the recruiting process. But I've always said people don't care how
much you know until they know how much you care. And I think we are family,
and I think they have to understand that you have an interest in them as a
person, as a student, as an athlete, but when you step over the line on the
basketball court there are certain demands. And I'm going to continue to
demand that. I might turn the volume down at times. Sometimes it's turned way
up. But I think it's all about knowing your personnel and knowing how to best
communicate with each individual.  
  
Q. Pat, there is obviously always a sense of urgency when you're this close,
but given the fact that five of your players, unless Candace Parker changes
her mind, five of your starters are likely to leave, do you as a coach feel a
particular urgency knowing it might be harder for the next couple of years?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Knowing that I'm starting over next year?  
No, I think every year at this time of the year I just hope that our staff can
do a tremendous job of preparing through our scouting report, and just do our
preparation on the floor. This senior class, they're a special group. They
have been a challenging group at times, but we're in a good place right now
and I think they're in a very good place. We talk about the legacy that this
senior class could leave on this program. Yes, they've won SEC Championships,
and, yes, they've obviously cut down the net last year in Cleveland, but is
there more for them to really leave their mark? And I've tried to put that in
front of them, because I think they are such a talented team that they should
be thinking, we want to certainly let people know that we want to win a
championship. We've won one. We would like to win two. We want people to
remember this senior class for a number of reasons.  
So I think as far as their focus, I don't see it as pressure for them. I see
it as just an opportunity and something they're really excited about at this
time of the year, and they know it's going to be hard. They know that it's
going to be very difficult to even get out of this region, much less win a
championship.  
So they have to bring it and we have to be very mindful of playing possession
basketball. And not taking possessions off.  
  
Q. Candace came in from the very beginning with so much hype, and I was just
wondering if you could talk about her makeup that has allowed her to handle
that and flourish in it and about her as a player.  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Candace coming out of high school, obviously watching her
play and just seeing what a great upside she had to her game, I didn't know at
that time that she was going to be the great player that she has become,
because I didn't know how hard she was willing to work. When you watch kids in
high school you get a different look, and when you get in the college game and
particularly coming off a knee injury and having to work through that, I think
that really inspired Candace.  
I think the thing that has allowed her to elevate her skills and her game
overall is her commitment. I've said this many times, but she is the one
player on our team that has been in the gym the most, and worked on her ball
handling, her left hand hook, her right hand hook, her jump shot, playing off
the dribble. You know, she's really expanded her game through her commitment
of getting into the gym and doing so.  
She'll tell you, she'll find something that she wants to work on, and she's
going to work on it may be on Monday, on Tuesday maybe it's going to be a
different skill, different facet to her game. But she's very focused in
getting better all the time. I think that and aside from that it's just really
running the floor a lot harder, going to the glass a lot tougher, rebounding,
making rebounding and defense a priority. That's where, to me, to separate
herself out now and help us separate ourselves out as well is her defensive
play, and just the presence she can have on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Pat, can you give us your first impressions of the other seniors that
played in that All-American game here four years ago?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, obviously Alexis Hornbuckle to me is a player that at
the time coming out of high school I thought, wow, what a great athlete. Also
a tough-minded defensive player. But now, as I look at Alexis's game and how
she has simplified more on the offensive end and focused on only taking the
three ball when they leave her open and not forcing that, being able to get
paint points, put-backs, her presence right now on the floor from a defensive
standpoint really sets the tone for us.  
And Anosike, obviously Nicky is another player that just really has stepped up
and, said, I'm going to be a force at both ends. She's much more aggressive
offensively. But if you could look inside of our team, what you would see is
that Nicky is really at times the heartbeat of our team. She's the leader.
She's always the one that's pulling everyone together. So in particular I
think those three have, they elevated their play and they have established who
they are, and they've gained the respect of their teammates consistently.  
  
Q. Off the court, do you have any curiosity or any interest in watching how
this event goes? Because Oklahoma didn't make it. There was such a curiosity
and speculation on, will fans come now? How much do you pay attention to that
as someone who is interested in the growth of the game?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Well, first of all, I hope the fans will come out. We were
in a similar situation not at the regional level but the Final Four, and we
lost in overtime to Virginia on the campus of ODU. So Virginia game to
Knoxville and played on our home court, and obviously that was one of the
hardest things, knowing that, you know, Tennessee fans and obviously even our
own department had made tee shirts up that said "Tennessee in the final
three." Well, Tennessee wasn't there. And Joan Cronan, first thing she said
is, "You don't know how many thousand tee shirts we have and how much money we
have spent." And I said, "Next year we won't have to get any practice gear, we
will wear those tee shirts," which we did.  
Fortunately we got back to the Final Four the next year and beat Virginia for
the championship. But having said that, I got on the radio, I got on
television, I pleaded with the people in Knoxville to support that event, and
it was unbelievable, the response. And I think it's all about just getting
people to understand that when you host an event, obviously the people here in
Oklahoma City, and just in the surrounding area, hopefully will encourage
people to come out.  
I think it's going to be great basketball, I think you have some special teams
here. You've got coaches that have been in the game and been very successful
in the game. So that would be my message, and that's what I did when we were
in that situation. I'll just tell you, I'll never forget how the people
responded.  
  
Q. Candace has this said this shoulder thing is fairly constant but when it
happens like it did the other night, does your heart jump up in your throat?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: At this point in time anyone who has a problem with a
shoulder or ankle or knee, yes, it gets my attention. The good thing with
Candace is, you know, I think she listens and also responds well with our
trainer, Jenny Moshak and I'm constantly asking Jenny about that. And Alberta
has a similar problem. You just hold your breath. It's like from the time that
we left Perdue to time we arrived here, we did very little contact, and we did
virtually nothing up and down the floor. Because I am a little paranoid at
this time of the year about keeping them healthy and not going with a lot of
contact until we throw the ball up.  
  
Q. Muffet said she had you at a good time, you have a bad shoulder and your
knees aren't what they used to, what do you think about that?  
COACH PAT SUMMITT: Is she talking about me? She's going to have to take those
high heels off to catch me! (Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nicky, when you beat a team by 24 earlier in the year and they've never
beaten you in 19 tries, how do you avoid overconfidence?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I think they're a lot better team watching them play against
Oklahoma, and I think their guards are really good. The combo guards can shoot
from the outside and drive. So we're maybe going to have to key in on that.
And, you know, this is for a championship, you know, you win or go home. So
that's motivation right there.  
  
Q. Alexis, you guys got the late game again, in West Lafayette you started
off sluggish in that late game. What do you do differently here to make sure
that doesn't happen again?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: I don't know what to tell on you that. You still have the
long days, everything pretty much is the same, the shootaround is kinda early.
You just have to be ready. It's the Sweet 16, that should be motivation within
itself.  
  
Q. Candace, Coach was talking about the transitioning of your game from the
time you got there to now and part of it being your work ethic, could you talk
about that? Also how you have been able to handle and thrive in the spotlight
without it letting it wear you down.  
CANDACE PARKER: At Tennessee you play with the best, you're coached by the
best, so every day you're getting better. And I think that's been the key. We
play the toughest schedule, and in the summer we have some of the best
facilities and one of the best strength and conditioning coaches. So we just
get in the gym and we lift weights, and championships are won in the off-
season.  
We came to Tennessee to win a National Championship and to be in the spotlight
and to have pressure. So that's something I came into the situation knowing
how it was going to be.  
  
Q. Nicky, are you trying to take more of an active leadership role at this
point in the year? And if so, in what ways?  
NICKY ANOSIKE: I always feel like the seniors, it's their job to step up in
postseason and lead the team, because we've been here and we know what it
takes. I know my freshman year in the Final Four I didn't know anything that
was going on because no one really took the time out of their day to help me
out. So I always told myself I would never let it happen when I was a senior
or when I was an upperclassman, period.  
So I really just try and make sure that no matter what, you know, the team is
on the same page, and that your freshmen never feel lost because we need them,
because I know what it's like to be a freshman and feel lost because I was
there. So I just make sure it doesn't happen on this team.  
  
Q. Alexis, I know Pat was influential with you and you had some family
losses in the last year or so. Can you talk about what she's meant to you as a
coach and mentor in the last few years?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: Coach has done a great job of building a relationship and
that works two ways. I had to work hard to get a better relationship with her.
And as you mentioned, I have had family members lost within the past year and
she's just been there for me. She's like, whether you need to talk or if you
need to stay at home a little longer, no matter what it is, I just want you
100% on the court. You see the type of lady she is on the court, but at the
same time her mother instincts kick in.  
  
Q. Pat talks about the combination she needs to get you guys to win, the
"big three." Can you talk about how you have to play and also the last run-
through for you guys, are you savoring the moments you have left?   
CANDACE PARKER: I think definitely our team needs all three of us to step up.
These last four games definitely. You know, we have to bring what we do best
to the table. In terms of savoring the moments, we are. We obviously know that
there's not much time left and this is our last run. I just want you guys to
know I love you.  
  
Q. Anosike, talk about the experience you had in the McDonald's game here
several years ago, and do you remember meeting each other for one of the first
times at that time?  
ALEXIS HORNBUCKLE: You know, I would love to talk about the McDonald's All
American game. Nicky and I were on the East and Candace was on the West. And
all I gotta say is we won. The West lost.  
It was a great experience. We were talking about it in the locker room a
little bit, just being here and having great memories. We have fun together as
a whole and, hopefully we can keep our winning streak alive on the court and
she can get one, you know, because it's on her!  
CANDACE PARKER: You think that is funny! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Candace, talk about the shoulder issue.  
CANDACE PARKER: Jenny Moshak has done a great job. She is the best trainer in
America, in the world, ever. She is definitely -- it's getting rehab and icing
and stimming a lot. I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Nicky, going back to that McDonald's All American game because I know how
much Candace loves that, she won the dunk contest here in Oklahoma City. Four
years since then she's become what she's become, not just the dunker. Can you
talk about the evolution of her game and her ability as a teammate over the
last four years.  
NICKY ANOSIKE: Candace has definitely gotten her hair done since then.
(Laughter.) And now she's fabulous!  
But she has gotten a lot better every year since she's played, definitely
tried to get as much advice from her offensively as I can. She'll whisper
something to me during practice when I'm not making my shots or something. But
I would say she's definitely in the gym all the time trying to work on her
game and it shows. You get what you put into it and she is definitely a
testament to that.  
  
Q. Following up on the dunk thing, Candace, was the reaction to that a
little different than you thought, where it was like, that's the girl that can
dunk, instead of that's the girl that's talented and she can also dunk? It
seems like here and in the Army game that's what everybody was talking
about.  
CANDACE PARKER: In the women's game dunking is not something you see every
day, so I feel like at the beginning it was like that, but then as my career
has progressed it's different. I think now there are more girls in women's
basketball that are going to be dunking, so I think it's going to grow.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck to you tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: (No microphone) -- a game where our experience down the
stretch, all had an amazing game. And I thought our seniors stepped up and
played with a lot of poise. We're going to need a lot of poise and then some
to tackle the challenge that's ahead of us with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess the first question just looking back at the early January
game and how hot Tennessee was, especially Angie Bjorklund, how do you tackle
that game keeping the pressure on Candace Parker and focusing on their
perimeter players as well.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: They shot the ball extremely well from the three-point
line, and we actually tried to guard them, our game plan was not to pack it
in, although it looked like that way. So we've worked on our defense overall
since the Big East Tournament. Since actually after the Connecticut game we've
played a lot better defensively. And I think our attitude is a little better
about the defensive end. We are rebounding a little bit better. We just got
better defensively. We'll see if we got good enough.  
  
Q. You just kinda touched on it a little bit but what are the best ways to
defend Candace Parker and how much of that involves trying to get her into
foul trouble?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I think similar to how we looked at Courtney Paris; I
don't think you stop her, I really don't. I think you have to hope that she
doesn't have a monster game and it would be great if she got into foul trouble
but that's not our game plan. We're going to play our game and really we have
to go out -- I think the first time we played them we worried too much about
her, she still got 20 and everybody else beat us as well. So I think we need a
new plan.  
  
Q. A lot of emphasis obviously on the post game but you've got two teams
with veteran backcourts, Tennessee with Shannon and Alexis, in yours with
Charel and Tulyah Gaines. Can you talk about how key the guard play is going
to be?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: For us our guard play has to be great for us to win and
it has been very good. I think their guards are very experienced, excellent.
They have a great team all around. I think their backcourt is exceptional as
well, certainly among the best in the nation. I think that at this point in
the season, I think in the NCAA tournament I think the guard play is usually
what wins the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contributions of Charel Allen this season,
especially here toward the end of the year.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Charel Allen is the only player in our team's history
that has scored 1,500 points or more, gotten 500 rebounds and gotten 200
assists and 200 steals. It's kind of amazing with the players we've had come
through that she's the only one that's accomplished that. So she has left her
mark on our program, and has been sensational since her freshman year but this
year even more so.  
She's the one who makes the big shots when we need them. She's played well
consistently all year long, has had an incredible season.  
  
Q. The people here say it's all your fault that they aren't going to have to
open the upper deck tomorrow. (Chuckles.) Do you feel a sense of guilt?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: No, we're combing the state for Catholics right now. I'm
hoping to fill up the arena and get all the Catholic school kids out here
today. We were practicing over at the Fighting Irish gym at Bishop McGuiness.
I'm hoping the people come out. I plan on wearing red and hope the people will
cheer for us.  
  
Q. Why red?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It's Oklahoma's colors. I figure maybe they'll cheer for
us rather than orange.  
  
Q. After the first meeting you mentioned that your team was, I think your
exact quote was, "we were definitely intimidated," how do you rectify that?
Does it help that you've played them once, seen that at emotion of fear once?
  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know if it helps playing them once, but I think
it helps that we did play three of the No. 1 seeds, you know, and Rutgers as a
No. 2 seed. So we got better during the year playing those kinds of teams,
certainly coming out of the Oklahoma game, another great team that we were
able to play and gain some experience. And I think at this point in the season
the seniors are thinking, we don't want our season to end. So I don't know
we'll be intimidated. I don't think we will be, but certainly we're going to
play hard, and I think for us, that's our big key. You know, we want to go out
and play our game, play hard and see what happens.  
  
Q. In building your program to one of the elite programs you have won over
the Connecticut and Rutgers, but you haven't had the elusive win over
Tennessee. Talk about what that would mean to break that streak.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It will be great if I wouldn't have to answer that
question anymore. I think that would be the best thing about it. They're an
excellent team and probably the one year we had the National Championship team
we didn't play them, not to say that we would have won, but certainly that
probably would have been our best chance.  
They've always been a higher seed when we played them, and not the kind of
team that looks past people that you can sneak up on. So I know I saw in the
paper again today and I feel like it's printed on my forehead, "0-for-
Tennessee." But I think I'm giving Pat a good time. She's coming off the
shoulder injury, she's got bad knees. I think this year if we get her in a
running game I got her! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about playing the top seed, your team is getting a chance
to play them again after the game, that has to be extra motivation, not just
the loss but the chance to beat Tennessee?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I think it is motivation, not so much, you know, in kind
of a revenge sort of way, but just for themselves to say, you know, we're
going to play our game. I think we looked at the film from that game and we
were pretty bad start to finish. We didn't have a lot of highlights to look at
to say, we did this well or that well. So I think that's been how we've looked
at each game after we came out of those types of games, and said, if we at
least play our game then we can feel good about how we're running our stuff or
how we're defending or how we're rebounding. And that's really what we're
going into the game thinking.  
  
Q. After Devereaux went down, you guys struggled a little bit at the end of
the season. Did that have anything to do with her injury? She was contributing
a great deal to you at that point.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She really was. We had a great week after she we went
down. We beat Pitt, Syracuse and won at DePaul. I think offensively we were
really doing a lot of good things. Defensively we had gotten a lot better
which was surprising because she is definitely one of our better defenders and
one of our best rebounders. We really missed her in games when rebounding is a
big factor. When we played at Rutgers, I thought we really missed her ability
to defend in there. And certainly there are times she helps our press and she
helps us in a lot of ways. So I definitely think we've missed her, but we kind
of banded together pretty well immediately following her injury.  
  
Q. You have lost Devereaux Peters, Erica Williamson can you talk about what
you're getting out of her now that you're using her in the post?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I was pleased with her against Oklahoma. I think having a
big body in there and having a defensive presence. And it's hard to say you
play well when you let Courtney Paris get 24 points and 16 rebounds, but I
thought she did -- she didn't get a lot of rebounds but she was effective
keeping others off the boards. She has had some great games for us this year,
really, really maturing as a sophomore and throughout the year had some great
games. So she is going to be important, I think. Certainly the interior
defense is going to be really crucial for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your other sophomore, Ashley Barlow? You've been
getting consistent scoring from her.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She's kind of the unsung hero of our team. Somebody
nobody talks about. We get a lot of stuff from her. She is able to score out
on the offense, and get big plays. I thought the steal she had late in the
game against Oklahoma sealed the win for us. She is a great free-throw
shooter. She shot well from the three-point line this year, and she is the
most determined player I've ever coached. She isn't real big or real fast but
she gets the job done because she has a tremendous will, and she is a really
important part of our team.  
  
Q. Will you or have you picked Lindsay Schrader's brain at all about Candace
Parker?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: No, we haven't. I know they played together a little bit
back in the day, and before we played them last time we spoke a little bit.
But I don't think -- I think she's somebody that you don't need to know too
well because she's just a great player, and there's not a lot of secrets, I
think.  
  
Q. Obviously Candace Parker, and some of the guards get a lot of attention
but can you talk about Angie Bjorklund, obviously memories of her and Vicki
because, maybe?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I have fond memories of her, and I think she made seven
threes in our game, and we were trying to guard her. But she is somebody that
is a huge concern to defend. You can't worry about the inside when she's on
your side. She had an incredible freshman year. I knew watching her play she
was going to be a great player. She reminds had Beth Morgan who was a great
player in Notre Dame shift, she is just an outstanding player and we might put
somebody on the bench with her just so we're ready for her when she comes in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Charel, like every Notre Dame player, you've never beaten Tennessee. They
handled you easily earlier in the year. What do you take out of that game and
what would it mean to be the team that broke the ice?  
CHAREL ALLEN: It would be great to beat Tennessee. They're the No. 1 seed,
we're the No. 5 seed. We have nothing to lose. They have everything. They're
the defending champs. And I would think we learned when we played them earlier
this season, we just have to guard the three-point line. We gave up seven
threes to one girl and that's not acceptable. We have to guard the three-point
line.  
  
Q. Charel, would you talk about how many times you've seen those three-
pointers over and over? Have you guys watched the video of that game?  
CHAREL ALLEN: We have watched it over and over again, and actually I'm tired
of watching it. So we're going to get out there and show them that we can
guard the three-point line.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Coach said she hasn't tried to pick your brain at all about
having played with Candace Parker for any tips or anything like that. Is there
anything that your teammates have asked you involving Candace that you can
help out on or anything like that?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: I played with her six years ago, so she was a completely
different player than she is now. We were friends back in the day but I
haven't contacted her or anything like that since then.  
So, no, they haven't said anything to me about it, no.  
  
Q. Ashley, would you talk about what it means to get this far for the first
time, and what's driving you now to keep going to the next round?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: It means a lot to us and, I mean, we just continue to fight. It
was amazing to -- very exciting to get to this round, and we played all the
way to the end and fought all the way, and that's what we're going to continue
to do. And we believe in ourselves.  
  
Q. Ashley, Coach said that you were the most determined player she has ever
coached. And also she said they don't run a lot of plays for you. Seems to me
to be kind of opposite thing.  
ASHLEY BARLOW: When you have a player like Charel Allen on your team, I mean,
she is a great scorer. But you've got to stay in the offense, and that's what
I try to do and that's when my shots come when I stay in the offense. I do my
shots through the offense and it's not like I'm out of it. I mean, I just work
and try and do whatever it takes for the team to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, best of luck tomorrow evening.

### [Kristi Toliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15662)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Maryland press conference. We'll
start with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, sometimes it's just not your day. You have to give
credit where credit's due and I thought that the Stanford did a tremendous job
tonight for 40 minutes.  
Credit to them. I thought they continued to hit big shot after big shot. And
really they played poised for a complete 40 minute game. And from our end I
felt like we dug ourselves into a hole early and felt like we were trying to
fight and come out of that for the entire game.  
But credit again to Stanford how aggressive they were, how they played us
defensively, made it extremely difficult and obviously the shots that they hit
from 3 were big time daggers. And they did a tremendous job.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kristi, you and Candice put on a pretty remarkable show. Are you able to
even realize that right now?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Candice played phenomenal today. Made big shots, was their
leader. She did a great job. Right now all I'm feeling is the loss and the
fact that I don't get to play with my seniors any more and that's what's going
on in my head.  
But, yeah, she played a great game.  
  
Q. Kristi, what was going through your mind in the second half though, you
got 24 point in the second half, was there something that you wanted to do or
you saw that you could take advantage of?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Again, I just wanted to be aggressive. I think that I was just
taking what the defense was giving me and I had open looks and I was able to
create and then I kind of got in the zone. That was basically it.  
  
Q. Crystal, can you talk about what you're feeling right now and what hurts
the most from this loss?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: As a senior I didn't want my career to end and neither did
the rest of the seniors. And it's never going to be like this any more
professionally. The team atmosphere, it's never going to be like this any
more. And we just didn't want it to end.  
  
Q. Kristi, Wiggins got her points but how disappointing was it to let
somebody like J.J. homes get her career high?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Yeah, she played great too. Again, Stanford knocked down a lot
of shots and they did a great job in the first half and in the second half we
weren't counting on them making those same shots again and they did. So you
got to give credit to them for stepping up and playing big, not only Candice
but her surrounding cast.  
  
Q. Marissa, even though they had the lead and as coach was saying that you
guys were trying to dig out of a hole, it seemed that you never really were
out of it until the final ticks went down. Did you guys feel that even though
they were 12, 10 up that a couple 3s from Kristi and you're right back in it
and you were there until the end?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: Definitely. We never thought we were going to lose the game
until the final buzzer sounded. We have a lot of weapons on this team. So no
matter how many we were down we always feel like we can get our self out of a
hole with the great shooting we have on this team.  
  
Q. Crystal, could you talk about Stanford's inside game and how hard it was
to score and stop them from scoring?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Well they had a great game plan and they just did a good
job.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student-athletes and we'll take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. When they started, when they came out hot from the outside did that cause
you guys to have to change something that you were doing?  
COACH FRESE: They're just obviously so dangerous when they're hitting 3s with
the kind of inside presence that they have inside. So we really felt like we
wanted to stick to our game plan. That eventually those shots weren't going to
continue to fall. As much game film that we had watched on them, we felt like
the percentages were going to even up. But obviously like I said, all the
credit goes to Stanford for just making so many great shots in this game.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Stanford's inside game. Particularly on
defense against your girls?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I thought that they were very physical. Very aggressive.
And I thought at times from our end we really shied away from the contact and
which is something from our end that I thought we could have been a little bit
more aggressive.  
But they made us with work for any shot that we got, obviously, with both
Crystal and Laura, the touches that they got and the moves that they had to
make, they made everything extremely difficult. They're just talented, big,
post players for Stanford.  
  
Q. Last three minutes of the first half, couple turnovers, a couple air
balls, how disappointing was that stretch and how important was that
stretch?  
COACH FRESE: Well, yeah, that stretch was critical and I thought really to be
able to cut for us into the lead and to be able to go in with some momentum
into the locker room at half time.  
But again I think credit to Stanford's defense and just how smart they are,
the plays that they were able to make tonight.  
  
Q. Another stretch was that stretch of free throws that you guys missed five
of six, you cut it to six, Candice hit a 3, and then you had a chance to get
some points back with those free throws and they didn't fall. Was that crucial
to you?  
COACH FRESE: It was critical I thought. I mean uncharacteristic of us from the
foul line. Again, I don't know if that's nerves or for us we're usually a
better free throw shooting team and it always seemed like when we were
starting to get some kind of momentum obviously Candice did what any All-
American does, she stepped up and hit some big 3s and some big shots.  
  
Q. Was Kristi getting all those points on her own, or were you running
things for her or was she in the zone?  
COACH FRESE: A little bit of both. In terms of our play calling we wanted to
bring their bigs out as much as possible. We wanted to set a lot of them on
ball screens. We knew they were going to make it extremely difficult inside
with their great post presence, doubling, post to post, so a lot of that, some
was play call and some was just a lot of on ball screens that we wanted to
set.  
  
Q. Things got out to such a quick offensive start, a lot of points on the
board, did you have a sense that it was sort of a keep up kind of a mode?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, and I tell you, I thought the tempo was going to favor us,
to be honest. Stanford likes to have more of a controlled pace and a
controlled offensively. So at the time I thought it would favor us to be
honest. But again credit to them, 98 points that they put up on the board and
they were clicking on all cylinders.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the imprint the seniors have left on the team?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I tell you, as difficult as right now is for our team and
for our locker room, I tell you, I don't want to be sad that it's over. I want
to be happy that it happened.  
Especially with this group. What these seniors have meant to our program in
their four years and like I told them in the locker room, to go through your
college career and only be one of four teams to win a National Championship
and obviously to be the first at Maryland and they have raised the bar, they
have raise raised the standard for Maryland basketball and I think that's why
the pain is there just because we have had such a tremendous experience with
them, what they have meant to our program and what they have meant just as
people. Not just basketball players, but what they have meant as people to
each and everyone of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with the Stanford press
conference. Take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, I just want to congratulate Maryland on
a great season and they're a fantastic team. I'm really proud of our team to
be up here and be representing the west at the Final Four and we had to work
very hard to beat Maryland. And we did it with I think everyone really
contributing, willing to do whatever it takes. We knocked down our high in
terms of 3s by knocking down 14 3s we had a great inside presence with Jayne
and Kayla, they're defense and their rebounding, you know, you thought Roz
worked extremely hard on Kristi Toliver, she's a fabulous player. And even
though she did score a lot, I thought Roz worked really hard and that was real
important for our team and Candice, what can I say about Candice. She is a
great player, steps up in big games and she really stepped up for or our team,
knocked down shots. People came off the bench, Jeanette and Jill contributing,
and our whole team was ready to go. So I'm really proud of our team, I think
that through the whole NCAA tournament so far they have really responded to
the challenge and obviously there's going to be a bigger challenge next week
and we'll be ready.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, when the 3s started to fall did you kind of have the sense it
was going to be a good night?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah. I think that just you could tell from the beginning our
team knew, this is just such a special team. And before the game we all
huddled up together and we could just see the focus in everyone's eyes and I
think on the shooting we were relaxed much because we had confidence in each
other and we knew that everyone was going to have each other's back. So I
think that we started out shooting really well and I think that when we got
our offensively and our defense going it was the whole night it was great.  
  
Q. J.J., what did you have for lunch today? What was that about?  
J.J. HONES: I felt like throughout the course of the tournament people have
stepped up big, obviously Candice 44 points, 41 points, Roz had a big game.
Jayne and Kayla have been solid. I felt like people might have been sleeping
on me in terms of that. And so I felt like it was kind of my duty to make
shots and whatnot and so -- I don't know.  
  
Q. Candice, were you considering that what this game meant, were you nervous
at all before the game and what did you do before the game, anything different
you talk to the team?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: You know what, we all talked and surprisingly, no, I wasn't
nervous. I just thought, I knew this wasn't going to be my last game so I
wasn't nervous and our team knew that and I think have you to go into a game
thinking that every time. Otherwise you'll put pressure on yourself.  
I had just great encouragement from my teammates, Jayne, snatched me, grabbed
me and just said some really great words of encouragement before the game. And
Tara also said things and everyone just has confidence in me so I wasn't
really nervous about that.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about how the night went, I remember last week you
said you looked at Candice and you knew she was fine, was that sort of the
same sense you had tonight?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yeah, I think our team from the very beginning was just extremely
well prepared and very confident. You could tell that everyone, we were out
there telling like stories from the beginning of the season, with how hard we
worked and how hard we had to work this entire game to get this win.  
Candice was the best, I told her before the game she's the best player on the
floor and there's no one who can stop her out there. She's played all over the
world and no one can stop her there, so why tonight.  
  
Q. For Candice, did you feel like a sense of mission to get Stanford back
into the Final Four?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. I think we all do. Growing up on the west coast,
a lot of us, all of us except for Roz grew up on the west coast and we really
know that how great of an institution that Stanford is. What a power it is in
basketball.  
So absolutely, we were aware of that and we wear that with so much pride. So
we did have sort of that mission and me especially. Especially being my last
year and I knew that this team is a team that can do it.  
  
Q. Candice, obviously this has been the round that tripped you up in the
past, did you think at all about that? Did you think back on those other two
games you played in the Elite 8 and draw motivation from that or did you try
and shut it out?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Absolutely. That, I think that helped me a lot because I just
thought about my freshman year even at Michigan State, seeing just I think
that what hit me was actually my sophomore year we lost to LSU and they were
celebrating and dancing and I was just like, gosh, I just want to dance like
that just be excited and go to the Final Four with my team. And I kind of had
that image in my head before the game started. And sure enough, we were all
out here dancing.  
  
Q. For Kayla, what is somebody six four doing out there past the three foot
arc?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: They found me on those on the pick and pops with Candice and
I've been practicing my 3 in practice and we have a couple plays for that. But
I think it was just my time to step up and hit them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the work you guys did defensively on Langhorne and
Harper inside?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that they were a big focus with those two and Toliver and
Marissa, but I think that our main goal when we huddled up before the game was
rebound. We said if we rebound we'll win the game. And we actually ended up
getting out rebounded, but I think that it was just, we took it kind of to
heart. We kept that two seed in mind and it just, there was no way we were
going to lose this game.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: The same way. I think that preparing against Pittsburgh and
Cal and the doubles really helped us for this game. We had Candice all the
time helping us on the post and I think it really took the pressure off of me
and Jayne, knowing that Candice was always going to be there.  
  
Q. Candice, you seemed extra eager to take 3s tonight and one time I thought
maybe you took a 3 when you should have been killing the clock. You seemed to
be pretty confident out there. Do you know you can step right up to that line,
you know, you don't have to go three or four feet behind it to shoot.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, I know. In the timeout I think I hesitated one time to
take a shot and Tara looked at me and she said, whenever you get a shot, just
take it. So I think that probably came after that talk, but.  
(Laughter.)  
But, yeah, you know, I think that's I was just feeling it today and really I
tried to attack the basket first and then once you attack the rim you can, it
sets up your outside shot. So I just took 3s just in the flow of the game when
I felt like it.  
  
Q. Roz, they cut it to six, and Candice hit a 3 and they missed some free
throws, but you guys did that sort of unflappable thing again. Where you
didn't let it get to you. Did you guys feel like it was pretty well in control
when they made a run at you?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: In this game we were very aware of the fact that Maryland
has been down before and by big numbers even and has come back and won. So
it's funny because we were on the court up what was it, 10 or 12, with like 22
seconds and saying, "They can come back. You know, they can still come back."
And we were keeping each other so honest, making good plays and coming in
like, we don't even congratulate anyone, we're just like everybody has to box
out, be fresh. So there's definitely that sense of do not let up.  
  
Q. J.J. when you said that they were sleeping, did you mean that they didn't
have you on the radar, they didn't and they were they underrated you or
something?  
J.J. HONES: You're going to have to ask their coach what they put on their
scouting report. But I don't know, I just found myself open and my teammates
found me and I mean I hit shots.  
  
Q. You also drove though too.  
J.J. HONES: Oh, yeah. Yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let the student-athletes go back to the locker
room. Take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. I hate to ask a one person question, in what was such a great team game,
but we have all our own angles. For Candice, where does this rank in the games
that you've seen her, that she's played for you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: In some ways it might be the very best because the most was
on the line. We talked a little bit before the game and she just said to me,
she says, I'm not nervous and I said, well Candice, we want to play more. We
don't want this to be our last game. And I said that you got to just whatever
sometimes when I watch her play like when I saw her play at Maples that last
game, I just said, I can see when you relax and are having fun. Just do the
same thing.  
Actually against Pittsburgh I thought she was kind of tight. And actually in
the beginning of the second half I thought our team was a little tight. We had
a 10 point lead and then we were short on all our shots and I'm like, forget
about the lead let's just play the way we played in the first half. Maybe we
shouldn't have had a half time.  
But Candice just, she hit a real big three for us, she hit a couple of them, I
guess, but I think in the second half kind of right at the top and she was
just such a great leader for our team. She really, I had no idea she really
had 41 points. She had a lot of free throws. But this might be her biggest
game. But I hope her bigger, biggest one is ahead.  
  
Q. Can you remember ever being up by 10 points at half when the rebounding
totals are even and your opponent shot 64 percent from the field?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I really can't. I know that they shot well, but we were
shooting really well from 3. And a lot of it for me at half time is kind of a
sense of how are they playing us, what kind of shots are we getting and we
were getting some good shots. And we were working hard defensively. And
Marissa Coleman was I think kind of the one that was really hitting for them.
And then Kristi Toliver I think she was maybe the leading scorer at half time.
But they were working hard for their shots. We were taking care of the ball,
we weren't letting them just play volleyball off the back board, which we have
seen them do a million games. And we were hitting our shots.  
And we had good flow to our offense. We were running things pretty well, it
wasn't like perfect, but we were getting shots we liked. And then Kayla just
decided to go off. And I like that plan.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what it feels like for you to go back to the
Final Four. It's been 11 pretty long years.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that going to the Final Four is something really
special. Obviously winning a National Championship is even more special, but
sometimes things just have to be right. And I think that we have had some
great teams, we have had some great individual players, but I don't know that
there's ever been anyone that has done any more for their team than Candice
does, in so many ways. Whether it's defensive rebounding, scoring, a team
leader, and I'm just at this point I'm just really happy for her and really
happy for our team to have this opportunity. And the fact that they really
play hard for each other, they really enjoy playing with each other, they're a
crack up just sitting back there and they just wanted it for each other. And
it's really special.  
There's no guarantee, I don't know how many coaches have in women's basketball
have gone to the Final Four, there's a couple coaches that monopolize it, but
it's a really special opportunity. And we want to go there and just have a
great time and just do our best.  
  
Q. I want to know if you were nervous before the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I really wasn't. I think in some ways for our team and for
me the best thing happened, which I think you recognized, the fact that we
were a number two seed. I think that in some ways that took some pressure off
of people and the fact that we played, I thought Pittsburgh really prepared
fours this game. Pittsburgh was extremely aggressive. And that, at half time I
said, so which half was harder, this one or last week? Or last night whenever
we played. And they were just like, yeah, we can get our shots. And I said,
yeah, so let's run our offense now let's play great defense.  
So I thought we did. We really -- I think people really worked hard to do what
we asked them to do. And then you have very -- they're exceptionally talented,
Kristi Toliver, she's fantastic. She's just, we were working as hard as we
could to keep her in front and she still went by. Langhorne and Harper, are
both great players. Marissa Coleman. And we gambled and Strickland hit a shot,
and then we just kept gambling. Before the game I had our manager chart
Strickland's shooting and it was scary how she shot and I was really nervous I
thought maybe this isn't going to work and then Bobby said yeah, but, you
know, I can hit shots in warm up too. So I said all right, we're going to
stick with the plan.  
  
Q. That first half was a little fast paced, Maryland thought that favored
them. And you were a little concerned yesterday about the pace. How did you
feel as that everybody was going up-and-down?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I feel like our team's in great sheep. The TV time outs are
so long that I wasn't worried about the pace at all. Honestly, I was wanting
us to pick it up more. I thought we could have maybe run a little bit more.
But one of the things for us I wanted to keep Jayne in there. And so basically
I told Jayne I said you can walk down the court, but when you get down there,
move. And get good position in the post. They are some big, I mean Maryland
has some very big physical bodies. And the toll was not running as much as it
was when you got there and you're playing against 55 Perry and she's got her
forearm in you or Langhorne or Harper, and they're very physical.  
  
Q. Could I get some thoughts first of all on J.J.'s play and then Kayla.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that J.J., she had, I teased J.J. before the
game and Jill both, and I said, Jill's coming back and sometimes you can get a
sense before a game like who is kind of ready and who is doing things. And I
said it's Oregon day. I said we need our Oregon players to step up. And J.J.
stepped up big. Knocking down big shots, making that steal, I didn't really
even see it I turned and I saw her just going in for a lay up.  
But our team, I think our team had confidence. And J.J. shot with confidence
and played with confidence. And Kayla is outrageous. She just is so she is so,
I mean this, you hear this line on ESPN all the time, as cool as the other
side of the pillow. Well that's her. She is really poised. And she is talking
to Jayne, I'm, they're longer, I'm going to have to lob it a little higher for
you, she is really, really a mature player. And she stepped out and hit 3s and
we have been working on that. So I am glad to see it come to fruition in this
game.  
THE MODERATOR: About the pace again and you talked yesterday about it you were
kind of okay with whatever the pace was, but could you have imagined that you
would have 51 at half time or 98 as a final score. Could you have ever
pictured that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We knew we were both really talented offensive teams and I
don't think it reflects bad defense necessarily, we worked very hard on
defense and so did they. But I think you just, I think it's great for the
women's game. I think it's great for hopefully it's a really good TV game. A
lot of scoring, clean play, only seven turnovers on our team, not a lot of
fouls called. I would think that for the fans that came from Spokane, that
they would really enjoy watching and the TV people would watch it too. I sure,
I thought it was a fun game. And we just want to keep it going. Our team
really enjoyed it, they're having a great time in the locker room right now.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you very much.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started take an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH FRESE: First of all I tell you, just we're extremely happy to be here.
We appreciate every single time that you get to advance and move on and to be
able to play tomorrow.  
I'll tell you, just very proud of how we came out and played what I thought
was probably pretty close to a 40 minute effort from our end, from a defensive
end. And just the unselfishness we displayed together as a team and just being
able to execute the scout and the game plan almost to perfection yesterday.  
So quick turn around, obviously, with the tremendous Stanford team. And as
always, they're extremely well coached by Tara, do a phenomenal job and we
have got to continue to execute our game plan and be ready to play. And
obviously both teams are very, very talented and we have just got to be ready
to come out and play 40 minutes of inspired basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Brenda, did you have a chance, I'm assuming you scouted the Pitt/Stanford
game. And Pitt tried to disrupt Candice that was sort of seemed to be their
game plan. How will you try to stop her?  
COACH FRESE: Candice is obviously an extremely tall especially talented
player, very versatile, athletic, that's why she's an All-American. But I
think by committee, obviously, being able to run so many different looks at
her and players, just because she's extremely talented, again, I think we need
to have tremendous team defense tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Nebraska, start with coach, talk about your defensive effort last
night. Where you got contributions from everybody. How do you get to that
point where you get the unselfish nature and get these girls to buy into
that.  
COACH FRESE: Well I tell you, we were really locked in together as a team. I
thought our hustle plays really were the difference in terms of our energy and
our intensity. But just the commitment. We talked about it leading up to this
game, we talked about it in the locker room and you could really see the focus
and the concentration that was there that we really wanted to defend for 40
minutes.  
  
Q. Crystal, how much through the course of this year has last year's NCAA
exit sort of motivated you and driven you guys?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think we were really just disappointed with how our
season ended last year and this whole season we have been using it as
motivation to push us through and I think that right now after we got through
that second round now we're just a whole different team and we put that in our
past. We're concentrating or we're not concentrating on that too much any
more.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to tackle it. But with Kristi and Crystal being such an
amazing inside outside game, have teams will many underestimated everybody
else. I know that you guys almost all of you score in double figures and that
is been a little bit under the radar for the other guys and that's helped them
pick it up?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I don't think so at all. As you can see when you listen to
people talk they talk about how deep our team is well, how balanced our
scoring is. I think that that is what makes us so good just how anybody can
come out and score 20 a night. So I think we really use that to our advantage
our balance offensively.  
  
Q. Laura, talk about the post matchup tomorrow night with Jayne and Kayla
inside that rebounding margin that they had last night probably made an
impression.  
LAURA HARPER: Definitely. Seeing such a strong rebounding advantage that they
had I don't want to say pressure but it puts a lot of focus on post players as
we know it's something that we're going to have to be focus and be ready. We
have played against very good post tandems before and so we'll just have to
come out and play our game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Who is the quirkiest on the team and what makes them so goofy?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: That's a tough one. I would probably say each and every one
of us have our moments. I don't think one single person gets the award. I
think everybody at different points in time has their goofy moments and does
certain things.  
LAURA HARPER: I don't know. I think Jade has her moments where you just don't
know what to expect from Jade and she just keeps us all kind of smiling and
guessing what she's going to say next.  
  
Q. Do loose moments like that help you guys especially when the stakes are
so high right now in this tournament do you need those kind of loose moments
to relax?  
LAURA HARPER: For sure. We play our best when we're playing loose and having
fun. And last night was just a prime example of just not even thinking, just
playing, playing D, playing offensively, just doing all the little things. And
that's just when we start to flow the best.  
  
Q. Laura, follow-up with the post player. Who does Stanford remind you of
teams you played so far their tandem?  
LAURA HARPER: I mean, personally I think it's like UNC, just because with
Larkins and Pringle just being both daggers and you can't just stop one. But
also coach also compared them to Oklahoma too, so.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I think they're pretty different. I really can't compare
them to anybody. So it's kind of tough.  
  
Q. Can you just from a matchup perspective what are the things you need to
do, what are the things you cannot afford to do tomorrow night against
Stanford?  
COACH FRESE: I think that we obviously have to be able to come out and play
another tremendous 40 minutes of defense. We understand that. Stanford's
offensively, the number of sets they run, it's extremely complex. So we have
got to be able to defend and obviously we have to be able to rebound. The two
staples we have talked about all season long. And it's exciting that I really
feel like those two areas are going to be a main focuses and keys of the game.  
  
Q. Crystal or for anyone else, this is kind of your coach described it as a
bracket that's been a little overlooked and I know you guys have been
motivated by being an underdog and Stanford feels very much that they're the
underdog, they wanted the number one seed, you guys got it, do you feel like
it's kind of a grudge match between two underdogs?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: Kind of in a way. Our team always loves being its underdog
and I know Stanford wasn't happy about getting it the two seed, but a lot of
people still don't think we deserve it and we want to prove a lot of people
wrong.  
  
Q. I want to ask a completely goofy question. The Happy Days, you guys ran
into the actually Happy Days members. By a show of hands how many of you had
ever heard of any of those actors before? Okay. All of you. Okay. But is it
true now that we heard that the only way that you knew who Henry Winkler was
the Fonz was because somebody had seen it in Family Guy?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I knew him from the Water Boy. That's how I recognized his
face.  
  
Q. Tell us a story about that for those who don't know about how you ran
into them?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: We were in the hallway and walking toward the elevator and
all of a sudden everybody was like, that's the Fonz, that's the Fonz. And
everybody was, hey, hey, hey. And so everybody turned and looked back and we
are like, oh, yeah, that is him and everybody started running over we're like,
can we get a picture with you. It was very exciting.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Where was this?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: In the lobby right near the concierge desk?  
COACH FRESE: The funny thing with that story as well one the age gap, kind of
that you alluded too, and then my husband and I spent my husband probably
spent an hour up in the room laughing about the Fonz, just thinking probably
through the course of his life when I ran up to get a picture with him it was
here, with my thumb, you know. And just the poor guy what he must go through
in his life with the excitement that we all showed when we got our pictures
taken with him. So it was a great moment. Light. And just what we need to just
to have a lot of fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Stanford got Cuba Gooding and you got the Fonz. All right.  
COACH FRESE: Yeah.  
  
Q. You recruited Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, can you just talk a little bit about
what you saw in her. She said she narrowed her choices down to you and
Stanford?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, it was a really intense recruiting effort. It came down to
both schools. Just a great kid, tremendous family, she had visited campus
numerous times her and her mother and we did a home visit with her. And just a
special player whose had a tremendous career for Stanford.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies, while you go behind us here and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you had your last meeting with Kristi after last season what are the
things that you wanted her to improve upon and has she come through on
those?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I think that obviously it continues to be a process with
each and every player and for Kristi we really felt like from her sophomore
year to her junior year we wanted to, Kristi is someone who always leads by
example. She has a tremendous work ethic and passion for the game. But we
really wanted her to get more vocal and really display more leadership. And
probably more consistency kind of like you saw last night in terms of her not
showing frustration.  
I think that obviously it sums it up, the floor game that she played last
night for us shows you just how far she's come and how far she's grown and
again it's a credit to Kristi from all the hard work she put in an and in the
summertime to going to the point guard college, to just all the little things
that she's done to put her game into this position to be so coachable is
really a credit to Kristi.  
  
Q. Can you talk about a little bit about the season, I asked about that
second round loss and how much you guys have gotten out of that, but this was
a season where you were in and out not on the road with the team the assistant
coach was there, how did the kids sort of handle all the changes that were
happening in your own structure while they were trying to sort of keep this
going?  
COACH FRESE: I think that our players have shown through it all just the
ownership that this is their team and this is their season and we really
talked about it from day one with our first team meeting when I announced to
the team that I was pregnant and just we knew kind of how the season at times
was going to unfold that I was going to be in and out wasn't it.  
So can't say enough about the leadership of our upper class men and really
taking that to heart. And the ownership there. And I think that this team has
really displayed what a team is really all about. Just in regards to it was an
uncharacteristic season to have your head coach not travel on road games, be
in and out. My assistant coaches, I can't say enough for Daron Park who, with
the way that a new coach coming in, coaching this team, all my assistants,
Erica Floyd, Diane Richardson, everyone really stepping up to the plate.
Coaches and players alike.  
Really that's what a team is all about, really pulling for each other and
helping each other through it.  
  
Q. Was it bumpy ever? It sounds like it went very smoothly but was it?  
COACH FRESE: Well I think like throughout the course of any season you're
always going to have different patterns and flows to it. And I just feel
really fortunate of just all the great people we have in place. And you are
uncertain the first road trip I didn't travel to was UCLA and UC Santa
Barbara, two very difficult games for us. UCLA we were down 17 and to be able
to watch the comeback that our kids displayed I knew that you could just see
something special with this team this season, the lessons that we took from it
a year ago, to heart.  
  
Q. You guys are playing for a spot in the Final Four. Both teams are. That
should be motivation enough. But it definitely seems both teams have an edge
about the lack of respect angle. Will that play a part in the motivation
tomorrow as if the Final Four isn't enough?  
COACH FRESE: I think that both teams know where it's at at this point. I think
that it really comes down to getting out on the court and executing. And which
team is able to execute their game plan or is allowed to.  
I think once you tip up the ball, all that goes out and we're just going to
play.  
  
Q. This is the round that has stopped Stanford three of the past four years.
And two years ago you advanced past the Elite 8 and won the whole thing. How
much does that experience matter right now that your kids have won a National
Championship, played in that game and Stanford's just been trying to get to
the Final Four?  
COACH FRESE: You would like to say that you should, that you can count on your
experience, but at the same point the year that we advanced we didn't have the
experience, we just played. So again, I think that it really, I would have to
say that you just come out and you have to be able to play and you have to
play for 40 minutes and it can come down to a possession, it can come down to
a lucky break. But just wanting to come out and play as hard as we possible
can for the 40 minutes.  
  
Q. We asked the kids earlier, I'm going to ask you about the rebounding and
the battles after you saw what Stanford did last night and what your girls did
too. Talk about that inside battle?  
COACH FRESE: It's going to be a battle on the boards, absolutely. A hundred
percent I would agree with that. And a battle of the bigs. It's going to be
exciting to be able to see from both teams. Just special players, amongst both
teams.  
So getting on the glass is going to be key, I know Stanford's focusing on it
so is Maryland and so it should be a lot of fun to be able to watch them
amongst both teams and just the competition that's going to be out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach I'm guessing maybe your first experience with Stanford
was as a player at Arizona. Just curious looking back 15 years, 15, 16 years
ago, what you remember about Coach VanDerveer's teams then Stanford and
learning from that.  
COACH FRESE: Right. Well I tell you when I was a player at Arizona, Stanford
just like they are now, they were rolling. It was it was back with Jennifer
Azzi and the National Championships that they had won. And always just
remembering and continue to have the utmost respect for what Tara's done with
her team and program, as an Olympic coach, what she's done for our game has
been truly special. And she's one of the best basketball minds in the
business. And she continues to have dominant teams each and every year.  
  
Q. Did you win any games against Stanford when you were at Arizona?  
COACH FRESE: No. Not, not those years. They were a special team, special
group. That had just had done so many things in that era when Jennifer Azzi
was a Kodak All-American she was actually an idol for me. It's kind of hard
when you're playing against her and you think of her as an idol. But just they
were a lot of fun to watch.  
THE MODERATOR: All right coach, thank you.  
COACH FRESE: All right. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the media conference. Take questions for
the student-athletes after an opening statement from the coach.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought our team played a much better second half. Made
some good adjustments. We did a really good job of getting the ball inside to
Jayne. I thought Kayla stepped up big. I was really for the most part our shot
selection was good, and our defense especially on our double on Walker was
really strong. I thought Candice really plays really well within herself when
she didn't force things, she really made nice passes to other people. J.J. hit
some big shots. Roz hitting some big shots.  
And I was really disappointed with the call against Candice having watched it,
I saw it the first time, but when I saw it the second time, it really I
thought it really put her at risk to get hurt and that was something that had
me really upset.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, expanding on that, what's it like as a coach when you see your
player on the ground like that taking a hard foul?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that hard fouls are part of the game. But a play
should be made on the ball.  
I just think that when, there's a lot, people put a lot into it, this is a
situation where in all games sometimes things happen that's very emotional,
but as a coach it's really hard when you see someone go down like that. You
watch your whole season kind of flash before your eyes. And with Candice
having such a spectacular career at Stanford and we want to keep playing. And
our team obviously depends on her a lot. So I was, you just, I think I just
kind of had to kind of pull my heart off the floor for a minute and I ran out
there.  
  
Q. Candice, you're going to play the team that is a number one seed that
maybe you feel look you guys should have or could have gotten. How much
mileage, how much motivation have you got from that throughout this
tournament?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I've been in this situation before where we have felt like we
deserved a one seed my freshman year. And it really comes down to this game.
We can't talk about it. We can't say we should be this or that. This is the
game that's going to prove that. So I think that as a team we're really
focused, we're excited about this and we're just going to play the best game
we can and we're going to play tough and together like we have the whole year.  
  
Q. J.J. you also got knocked down, can you talk about the Pitt game and it
was just a really tough battle for you guys and how that is going to translate
into playing another team that's going to be tenacious.  
J.J. HONES: I feel like earlier in the season like especially in Pac-10 UCLA
was an equally physical team. And yeah, we were on the ground a little bit
more than normal in the game last night, but I felt like our team was prepared
for it. We knew what was coming. We know that in tomorrow's game it could be
equally physical. So I feel like I'm happy we're playing the game that we just
did, because it definitely gets us prepared for anything that they can throw
our way.  
  
Q. Jayne, what do you guys need to be prepared for in terms of Maryland and
what they do?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we really need to pay attention to our scouting report
and to what our coaches are giving us. Really just be focused. I think more on
what we need to do. I think that is, will be a very important thing for us.
Taking the shots that we need to take and being patient and having the focus
that we have had throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. For anybody who wants to tackle it, the Vanderbilt players said they
thought that Maryland resembled Tennessee in terms of their style and their
athleticism. From what you've seen in film or what you've heard about them, is
there anybody on your schedule that Maryland reminds you of?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well I know the Maryland players very well, I played with
three of them several years on teams and I think I have a pretty good feel of
their game. They're incredible players. I think we played Tennessee this year,
we played UCONN and they're right up there with those teams. We know that
they're high caliber, they won a National Championship and we definitely know
that they're a great team.  
  
Q. Candice, last night you guys were the team with all the experience that
had gotten through that round, now you're going against a team where a lot of
the players have passed the Elite 8 and gone to the Final Four and won a
championship. How much of a difference does that make, the fact that they know
how to get past this round and this is the round you guys have not gone past
for awhile.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: I think it helps a lot having the experience and knowing what
it feels like to get to the Final Four. But it's a game. You have to still
play. Maryland's in the same position we were in last year, losing early, so
they're motivated just as much as we are and I think that its just going to
come down to who wants it more. It's really, you know, experience it means a
lot, but I think that it's just going to be who is hungrier.  
  
Q. For anyone, your coach during this selection show alluded to the fact
that maybe a lot of people don't get to see you play especially for those of
us on the east coast, what are we missing out on not being able to see you
guys play that much on TV?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think there's very quality basketball being played out
on the west coast. I'm from the east coast, and I know that they're definitely
is a lack of exposure. I didn't really know much about Stanford growing up in
Queens and being in high school and I had to do the research to find out that
there's a strong program there, a strong tradition, we have a lot of Pac-10
schools in the tournament. We're physical. More physical than you think. And I
think that there's a lot to be said about finesse too. That's exciting to
watch. And I know I've got -- I'm very lucky to play with a couple of All-
American caliber players and I think that people who haven't seen Candice play
and haven't seen Jayne play would be missing out on something is really
special.  
  
Q. Kayla, Jayne was talking about the fact that she was at the Pan-American
Games, she has seen Humphries, she's been around a lot of the great post
players. You're going to see one of those great post players tomorrow, how are
you preparing for that and what do you think about all that?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well I think that the Pitt game really prepared us for the
physicality of Maryland. I think doubling Cal and Pitt is really going to help
us against Maryland. But just as long as we stay to our scouting report and we
focus on ourselves I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Tara, how much benefit is it that Candice knows some is of these players
really well we really well and that they have crossed paths frequently and
might know each other's game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's going to -- I don't know, I think it's going to
be irrelevant once we're out on the court. But our team listens to Candice.
And I think that if Candice knows firsthand that she plays with Jayne every
day, maybe she is played with Laura Harper, or played with Crystal Langhorne,
played against Marissa, maybe those are the three, you know, if she is
confident, then our team will maybe feel that confidence coming from her. And
from what I've heard from Candice, Candice feels very confident and believes
in her teammates, with Jayne and Kayla and Jill and Roz, J.J., and the rest of
the people that will go in the game.  
So but the fact that they know them and they're friends, that's, that will --
I know from guarding Candice my two minutes in practice that won't matter,
because she will go after anybody.  
  
Q. Tara, you guys were in this position two years ago, how is this group
different from that group that wasn't able to get past LSU that year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that our team, the last, the three years that we
have been to the Elite 8 I'm very proud of all those teams and they have all
done really, really well. I do feel that this team is very different and I
feel really different today. I remember just as an example when after we beat
Oklahoma we were not expected to beat Oklahoma and we were not expected to
beat even though maybe we might have been seeded higher, people were very
surprise that had we would beat Connecticut or beat Vanderbilt. We were a six
seed and we beat a two seed.  
We really have been preparing for being in this position all season long. I
think our team's win at Rutgers let our team know right away, hey, we're going
to play with the big women. Our win against Tennessee, our win against Baylor,
even though we lost some players to our ACLs, everyone else has really rallied
and believed in themselves.  
We did have a bad weekend, but everyone came back and rededicated themselves
and I think that that's where someone like Jayne just said hey, what do I need
to do to help my team. Roz is in the gym more, Candice, J.J., everyone stepped
up their game. So I feel like this team is ready to be in this position and I
just -- we have watched more, we're way ahead of where we have been in past
years in terms of preparation. We have been working for this day and I just
have confidence that our team will come out and give their absolute best
effort.  
THE MODERATOR: For the post players, Kayla or Jayne, both can answer if you
like. Last night you had, you two individually and as a team had an
outstanding rebounding night. Out rebounded Pitt 54-30. Now tomorrow night you
take on a team that's known as fierce rebounders, I think the last couple
seasons maybe the best rebounding team in the country. Just maybe just talk a
little bit about how you go in and rebound with a team like Maryland.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that's definitely a big, it will be a huge part of the
game tomorrow night is who controls the boards. Just I think the first thing
we talked about was rebounding. A lot of teams that play in women's
basketball, they rebound the ball really very well. So it will be extremely
important for us tomorrow to really make that a big focus point.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I feel the same way. I think rebounding is going to be a key
part to this game and winning it.  
I think that if we all box out and don't rely on jumping out jumping people I
think we'll win that margin.  
  
Q. Candice, do you have any soreness or after affects from the foul last
night?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Yeah, she kind of got my hand. So it's just my left hand but
it is okay. It's nothing serious.  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about you've had 75 points in three tournament games
and the offensively is sort of running through you. Can you just talk about
the success you've had offensively he in the tournament so far and what you
think it means going forward?  
JAYNE APPEL: It would be selfish of me to say that those are my points. But
it's really my teammates points. They're forced to guard Candice on the
outside otherwise she goes off for 44 points. They're forced to guard Roz. She
showed last night she had hit that shot. J.J., you know, we have guards on the
outside that are going to hit that shot. And teams are forced to stop me and
Kayla inside before they can worry about the outside, I think. It's an easier
shot to make a lay up than a 3-point shot. Well at least for me. Maybe not for
Candice, but.  
(Laughter.)  
I think it's very important for me and Kayla to easily establish the inside
and force them to guard us so that our guards have pressure taken off of them
and can just really relax, shoot the ball and have fun. And I think that will
be a big key for us tomorrow is just relaxing and playing ball.  
  
Q. I'm guessing this might be for Rosalyn, talk about Kristi Toliver a
little bit of the she had a great game last night without scoring. What do you
do to slow down her floor game?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: Kristi Toliver is an amazing player. We know that
Maryland has a large group of players that are all very talented. We're going
to scout them, we're going to watch video, we're going to try our hardest to
learn what are their tendencies. Is she doing her crossover, or going behind
her back before she usually steps back for that three. So that way you can
help yourself and give yourself the best chance of trying to contain her, stop
her, she's a good passer as well as a shooter. And I think that you just have
to be focused and like Tara says, you also have to have amnesia almost too. So
you can't let any one play get you down. Someone's going to hit shots,
someone's going to make a big play. But know that you can do it on the other
side of the floor and that next time down it's going to be a hard shot that
someone's going to have to make on you.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. They will be going back to the break out room and in
just a moment we'll resume the interview with coach. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you address Jayne's import to you offensively, how important she is
to what you guys do offensively and what you guys do generally?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You've watched us play all season, and the thing about Jayne
and Jayne in some ways can do what Kristi Toliver does. She doesn't have to
score to be really important for our team. But she does score very well.  
We do run our offensively through Jayne. And we do come down and look for
Jayne before we take other perimeter shots for the most part.  
She's a great passer, she's a very intelligent player, she scores well. She
pretty much demands a double. And when teams do that, then she passes out as
you've seen her get like seven assists in a game.  
I think some of it is her size, her hands, her court awareness. The fact that
she's incredibly unselfish, she doesn't care about scoring but she just cares
about winning.  
  
Q. Since 1990 nine schools have won championships but only three of them
have won more than one and you're one of them. In your mind what are the
components to winning more than one championship?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that when you win the first one, for us in 1990 it
was incredibly exciting and then you just, when you have one, then you don't
see it as being impossible. It kind of just looks like this really steep
mountain to get to the top and when you get up there you're like, oh, the
climb wasn't that hard.  
And, but then when you start all over again you're like, whoa, this is hard
again. And I think that having been there as a coach and our whole coaching
staff has been to the Final Four and won a National Championship. I think that
our players kind of just realize it's not impossible and it's do able.  
So I think that having, when you do it once then you feel like well you can do
it again. And it's something that obviously we hope to do another time, but
it's a really special accomplishment and it just to go to the Final Four is
really special. To win a National Championship once would be enough. But once
you get it, I think you just, you want to do it again.  
  
Q. What do you think the pace of the game is going to be the tempo?
Obviously both teams can score, they tend to just seem to run up-and-down the
court. How do you think that's going to play out?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well I think that I'm fine with really any tempo that
happens. We're fine running up and down. We want to run.  
What I find a lot of times is that players I call it kind of uphill/downhill.
People really run faster on offensively and kind of go slower on defense. And
as long as we're running fast on defense, I'll be happy with that tempo.  
But that's going to be our focus is going to be our defense and our
rebounding. Then if we can get out and get some easy baskets or get Jayne on
the block before there's a lot of big crowd there then I'm happy with that.
But we don't want it to be just a flat out kind of run and gun show. For our
team we want to really make sure that we're playing with a purpose and that we
have the shots that we want that we're taking the shots that we want.  
  
Q. Just curious, I saw a story you called Jayne the franchise and you have
Candice Wiggins who is everybody's All-American. Could you elaborate on the
franchise tag you put on her?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I might have happened when she first signed with Stanford or
was first coming to Stanford. But just Candice obviously is an absolute phenom
and I love coaching Candice. But Candice needs Jayne. As just as much as Jayne
needs Candice. We need that inside presence. The big that can move some people
out, can score on the block, that passes as well as she passes. And when you
look at all the teams that are pretty much in it, at the end they always have
some really big physical post players as Maryland has three of them.  
So we're really fortunate to have Jayne, because we can build a team around
her. And as much as we're going to miss Candice next year, which we will miss
her terribly, to have Jayne as a foundation of your team is a great starting
point. She is -- I think she's in a lot of ways the rock to our team. We go to
her and she delivers.  
THE MODERATOR: Looking back and I asked you a question similar to this on
Friday about just coaching for as long as you have, but Coach Berenato of
Pittsburgh talked both yesterday and the day before about just the growth of
women's basketball and how important it is and thanked the writers and you
started down south in Moscow, Idaho and now an at Stanford, just kind of
curious from the AIAW tournament at Idaho to here today, just what you've seen
in growth in the sport.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that we have always had very talented female
athletes and what we have now is more opportunity for them to play and improve
and grow and do things that some of them never got a chance to do. With
scholarships, with basketball camps, with so many summer teams and high school
tournaments, I just think sports is just besides being so much fun, I think
it's very valuable to the experience of both young men and young women. And we
have seen a boom, but we also know that we have a very, very long way to go.  
We just -- I'm really thankful that I work at a university that values women,
that values women's opportunity to play and we just -- I love my job and I
just, I can't even, sometimes I'm just really thankful that I wake up every
day as a basketball coach. Especially this morning. It felt really good.  
  
Q. Sort of dovetail off that, are there structural things that the game
needs? One two or three things that this sport could use to sort of move it
up, move it forward?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Tell me your first name again.  
  
Q. Milton Kent.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Milton, that's an excellent question. You know, I don't
pretend to have the crystal ball for basketball, but I think that a lot of the
leadership in the NCAA, women's basketball, that this is a great tournament
and the NCAA puts on a first class tournament just like here and we talked
last night about how the number of people coming out and watching is great and
I hope we have a great tournament out tomorrow night.  
But I think that it's really important if there were things to do, I would say
institutionally that each place, whether it's Stanford or universities to
really value the experience for women as much as they do for men. To put the
resources and put the focus and give the women the same opportunities to have
great competition, to have great coaching, and to really grow the game. That
would be I think institutionally we should do that.  
And I think that across the country you see different places, different
pockets really promoting and really working hard to make women's basketball a
big time sport. Which I think it should be. That would be my first kind of
idea.  
I think another thing is that to get away from kind of east coast, west coast.
I see it in so many things like we play east coast style and women's
basketball is going to be better when everyone is included in the
conversation. That in fact it's that women's basketball is great nationally.
And not just this conference or that conference. And to get away from also the
kind of a labeling of well this is the best player and this is a best program,
but that there's more depth and breadth to the excellence of women's
basketball. And then I just think that my third thing would be to really work
on developing coaches that really make it a quality experience for student-
athletes. That we don't get into just pressure, the pressure of coaches to win
or not to lose their jobs, and that they don't make it a quality experience
for the student-athletes.  
I think that their experience should be the number one thing. And, yes, I am
proving, but, and yes, you want to win as a coach, but really the education
and mentoring of young women and more women in women's basketball.  
  
Q. If I can follow-up the last part up particularly. Is it possible though
as more money comes to the sport and more demands come to coaches, obviously
there are more high six figure, more seven figure contracts coming, can a
coach really afford to spend the time sort of making the experience better
when the principal function seems to be now to win?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think the salaries of coaches should dictate the
experience of the student-athletes. I think that I do think that it would be
great to see improving salaries across the country for coaches, women's
coaches and not have the disparity between men's and women's coaches and
that's a whole discussion about maybe separate discussion there, but I think
that the experience for both men and women and the college and high school, we
do set the, we do set the tone a little bit. People come and watch our
practices and people watch games and see our behavior and I think that
modeling good behavior and mentoring young women should be the focus of our
job, not just winning games. That the, just the winning should not be
everything.  
And I think it's do able. But I think that it will take, it takes, I don't
know, some strong leadership, whether it's in the NCAA or institutionally, and
people really saying that this is important. That the student-athlete's
experience is the key ingredient in the whole.  
  
Q. To develop the game, women have 15 scholarships, men have 13. That
probably plays a role in more Mid Majors or more upsets among the men. Is that
something that the women should consider or is Title IX make that
impossible?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You mean like having fewer scholarships?  
  
Q. Yeah, so the talent is spread out again farther so there's more
interest.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a good question too. And in some ways in a
lot of programs you don't use all 15 scholarships. And a lot of programs I
think actually abuse kind of male practice players and the number of guys in
practice and if you make a mistake on a recruit, they're not practicing,
you're playing against guys every day. But we do have is a real high inches
dense of ACL injuries that like on every team you can find I'm sure at least
one and maybe two. And that's in women's basketball and not in men's
basketball.  
So we could probably work it with 14. And like right now we only have really
11 healthy players, but I think that somewhat based on injury and if you
didn't then you would have less opportunities for women and more male practice
players.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach. Thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We got into philosophy here. Dang, I got to just think about
Maryland.  
(Laughter.)

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement by
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, I just really loved our defensive intensity and our
hustle throughout the game. And I thought that we came out really inspired and
wanted to come out and play as aggressive and focused as we could from the
defensive end. And just a credit to this team. We were excited. We were ready
to come out and play some of our best basketball, and I thought that we did
just a tremendous job on the offensive end as well. The unselfishness that we
displayed, being able to get the ball inside, being able to be aggressive and
then being unselfish with each and every play that we made. And a credit to
this team, also a credit to Vanderbilt, I thought they played really scrappy
and were a tremendous team.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Any of you, can you remember the last time you guys played confidently
and as dominantly as you did from start to finish?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: I have a bad memory, so I'll use that. I can't remember.
It's probably one of our best games, but I'm not sure exactly when it was.
We're just happy we're playing like that right now.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: I also have a bad memory. But a game that really sticks in my
mind, it probably wasn't the last game but a great game that we had was
against LSU and against Oklahoma. I think we played tremendously from start to
finish, all 40 minutes. And I think that we executed the game plan. We played
loose and free, and that's exactly what we did tonight. So I think you can
compare those two games.  
  
Q. Marissa, can you talk or Kristi, can you talk about the contributions
Marah had coming with those 3s early on?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think she played great today. She had been struggling in
our past couple games and I think she came up big for us. She hit key 3s for
us when they were going on their runs, and I think a few of her 3s were
definitely demoralizing for them and daggers in their hearts and got us going.  
  
Q. Kristi, did you make a concerted effort coming into tonight to feed the
post and maybe not take your shot because you didn't take a shot until like
the last minute of the first half.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: Not consciously. I know that we always go inside and out. We
have the best post players in the country, and we were just trying to
distribute to everybody. And everybody today was -- I felt like Tom Brady.  
(Laughter.)  
Everybody was just connecting. And we had great chemistry, and everybody was
executing offensively for the game plan. So I just had a lot of fun just
seeing them succeed and finish plays.  
  
Q. Crystal, you guys look especially inspired. Does it even cross your mind
before games like this that any of these games could be your last?  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: You can't help but think about it being a senior. I think
that's what our senior class thinks about a lot. Any game could be our last
and we just want to go out there and play hard every minute we're out there
because you never know when it's going to be your last few plays.  
  
Q. Marissa, you guys talked about playing good defense before but this is
the first time in a long time you really played great defense. What led to
that tonight?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think just listening to different people in the media,
watching ESPN, and us not really being the talk of things and mainly because
of our defense. So I know from us talking we just wanted to make a conscious
effort to go out there and get stops. Especially from the guard's end we
struggled with our perimeter defense a lot this season, and I think tonight it
was 1 through 5. Whoever was in the game we communicated well, and we executed
our game plan and got stops after stops.  
  
Q. Kristi, do you always smile when somebody fumbles a pass and misses an
assist for you?  
KRISTI TOLIVER: You know, that was something I consciously wanted to do today.
I wanted to smile for 40 minutes. And they're not going to make them all, and
I think that today I wanted to work on my mistake response and not get so
negative and not get so down, not scowl because these guys are watching me.
And if they're watching me smiling when they're missing, of course I'm going
to smile when they make it. And I think that gives them the extra confidence
to go up and finish plays.  
CRYSTAL LANGHORNE: It does.  
KRISTI TOLIVER: I know it does.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: All right. They will go to the locker room, and we'll hear from
Coach Frese.  
  
Q. Laura's defense in particular, I know she got in some foul trouble, but
it looked like she was really playing some of her best. Can you talk about her
performance tonight?  
COACH FRESE: I thought given the limited minutes that she played because of
the foul trouble, she was really the energy and the spark on the defensive end
and I think you could see that even at times when she had to go out because of
the foul trouble just what she brings to the table and I thought she was huge,
especially with her play against Wirth, she's very talented and I thought that
Laura made her work for everything tonight.  
  
Q. Marissa mentioned not being the talk of things and I guess no one has
been really talking about Maryland winning it this whole thing. Do you think
maybe they might start talking about you now?  
COACH FRESE: I hope not. I love it right where it's at. It remind me of two
years ago and it's just amazing that you can continue to dismiss this team
32-3 and not see the positives of how this team plays.  
Obviously they're a tremendously talented offensive team and we rebound the
ball extremely well. But I hope it just continues right along the path that
it's been. I think that's, we work better that way.  
  
Q. Christie's game, especially the first half, how impressed were you with
how she was distributing the ball?  
COACH FRESE: I thought she was a floor general for us. Really set the tone.
And just her presence her poise, being able to get the ball to the amount of
touches that she was able to get inside for Crystal was really key in terms of
our overall game.  
  
Q. How reliable has Crystal been for you guys down the stretch?  
COACH FRESE: Oh, I mean, Crystal's obviously our go to player. The fact that
any pass you throw in there she's going to catch and I thought really it was
as physical as it was inside she was able to make so many plays and obviously
it's no secret she's our go to player inside.  
  
Q. You only had one point from your bench, is that a concern?  
COACH FRESE: Well I think that any time we have obviously been able to get
great energy. And in any game it's different. To be able to see the energy
that we were able to get from Jade in this game and obviously the last game
from Ashleigh, but it's all kind of related at times and from our end when you
look at the talent that we have the media time outs are about five minutes
long and in the tournament, so I just really felt today in the flow, we were
well rested, and just that's why really why our starters played so many
minutes.  
  
Q. Couple of the players said yesterday that they felt the pressure was off
after having getting through the first week. Did you sense that they were a
little more relaxed?  
COACH FRESE: I could sense it from our last game at home against Nebraska,
just the relief that we had. And just coming out here we have had great
practices leading up to this and I definitely think that like you see tonight,
just from our end, being able to play so freely makes a big difference in our
play.  
  
Q. How important was the last five minutes of the first half. You let
Nebraska back in the game the other night and it seemed like you put your foot
on the gas?  
COACH FRESE: We talked about it. We didn't want to lose our focus and we
wanted to play, obviously, a complete 20 minutes when we were out there. And
we really talked about it in that last time out and just great to be able to
see the focus and the intensity that we had on the defensive end.  
  
Q. There was some people saying that Vanderbilt kind of reminded them of you
two years ago. Young, kind of nothing to lose and playing hard. Do you think
that gave your team a little bit of focus knowing what they were going through
so they didn't let them play that way tonight?  
COACH FRESE: Our team respects every opponent that we play and we could really
tell on film we knew how well coached Vanderbilt was. How their team is, I
mean just played very scrappy like you saw tonight and we don't want to
underestimate anyone and this team won't. Not with the pride that we have and
with what we're playing for.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. That will conclude the interview. Thank you, cope.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.

### [Shavonte Zellous](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18451)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BERENATO: Just like to congratulate Stanford. I thought they just did a
great job and they really I think took it to us on the inside. And the
rebounding was a huge factor in the game. And we were out rebounded by 24. And
that had a lot to do with the size of Appel and Pedersen. So congratulations
to them and I wish them the best of luck as they continue on their questions
to a National Championship.  
At the same time, I just want to say just how proud I am of my team and of the
university of Pittsburgh. And I think that, it was a great honor to be in the
NCAA but we didn't just settle, we just weren't happy to be in the NCAA. We
felt like we could really he do some damage and I just think that what the
seniors have done, Marcedes and Mallorie and what they have done, it's just
been great and Shavonte Zellous, she's an awesome player and she's a great
teammate, she really took the team on her back tonight and I thought that you
could see some of her explosiveness and she's charismatic on the court.  
And I thought Mallorie Winn really stepped up and just did a great job.  
So for what these ladies have done for the university of Pittsburgh and for
the people of Pittsburgh, for our Chancellor and Steve and Carol and Don and
our community. We're a hard working community, I think I mentioned that the
other day and they bring their lunch pail and their hard hat pretty much every
day and I just can't say enough about them.  
Again, to the seniors, they were just, they're a pleasure. I don't look at it
as that they're leaving or our season is over for them it's just beginning.
And really that's what an education is all about. I think they will have great
a careers and for Shavonte we have next year and we'll start working and I
wish we could play another game tomorrow. We definitely, I definitely my staff
Jeff, Caroline and Shay, we want to thank them.  
We're not ready for this to be over. So to everybody involved but especially
to my team, it's just a hell of a group of girls and ladies and you know what
they're going to be community changers. They're life changing people. And I'm
really proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcedes, how tough of a matchup was Appel inside and then the second
part of that they seemed to double down on you a lot and it didn't seem like
you guys were ever able to figure out how to get the offense going out of that
double team.  
MARCEDES WALKER: She's a really good player. I knew coming into this game she
was a really good player and I knew I was going to have to play a strong game.
She had the best of me. And as for like the double team, we knew that they
were going to double and that was a lot that we were working on in practice,
so we were expecting them to double, it was just that we couldn't, I didn't
hit any shots and I wasn't aggressive on the double team and I tried to kick
it back out and stuff like than just re-post but we wasn't able to get it
going.  
  
Q. Shavonte, can you just talk about what it was like to kind of engage in a
game like that, especially in the first half when it was so close and where
you felt like it got away.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: In the first half it was close. I think that the second half
it was close too. They just, we let them get away from us. I think that they
by them off offensive rebounding and put backs, the things like that, we let
it slip through our hands and that's how they got away from us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions now for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about at one point it was 49-46 with about seven and a half
left and you took out both Zellous and Walker. And that's what when the game
got away a little bit. They went on a run. How hard was it to see that happen
under those circumstances, I guess.  
COACH BERENATO: Well, it was very hard and you know, Walker had four fouls.
And Shavonte, she rarely, rarely, rarely, I mean rarely asks for a breather.
And she had asked for a breather and it just happened that Marcedes had picked
up her fourth foul so we just felt like we thought that we used a time out, we
thought that would be good enough. But I just thought that they really
exploited the inside on us. I thought that then we rest a couple sets probably
took some ill advised shots, missed, didn't get the rebound, then went down
and they connected and I thought that they scored the two plus one and then
the very next time down the court they penetrated, we had like three great
stops and on the rotation they kicked it out to the wing and they hit that
three. And I thought that that was a dagger we got Tay Tay right back and they
came right back down and she hit, the same girl hit the shot again, you know,
a three. And I felt at that like that was really tough to overcome and then it
was nine points and we really we just didn't chip it away after that to be
honest with you.  
I thought that really up until about two and a half minutes to go it was a
three possession ball game four possession ball game and that's a reasonable
ball game. We pressed them and I thought that we surprised them with that. But
their size really hurt us. I thought that, um, you know, they just they really
exploited us on the inside.  
  
Q. Coming into the game did you ever imagine that they would have such an
edge in the rebounding department, really physically dominate you the way they
did?  
COACH BERENATO: I knew their size. They start two six four kids and so we have
really felt that Pedersen was going to be the difference maker to be honest
with you. We felt like my kid is five nine and that starts at the four spot so
she was somebody that we were really worried about. But we thought maybe we
could out physical them and I did think in the first half I thought it was a
tremendous game it was really a physical game, it was a fun game, it was a
great game, and the first 13 minutes of the second half, so you look at 33
minutes and then like I said, you know, I felt like if we could just keep
going at them, go at them, just attack and maybe we could wear them down.  
But actually it was the reverse. And I thought they just did a great job of
just running their splits, running their sets, running their curls and they
just dominated us on the inside. Dribble penetration as well as just both
Pedersen and Appel on the flares and the handoffs.  
  
Q. I know it's tough to look at the whole season after a game like this, but
can you put into perspective what the team accomplished this year and do you
think you were maybe even a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of where the
program is?  
COACH BERENATO: Yes, I think I can put it into perspective where the team is.
And it's not hard for me to think about it after a loss because winning and
losing is part of it. That's just the way it is. I did not think that we would
be sitting here as the losers tonight. We really felt into our heart and soul
we were distinguishing to make it to the Elite 8 and have the opportunity to
play. But I feel like I enjoy every moment. And I try to make the team and the
staff aware of everything that we have accomplished along the way.  
I'm not real good at like strolling down memory lane. I don't have a very good
memory. I don't remember who I met five minutes ago, so that's in the past.
But I do really think that I really live for today and I enjoy everything and
every minute of what we do. And I feel like it was great year for us. We tied
our record number of wins with 24, which is what we got last year. We beat I
think five or six Top-25 teams. Which is a record. We beat a team in the
Top-10 when Notre Dame was number nine in the country. We got our first Top-20
away win, which was DePaul, January 6, and we beat them by 30. We beat West
Virginia who was 13th in the country, we beat Baylor who was just a national
name.  
But more importantly I think we have three seniors -- that Mallorie has
already graduated. And Marcedes and Karlyle will graduate in April. And
Shavonte will also graduate as you know she's a junior. And these people are
just such wonderful people. And I think probably the most important thing that
we have done and I always say winning is great, but losing like the highs of
winning are not as low as the lows of losing. And it's hard to lose. But I
don't think that we are losers. Tonight it was a double win for Pittsburgh.
And I know some people might go, oh, that's so contrite or that's so whatever,
but I really believe that. Because I feel like Pitt women's basketball has
been embraced by the community. And has been embraced by the community of
Pittsburgh as well as the university.  
And I think that five years ago that's something that my staff and I, we were
brought here to do. We were brought here to be healers and I think it's about
people, it's about the story, and if you look at the stories of the kids on my
team, it's so much more important and so much more valuable than pick and roll
or a 1, 3, 1, nobody's more devastated than me for losing. But at the same
time I think that we really he need to keep it in perspective and I think the
university and I think the community and this team has really a lot to be
proud of.  
THE MODERATOR: All right.  
COACH BERENATO: I'm just going to say before we leave. Okay. I probably have
another minute, right.  
THE MODERATOR: You got four or five.  
COACH BERENATO: Damn. All right.  
(Laughter.)  
COACH BERENATO: Well let me -- no, I'm just kidding. Just, I just want to say
to the NCAA, and I really I guess I really he can't see back there, but I
don't really he know who is here but NCAA and to the people of Spokane, you
guys have done a tremendous job just in hosting and you have embraced us. And
to my host family, John and Karen, you guys are awesome and I'm sure you're in
the audience somewhere. And Ray and Kevin, coming out here from Pittsburgh and
to the other writers, if you guys don't write about our story, our story never
grows. And as the NCAA they, we're the NCAA. We represent them. And women's
basketball is the greatest story in the world. And they're great student-
athletes. And they're kind and they're gentle women and they care and they're
great volunteers and they're just hard working kids and so I just want to say
to everybody that's here, the auxiliary people that have helped with this,
with facilities and travel and security and catering and I know all about it,
because when I was at Georgia tech I hosted two Final Fours and at Pitt we
hosted a regional last year.  
And then just a special shout out to our Chancellor and Steve Petersen and my
staff, you know, who has really changed the face of women's basketball at the
University of Pittsburgh. I feel like that is team now, it's a team that
people will recognize and they have worked hard for it and they brought great
pride to the university as well as to the community. But we could have never
done it if my staff and the community and the administration didn't jump on
board.  
So to all of you that are here tonight, it's late somewhere, in the world, and
I just want to say it's like the saying it's five o'clock somewhere. Well, I
just want to say on behalf of my team, thank you all very much because by you
being here our sport will grow and grow and grow and all these NCAA events
will be sold out in the future. So thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach thank you.

## March 29, 2008

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Jennifer Risper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18063)

### [Christina Wirth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16901)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then go to
questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BALCOMB: I'm just really proud of this team. I think their improvement
over the season has been amazing. I just, I feel bad for them not playing to
the level they have been playing for the last two months.  
We didn't give it our best effort. Maryland's a great team. We got so good
defensively and just didn't come out with that intensity and dictate and got
down against too good of a team to really come back.  
But we fought back and I'm really proud of the way we handled ourselves in the
second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How did Maryland compare to Tennessee or LSU?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I guess to Tennessee they would compare, they're really good
in transition, a really good offensive team. I thought they did a good job
with their switching man. And then LSU just with their switching man and just
being aggressive, being physical down low, that's how they would compare to
those teams.  
  
Q. Do you think they can compete with them?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Yes, definitely. I definitely believe that they can compete
with Tennessee.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about offensively it was a struggle to get some things
going it looked like and especially from long distance for yourself. Were they
doing something special with you?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: Like Jennifer said, they were switching every time on pretty
much all their screens, so I didn't get very many open looks. The ones I did
have I just didn't knock down, and that happens.  
I think that all year we prided ourself on our defense, and that's how we win
games. Every team's going to have a night where they struggle shooting the
ball and you can't rely on that. And tonight we just didn't get it done on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. For both of you, talk about the year in general, what you felt like you
accomplished and what you're looking forward to in the future.  
JENNIFER RISPER: Kind of like what Coach said. We have come a long way. Just
in the beginning of our season with one of our first losses to Indiana State
if you look back and you see where we came defensively, offensively, we just
formed together as a team on and off the court. We worked a lot harder as the
season went on. Even last year just making it this far to the Sweet 16 that's
just an amazing accomplishment in itself.  
So I guess I just would say that we came a long way from the beginning of the
season, and we have definitely added. We know where we want to be next year.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: We did great. We have come a long way. We have had a lot of
adversity, and I think that it's made us stronger as a team. I think a lot of
times when they face adversity they start to sort of go their separate ways,
and that definitely wasn't the case with us, and I'm proud of our team. I
think that our young players stepped up. And something that we talked about in
the locker room was next year we're not going to be a young team, we're going
to have a lot of players with a lot of experience, and we're just going to
remember this feeling and build on it next year.  
THE MODERATOR: All right we'll excuse them to the locker room and take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I asked the players about Tennessee, because the Maryland side of things
they feel like they have been kind of left out of the discussion about who was
going to get to the final. Do you think this is a potential finals team?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, I guess so. I haven't watched any of the other teams. I
have been preparing for Maryland.  
  
Q. You played Tennessee three times this year. Are they comparable to
Tennessee?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah. I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about their offensive efficiency. It seemed like they
got it inside with Crystal and then enough outside game Toliver, just the
aspects you have to deal with when you're guarding them.  
COACH BALCOMB: Toliver handles the ball extremely well. She just has a really
good sense of the game. I think it was really tough for our guards with our
matchup with the different defenses, switching man, everything, we had so many
different people on her, but she is really, she really reads the game very,
very well and is extremely confident, and she can change speeds and take you
off the dribble, penetrate and dunk to those posts.  
I think also getting 42 points inside in the paint was really something that
hurt us. We gave Langhorne, a really, really deep position inside and again,
that not dictating, but it's really hard to stop because of that balance where
they have a great guard, all their other guards can shoot it and spread the
floor and then you got Langhorne inside. That's a tremendous post player to
have down there. So they have all the pieces to the puzzle offensively, and I
think that's why they're so dominating on the offensive side.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you saw the second half that you liked. What did
you try to do at half time, and what kind of response did you get from your
team?  
COACH BALCOMB: I just think our effort was a lot better on both ends of the
floor. Especially crashing the offensive boards, finding other ways to score,
instead of just shooting the 3. Down the stretch we had to shoot the 3 and
couldn't make them, but attacking the basket, getting to the free throw line
more, crashing the offensive boards. And even defensively I thought we did a
better job. We went back to a lot of our matchups, and we did a better job
keeping them in front. They still really hurt us on offensive rebounding and
checking out.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the season, where you came from and where you finished
and what you're looking forward to?  
COACH BALCOMB: I'm really I think the best word is just very, very proud of a
team that I think has, like said earlier, they have come farther than any team
I've ever coached. And we were not a very good team early in the season. And
since December they just really bought on to our vision as a staff and as
leaders. They really stepped up. The two ladies next to me as juniors stepped
up as leaders, and then the team stepped up with them, and they have worked
extremely hard.  
They paid the price to get here. They gave us everything they had, and they
bought on to a lot of changes in roles. And accepted those roles, and I just
loved seeing the freshmen grow, the team grow closer as a team, and people
being willing to get out of their comfort zone so that they were able to grow.
And that's hard for 18 to 22 year olds to do. And I just, when I see players
do that, I just enjoy coaching them.  
And I told them in the locker room, I had more fun than I've had in a long
time coaching a team because in the last month they just, they were so easy to
coach because you could coach and teach you didn't have to motivate. They
already were extremely self motivated, they owned it, they took ownership of
the team, they led each other and they worked their tails off. And so they
were exactly where we wanted them to be.  
We didn't have the size and strength to matchup with Tennessee and Maryland,
but we didn't lose to anybody that wasn't bigger and stronger and more
athletic in the last three months. And in fact we beat a lot of teams that
were bigger, stronger and more athletic. And that's what we mean by over
achieving.  
  
Q. How much do you chalk up to their defense or just an off shooting night
for you guy guys on the offense?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think they did a good job defensively. I always give credit
to people that can make us take tough shots and they got us out of their flow
by switching on a lot of screens. We did have looks and against a team and I
said this every time we played great teams at the next level, that are Elite 8
and Final Four teams, you have to make shots. And we had shots, but I do think
that they did a good job being extremely physical, but we had to make shots
and didn't knock down shots that we usually make.  
And we're not a great offensive rebounding team, so we're a team that really
has to not only do you have to play great defense, but against these teams,
but you got to make shots.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. With that, coach, the interview's completed. Thank
you very much.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you very much.

### [Candice Wiggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18463)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought our team really had to battle. It wasn't pretty,
but I thought it was a very physical game and I was really proud of how our
team stepped up. Pittsburgh has some really talented players. Zellous had a
great game for them. I thought Roz really worked hard especially in the second
half. We did a much better job defensively. We didn't give them transition
shots, first half we gave them too many transition baskets.  
I thought we did a great job on Walker. What did she end up with? I don't have
a stat sheet. 2. Okay. So I thought the we did a great job on her. Jayne
really finished well, did a good job at the free throw line. They were a very,
they're an athletic team, they let them play tonight, and I think that that is
all in our favor for Monday night and I'm really excited that we'll be playing
Monday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, you guys, there was a long stretch where you really couldn't put
them away. Go up by seven and then they would get back into it. With a can you
kind of describe that second half and sort of that the way the game was
going.  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well, I think it's in tournament time it's everything
changes. The pace of the game, the intensity is just up. Everyone knows what's
at stake. So I think that was probably a cause as to why we couldn't get a run
or get a lead going.  
But I think that maybe halfway through the half the second half we all looked
at each other and we just stayed together. We stayed tough. We never quit on
each other. I think that's why we were able to pull away is we stayed
together.  
  
Q. Candice, did you break anything and Jayne, if you could talk a little bit
about the inside play and did they let stuff go and was it pretty rough?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: No. I did not break anything.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think in the tournament it's always a lot more physical than a
normal season game. I think we had a, she was a big challenge inside for us
guarding Walker. And by matchup I was matched up on her, but really it was a
team effort in stopping her a hundred percent. It was everyone doubling down
and knowing what they were doing on the outside.  
  
Q. What about offensively for you? Were they leaning on you more or more
physical for you?  
JAYNE APPEL: We have had physical games all year and in the Pac-10 we have Cal
with those two and they're just as big and there's two of them, so we have
gone against it in past games, but they definitely were very physical inside.  
  
Q. Can any of the girls talk about at one point I think it was like 7:45
left you were up 49-46 and they pulled out both Zellous and Walker and it
seems like that's where you went on a run and took control of the game. How
important was that time right there?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think that was a very important time for us
offensively. We really went on a run, we were able to O board. I think that
was a time where usually we were executing our offense, defensively, we had
game plans whether Zellous was in or wasn't, we had strategic plans for both
of those situations. And I think we really worked hard and came together to
execute those plans and in both of those situations. And I think we definitely
did take advantage of it. And again, as Candice said, it was really the second
half, I mean people came off the bench staying stay tough and together. Let's
get this going. People wanted this win. It wasn't just everybody on the court,
it was everyone. So that was a stretch where I think the whole team came
together. And that's what made that special.  
  
Q. You hit a couple of big shots right after they pulled close and you
seemed pretty assertive tonight. Were you looking to take open shots when you
had them?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I would like to thank my teammates for really and my
coach, even in shoot around people are saying positive things to me. That
helps. And honestly, my success really comes from the fact that we have such
great great players like January and I Candice and that's just the honest
truth. Because people have to pick them up. People have to pay attention to
them. And that's what I'm in the gym working for, those opportunities when
everybody's paying tense to them and I get my shot and I'm ready to knock it
down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they were doing to you defensively, you didn't
even take a shot until midway through the first half and after coming off that
huge game the other night did you get frustrated at all or did you know that
the other ones would come through?  
CANDICE WIGGINS: Well we knew that they were going to to focus in on us. I
think it was pretty clear that they're not going to want me to score 44 points
again. So I was really working to be patient and not force shots and not and
my teammates eye, I didn't even really need to shoot. Everyone was doing
really well. So I was looking to get Jayne looks on the block and I think
everyone was knocking down shots, so it wasn't really a necessity. So I wasn't
really frustrated or anything like that.  
  
Q. I know you were asked about your shooting, but to me it was sort of a
complete game and I think even the five fouls should how aggressive you were.
You were doing Candice Wiggins kind of rebounds underneath and everything.
Were you possessed tonight or what was going on?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think during half time we were up, but we were up one
point and I thought about what it would be like to, I honestly thought about
what it would be like to come back here and everybody is going to be like I
should've, I could've, I would've, and I think that was definitely feeling I
brought the out in the second half that I don't, I didn't want to have that
kind of a conversation with my teammates or with myself.  
And defensively, Zellous is a very good player, she came out in the first half
and really did very well. And I took that personally. Jeanette took that
personally and we worked really hard and I got most of my fouls in the second
half but I think I frustrated her and I know she scored a lot less. So that
was my main contribution to my team.  
  
Q. A little bit of inspiration from Cuba Gooding talking to you guys.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: So Cuba and I --  
(Laughter.)  
No, so, anyway, -- anyway we were going it was a couple of us heading
downstairs to get something to eat and we saw Cuba in the bar. We weren't in
the bar you but we saw him. And anyway he came up to, he had already spoken to
the team came in, spoke to a couple of the people who were in the room with
Tara, we do an inspirational movie theme for every game. And Men of Honor was
a the team for the game four. And so he was in that movie and we told him that
and he was very excited about it. And then I ran into him at the bar and we
had a little conversation random about McDonalds and I brought him back a
fillet of fish.  
  
Q. Did he pay you back for it?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I said it was on me, don't sweat it, Cuba.  
(Laughter.). For real.  
  
Q. Did you have to leave a ticket for him?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: He's filming tonight. I got his cell though. -- no. I
don't.  
(Laughter.)  
CANDICE WIGGINS: No questions about that any more. Get the mic away.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Jayne, can you talk about we'll ask you this tomorrow, but can you, I
know it's too early to even ask this, but Monday, Maryland, a lot of big
bodies, any thoughts to what that's going to be like?  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't think it's ever too early. We're already talking about
them in our locker room, getting a scouting report after the game. Waiting for
the 30 minutes of media to start. So we have already started. We have been
looking forward to this game a lot. We know it's going to be physical. Tara
kind of gave credit to Pitt saying they're getting us ready he for Monday with
how physical they were.  
I think we're just going to come out and try and do what Stanford does.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting Walker out of the game and how it seemed to
frustrate her, that she wasn't able to get going offensively and then she
picked up some early fouls. It seemed like your team really fed off that.  
JAYNE APPEL: Well I think that our coach told us before when we were scouting
them that in games that she's scored I think it was 10 or less, they haven't
won. So I kind of made that a goal of mine to always make sure I was doing my
part in stopping her. And I knew my teammates would do their part also.  
I think that that was our main focus on defense. Definitely her and Zellous.
So making sure that she didn't score and getting her in foul trouble, that is
really it kind of hurts their team because she's a big part of their offense.
So that was really important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you go back to the locker room now. Take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about offensively the difference between the first half and
for your team and the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought that in our, our team wanted this game very badly.
I thought in the first half we really weren't able to establish any flow
offensively and I thought that, I mean they were really all over Candice and
the physical nature of the game is different than what we have played in in
the last games.  
I think that it kind of, it kind accounted for some of our maybe bad timing
and I thought that some people were trying to make some plays that really
weren't there. And we tried to do a couple of those in the second half too.
But once we kind of got in a little flow and I really think Roz was really so
huge for with her hitting some shots and her really playing as well as she
did, she really took a lot of pressure off of Candice. And also off of J.J..
and then I think things kind of went from there. When she kind of got going
and she was so into it, I think that was really the key for us.  
  
Q. Like I asked the girls, how important was that stretch when they took
Zellous and Walker out of the game a little over 7:30 minutes left and your
girls made a couple big plays. I think I think you went on a 7-0 run. Did you
feel the tide turn right there?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There was a time in the second half where when Walker went
out I thought, well, I'll get Jayne out and give her a little rest. But then
she went back in and they're a different team without Walker in the game in
the same way that we're a different team without Jayne in the game.  
I'm not sure why both of them went out. But when you have your two best
players on the bench, I really tried, I try never to take Candice and Jayne
out together. But we did take advantage of that a little bit. The women on our
team really responded I thought really well.  
THE MODERATOR: One quick look at the stat sheet out rebounding 55-30, that
seems like maybe the ball game kind of in a nutshell there.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We did talk about rebounding being really key. And just I
think you could get a sense from our team that this was really important. And
they played really hard for each other and just to battle and to not back down
when a team really took it at them and I was, I really was afraid when I saw
Candice get hit, but I think the other, just the physical game will really
help us to go for Monday night and hopefully beyond.  
  
Q. Maryland has a lot of players left over from their 2006 National
Championship team. Does the difference in tournament experience concern you at
all heading into Monday?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think at this point it does. We'll have a very good
sense of what we need to do against them and they have a very good sense of
what they will need to do against us. But I think our team is playing very
well. People are very excited to play with and for each other. And I think
it's going to be a great battle on Monday night.  
Both of our teams have a lot of really positive tournament experience. Maybe
the fact that we haven't gone to the Final Four will work for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach, thank you.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Sure.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from the coach and then take questions.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, us an all know, we're very excited to be here.
Our season feels like it's gone really fast. I just, it's hard to believe that
we could only play a possibility of four more games. And we just really want
to put everything on the floor and I thought we had a really good game against
UTEP, I thought we played well against Cleveland State, we're playing with a
lot of momentum. Actually, finishing the Pac-10 tournament and the feeling in
the locker room is that they just people want to just keep playing together.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Pittsburgh hasn't been to this game before in their program's history,
your program has, but most of your players haven't, because you're start ago
fairly young lineup. Does experience matter at this point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that experience can help you. The fact that maybe
just even all the different routines of the NCAA, practices, it is exciting.
But having players that have been here before I think can show some of the
younger players make them feel comfortable. A lot of it is seeing yourself
being successful at this level and hoping to go beyond.  
  
Q. When I team like Pittsburgh plays Connecticut twice in one year, even
though it was lopsided losses, how much does that prepare them for this type
of competition and especially maybe playing a program that maybe runs a
similar style of offense to yours. Do you think that can help them even if
they were pretty much blowouts?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that Pittsburgh has had a great season. They do play
in, they do play excellent competition, whether it's on -- the Big East played
a double round robin, so did Pittsburgh play like Notre Dame place, Rutgers
twice?  
  
Q. No, but they met Connecticut twice because of the Big East tournament.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Okay. So but I think that they have played really good
competition. I don't know that our style and Connecticut's style is really
similar. I think that they play a lot more extended defensively or they play a
different defense, but the fact that they have played against really good
talent and really good teams I think it's a plus. And we have done the same
thing. Playing Connecticut, playing Tennessee, playing Rutgers, a lot of the
same teams you're talking about. I feel that the competition that we have had
in our conference a lot of people feel that it hasn't prepared us, but in a
lot of ways I think it has prepared us for the tournament.  
But to answer your question directly, I think that Pittsburgh's here for a
reason. They're prepared and they have some really talented players and
they're playing really well right now.  
  
Q. You guys, your players and you have talked a little bit about how the
pressure's of playing at home. Last two games at home in the tournament and
how in a way that can be a little bit of a disadvantage and now that you're on
the road, it's a chance to kind of bond and all this stuff. Have you guys
started getting into that, that sort of road trip coming together getting
really getting down to business kind of thing?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think one of the things for us hosting like hosting at
home, we hosted, Maryland hosted, when you're at home for us this year one of
the things that was really great for us was that our team was finished with
their finals. We did have people stay in a hotel just for the Friday, Saturday
and Sunday in preparation for the games. And I think that having kind of
having the separation and having the focus helped us this past week end.  
Being up here we just got here last night, but my sense is that people are,
there's really a very comfortable, they're excited to be with each other, they
enjoy spending time with each other. They're just, you're in the meal room and
people are, there's a lot of laughing and very relaxed. And when we're at
practice, we're very focused there. And they know that it's a one game show.
And I just feel like our team doesn't want to waste maybe how well we have
played lately. Having played well against UTEP, having played well against
Cleveland State, played well in the Pac-10 tournament, finishing strong and
just really wanting a crack at some of the teams that maybe we played earlier
in the season and play them again.  
  
Q. For those of us who aren't familiar with Candice, can you share a little
bit about who she is on and off the court a little bit?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, we're really fortunate at Stanford to have a player of
Candice's physical talent and physical ability. But that only really scratches
the surface in terms of what she does for our team and who she is and our
program.  
Candice came on as a freshman and she basically the first day of practice in
my mind she practiced like the Olympians that I had worked with. She practices
hard, she's very intense. I made the mistake of trying to guard her in a drill
and she jammed my finger. I mean, it doesn't matter who is guarding her or
whatever, she goes really hard and she has, she I think the number one thing
is she's extremely competitive, she really is very dedicated and very
committed and she's very focused.  
The off the court -- just in terms of a player, she can shoot, she can
rebound, she can defend, she's very unselfish -- but off the court she just is
kind of like all the college kids. She has a lot of friends, she's in a
sorority, she has -- I just think she has real, she's a real special human
being. She is a very humble person and a humble player. And she's just really,
she's a joy to be with every day.  
I love coaching her and I have made a point of telling her that basically
every game before every game I just said, "Boy, I'm excited about the game,
but it will just be one less that I'll have to yell at you." And she's really
someone that I'm very proud to say I'm her coach.  
  
Q. A bit more on Candice, do you recall the first time that you met Candice
and her mom and what kind of struck you about the relationship that those two
share?  
COACH VANDERVEER: With Candice and her mom? Well I met Candice first, I
watched Candice play at it was a Nike camp in the summer. And she was a young
player. And my assistant coach pointed her out to me and I'm like, wow. And
then she came to our basketball camp and she basically, I put her through all
the drills all day long with all the campers and then she would tear up the
coaches at night. And one of our more astute players said "Tara, she's really
good." And I'm like, "Yeah, and she's really smart too." And so that player
made it a point to have breakfast and lunch and dinner with her every day. And
we're really, really excited that she was thinking about Stanford.  
And I met Candice's mom on a home visit. And just I could just see kind of the
special relationship that they have. And her mom and her whole family has
never been anything but extremely welcoming and positive with me and just I
remember her mom just saying, making a comment to me about how much Stanford,
how much Candice loved being at Stanford. And just how happy she was and how
sad it was it was only four years. And I said, yeah, I'm sad about that too.
But her mom to me has been really, really special. And her whole family, I met
her grandmother and other members of her family.  
  
Q. Is there a different feeling you didn't get to this round last year, but
is there a different feel now compared to the three years prior? Do you feel
more comfortable about where your team is, more confident or what?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a great question. In that every year you kind
of feel different. But like, just as an example three years ago this was
before Candice's class, so three years ago this game I saw, I'm talking to
Melanie and she goes every year I've gone to a regional it's always with
Stanford. And so three years ago we were playing Vanderbilt, which they were a
two seed, we were a six. And at that point we were playing in Oklahoma and the
preparation for that game and just to win by like maybe I mean just at the
buzzer when it was just an incredibly exciting game and really a thrilling
game. And we know that this game is going to be a great game to play in.  
The next year I think we were playing Oklahoma in this game. And again, just
we, you know, a lot of preparation and we have done the same thing this week
just really get ready to play Pittsburgh. And we know that this is obviously
going to be a great game.  
Last year it was very disappointing not to be in this game. For whatever
reason, I feel like our team is very excited to be here, but they're also,
they're very relaxed. Maybe some of it was the pressure that people felt at
home and honestly I think that this is something that really helped our team a
lot and I don't mean this in a bad way at all but to see the pain that Cal
experienced coming right down our tunnel where, for their coaches and players
were there, it was an extra reminder to our team of how fast something is
over.  
And they know it's all about tomorrow night's game if you want to be playing
on Monday night or if you want to have a shot at going to the Final Four and
this particular team doesn't talk about stuff much. They're not like looking
down the road or they just, this particular team I think feels very kind of
comfortable in their own basketball skin. They're just really enjoying just
hanging out in that locker room out there or at the hotel or they get together
and watched, they're excited to watch the men's game together and things like
that. But it's a, it feels, I said the other day, I said this team's growing
on me.  
THE MODERATOR: You've been at this a long time at Stanford, 22 years, there
had to be that first time you got a team in the Sweet 16, that's where your
opponent is tomorrow night. Can you just remember back to that first time and
how that felt?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that it actually happened when I was at Stanford you
mean or when I was --  
THE MODERATOR: Either.  
COACH VANDERVEER: 22 years is a long time. I think my, I think the first time
that the Stanford team was in the Sweet 16 was when we played at, we played
Texas. And I guess I would have to check but we had, we were, we played
Montana, won in overtime. And I think that we played in Texas and it might
have been like in the '88, and it was thrilling. We were absolutely thrilled
to be in the Sweet 16. And once you get a taste of it, you just want more. But
it was really exciting and I think it did great things for our program and we
just, we got there and we had a young team and a lot of the young players were
like, wow, this is really fun, we want to come back.  
  
Q. Who was the player who had lunch with Candice every day at the camp?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Clare Votensteiner. I'm not sure if it was, she might have
wanted the free lunch. No she was working camp, she was really cute. She was
like, "Boy, Tara, she's really good." And I was like, "I know, Clare."  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach, good luck. We'll now take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For either of you guys to start, can you talk about the matchup. What you
guys have seen from Pittsburgh on tape, what you're anticipating is going to
be the keys to the game tomorrow night.  
J.J. HONES: From what the coaches have shown us they're very long, very
athletic. They have a very big post player in Walker. So we'll have to just
follow the scouting report.  
JILLIAN HARMON: Just to add on, I think they also have a good combination of
inside and outside. They have got Zellous on the outside is their leading
scorer, I think they pride them self on their toughness so we just have to
come ready to play.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel relaxed? We talked a little bit on the phone the other
day with some of the players about being away from home now and having this
really feel like a road trip and the tournament in another arena and that
bonding that you guys will get for the last few games that you'll play
together. Is this a relaxed team?  
J.J. HONES: I feel like compared to last year when we were staying in the
dorms, while we were at Stanford this year we were in the Westin and we were
staying, kind of playing Stanford like it was a road trip, which is
interesting, I feel like that definitely helped for this road trip. So I felt
like we didn't necessarily have home court advantage. And so I feel like it's
not really much of a difference for the second time around.  
JILLIAN HARMON: I think we're definitely relieved to be out of Stanford, we
love playing at home but we're really glad to be here in the Sweet 16 in
Spokane.  
  
Q. For Jillian, can you tell us, talk a little bit about playing with
Candice, what she's like on and off the court and then J.J., if you would
comment.  
JILLIAN HARMON: Candice is just a tremendous player. I think everyone saw that
in her 44 point effort against UTEP. Not only did she have 44 points, she had
10 rebounds and 8 assists and she just brings so much energy to the program.
She's a great friend off the court to everybody, she's there for everyone. And
we, I think we all feel just so lucky to have gotten to play with her. And
I've gotten to play three years with Candice.  
J.J. HONES: I agree with what she said. Even if Candice doesn't have 44 point,
10 rebound, 8 assist games, I feel like she still comes ready to play. And if
maybe she is having an off shooting night, she does a very good job of
rebounding the ball and setting people up. And any time Candice is on the
court I feel like the defense has to know where she is at all times. And so
that definitely does open it up for perimeter players and even the post
players.  
And I feel like she's just so genuinely happy when other people do well that I
feel like you just want to do well for her. And I definitely feel like being
here in the Sweet 16 and then, you know, hopefully we'll get to where we want
to get, would be a great tribute to both Candice and Cissy.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, do either of you have a favorite story about Candice?  
J.J. HONES: Maybe not one for the record.  
(Laughter.)  
JILLIAN HARMON: I don't have a specific story, but Candice is just so
competitive in everything she does. If we're playing cards she wants to win
and she's probably going to win. And you can kind of see that on the
basketball court, every drill, in practice, every possession in the game. So
she's just so competitive and I think that's why she's so successful.  
  
Q. Pitt's making its first appearance in the Sweet 16. You guys didn't play
in this game last year, Jillian you played in this game before. Does
experience count at this point in the tournament?  
JILLIAN HARMON: I'm not so sure it does. I think that everyone who is in the
Sweet 16 is a great team and they deserve to be here. And this, our team's,
we're a young team as it is, we didn't make it past the second round last
year. And I think it's just whoever's executing and playing well in that
specific game.  
THE MODERATOR: When I introduced you, I talked about the northwest ties, just
comment about how many folks are heading up from the Portland area for the
tournament.  
J.J. HONES: Are there a lot of people headed up?  
THE MODERATOR: Yeah, you have a lot and what's that mean to you.  
J.J. HONES: Actually I feel like someone told me that my high school coach is
coming up, but I didn't even know that. So I don't really feel like -- it's
very something special to know that you're playing in front of people who have
watched you growing up or grow up and I don't know, I feel like not only do
you want to do it for your teammates but you also want to kind of show them
just what you've accomplished in your career.  
JILLIAN HARMON: I think that, I just am so glad to have the opportunity to
play in front of my family and friends. I probably got about 15 people driving
up. It's just a great experience to be in the Sweet 16 and they're all really
excited to come up and watch.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. That will do it. Thank you, ladies. Good luck in the
tournament.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with our press conference. Start
with an overview of getting to Spokane and what the season's been like and
then we'll go to some questions.  
COACH FRESE: I tell you we're thrilled obviously to be here in Spokane and
very excited to be one of 16 teams left in the tournament.  
Obviously you know how difficult it is to be able to advance each and every
round and we take nothing for granted.  
I tell you, just tremendous season, obviously, for us, and being led by our
veteran leaders, Crystal Langhorne, Marah Strickland, Ashleigh Newman, Kristi
Toliver, tremendous year that they have had and just wanting to continue to
advance. And getting ready for Vanderbilt, very difficult matchup playing in
the SEC, very talented. From our end just need to be ready to play and execute
for 40 great minutes of basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Jade Perry and Ashleigh Newman, they had
a really good game for you in the last game, but is it as much the lift they
give off the bench as the defense?  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, Jade and Ashleigh are unsung heroes and I think a big
reason why we are here today is just their play. In our last game against
Nebraska, the energy and the spark that they provided, I look at Jade and the
lift she gave us when we were in early foul trouble in the first half against
Nebraska, Ashleigh and her defensive intensity. Need to have both of them
provide that kind of spark, that kind of energy to be able to allow us to
continue to have that kind of depth off the bench.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Crystal Langhorne a player that gets her number
retired before she retires.  
COACH FRESE: Well, I mean when you're the all time leading scorer and leading
rebounder in the history of our program, and Crystal is by far the most
decorated player to ever come through our program. And what she's meant to
Maryland it only seemed fitting on senior day to be able to honor her and lift
her jersey into the rafters. And I think that the most special thing about
Crystal is not only what she's been able to do to produce on the court, with
the numbers the accolades, being an All-American, just what kind of person she
is off the court. And academic All-American, what she does in the classroom,
and just how she carries herself as a person.  
  
Q. Can you go into more detail about the off the court?  
COACH FRESE: I tell you, Crystal does all the little things for us. Like I
alluded to first on an academic front, just, a communication major, has always
from day one been able to take care and handle her academics. What she does in
terms of being a role model, out in the community, how she carries herself,
how she handles herself, and I think that the most special thing about Crystal
is just how she handles pressure. Never is phased or caught up into any kind
of pressure, and especially the little things off the court that a lot of
times girls can get caught up into with drama and different things that go on
and she's never been phased by any of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much this Vanderbilt team kind of reminds you of
your team two years ago that won the title and how hard it is for a young team
to take that next step once you've reached, you almost hit a plateau, how hard
it is to get over that plateau.  
COACH FRESE: I think that when you look at it sometimes it's kind of good and
bad. In the fact of you can play as really free and really loose because you
have nothing to lose and I think when you look at Vanderbilt you see that. You
see that how they have played through their last 15 games and they're
extremely talented. Obviously when you have a veteran-led team you have the
experience factor, but you also know every step and what it means and what you
have to do in order to advance.  
  
Q. Do you have any sense of the four teams here that have things in common
just in terms of what you guys have all done from a basketball sense?  
COACH FRESE: What we have in common? I mean that's a difficult question for me
given the fact that my focus has been on Vanderbilt, I got to be honest.  
I think that probably the interesting thing from all of our ends is I'm not
sure the critics out there who they really feel like deserves to advance. I
think we're kind of all kind of underdogs I guess would be my first guess and
probably assumption in terms of just the bracket. I'm not sure the critics out
there really have a sure favorite of who they think is going to advance out of
this bracket.  
  
Q. I believe on Selection Monday your team was the only one with a couple of
babies around, can you talk about the dynamic and what they brought to the
team and how they changed the team or had changed you at all?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I mean, obviously from our end it was, it's been a special
season. And for our team to really go through an entire pregnancy with their
head coach is the special dynamic. And I think that's something that our young
girls and women some day as they go through it will remember for the rest of
their lives.  
I think that's what makes it so special is our team is a family and every step
of the way of how we have approached the season, how our team has been able to
do so many things with or without their head coach, but it's really a family
and we all take care of each other and we all help each other out to the best
of our ability.  
So it made sense on the selection show just to have everyone there. It's our
extended family together.  
  
Q. As you went through that did you get advice from other coaches on how to
deal with the pregnancy during the season and the lack of sleep all the things
that come with that?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, most definitely. It has been neat to kind of see within the
coaching fraternity those that have had kids and the ones that have reached
out to be able to give such great advice. Really, I've only met one other
coach whose had twins, so the dynamic is a little different because you can't
travel, you're restricted from that at an earlier rate than if you were just
having a single baby.  
But the coaches that have reached out and really talked about it in this crazy
profession just trying to reach and achieve balance and really balancing all
of it between your team and your family has really been probably the special
thing to me.  
The other thing I would say in the coaching fraternity is, just the ranks, I
mean the number of officials that have shared with me that they come from a
family of twins or assistant coaches who are twins or within their family, I
think that that's been probably the most special thing is just that whole
extension that people have shared with me throughout the season.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've achieved that balance yet, there are those of us
who have kids who feel we have gone years without figuring it out?  
COACH FRESE: I think we're constantly working through that balance your entire
life and I think you kind of sometimes go in and out of it.  
You're asking me in five and a half weeks post, if I have achieved balance?
Absolutely not. But I think that's the goal, that we all want to strive for
that goal. But I think just having the tremendous amount of support that I
have at Maryland within my staff, our team, my family, really helps you to try
to get closer to that.  
  
Q. Vanderbilt had mentioned that they had yet to play their best game I
wonder if you feel like you've seen your team play its best game and how much
does it worry or how much do you stress playing 40 full minutes?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously I don't feel like we have played our best game in the
tournament. I don't think as a coach and as a team you ever feel like you've
played your best game 40 complete minutes but I think that's what you strive
for. Day in and day out you strive for your best practice as well as your best
game and your most complete game. So that's always a goal. That's where we
continue to set the bar and want to continue to aim for.  
  
Q. Could you take us through a typical day for you when you're balancing
baby schedules and basketball schedules. Just what a typical day is like for
you?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, obviously it starts really early. In the morning in terms
of the daytime it's always I try to get up and spend as much time as I can, I
guess if you're asking if I'm back home and I'm in Maryland. And to spend the
early morning with the boys, so I kind of have that bonding time. Whether
there's a feeding or a diaper changing of some sort that I can do. Then I head
into the office, I get prepared for practice mindset and focus and goals on
this team. And then when I come through back at night trying to reconnect
obviously with the boys and then you kind of find those moments when they're
asleep then you're working, back and forth, just every second, every minute
you find that you're not going to have time for you so much to speak. Although
I did get a massage out here.  
(Laughter.)  
Which was, there is my balance.  
(Laughter.)  
So you got to squeeze those moments when you can. But definitely just trying
to balance all of it.  
  
Q. On Selection Monday you, the team I cover, Stanford, was distraught that
they didn't get the number one seed visibly and you guys were elated. Did you
feel pretty confident that you would get a number one seed and what did that
mean to your team?  
COACH FRESE: I think that the committee always has difficult decisions to
make. Especially with how our game has grown. Obviously we're extremely
excited to see that we would receive the number one seed and I think there
were a lot of teams worthy and I think they had difficult decisions between
the one and two seed. I think we're all fully aware of it is just a number in
front of your name and you have to go out and you have to be able to play.  
But we do feel good in the sense of that the non-conference schedule that we
put together playing 14 games in 31 days winning the NIT, the amount of top-
ranked teams that we played, the ACC Conference, you know, how difficult it is
there. And just looking at the body of work that we displayed. Our three
losses were all against Top-10 ranked teams.  
So I compliment the committee, but at the same time I think there's a lot of
deserving teams and Stanford is one of them. They're a great team and have had
a tremendous season.  
  
Q. When Vanderbilt was here they compared you guys at least the team that
they think they seem to feel that you guys resemble was Tennessee. In looking
at film, who do they resemble that you've played this year and what kind of
matchup problems or defense adjustments defensive adjustments do you think
you'll have to make?  
COACH FRESE: They're a unique team because they're not characteristic of the
teams that we face in the ACC, so I would have to probably think back to our
non-conference schedule, just the fact that they run so many sets, they all
can shoot it, their post players can go inside and out. So I think they're
unique to probably anyone we have played. So I think they're kind of a
combination of a lot of different teams that we have had to play and we have
played some teams that have post players that can step out and shoot it and
just with their versatility.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Coach thank you for joining us.  
COACH FRESE: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. The obvious question is Marah, who won the fight?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I think that I would have to say I won the fight, actually.
It was a good battle between me and Laura, but I came out on top.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For Laura and Marissa, Vanderbilt looks a lot like you guys did two years
ago, a very young team, trying to break through to the next level. Can you
guys talk about what that was like making that championship run two years
ago?  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously when you have no pressure and you just have that air
about yourselves it's easy to play and be loose and have a chip on your
shoulder. But I don't know, we're a very veteran team, so we know what it's
like to be that team, so it's kind of like I think we're ready to counteract
and just play our game.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: When you're not expected to win like we weren't not expected
to win our year, then you just go out there and play free, there's no pressure
on you. You don't have to worry about living up to any expectations or
anything like that. But like we're we were saying we're a very veteran team,
battle tested and experienced. So we're very confident going into tomorrow's
game and for the rest of the tournament.  
  
Q. For all of you, we talked to your coach about how life has changed since
the twins came out. What's it been like for y'all? She described it as a
family atmosphere, do you believe this whole experience brought you all closer
together as a team?  
MARAH STRICKLAND: I think that it's definitely brought us together as a team.
Just having the babies around, watching coach be so motherly with them and
taking care of them. And it definitely feels like we get to be their big
sisters and so it's a lot of fun.  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously they came at a good point in the season because it's
more like bringing us together type thing. Being together at her house,
holding the babies, just spending more time as a team with Coach B being
there, kind of picking her up, it just helps our like connectiveness grow
bigger.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think that on top of all of that I think it showed us how
great our coach really is. She's fought through a lot of stuff all season. She
came to practices when none of us knew how bad she was really feeling. She was
back so quickly after she had the twins, she surprised us at the NC State
game, she came down to the ACC tournament. So she's kind of like Super Woman.
There's not many people that can have one child let alone twins and come back
and do what she did and be so important to this team.  
  
Q. Can you follow-up a little bit on, what is that, as young women, what
does it mean to have a role model like that? Does it kind of show you that
there's more possibilities in life than maybe what you might have thought?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: I think it was an inspiration to all of us. Especially she
got a lot of criticism for her timing when she got pregnant. But she barely
missed a beat. And there wasn't a better time, we talked about it, for her to
have the twins with all the veterans on this team, a lot of us have been
through all the stuff. And we knew what was expected of us, so when she was
gone it was just extra motivation for us to go out there and play that much
harder.  
LAURA HARPER: Also with her being a role model it gave us like a release to
see someone working that hard for her to be at our Senior Night a week after
she gave birth and just wanting to be a part of this team it shows how much
she really cares and it almost makes us to work harder to see what the types
of battles that she went through for us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the assistant coach that took over, he was a first
year guy too and all of a sudden he's running the show quite a bit. What was
it like adjusting to him?  
LAURA HARPER: Well obviously getting adjusted to a new coach is something that
we have to deal with. But he came from the summer and he was very confident
himself and all of us and he instilled so much confidence in just us as a team
and us as players. So it made that transition a lot more easier. It made it
feel like we were actually players and he always said it was a players team,
he was just kind of guiding us along the way.  
  
Q. Brenda talked about the need to play 40 great minutes. Do you guys feel
like you've done that yet and is that a concern that y'all have the rest of
the way?  
MARISSA COLEMAN: We haven't done it so far in this tournament. We have done it
throughout the season. And I'm not going to say it's a concern, actually
thinking about back to our first two round games I think the reason why we
didn't play complete 40 minute games is I think we were putting pressure on
ourselves to get out of College Park. Because that was one of our main goals
because that's where we got knocked out last year. I think now we're going to
play more free and more confident and you're really going to be able to see
Maryland basketball.  
  
Q. I read somewhere you have family members around this area. Can you kind
of explain that who they are.  
MARISSA COLEMAN: My mom's whole side of the family is from Portland, Oregon
and she has family in Seattle as well. I lived in Portland until I was like
four. So some of my family is from Seattle and Portland and they're going to
drive to the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. This would be for Laura, tell me a little bit about playing with Crystal
and what she's meant to the program at Maryland.  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously coming in from high school I felt as though I was
going into college with the post player coming out of high school. So playing
with her the whole time I feel like I've learned from the best and I've
stepped my game up just playing alongside someone who is so good.  
I just feel like we kind of compliment each other. And her being so strong,
her on the left, me on the right. And being able to watch in practice it's
invaluable to be alongside someone for four years in a row and practicing for
four years in a row.  
  
Q. Laura, two years away from looking back from a National Championship,
what does that mean today, to this team today? I know some were on the team,
some weren't, but that's that mean as a group today?  
LAURA HARPER: Obviously being in this spot and thinking back to two years ago
winning a championship and actually seeing like the clips on the TV in the
hotel, it's just a good feeling for this team. It just, it's almost
indescribable because we didn't think about anything for that run. We didn't
think about playing games, we didn't think about what anyone had to say about
us, we were just playing for us, for each other. And just to get out of
College Park and realize how much pressure we put on ourselves, it kind of
just reminds us what how innocent we were and how much fun that was. So just
to get back to Maryland basketball and just play free play and relaxed is what
two years ago means to us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH BERENATO: I can't see you. Now I can see you. I just want to say thank
you to all of you for being here today. It's exciting. It's not only exciting
for Pittsburgh, but also for the other teams that are present. And to be in
the Sweet 16 is awe inspiring. And some people you dream about it your whole
life and some people, coaches and players, student-athletes, they go through
their whole life and they never achieve this.  
So it's with great pleasure and joy and excitement that we're very, very happy
to be here for our women's basketball program, for the athletic department,
for the university, and our community. Because Pittsburgh is a blue collar
city, and I think our team is a blue collar team. We're a hard working team
and there's a couple individuals in particular that really makes our heart
smile for. And that is our chancellor, Mark Nornenberg who really had great
vision five years ago and belief. And then there's two ladies, Carol Sprague
is the main reason that I would say I'm probably at Pittsburgh. She believed
in me and she believed in my family. And then she's been at Pitt I think like
34 years. And another lady, Donna Sand has been at Pitt for 34 years. They
have never experienced this.  
And they have worked every year and they have believed in the team every year.
And Carol Sprague was even on the NCAA Selection Committee for five years and
I can't even imagine what it would be like to be on a selection committee and
never even think about your team Pitt being up on the board. I can't even
imagine that.  
So for her I'm really glad she's not on the committee, I'm glad that she's
here. I don't know that she's been able to enjoy it yet because it's been a
helatious ride and a lot of stuff to do. But we're excited. We got here
because the team believed in us and we believed in our team. And I think any
time you have blind faith, anything is possible. And we have worked hard, we
have had our ups and downs and we have had a lot of downs this year and a lot
of situations that really could have held us back, but we weren't deterred. We
have had great highs, every day we are here and every day we're able to go to
practice is a wonderful day, it's a gift. I think we have to celebrate that.  
So we're just happy to be here. And for Spokane to host this regional is
awesome. We have heard tremendous things and since the minute we stepped off
the plane the hospitality has been nothing but glorious. And I just want to
say to all the people, whether it's been our hosts, at the restaurants, the
arenas that, we have used some different gyms already, you guys have been
awesome and we want to just say thanks in advance.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Coach Balcomb is from Jersey, your assistant Lisa was at one of your
basketball camps?  
COACH BERENATO: Hell, she went to my school. We were at the same high school.
Don't minimize it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the Jersey presence here in Spokane?  
COACH BERENATO: Yeah, we love it. Jersey girls, there's a play or something
out, Jersey Boys, everyone keeps telling me about that, forget that. It's
Jersey girls. Melanie's awesome. Melanie's, she's a terrific coach. I really
admire her. And Lisa, she's, she went to Glouster Catholic, she's from my
hometown Glouster, which is really a blue collar town and she was a blue
collar kid. And it's just really exciting having had the opportunity to see
them since they have been here, but I did spend some time a little bit of time
with them in Albuquerque, and whenever I see them of course I think that we
all make each other laugh and smile because people that aren't from where
we're from really have -- y'all don't have a clue. And it's just great. It
will be really great if the Jersey girls rule and we get to the Elite 8. I
think that would be really fun.  
  
Q. Your schedule, how do you think playing the schedule you did helps
prepare you for a game like Stanford and did you intentionally schedule teams
like Duke and Maryland with the NCAA tournament in mind?  
COACH BERENATO: Absolutely, Ray. And it's good to see you here. I'm really
happy that you made the trip. So thank you for the time and effort.
Absolutely, we really scheduled up and there was a time and it didn't hit me
until February that I thought I was crazy because we went through a really
helatious part of the schedule in February where we played I think it was five
of seven teams were in the top 15 in the nation. And we weren't ranked in the
top 15. And we took some dips. So of course everybody immediately, media and
the community probably across the country were like, "Well we knew Pitt wasn't
that good anyway" and we were just like, whatever.  
But we scheduled early on non-conference. We went up to Penn State and had a
really tough schedule up there. We played Penn State, we played Greensboro,
who is, or Charlotte I think at Charlotte, who usually goes to the tournament.
And then we played Arizona. And then we went to Madison Square Garden and we
played Duke when they were ranked sixth in the country, Maggie Dixon Classic
and lost to them on a last second shot. They scored with 1.2 seconds and won
by two.  
And then we played Maryland at Maryland and we lost by 13 there. And I think
that people would think oh my gosh what are you doing, but we definitely had
it in mind for the NCAA. Last year we scheduled so that, we really wanted to
be in the tournament and for 20 wins, on track for that. This year we thought
we had a veteran team so I needed to schedule up for seeding.  
But it did get to be a point where, I'll be honest with you, we were really
stressed. We had 18 wins and it was almost like, "Oh, my god, are we going to
get two more wins", and even though our RPI and strength of schedule were in
the Top-20 as a coach you put tremendous pressure on yourself.  
The second part was we scheduled our games on road and if you notice we only
had 11 home games. And eight of those games had to be conference. We didn't
play our first home game until December 6. I think December 5 or 6. Which is
ludicrous in essence, but for us we always talked about the tournament this is
what it's like we're going to have to be on the road and weather the storm. So
I think that definitely it has helped us.  
  
Q. Can you expand on that schedule a bit in terms of the Big East has done
very well in this tournament this year. Can you talk about playing that
conference schedule how it's prepared you to reach this point.  
COACH BERENATO: Well I think that again it's really wonderful to see five of
our teams in the Sweet 16. I only had pre- algebra so I don't know percentage
wise what that is. But 38 percent. My sons and daughters will die if they hear
me say this. But it's a really great percentage I think. That's terrific. And
I would say we without a doubt probably are the top conference right now in
representing. And for us we had to play those teams all the time. And we had
to play West Virginia twice. And West Virginia was, got ranked in the Top-10
at one point. And so again I just think that in our conference and we believed
there was so many teams that could have come to this tournament and competed.
But they didn't have the wins because we beat everybody else up. They just
didn't get the wins.  
But they're either in the NIT or even a team like Marquette, like Marquette is
a really good team. St. John's is a really good team. They didn't make it to
the big dance because wins and losses. And in essence that's it.  
And I think that when we come out and we're not -- we play Connecticut twice.
Connecticut is number one in the nation and I think Connecticut is a really,
really, really good team and I've said, if Connecticut, if we don't win the
National Championship, you know, I hope Connecticut does. I think they're
going to win it. And that's exactly how I feel. They're that good.  
So we have already played them twice, and we played all the other teams, we
played West Virginia, when they were ranked I think 12 and we beat them and we
beat Notre Dame who is ninth in the nation. And we beat DePaul when they were
15. And we beat Louisville who is in the Sweet 16 right now. And you know, I
just think that -- and then we played Rutgers we lost to them they were fourth
in the nation, we lost to them by four points without Mercedes Walker. You
know, we lost to some of those teams but they're here. They're representing.  
So I feel like for my team you know, I mean I don't know how they can look at
anyone and be intimidated because as long as you're not Connecticut, we feel
like we have a chance. And that's the truth.  
  
Q. You're obviously thrilled to be here how do you sort of change gears with
your team so that they're not just happy to be hear; and then the second
question would be can you just talk about Stanford a little bit and the game
that you've got coming up?  
COACH BERENATO: There's no changing gears because our goal was to be here the
whole time. We're not surprised that we are here. I know y'all are surprised
we are here but we're not. When we left Pittsburgh back last Wednesday we
packed for this trip. We knew that -- I mean we had our itineraries set and
the kids knew that they needed to pack straight through for Spokane. I told my
coaching staff to bring four good outfits for coaching. So we had a plan, we
had our itineraries straight through. It wasn't like after we beat Baylor we
were jumping up and down and going, "What do we do now, do we go home or not."
I mean it was sad. I mean we're a very, very happy, but you know we are here
to win and we are here to we feel like we can compete with Stanford.  
To address your second part of the question, we feel that Stanford has a great
team and they have a great coach. I think Tara does a great job and obviously
she's a legend in our game. And I think that the one thing that Stanford has
and Stanford has unbelievable tradition they have a deep and rich tradition.
And when you look at, I'm educated and you're educated to the game and they
have won a National Championship and they have been to four Final Fours and
they have been 1932, you know, Elite 8s and Sweet 16s and all that other
stuff, but my kids don't know that. My team, they don't know that.  
But my team, it like, so for us it's a game. You see, it's a game. And we have
been taking it just like in segments, game by game by game by game. And I
think that Candice Wiggins, she's awesome, she's tremendous, she's a, she's
one of the better guards in the country, one of the best guards in the
country. But I saw Candice Wiggins play when I went out to San Diego and
recruited Mallorie Winn, we have a girl, Mallorie Winn from the Bishop School,
and they played each other that game that I saw, and Mall's team beat
Candice's. But Candice was everything and she was all that and a box of
chocolates and player of the year and this and that. But Mall's team won.  
So I was fortunate to see her and now how fitting that they're seniors and
they're playing against each other. I just think that's really cool. I don't
know that that could have ever been planned. So again I think Appel is an
awesome post player, I think she gets better and better and better and better
every game. I think that Pedersen is really, she's the glue, she's the X
factor to their team. She makes great passes, high low, she can take it from
the outside, you know. So I mean they have a good team, but I think everyone
in the Sweet 16 right now has a good team. Everybody has an All-American. We
have Mercedes Walker, everybody has defensive Player of the Year. So we have,
you know at this point you throw the ball up and you hope that it's a great
game.  
  
Q. Can you compare and contrast Stanford for Connecticut having played them
twice and talk about what it was like to be celebrating your victory over
Baylor and watching Candice Wiggins score 44 while you were doing that?  
COACH BERENATO: That was a non-factor. We weren't watching her score 44. I'll
be honest with you, that's what you have videotape for. Our scout team was,
she was like, I have to go back to the hotel and because Stanford's on TV. And
I said no you're not going back to the hotel that's what we have VCRs for and
we taped the game and tonight, you know what, we're going to the Sweet 16 and
you're going to have dinner with the team. And that's I just really believe
that you celebrate the moment and tomorrow morning it will come really, really
quick and we'll start working on our scouts as we are.  
But you know, Candice, she scored 44, and she's capable of that. And I think
if you look at their run, you know, they were able to beat that team fairly
easily. So um, as far as comparing and contrasting Connecticut and Stanford,
about the only thing they have in common is that they run the triple post and
they're both pretty good at it. I feel very fortunate in that we have played
Connecticut twice and they run the same offense and so I mean Shay played for
Connecticut, she's our scout, she's, you know, last night I mean in watching
my practice I thought for a second well maybe my team should play triple post
in, they're doing pretty good with it. So I'm not a triple post girl, but at
the same time, you know, they run, they run a really nice set and they both
have inside outside.  
But again I think when you get to this point everyone has inside outside,
everybody can hit the 3-point shot, you know, it's, um, it comes down to
intangibles.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck in the tournament.  
COACH BERENATO: Thank you. And thank you for being here and keep writing about
our game because it's the only way our game is going to grow.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for the student-athletes now.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about how the non-conference schedule the games
against Duke and Maryland and then the Big East schedule prepared you for a
game against Stanford, which has won 20 games in a row.  
MALLORIE WINN: I think that the Big East is a really competitive conference
and I also think the coaches had a purpose in us playing some of the top teams
in the preseason such as Duke and Maryland. And I think that definitely
prepares us for this tournament. So I don't think we're going in with any kind
of intimidation, I think that our schedule has prepared us to the fullest.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Mallorie said it all.  
  
Q. Marcedes, can you talk about your matchup with Jayne Appel tomorrow
night?  
MARCEDES WALKER: It's going to be a really tough matchup, a really good
matchup. You know, I seen her play a couple times on TV and she really did
what she had to do for her team to win games and I think that's what I have to
do going into the game, I got to stay out of foul trouble and really help my
team and I just, I'm just up for the challenge. I played against Kia Vaughn
and all them caliber teams and all them good caliber players in the Big East
and it's just another challenge and I'm up for it.  
  
Q. Getting back to that tough schedule y'all had this year your coach talked
about there was some down times this year, some tough losses. Can you talk
about how you kept your composure from those losses and kept the big picture
in mind knowing that ultimately it would help you get to this point?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: We just had to come together as a team, having I think we
were down four losses or five losses back to back to ranked teams and that was
ranked in the top 15. So we just had to come together as a team and keep our
cool and knowing that we are still a good team and some teams have downfalls
and that was our biggest down fall and now we're up on our peak.  
MARCEDES WALKER: It was tough having them tough losses. We did have an up-and-
down season. Some games that we lost we thought that we wasn't supposed to
lose and that's what teams go through. You're not going to win them all. I
think that the best thing is now we are on top of our game and we're in the
Sweet 16. So I think that right about now all the teams that's out there right
now is the good teams and they know they're on the top of their game. So we
just have to show it tomorrow.  
MALLORIE WINN: We did have some up-and-downs, and I think that the great thing
about the NCAA tournament is that really none of that matters. Every game is
your last. Who you lost to and how much you lost by and who you won or who you
beat and how much you won by doesn't really doesn't matter. That's the great
thing about this tournament. And we are on top of our game now, like Marcedes
says.  
  
Q. Some of us here don't really know anything about you guys and your coach
and this is the first time we have seen your coach. And she seems like a lot
of fun a live wire and stuff, can you guys tell us more of what she's like
behind the seasons, is she kind at that of a butt kicker or is she always fun
or what? Gentleman she's a lot of everything.  
(Laughter.).  
MARCEDES WALKER: She's crazy, she's outgoing, she's behind the scenes, I ain't
going to say nothing, but, it's just like we just love playing for her. I
think that sometimes we get mad at her just like she get mad at us, but in the
long run we love her to death and she's our coach and I think that the way
that she is the way this program can explain this program, because I know that
she always talked about being how she was out going and stuff like that and
how she wanted want the players to be courteous to other people and I think
that she really, like the players really bought into her, because I think that
sometimes we act crazy sometimes we, like I know a lot of times when we do
media we're outgoing and I think that really comes from our coach and we
always, and we love her to death for that.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: I think Marcedes said it the best. Behind the scenes we
ain't going to say nothing, but, she is an outgoing person and she's very
happy and right now she's uppity up because we're in the Sweet 16. But we all
love her for that. So I think she said it the best.  
MALLORIE WINN: She's pretty much always outgoing and she does drink a lot of
coffee in the morning.  
(Laughter.)  
So, but just like any coach, she's tough on us and there's times when she,
she's always going to support us. There's times where she's tough on us, but
just like any coach she has her moments where she's kind of mean, you know.
But Coach B has done a lot for this program and to draw a lot of attention and
support for our program. So we do love her and we appreciate her.  
  
Q. For the seniors, coming in the program didn't have a lot of tradition,
didn't have a lot of wins. What made you think it was possible to do that at
Pitt?  
MARCEDES WALKER: I think that it came from like the head coach down to the
coaching staff and the administrators. I can speak for like when we came in as
far as like me and, well we're all seniors right here, it's just Shavonte and
Jania on the court, but I know that everybody really believed in Coach B and
the staff and what they were trying to do with this program as far as turning
it around. And we would never think like you can always say that you want to
come into a program and change it around, but for it to change around each
year that we have been there is, it was like pretty exciting. I know that
Coach B was like the big part of it and Coach Williams and Coach Shay, because
if you didn't recruit good players to come in and really like dedicate
themselves to working hard on the court and being competitors every night, I
think that like this program wouldn't be where it's at. So I think that by
them getting these caliber players here and really willing to work hard, this
program was able to change around.  
MALLORIE WINN: I knew them before I came to Pittsburgh so it wasn't like I was
coming into anything new. They recruited me at Georgia Tech. I knew what kind
of coaches they were and I knew their standards and I knew that they wanted to
come to Pittsburgh and recruit players that were accustomed to winning in high
school. So I knew that as long as you started as they started improving their
caliber of players that the program would grow and that's what it's done.  
  
Q. Mallorie, can you just talk about your recollections of playing against
Candice Wiggins in high school, coach mentioned you played against each other
and she was recruiting you. And for all three of the players if you can just
talk about how this triple post offense they run is similar to Connecticut's
and how much playing Connecticut helps you and in having someone who played at
Connecticut coaching you an and teaching you can help you prepare for that.  
MALLORIE WINN: I played against Candice about six years ago.  
(Laughter.)  
But Candice, she's a very good player. She was very good in high school. Coach
B said earlier, she was all everything, all counties all that kind of stuff.
Yeah, it really, it's not really about me and her. It's really just about us
knowing our game plan and I think we have a great scout against Stanford and
understanding that Candice is the focal point of their team, so we really do
need to pay attention to her and make a great effort to limit what she can do
in this game.  
MARCEDES WALKER: I think that, I know Coach B stressed the fact that Mallorie
played against Candice her senior year and it's just like you always got that
one best player on your team, just like Stanford is going to focus on Shavonte
and it's just like it comes down to a team effort. It's not just about one
player. And at this level you can't just let one player beat you.  
So I think that it's going to be a team effort on guarding Candice and
guarding Jayne too because she's averaging double figures and the other four
players too. And as far as getting ready to play against them for they run the
same offense as UCONN, it's just that you just got to just dig down and play
defense. You just got to get stops. And at this time people, you should be on
your top of your game as far as defense. And I do think that playing against
Connecticut got us prepared, will get us prepared for that. And I don't want
to mention like the 30 point losses and the 20 point losses, I won't mention
that. But it's just like right now you got to play defense. So that's it.  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: As far as the triple post whatever offense they run, but
like she said, we did play Connecticut and I think Notre Dame ran the same
offense as well and it's just going to have to come down to a team effort
playing defense and stopping the go to players.  
  
Q. Mallorie, that game that when your coach came out to recruit, was that,
that was a really big deal in San Diego, right, was that, can you talk just a
little bit about what that game meant? I mean, was it all billed as the two
superstars against each other and also when you look at film now is this
Candice the same Candice that you played against in high school, does she look
the same?  
MALLORIE WINN: I think that back then it wasn't like me against her. I really
can't remember that well. I believe that either of us we were probably 1 and 2
in the county, so it was really just the two best teams going at each other.
And it was a huge game at the time. I think that after we beat, she played for
La Jolla Country Day and they were always our cross town rival, but after we
beat them I think that we left or I left my senior season leaving Bishop's,
which was my high school, number one in the county. So it was big in that
sense. What was the second question?  
  
Q. Looking at the film of her now, is it the same player that she was then?
What's the difference? What are the similarities?  
MALLORIE WINN: When I look at her I think her, she's the same in the sense
that she's very athletic, she's very passionate, she's a very passionate
player. She brings a lot of emotion to their team. I think that obviously over
the years she has developed her shot and penetration and all that kind of
stuff. So she's developed as a player. But when I look at her she's definitely
the same. The same looking.  
  
Q. Any of you guys, Stanford will come in with more experience in this game
than you guys have, does that make a difference?  
MARCEDES WALKER: It's not about experience right now. It's about who is going
to go out there and play the hardest to get the win. They have been here, I
can say -- well Candice been here for almost four years in her career, but
like the last couple years I can remember I think there's probably like, if
y'all can help me out, like this is their first time to the Sweet 16 in like
two or three years. Two years. So it's just like we fresh too because it's our
first time to the Sweet 16. So it's just like that it's the NCAA's, so you
just want to go out there and leave it all out there. It's not about the teams
that have been here way before you or if they have been here three straight
years and you just your first time here. It's just the best team go out there
and playing right about now you just got to be on the top of your game, both
teams.  
  
Q. A couple of you experienced I think the six win season when you were
freshmen. If that's right.  
MARCEDES WALKER: No. No.  
  
Q. You weren't here at that time. All right. Well like 12 wins maybe the
first year. How satisfying is it to go from where you were to where you are
now?  
MARCEDES WALKER: Well I was the only one who played that 13 year season or 13
win season. And I was pretty frustrated. But having these two right here
Shavonte and Mall, I know I used to talk to them a lot freshman year to get me
through. And it was like it was hard because I know I had injured my shoulder
and I couldn't play in the last post season game when we went to the Big East
Tournament.  
And I know coming from there Coach B was like, you never had a post season. So
ever since then we have been just playing post season and it means a lot to be
sitting here now and talking about the Sweet 16. And I don't know, I guess
that just comes from us working hard and the coaches getting players in there
to work hard to be here right now.  
  
Q. Your coach described your team as like a blue collar like team. Can you
describe what your identity is, hard working, could you describe would you
describe it as blue collar?  
SHAVONTE ZELLOUS: Our team? I wouldn't say we are a blue collar team. We do
work hard, but then we have like our up-and-downs days in practice when we're
just like, oh, you know, but when it comes all down to it, like right now,
we're all hard working team together.  
MALLORIE WINN: I think we're the kind of team that rises to the occasion and I
think that when we understand what's at stake and we play hard I think we're
very difficult to stop. I can't say that we're blue collar in that we're an
extremely hard working team on a consistent basis, but I think that when it
comes down to it, when the time comes and when we really need to play, we do
play.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies. Good luck.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Balcomb.  
  
Q. You've been in a few states since Monday and flown a lot of miles. Could
you just talk about the last three or four days and the whirlwind that it's
been to get here.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well I think that it really helped us to get out of New Mexico
as quickly as we did after our game. We flew through the night so most of the
kids slept and then went to class the next morning.  
Had that day off. Had a really good practice the next day. And then got on a
plane again and had yesterday off. And looking forward to practicing today.  
But again, our kids are excited, they're young, they have a lot of energy, and
this is where they want to be. So I don't think it's even been discussed or a
factor in how we feel. Because I think we feel great.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about all the Big East teams in the Sweet 16 but can
you talk about playing in the Southeastern Conference and how playing at such
a high level has brought you to this point.  
COACH BALCOMB: Absolutely. If you look at our record, since January we haven't
lost to anybody but LSU and Tennessee. Yet we have four losses. So you play
Tennessee three times and they're a number one seed and you play LSU and
they're a number two seed, and I think that's one of the things we keep
telling our players is how prepared we are. As well as beating Georgia twice
and having other quality opponents like Auburn and Kentucky and teams like
that, that we have done really well against. And I think that does build our
confidence, because our competition has been very good in the last two and a
half months.  
  
Q. As you look at film and stats and all, who does Maryland remind you of
teams you've played this year? If anybody.  
COACH BALCOMB: A lot like Tennessee, to be honest with you. They have just got
some great, great players, individual play, and knowing personnel and
defending that personnel. They have five tremendous players on the court that
can all create a shot for themselves or for someone else. And they have great
experience.  
So we have, individually, we have compared people to different teams, but as a
team, as a whole, Tennessee seems to come up more than anybody.  
  
Q. Last year you guys were expected to get to this point with a senior-laden
team and you didn't. This year it can be kind of considered a little bit of a
surprise, how do you keep kids from just having that being happy to be here
type of feel?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think you just have to know your kids. And I think that they
feel like they're playing really well. They feel very confident. They feel
like they have a lot of momentum going in to this game. And by being young and
not being expected to be here they feel a sense of relaxation that you have to
have on offense. Yet at the same time they're competitors and they want to win
every game they play.  
So it's a great combination, because you want to be intense on defense, but
you want to relax on offense. And then they don't have that added pressure of
being their last game and feeling, and a lot of them know what that felt like
last year. And they just feel a good sense of I think just looking forward to
the next opponent and to the next game instead of concern. It's a great
feeling. I know as a coach I feel totally different than I did last year. And
I know that I'm sure they do too.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the matchup what concerns you player for player
and how you'll matchup with these guys?  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, I don't think we play a lot of player for player, but I
think that what we like is to keep people off balance. We like to play
different defenses. We like to play matchup zone, we like to play man, we like
to play trapping, half court, three quarter court. So what we like to do is
keep people off balance as a team.  
Individually we don't really matchup with them. I don't think there is a
matchup to worry about. But we play defense and have all year, it's the best
defensive team I've ever coached and we have just held our last two opponents
to 46 and 47. And I feel like we did that is a team. And I think the advantage
is we know we need each other. And there's a lot of, there's a sense of trust.
We help and then we rotate and the next player is there. Defensively that's
what I try to teach is team defense, not really individual matchup defense
anyway.  
  
Q. Can you pinpoint a game at some point during the season where you can
look back and say this is where I knew this team was going to make it this
far?  
COACH BALCOMB: Not really. I think that our team, our season thus far has been
about recovery and the only thing I looked back about is losing two straight
games at home. That had never happened to me at Vanderbilt and to our program
and we got, we really got beat and beat well by Old Dominion.  
So we knew that it was broke and we needed to fix it. And so we had a lot of
time to do that. I like the timing of when that happened. And what we did with
our program and the things we did and the adjustments we made and then we got
everybody on board. And once they have been on board and once we have, we had
their attention and made the most of that and we have just, it's been just a
focus on getting better every game.  
That's why I was talking earlier, I don't think we have had our best game yet.
We're that young that we can't wait for another game. We want to keep it going
because we want to play our best game.  
  
Q. How important to the program to get past this stage where you've been a
few times and you personally have done it at another school, but for this
team?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it's something that we strive for as a program. The
expectations being from the SEC conference, but the expectations at Vanderbilt
when I came there was to get the team back to an Elite 8 and then on to a
Final Four and a national championship. And we will always have those
expectations and be reaching for those. This year is no different than any
other year. And I didn't treat it any differently.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier you feel different as a coach from last year to
this year. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think that there's, again, with a senior class, you want so
much for them. I feel exactly how may players, what their statements have been
interesting, because they haven't talked about them feeling the pressure, they
felt like they wanted to do it for Dee and for Carla and Caroline and I felt
the same way. They were my first recruiting class and they had been through a
lot of adversity. And that first recruiting class of six or seven players,
Caroline was a walk on actually in that class, and to get all the SEC
Championships and the individual accolades that we did, but we wanted to go
farther and make a run in the NCAAs. And so what we had talked about when I
recruited them was getting to a Final Four and winning a National
Championship.  
It was really talked about as one of their goals and that's why they came to
play for me at Vanderbilt. And so they wanted to do things that no one else
had done. And that's the ultimate goal of a National Championship. That has
not been done at Vanderbilt.  
So I think we had dreamed about it, and they had the same dream and so then
the players we brought in behind that came in with that same vision and wanted
it for them before they left. I felt the same exact way. I knew I was going to
have another shot, I knew I was going to come back, but I wanted it for Dee
and Caroline and Carla.  
  
Q. I know sometimes foul trouble and getting a team's star player in trouble
early can be key. Maybe more so with this team, they get over 85 percent of
their points from that starting five. Is it maybe even a bigger point of
emphasis to get to the bench in this game?  
COACH BALCOMB: Not really. I think that most teams down the stretch here once
you get into NCAA play have an either five, six or seven man rotation. I don't
think there's anything deeper than that. And everybody likes to talk about
depth being such a factor, what I think we want to do is not just get them out
of the game, but wear people down. Since depth is something that we have, we
feel like we have a starting seven.  
So that's one of the things we did against West Virginia, so since we just had
success with that we'll be trying to do that again. But we, again, we don't
want to get in an up tempo game with them, because that's their strength. So
we want to go fast to slow. Which is very unique in our program and something
that we want to make them defend us in the half court and we want to keep them
in the half court.  
  
Q. They get a lot of points also from the foul line and they seem to get
into the bonus pretty early in halves. Without necessarily touching that third
rail, how important will officiating be, will there be something specific he
you'll be looking for in terms of how the game is called?  
COACH BALCOMB: No, that's something I try not to focus on at all. Because I
don't have any control of that. The officials or who they're going to be. I
know our first two games were officiated differently than the SEC was and
that's an adjustment for the players.  
I think that you don't, again, we're in a new region, different officials,
you're going to get a different combination of officials, that might determine
how they officiate it. The key is adjusting to those officials in the first
couple minutes of play. Your players have to be smart.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you very much.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll go ahead and take questions for the student-
athletes from Vanderbilt.  
  
Q. I asked your coach the same question, a lot has been made about all the
Big East teams that have made it to the Sweet 16. Can you talk about playing
in the SEC and what a tough conference it is and how it's helped get you to
this point?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Sure. I think playing in the SEC prepares us for any team
that we're going to face just because it's so aggressive and just really
physical. And so we're able and capable to when we play teams like that, to
just be physical with them and maybe show them some aggression that they never
face when they're playing in their conferences.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: It's just, a big thing is we play against great teams like
Tennessee and LSU, Georgia, really there's no game in the SEC that you can
just completely overlook. It's good because once you get to tournament time
you're going to play against a great team every night and everybody is ready
to play. So just getting ready for that during your conference play prepares
you for tournament play.  
  
Q. How is the kind of sense and the feeling around the team different this
year than it was during last year's tournament and is there more kind of
relaxation entering in a this game?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that this year we have talked about this a lot, we're
just more relaxed this year. Last year we had three seniors who were great
players and I think that we were all kind of putting a little pressure on
ourselves for them just we wanted to go so far and end into the second round,
which it ended there, which was disappointed.  
This year because we're so young people don't expect a lot from us. We expect
a lot from ourselves, but it's just a different feeling because we're so young
and we're just a different kind of team this year. I think that because our
defense is so much better this year that it just allows games to be more fun
because nobody can take anything away from your defense.  
There's nights where your offense is struggling but because that's not really
our bread and butter this year, our defense is, we're just allowed to play so
much more free and just really go after games and know that we can stay in any
game because we can shut people down.  
  
Q. I asked your coach who she thought Maryland resembled of the teams that
you've played this year. So I ask you all that, but also I would ask you, who
do you think you guys, how would you describe your style to someone?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I guess we would say Maryland kind of resembles Tennessee a
little bit, where it's more about knowing the personnel, just what the girls
like to do and their kind of style of play. They just like to run and get out
there and in transition and play. What was the other question?  
  
Q. Who do you think, how would you describe your style?  
JENNIFER RISPER: I kind of just go with what Tina said, kind of last thing she
said was just our defense. We really take a lot of pride in our defense this
year. One of the keys we have is just running to have fun. So I guess that
would be our style, just getting out there and playing basketball together as
a team.  
  
Q. For Jennifer, your brother played at Eastern Washington here, have you,
are you familiar with this part of the country, ever been here before and if
not, what he's he told you about this place?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Well, no, I've never been to Washington. He really told me
that there's not much to do out here.  
(Laughter.)  
But I don't really do much anyway except go to the movies and go bowling with
Tina, so there's, you know, I don't know. I came here for basketball, so
there's not, you know, the mall, that will be fun, but that's it.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You guys have compared them to Tennessee, can you talk about how your
games went with Tennessee and how your defense worked against that type of
team?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: We played Tennessee three times so far this year and I think
that every time we played them we have gotten more competitive with them. We
talked about how they're similar to Maryland and that they're just, you need
to know their personnel. All five players on the floor can score and they're
good at it. So we just need to defensively we just need to know personnel. And
just really be aggressive. Teams like that, if you're they have great
shooters, if you're going to let them shoot, obviously they're going to knock
it down.  
So I think with Tennessee we got better every time we played them and just
taking those things away from them, not giving them anything easy, and then
just really just being the aggressive team. Yeah, Maryland's a great team,
they won a National Championship two years ago, but we're not going to be
intimidated by that, because we're going to go out there and go after it and
we're going to play hard and make them do things that they're not used to
doing. And I think that playing Tennessee three times just has prepared us for
that.  
  
Q. This ties in with a question about the Big East earlier, but the national
perception is that there's two power teams in the SEC with Tennessee and LSU.
Does, would you guys getting to the Elite 8 kind of dispel all that national
perception that there are a lot of powers teams in the SEC and that you guys
and Georgia and the like should be taken seriously as national contenders?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Go ahead, Tina.  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that nobody makes it to the Elite 8 if they're not a
great team. Right now I think that we're in a good position just that we made
it this far and we're excited about this game. I think that we're just going
to go hard after it and I think that even getting to this point shows people
that we deserve to be mentioned up there with the other great teams in the
country.  
In the SEC we lost to LSU and Tennessee this year. But we played them tough
and I don't think that any team in the SEC will say that when they know
they're going to play us next game that they overlook that game. I think that
we compete with people and we challenge people every night that we play them.
So I think that we're kind of on the verge and just, with the youth of this
team, I'm just excited for what we're going to continue to do this year but
even what we're going to do next year because we're just getting better every
day and I think that teams are, they're going to see that we're improving and
that they can't take us lightly, because we are a good team.  
  
Q. Have you guys talked to the seniors from last year at all in this run or
have they been in contact?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Well, Dee Davis she was at our bus when we left to come out
here and Caroline is also one of our grad assistants. So just with Caroline
there, she's always just encouraging us and just telling us keep pushing, this
is the best time of your life right now, this is the time where you go out
there and have fun. And so I think it really just, it clicks with a lot of our
girls now just because we're so young and that's what we want to do, we just
want to have fun. And sometimes basketball can seem like a job and it can seem
hard, but when you're out there with a group of girls that it's just fun to
play with, then this is the best time.  
We're just excited. You're going to see smiles on everybody's faces because
they just want to be here and we just can't wait to play on Saturday.  
THE MODERATOR: We have talked so much about the youth of your team, you
obviously are two of the veterans, just I'll ask Christina first, what have
you, maybe talk about some of the conversations you've had with some of those
young teammates gets continuing them ready for this trip?  
CHRISTINA WIRTH: I think that Jen and I have taken on a leadership role that
usually is seniors take because we only have one senior this year and didn't
want to leave it all on her, so our younger players have been amazing just in
terms of just being open to listening and trying to make the changes that
coach asked of them or that we ask of them.  
Just we have two freshmen that start and you talk to them and it's all head
nods and just, okay, okay, yeah, sure. And which is great. When you have an
attitude like that instead of somebody whose going to look at you like, okay,
you know, not listening, it just makes it so is easy because they're open to
what you're saying they want to make the changes because they want to help the
team.  
Our freshmen have been amazing, even our sophomores who are relatively young
they are just open to it. They're listening, they just want to do anything
they can and we have talked a lot this year about roles on the team and just
and it might not be the role that you're us a today from high school or
whatever, but or not the role that you want, but we have people on this team
that are just so willing to do whatever it takes to win that if you talk to
someone it's, and you sit them down and say, this is what we need from you, I
guarantee you in the next game or the game after that they're going to do it
and it's going to be beneficial for the team.  
JENNIFER RISPER: That's great.  
(Laughter.).  
THE MODERATOR: Ditto?  
JENNIFER RISPER: Yeah. Well -- yeah. I don't know, I guess talking to some of
them, we can talk about the things that they do well like Merideth she's a
great shooter, but in a basketball game sometimes your shots aren't going to
fall. So we try to focus on things that you can do. Which is working hard,
going after it, just the hustle plays, rebounds and steals and just being out
there forcing and dictating the other team.  
So I guess we talk about things like that. The biggest thing is just like
having fun like when we're playing on the court and we're looking in each
other's eyes or someone gets a charge we run over there and we huddle and
we're happy that she just gave her body to cause the other girl to get a foul.
And that girl's probably going to go sit on the bench now.  
So I think that the biggest thing is just we want to have fun together and
then also too the attitudes are just great. Especially Jence like as our point
guard she's so is focused and determined, but she works so hard and she is a
great person she's a great person to just encourage you.  
And so I think it's just fun. It's fun to play with these girls just because
we're young, but also too another thing is we're so young, but all of our
girls like even our freshman and sophomores like they play a lot. And you
think that they don't have any experience, but they have been playing all year
and in extremely tough games, lots of minutes. So they have gained so much
experience over the year, so.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, ladies and good luck.
