### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll, start off with a statement from Coach Turgeon, then open
up the floor to questions for the student-athletes. Coach, whenever you're
ready.  
COACH TURGEON: I'm proud of my group; really disappointed in the outcome. You
never want it to end, especially the way we're starting to play. We just keep
getting better every time we step on the floor. We controlled the whole game.  
I feel like we were in control of the whole game. And, you know, we did a good
job against their defense, their pressure, and it just came down to Love and
Collison at the end just making plays. I mean, Love made two unbelievable
shots and we couldn't guard the ball screen late, and Collison made two big-
time shots, and that was the difference in the game.  
Wouldn't change a thing. Just proud of our group. I feel awful for my seniors
who have done so much for this program, so much. And I just hate to see it
end, because I think we were just really coming on.  
  
Q. Talk about the final play and kind of what you saw and just your emotions
in general?  
DONALD SLOAN: We had a designed play set up to get our shooters open, and it
wasn't that drive, so I drove, and went up to shoot a layup, I guess, and it
was brought back down either by my force or somebody else's. Leave it up to
other people to see, but it didn't go our way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half and kind of what happened. In the
first half you guys decidedly had the difference in the paint. I mean, what
was different in the second half with Love coming up with all of those blocked
shots and things like that?  
JOSEPH JONES: He just made some great plays. He hit two key shots for them
that they really needed, and that's the only difference it was. After I played
tough defense, he just hit two big shots for them.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how far this program has come from when you
got here to the point you are at now?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's been just amazing. How this program grew from, you know,
four years ago. You know, we came in, you know, we worked hard to get to this
point. And, you know, it's pretty sad how it ended. I think we really had a
good chance to win tonight. I mean, a real good chance. I think we played
great. They made plays, and we couldn't really get shots. I mean, it just was
just amazing how this program grew. I mean, just amazing.  
  
Q. Dominique, while it never appeared that you guys lost your cool, only
three field goals in the last ten minutes. Did they just crank up their
defense, or did things just not work as well?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, you know, UCLA is pretty well known for their defense. I
mean, they had good defense out there, but also we did miss a lot of, you
know, good look shots. You know, I know there was a couple of them that I
missed, and I was wide open, and I should have made, and I didn't convert.  
You know, it just -- it's pretty frustrating, but you know we played on the
defensive end -- I think we played great on the defensive end. It was just a
great defensive battle.  
  
Q. The same question that Dominique got asked a little bit ago about just
your general thoughts about where this program is now compared to where you
came in.  
JOSEPH JONES: Words can't even describe it. This program has came a long way.
It went from not really known on the national basketball level, at the
national basketball scene, but now we are up there with the best. The program
is upward bound. We keep getting better and better each and every year.
There's no telling where the program might end up.  
Right now it's looking great for us, and it's going to keep getting better for
us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right thank you, gentlemen. Open up
to questions for the Coach.  
  
Q. Y'all had them 26-6 in the paint in the first half, and then it wasn't
like that in the second half. Was it adjustments they made or can you talk
about what the difference was?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, they blocked about every shot we had in the paint, it
seemed like, and we turned it over against their double-team. The first half
we made plays against their double-team, and the start of the second half we
made plays against them, got them out of doubling the post.  
And, you know, I thought we were in total control. I thought we were always
one step ahead, whether it was the ball screen action or doubling the post.
But, no, we just didn't make the plays in the second half. We had the ball
right there. We had a number of times we had it right there. And, you know,
they obviously blocked a lot of shots in there. So, you know, our guys aren't
use to getting chinned, getting the shot blocked like that.  
I don't know if it was blocked, but we kept going in there and, you know, then
I -- we went with our ball screen series because we started to turn it over on
the post, so I was getting frustrated when we'd turn it over. If we just
wouldn't have turned the ball over, we would have kept the lead; I think our
turnovers got them back in the game.  
But, no, you got to give them a lot of credit. I think Love just -- I think he
turned it up. I mean, he got every rebound, blocked every shot, and made --
the kid just turned it up.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that final time-out. Was there ever a shot to set
up a three for Dominique or Josh?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, that's what we were doing. Sloan went crazy on the play,
but we had a three set up for Dominique and using Josh as a decoy. And I was
watching that action, and all of a sudden I saw this blur coming by, and I saw
-- you know, saw him get bumped. And, you know, I don't know, you'll be able
to see it. They'll show it a thousand times on TV.  
Yeah, I was going for a three. I was going to run out of here with a one-point
win. That's what I was looking for, whether it would have worked, because
Sloan went so fast, I don't know, but something we've practiced a lot,
something that's worked for us, and I got a lot of confidence in.  
I thought it would be hard to get a three for Josh. We had two sides of the
play, but I thought we could sneak one out for Dominique. I was kind of
watching that action, and Sloan just went a little too quick, but he was
feeling good about himself and thought he could get to the basket, and that's
what he was trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about assessing this season and where you go
from here for next year and just kind of wrap it up that way?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it took a long time, but I finally had them playing the
way my teams play. We're not playing as fast as I'd like to play, eventually,
but I thought our execution was at a much better level. Our defense was at the
level it needed to be at, finally got them rebounding. We didn't shoot free
throws all year the way my teams will in the future, but I thought we were
going to win the national championship.  
I thought we were going to win today. We're getting better. We played the
number one seed on their home floor last week; had last possession. We played
another number one seed on not their home floor but -- and, you know, I
thought we were going to win tonight and win the next one and win the next
one. I really believe that we're just getting better every time.  
So I'm proud of the way we're coming along. I think, you know, was it a great
year? It was close to being a great year. We lost a few games probably
shouldn't have lost on our home floor, and it would have been a fantastic
year. But we did some really nice things with a new coach, and losing the
players that we lost last year, and kind of bringing the young kids along.  
So as far as next year goes, I can't even -- I'll just try to survive this
one. Hopefully we can continue to improve. It won't be easy. We're losing
three warriors. You know, Beau and Dominique and Joe; that meant a lot to us.
But our young kids got to grow up. If you want to assess next year, they got
to grow up. They grew up tonight. D-Ro was fantastic, played with great
maturity. Davis was pretty good but our young kids got to grow up to keep this
thing rolling.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the turnovers a little bit more. Seemed like
that was when the -- they got energy from them, and the crowd got into it
because of that energy.  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. We only had 11 turnovers, which is pretty good defense
against them. Five at half-time and six in the second half, but our post had
too many of them. DeAndre had 4 in 15 minutes. Bryan Davis had 2 and Joe had
2. They had 8 of our 11, our posts.  
We had one day to prepare; we knew it was coming, the double-team, and just
didn't make the plays out of it. And knew they were going to be strong. We had
to be strong with the ball, but we had opportunities to make plays against the
double. We made a few plays against it. We actually got them out of the
double-team in the second half. We hit a three and got another guy, we got
D-Ro for a layup, but that was the whole -- we just couldn't handle their
double-team the way we needed to handle it.  
And we just made bad decisions. We had a guy lifted, and all we had to do was
throw the ball back out to him. We just didn't make the right decisions at
times. But you got to give their defense -- I mean, they're big-time defensive
team, and you got to give their defense a lot of credit.  
  
Q. You talked about Roland as well. It seemed like when you came back in the
first half, Derrick came in and took Collison out of the game for a little
while. I mean, he wasn't out for very long, but Derrick did the good job on
the defensive side there?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, he did, and I was really proud of him tonight. Thought he
made a lot of really good decisions offensively and played with poise, made a
couple of big buckets for us, and he did a nice job on Collison. Collison's
really good.  
And those two plays -- but we were using that group at the last line-up and
thought about subbing and putting some defensively different guys in, but we
went with those guys. But D-Ro was great tonight. He's got to be more
consistent with for us in the future for us to maintain this thing and keep it
going in the right direction.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Thank you, Coach.

### [Mitch Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18248)

### [Brook Lopez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18422)

### [Doug Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18421)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, obviously if they're going to play this way I think I
need to stay away from the games all the time. That's all I have to say. I
think I want to turn it over to Coach Oliver, who has been coaching this team
all year long anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you want to make a statement?  
DOUG OLIVER: I mean it was the type of game that we've experienced this year,
time and time again. We've been in close ball games; for the most part we were
able to keep the game in the half court, and it was just it was a hell of a
basketball game.  
I mean I thought that Marquette answered when we got up a little bit. We
showed some composure down the stretch and got it to overtime and, you know,
that's why you play these games. I mean, the interesting thing is it's ironic
that during practice I coach the team, the other assistants take the team, and
Coach Johnson officiates. So, I mean, that's the ironic part of it.
(Laughing).  
So the kids are used to hearing my voice; that wasn't even a problem. And we
all stayed on the same page, and we just played good basketball, and so did
they.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Brook, I wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through what was going
through your head that last possession.  
BROOK LOPEZ: Coach called the play. He wanted to bump; he wanted me to post up
on the block and just bump my man off. Fred did a really good job just getting
me open, and then Mitch just gave me a really good pass, you know, so I got a
good look. I mean, it was a good look, thanks to Mitch. I was on the floor
looking at it, so I don't really know what to say.  
  
Q. Mitch, just what was going through your head and your teammates' head
when you see your coach get ejected like that that quick, then get down 11
pretty quickly after the that?  
MITCH JOHNSON: We just talked about staying together. It's kind of been the
theme of our team for whatever reason this year. We just really wanted to stay
together. Talked about a lot of mental toughness. Coach Oliver got us together
very quickly and said, "Let's just try to end the half out." I think there was
about three minutes left. He said, "End the half out right," and I think that
was huge. Kenny Brown hit a big shot. We came in at half-time and kind of got
that emotional high and kind of regrouped a little bit and took a deep breath
and just got back to playing basketball.  
  
Q. Brook, were you actually behind the backboard when you shot that? It kind
of looked from that angle that you were.  
BROOK LOPEZ: I think I might have been a bit. I think my hand was in front of
it, luckily. The rest of my body was behind it. Like I said, I was pretty much
watching from behind the backboard the whole time, and the ground. So I guess
I got a nice bounce or something.  
  
Q. Have you had a game winner like that, and obviously anything close to
that kind of pressure on that kind of shot?  
BROOK LOPEZ: I don't think so, really. I remember Gonzaga a year ago in
regulation I missed a fade-away bank shot, so I was really looking just to
attack the basket this time.  
  
Q. Brook, it seemed like there was a lot of emotion in the paint tonight.
Did you feel like they were trying to get you guys off the game by being
really physical and talking to you?  
BROOK LOPEZ: No. You know, I got to really cherish these games that are really
physical, you know, and you got guys talking to you, you know, and you just
got to let your game do the talking, so I just kept attacking.  
  
Q. How did you guys feel about your size advantage early on when you guys
got that 7-0 lead or 9-2 lead on your brother's back early posting up?  
BROOK LOPEZ: We came in wanting to play inside out, and Robin did a great job
of just getting it inside, playing slow, you know, looking what the defense
gave him. If they came to double, you kicked it out. If it was just one-on-one
you attacked the basket.  
  
Q. Mitch, you looked a little more aggressive early for your shot. You were
three of three from three. Were you trying to be a little more aggressive
offensively?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I kind of saw at the start of the game, looked like they were
kind of really sitting in our big guys' laps. I thought if we could hit a
couple perimeter jump shots, which Kenny did, and Anthony as well, I think
that can always relieve pressure of our big guys.  
We talk about it all the time, going inside out. I think the NCAA tournament
these past two games have been the best that Brook and Robin have passed out
of the post. I think that's a big thing for them because then it's almost kind
of pick your poison. If we're hitting our shots -- I know I think he scored
twice in a row in overtime, then passed out to me, and I hit a three, and I
think that's huge, because now they really can't double him too much, and he
can score usually one-on-one; we'll take our chances.  
  
Q. You told us a little bit about the mindset that you had after your coach
was ejected, but it's pretty rare thing that happened here. What was your
initial response to seeing him be ejected?  
MITCH JOHNSON: Um, you know, I don't think we really knew what happened at the
beginning. I thought it was just one technical, then I kind of saw someone's
arm give him the umpire "You're out of here." And just, you know, at that
point I just knew we really had to regroup, and we had a couple emotional
times there, like I said, before half-time, and Coach Oliver did a great job
of really pulling us together and just regrouping and having everybody kind of
use that kind of adrenaline into the second half and the rest of the game.  
So I think we also had a little extra adrenaline, because Stanford hasn't been
past the second round to the next weekend for a while, and I actually haven't
talked about it, but I knew that was something that I really wanted to do. So
there was definitely a little bit of extra adrenaline and emotion in this
game.  
BROOK LOPEZ: I was thinking the same thing, really. Once I realized what
happened, we really wanted to regroup. Coach did a great job of calming us
down and just preparing us for the game, and our team was just really good
about it.  
We've been playing together for so long we knew what we had to do. We just had
to go out and play our game, play inside out and try to "D" up as much as
possible.  
  
Q. Mitch, I wanted to ask obviously you played a lot of great games, high
school, college. Where would you put this in terms of the stakes, in terms of
the drama?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think I'd have to put it number one, just because of the
magnitude of the game. I won a couple state championships, but that's not
anything compared to the NCAA tournament play for the Sweet 16 and the way
that we had to battle for 45 minutes and just really show our toughness and
character, and I put it as probably the most intense game, considering the
magnitude.  
  
Q. Mitch, as a point guard, what are you seeing when you're trying to feed
the ball inside to Brook and to Robin? What do you see as a point guard, as
far as your keys to try to be able to get them the ball at the correct time?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think a big thing is the weak side. A lot of times, you know,
guys want to sag off certain people, or the other big guy will be kind of on
Brook's back almost as a double-team, so Robin and Taj and our other post a
lot of times do a great job of flashing, so that guy has to get away.  
At that point it's just Brook to give me the angle to pass it to and kind of
try to put it right on the money, so he gets it and usually can turn and get
one or finish, and that was kind of what he did when we needed it.  
  
Q. Brook, you had 28 in the second half in overtime. You've had a couple
games this year where you struggled in the first half with foul trouble then
had a big second half. Were you able too draw on some of these experiences?  
BROOK LOPEZ: Yeah, it really did help. I just had to put the first half behind
me, you know. We were basically down 6-0. So we knew we had to get back in the
game without Coach, so I was just attacking the basket and playing defense.  
  
Q. Was Coach Johnson waiting for you at half-time? What did he tell you if
he was? And what was the mood and discussion like at half-time?  
MITCH JOHNSON: When we first came in, I think I was the last person in, but he
was kind of off to the left. When I looked in the locker room real quick, he
met with the coaches before he addressed the team. We just talked amongst
ourselves and said we got to regroup.  
He came in and went over the pointers and said we've shown mental toughness
and character the whole year, and he just wanted us to show it. Like Coach
Oliver said, we've had different coaches and different voices. We stay
together no matter what. That was kind of like I said, the theme to stay
together no matter what happened. I think Marquette had us on the ropes as
couple times, and we really showed a lot of character tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one last question for the student-athletes. Seeing
none, we thank you gentlemen. Good luck in the next round.  
We now open the floor up for the coaches.  
  
Q. Can you just walk us through what happened on the play where you got
ejected, just sort of play-by-play a bit?  
COACH JOHNSON: Basically, you know, I was out of line. Bottom line was I was
trying to fight for my kids, and there was no profanity or anything like that
used, but I had been warned prior to that, and I put our team in a bad
situation, and it's unacceptable.  
  
Q. What were you warned?  
COACH JOHNSON: He had warned the bench when he told me to sit down, and told
me to calm down a little bit. Although I thought I was pretty calm. There's a
fine line for me with my intensity on the sidelines in terms of fighting for
my guys, especially in the magnitude of the game and knowing how aggressive we
need to be.  
But the bottom line is I put the kids in a bad situation, and I'm very
thankful and very fortunate to have guys like Doug, who actually was an
assistant coach when I was a player and Nick Robinson.  
  
Q. What were you doing after the ejection? Were you watching it on TV, were
you in the hallways, how did you spend the time?  
COACH JOHNSON: I was basically in the locker room watching it on TV.  
  
Q. Were you calm?  
COACH JOHNSON: There was nothing I could do. Actually, it's interesting, and
that's what I think gets me in trouble a little bit. My facial reactions and
demeanor gives you the impression, or most people, that I am angry and out of
control, where it's just the sideline intensity. I was very calm in the locker
room.  
Like Mitch said, when the kids came in, you know, my responsibility is to make
sure that they're not out of control or lose their composure like I did.  
  
Q. Trent, if before this game, if most people were asked who is the gritty
team, they would have said Marquette. Do you think if there was doubts about
the grit of your team before this game that some of that has shown through
tonight?  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, we see these guys every day. We know our level of
toughness. We know our level of competitiveness, and I don't get caught up in
comparing our team to anybody else's teams, because I don't see those teams
every day. I just know our guys have been very good all year long and very
competitive and very responsive to coaching.  
  
Q. Obviously a close game throughout. If this team had lost, would it have
been your fault?  
COACH JOHNSON: No question. Technical, six points, no question.  
  
Q. Did you have any past history? It seemed like you had something early on,
maybe even the first foul with that. Had there been anything before that?  
COACH JOHNSON: None whatsoever.  
  
Q. What did you tell Coach Oliver when you left and having played for him
and coached alongside him? What did you expect to take place when you put it
in his hands?  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, I think the kids emphasized it to their best. They're
used to hearing a bunch of voices. This is a coaching staff; it's not like
these guys answer to me. Doug has a wealth of basketball knowledge, so I
didn't need to tell Coach anything. We did the normal things we do at half-
time.  
We talked about our adjustments. I was watching the game and his role
throughout game, which is like at practice; he has defense at times, he has
offense at times. Donny has defense at times and has offense at times.  
  
Q. You had a big decision in the second half when you took the twins out for
an extended period. I mean, what was the thinking of when you were going to
bring them back? I guess they came in with about seven minutes left.  
DOUG OLIVER: It was going to be dictated by the score. We were fortunate to
have a cushion of five, six points when both of them picked up three fouls and
we went small. We were able to run a couple things that spaced the floor, took
time off the clock, so we got from nine-and-a-half minutes to seven, you know,
and the game was tied, or it was a one-point ball game.  
So we put them back in with three fouls, and that was going to be good enough.
We were happy where we were bringing those two big guys back on the floor at
that time.  
  
Q. Doug, when Trent was ejected, how much calming down did you have to do
with the players? What was their demeanor at that time going into the last few
minutes?  
COACH JOHNSON: Tell them it was just like when you threw me out of practice
when I was a player. (Laughing).  
DOUG OLIVER: Earlier when someone asked the question about what we discussed,
Trent, when it was time, he walked off. I looked and maybe thought he would
say something to me, but he just made his exit. I turned back and the kids
were -- they weren't chippy; they were sort of emotional.  
I just yapped at them a little bit, got their attention, so that they would
hear one voice to calm down, and Mitch said it best. We were down 11, and we
were able to get to half-time down 6, and that's really the only thing that
took place.  
  
Q. Doug, I think you put your hands to your head as soon as the ejection
signal was given. It looked like you kind of went like this. Can you just give
us --  
DOUG OLIVER: I didn't see the first technical, so -- I didn't see the first
technical. When I saw the hand go up to leave, I was a bit shocked, I mean,
and caught off guard. And, you know, I watched Trent a little bit, and then I
just -- I actually started to work into the moment of head coach again.  
I mean, I've done this before, so it was like having to take a deep breath,
think back and get the attention of the players. It's about the kids. I've
said it a long time, and Trent knows this, X's and O's are pretty simple. It's
about emotion and about young men and getting them on the same page, and we
were able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach Oliver, did you throw Trent out of practice when he was a player
and you were an assistant? And what was it for?  
DOUG OLIVER: The answer is yes. The answer is yes.  
He remembers the incident vividly. I guess it scarred him, I don't know.
(Laughing).  
But, you know, there was a -- he was mixing it up with one of the guys. I said
that was enough, because it was screwing up my drill, and he wanted the last
word, and I wouldn't let him have it, so he made an exit, and we continued on
with practice.  
  
Q. Trent, it's not every day that a coach gets thrown out of an NCAA
tournament game, and it didn't look like you said very much. There wasn't a
long conversation with either official. So there were really no magic words.  
COACH JOHNSON: No magic words. Hey, look, the officials have a tough job to
do. And, you know, the bottom line was the responsibility was on me, and I was
out of line, and just leave it at that, if you would, please.  
  
Q. Watching it on TV, was this Brook's finest game minus minutes as a
college player?  
COACH JOHNSON: I thought he was impressive the second half. Mitch had 16
assists, 1 turnover against this type of pressure, so I would have to say he
had a lot to do with that, too.  
  
Q. Doug said he was waiting for you to tell him something, before he knew it
you had left. Was that done deliberately? Did you leave without saying
anything --  
COACH JOHNSON: Again, I don't know if it was done deliberately, but I never
think Doug Oliver needs me. You know, the bottom line is he's been a head
coach for, like, 13-plus years. He was the assistant here and probably didn't
get enough credit for building the tradition and the foundation of this
program when he was by Mike's side, so it's not like he needs it. He's been
better for me than I have been for him.  
  
Q. Trent, just a little follow up. When you actually got ejected, you looked
a little surprised. Was the whole situation -- did it unfold quickly? Were you
surprised?  
COACH JOHNSON: I was shocked. I was shocked, believe me. Again, it's
unacceptable. So you can say it's the high road, you can call it what you
want; it's still unacceptable.  
  
Q. Will you ever get ejected from a tournament game ever again?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I don't think I'll ever get up in a tournament game
again. (Laughing).  
THE MODERATOR: At that, we'll thank the coaches. Good luck in the next round.  
  
"With 3:36 left in the first half of today's second-round game in Anaheim
between Stanford University and Marquette University, Stanford head coach
Trent Johnson received two technical fouls for unsportsman-like behavior.
Specifically, he was out on the playing floor, and out of the coaching box,
disputing calls. The first technical foul was assessed by David Hall. After
Coach Johnson failed to comply with instrucitons to return to the Stanford
bench, a second technical foul was assessed by Curtis Shaw, resulting in Coach
Johnson's ejection from the game."

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Dominic James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13757)

### [Jerel McNeal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18123)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
COACH CREAN: Congratulations to Stanford; they played an outstanding game. It
was a great game down to the wire, and I'm proud of our guys' effort, proud of
their toughness. We did some really, really good things, but the one thing we
didn't do when we had the opportunity in the second half was deliver the
knockout punch.  
And it was close a couple of times, but we just couldn't do it, and they
continued to play through it. We knew they would. They're too experienced;
they're too good. They're too tough to go away, even with what happened in the
first half with Trent.  
We knew they'd continue to play, and our intensity was fantastic, but it had a
few lulls when we had the chance to deliver, like I said, that knockout punch
that we never really got to. But it was a possession-by-possession game,
possession-by-possession overtime. They made an extremely difficult shot, and
that's the way it is.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. Can you explain what it's like losing the game like that? I mean, it kind
of came down to, you know, the big guy versus the overmatched guy. But it
seemed like, you know, you had position, and it just was a shot that just
happened?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Just like Coach said, it was an extremely tough shot. He had a
number of tough shots down the stretch. Our guys were battling down low, and
it just happened to fall. But, you know, those guys fought, being beat up, and
people were doubting them throughout the entire season, not only this game but
throughout the entire season, even though they got the final say with the last
basket.  
This team is all about facing hard times and people doubting us and our back
against the wall, and those guys step up every single time. That's what this
team is built of, character. We showed a lot of character throughout the
tournament, throughout the entire season. I wouldn't ask to go into battle
with any other guys than the guys I was out there on the floor with today.  
  
Q. Jerel, you had an outstanding second half, especially 30 points for the
game. Can you describe how you felt during the second part of the game and
early in overtime?  
JEREL McNEAL: The main thing, I was just trying to do whatever I could to help
my team win. We just knew we were battling back and forth there for a while,
and we just didn't get enough stops down the stretch to come out with a win.
We've been known in the overtime, in the second half, for the crunch time and
shooting jump shots, and they were shooting layups and percentages. They were
going to win shooting layups over jump shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen. Questions for Coach Crean?  
  
Q. You guys got through the hoop of getting past the first round with this
group of guys. Can you see how this is going to build toward future years and
their senior year?  
COACH CREAN: I hope it does. I hope it does. We did a lot of excellent things
this season, and we came out here and, you know, we battled as hard as we
could, and not always as smart as we could. But we battled as hard as we
could.  
And, yeah, I think we can build on it. You know, it's so hard to put
perspective on next year when you just ended a half-hour ago, but I love their
character.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel about the play your big man Ousmane Barro on the
Lopez brothers?  
COACH CREAN: When Ousmane went down with the fouls, there's no question it
changed for us a little bit, and our ball pressure wasn't as good as it needed
to be to keep the ball out of the post, and that's the best form of post
defense is your ball pressure. And frankly. We didn't take -- we didn't follow
the game plan a couple times on a couple of moves he made inside of the game,
but the shot he made at the end was a tough shot. Our big guys have gotten
better, but we obviously need to keep -- you always want to improve your team
in every position, and there's no doubt that, you know, as we go down the
line, we've got to keep improving our inside play.  
  
Q. Coach, considering that their coach was ejected for protesting fouls,
surprised at the disparity in free throws and fouls, particularly after that
point?  
COACH CREAN: No, I'm not surprised. I mean, I have no idea what he did to get
the technicals. You know, I saw him on the floor, but I was coaching my team,
and I'll just say this: We knew they weren't going to go away. We knew
Stanford was going to continue to battle and, if anything, take their
intensity up another notch.  
And we certainly -- we matched it a lot, but we didn't match it a couple
times, especially early in the second half. You know that's the disappointment
to me, that we did not come out and absolutely impose our will in the second
half. And whether it was a subtle jump shot, whether we just weren't as good
inside, you know, that's what we have to continue to learn to do. That's the
next step for this team.  
That's what the Big East and things prepare you for is to look for those areas
where you can really take the next step, and we didn't do that. We didn't do
that at the end of the first half, and we didn't do it at the beginning of the
second half.  
  
Q. Given the mismatch that you had in overtime and the situation, could you
really have asked for a better defensive effort from -- I think it was Burke
on the -- I mean, they seemed to have him pinned --  
COACH CREAN: Again, our ball pressure wasn't nearly as good as it needed to
be, and we wanted to come down off the pass. They're as good any team as in
the country with those two on the blocks. I liked our zone today, but we were
a step slow on the zone as the game wound down, and we had to keep that
pressure on with our man-to-man, and it wasn't as good on the ball with
Johnson getting it in, and we did not do a good enough job. When they made --
the toughest play made all day was the last one at the end of the game.  
  
Q. That's what I was talking about; I mean in that situation.  
COACH CREAN: He took a tough shot. I mean, he takes tough shots. The twins
have a real ability to make those plays. And, you know, we knew going in -- I
mean we're not -- we can't simulate two seven-footers in practice, but we
could have done a better job on the scouting report as far as following the
report a couple times, you know, in that post, taking away a certain shoulder.
But, again, they made some tough plays. They're outstanding players, and, you
know, Brook made big plays, and he caught it so deep that we couldn't get our
double-team down there.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Darren Collison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17166)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Kevin Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18266)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll lead off with a statement from Coach Howland and then
open it up to questions for the student athletes, then questions for Coach
Howland.  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, that was reminiscent of a lot of games we seem to be in
lately, where we're having to make dramatic comebacks in the last few minutes,
but the one thing I love about our team is that they know in their heart
they're always going to win the game. They're going to find a way.  
And we did not play well the first 35 minutes. That had a lot to do with Texas
A&M and how well they played. They are a very, very good team and very well
coached. They took advantage on us in a lot of different areas. They shot a
very high-percentage the first half.  
I thought the first ten minutes our defense really tightened, but we did a
much better job. Obviously there were huge shots down the stretch for us.
Kevin's two little fall-aways were incredible shots. Speak of horse shots,
those were like horse shot plays, unbelievable with that kind of, you know,
stuff on the line there. Your season's on the line, and you can step up and
make those plays, that's why he is a great player.  
And Darren's two plays down the stretch, Darren really kept us in the game
initially by all his threes. They were giving him threes. They were going
underneath the ball screens and saying, that's how you're going beat us, so he
did a great job of reading that. But I'm just really pleased we were able to
sneak out of here with a win.  
These are the kind of games you have to come out on top to be able to advance
in this tournament. The seedings mean absolutely nothing in the NCAA
tournament. So for anybody who doesn't understand that by now with all the
different games that are going on and going every year, this is another class
example.  
A 1-9 seed, and the margin between these two teams that played today is very,
very slight. Obviously the work we did in the regular season, and therefore
playing close to home, was a big advantage for us as we made our comeback.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. On the last Texas A &M shot there was a little confusion as to who
blocked it and how it was blocked. Could you tell us the details of what
happened underneath?   
KEVIN LOVE: Well, you know, I saw him driving in there -- was it Sloan that
was driving in there? I saw him fake it to the basket. There was only a few
seconds left. I was going to try to step up and block it. I thought I had the
right timing, but I think it was Josh who stepped up and blocked it. So many
things were going down, and it was down to the wire that I didn't understand
or see who blocked it, but after the game in the locker room we were talking
and it was Josh, and he made a great play.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you describe how physical the battle was down low with DeAndre
and Jones?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, it was pretty physical. I would definitely say it's up there
with Stanford, with the Lopez twins, and also Brockman and Wallace from
Washington as well.  
It was a very physical game. We expected that all along. Coach Howland was
stressing that throughout the week. Since we beat Mississippi Valley State, he
said it's going be probably the most physical game of the year, and it was
right up there.  
  
Q. Kevin, as Ben alluded to, you guys had worked all year with the idea of
getting here for the first round. Having that crowd and having the noise level
the way it was and the support that they gave you, how much -- how
instrumental was that in putting you guys over the top? Would you have won
this game if you had played it in another site?  
KEVIN LOVE: I don't really know if we would have. You want to answer that one,
Coach?  
COACH HOWLAND: I say yes.  
KEVIN LOVE: He said, yes, so I'm going to say yes too.  
COACH HOWLAND: One thing that just popped out at me as I was looking at the
stat sheet here that -- it's incredible that I didn't even know, because we
just came right from the locker room out to here. There's a time constraint
and everything. Eight blocked shots by Kevin today. He almost had a triple-
double with rebounds, points and blocks.  
Now he is not known as a shot blocker, per se, but that's pretty incredible.
Eight blocked shots is big time.  
  
Q. Speaking of the blocks, you had two underneath and then got the ball, got
a foul and went over to the fans and kind of was pretty pumped up at that
point. Did you feel like that right there was the moment that really got
y'all's engines revving and got you going?  
KEVIN LOVE: It's tough to say. I just wanted to get the crowd on our side. I
wanted to get the momentum going for us. I felt like at that time the momentum
was going our way. I just, you know, basketball's an emotional game, whether
you like to show it or not. I was just very into it.  
I think I flexed so much, my muscles kind of hurt after this, and also I stuck
my tounge out so much that, you know, it was pretty crazy.  
  
Q. They outscored you 26-6 in the paint in the first half. What adjustments,
what changes did y'all make in the second half?  
KEVIN LOVE: They were just more physical than us in the first half. You know,
they played a very, very good game, and they're physical inside. They got a
lot of players, four or five players 6'9" or taller. That's a team -- I think
they're 25-7, and they kind of underachieved for the year, but they're a very,
very good team.  
Like Coach Howland said, for being the nine seed all the way down to us, a one
seed, there wasn't much of a difference in our teams. They are very, very
talented and very well coached.  
  
Q. You guys were down ten points early in the second half to a team that was
playing well. Did you at any time think, my God we could blow it here? And at
what point did you think, okay, we got it?  
DARREN COLLISON: It was still a ball game to be played. Once that buzzer goes
zero, zero, the time clock goes zero, zero that's when we'll stop playing.
We've been through that all season. Ever since I've been here we've been
through adversity, especially in the tournament. So there's not quitting.  
We had some games coming into the tournament where we've been down; We just
stayed focused. We knew what we had to do; we knew who was going to win, and
all the coaches said we just had to do the right things to win the game.  
  
Q. You guys scored 40 of your team's 53 points. Did you feel like you guys
had to shoulder the load more than normal?  
DARREN COLLISON: Say again?  
  
Q. You scored 40 of your team's 53 points between the two of you. Did you
feel like you had to shoulder the load more than normal?  
DARREN COLLISON: The plays are designed for us. We had to create -- whether it
was me on the ball screens creating for myself or my teammates, or whether it
was Kevin getting it down low and getting an easy shot down low. The plays are
designed for us; can't be any better way, and we just took advantage of it.  
  
Q. And sort of a follow-up to that, Kevin. Is there a point in the game
where you sort of said, I'm the main thing that's working today, and I sort of
have to take the team on my back and try to win this game? I know you are not
trying to score every point, but the way things were going, did you ever sort
of feel you might have to come through to win the game?  
KEVIN LOVE: I felt like I had to get on the offensive boards, defensive glass
as much as I could. Rather than that I was just finding the openings. The same
thing with Darren as well. We did score 40 out of the team's 53 points, but
it's team game. I'm never trying to be bigger than the team. I just found
openings. The fall-away two buckets at the end felt good for me. Darren found
the seam in the lane and hit big shots. So those last four shots are very,
very big shots.  
  
Q. Darren, you've played in Final Fours, you played against Gonzaga and
Oakland. Can you rank this game as far as game pressure in the last five
minutes or so and also the atmosphere?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think it's been the same every second round game since I've
been here. My first year we played against Alabama; it was pretty much like
this, and Indiana last year. Like Coach says, the seedings right now, it
doesn't matter who we play. Every team is going to give it their best shot.
Today against Texas A&M, that's a very good team, it just shows everybody who
plays is capable and tough.  
  
Q. Kevin, speaking of your last minute shots there, what your coach called
horse shots, describe what goes through your mind as you lean back for a shot
like that?  
KEVIN LOVE: I'm just looking at the back of the rim just trying to put it
through the basket. You kind of dream about shots like that. You know,
advancing to the next round, hitting big shots for your team. I just wanted to
help us put us over the top any way that I possibly could.  
It happened to be scoring. Other times it's passing, rebounding, taking
charges. But, you know, what's going through my mind on those, I'm just, you
know, praying that I make them and, you know, it goes through the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen. Good luck in the next round.  
Questions for Coach Howland?  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difference in the paint between the two
halves?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, I thought a lot of their points in the first half were
actually off of ball screens, where Sloan was getting into the paint and
creating shots for himself and for others. I thought that DeAndre Jordan came
in and hurt us around the basket. He is big and long, and it's a really,
really good Aggie team.  
We knew that last year with our tough experience against them here a year ago,
and I think they're better than they were a year ago; at least, against us
they were for sure, because we're a better team, and they were handling us for
a lot of that game.  
Second half, especially the last ten minutes, we did a better job of hedging
and staying with our hedge in the middle of the floor, and that's a little
adjustment we made, to tell Kevin stay there and hold it longer, because he
was just dancing around them.  
Then when he got in the paint, we were matched up. Lorenzo got matched up and
fell down. Kevin got beat a couple times with Sloan coming at him, so we
probably should have read it, should have doubled it, but maybe we'll have to
look at that in the future.  
  
Q. They were saying you lost your voice, so obviously it was pretty loud out
there. Going back to my earlier question about the atmosphere here and the
support you got from this crowd and, you know, it probably did help push you
over the top, that's something you guys have used all year as motivation.  
Is that something that can reinforce it in the future, if you tell your guys,
hey, this is what we're playing for, and this is the result, this is what can
happen?  
COACH HOWLAND: You want to come talk to our team, Jim? (Laughing). We meet
again on Tuesday. That's pretty good. I'm impressed.  
  
Q. I've been coaching from press row for years, so you know how that goes?  
COACH HOWLAND: What we talked about after the game was that, you know -- and
the same thing's been true, we're getting everybody's best game. It doesn't
matter if we're at home or on the road. We've actually played better on the
road than we have at home. And, you know, when the backs are more against the
wall, and it's us against the world mentality, every game in this tournament
is hard.  
And that's why this is the greatest sporting event in all of American sports
is because anybody can beat anybody. There's the little guy, the big guy, I
mean the San Diego win over UCONN yesterday was incredible. The Western
Kentucky win, unbelievable. That's why this thing's so great when you just
look at following all the scores.  
I mean, Belmont comes this close to upsetting a great Duke team. We knew it
would be a dogfight. Every game is tough, and we understand that.  
  
Q. Coach, everyone's talked about Kevin's two shots, but could you discuss
Darren's two baskets at the end of his drives, and was that planned so he
would maybe get fouled and get to the line?  
COACH HOWLAND: Actually that was vintage Darren Collison. Driving down the
lane, going right, high off the glass, kissing it in. The second one was
really a blessing because that thing kind of rolled in had for us. And,
believe me, I'm very thankful.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how frustrating it is when two of your people who
you depend on scoring just had off nights, Shipp and Westbrook? They had very
difficult times scoring in the first half, and even to a large extent the
second half. How do you deal with that?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, you know, you are always going to have games where
certain players may have an off night, but when you have a good defensive
team, and they both played great defense, you stay in games and you find a
way.  
And really talking about it, it was Josh's defensive play up to -- at the end
of the game, Russell gets a dunk. That's one of his three baskets. Josh made
the play down the stretch, and he made a couple of rebounds. Luc did not play
well today, and you could tell from a week off, from not playing, especially
in a game, it hurts you.  
But he steps up and makes big rebounds down the stretch. Russell made big
plays down the stretch. So some people only see things from an offensive
standpoint; whereas, I see the complete game. And at the end of the day these
guys helped us win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for Coach? Thank you, Coach. Good luck in
the next round.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 21, 2008

  

### [Taj Finger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18249)

### [Anthony Goods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18381)

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: So open the floor to questions.  
  
Q. This is for either of you. Just wondering what the difference is between
the Lopez brothers. How would you describe the differences between them, their
personalities, either?  
TAJ FINGER: Off the basketball court?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
TAJ FINGER: Um, I'd say maybe Brook is a little bit more laid back off the
court, and Robin can definitely be more intense. And, you know, they're both
goof balls, you know. But I guess that's really it.  
ANTHONY GOODS: I think everything Taj said is pretty much correct. They're
funny guys. They're characters.  
  
Q. Can you give me an example of something.  
ANTHONY GOODS: I mean, everything's real serious with Robin off the court.
Anything like competitionwise is real serious with Robin. He's a competitor.
And, you know, Brook, he's kind of laid back, has a little more fun. But, you
know --  
TAJ FINGER: Robin also loves to sing off the court.  
ANTHONY GOODS: Yeah, he does. Robin loves to sing. Brook loves to tell Robin
to shut up. (Laughing).  
  
Q. What do you think of the singing?  
TAJ FINGER: Pretty good.  
ANTHONY GOODS: It's an acquired taste. (Laughing).  
  
Q. What does he sing?  
ANTHONY GOODS: Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, just, you know, just depends on
what he feels like at that time.  
  
Q. Anthony, what are your impressions of Dominic James? I'm sure you
probably watched some game film of him since last night.  
ANTHONY GOODS: He is definitely one of the most explosive players I've seen on
tape. Looks like his second and third step is just as quick as his first.
Really, he can jump; he can get off the floor, and he finishes well. It's
going be tough to try to keep him out of the lane.  
  
Q. Does he remind you of anyone you guys have faced this season?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I would probably say he's got like a -- his handle kind of
reminds me of like a Tajuan Porter a little bit. You know, like he's got like
a -- he's real athletic. He's kind of like, I don't know, maybe -- I really
can't describe it. The way he dribbles, it reminds me a lot of Tajuan Porter.
Obviously he is a little bigger and can finish a little better around the
basket. He is something like Tajuan.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you talk about what it's like as a guard to play defense and
have the twins playing behind you, I guess what liberties that affords you?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I mean, you know, it's kind of a luxury. It's kind of like, you
know, going into a fight with your older brothers behind you, you know.
Usually we try to pressure the guards and, you know, if they happen to get by
us, it's definitely a luxury to know you got 14 feet in the paint willing to,
you know, come and help and block shots and what not. It's definitely a
blessing for our team to have two of them out there.  
  
Q. Marquette's almost certainly going to try to, you know, force the tempo
and run up and down the court on you guys and try to get some easy transition
baskets. Anthony, can you talk a little bit about, you know, are you going to
try to play that style with them and try to slow the game down? Are you going
to try to do anything in terms of what you want the tempo to be?  
ANTHONY GOODS: I think we'll probably end up trying to slow the game down.
Because, you know, they excel in transition, so I think we're going to have
our perimeters get back and try to stop them from getting a full head of
steam, and getting those transition baskets and playing slower is going be to
our benefit because we have size and we have strength down low. So we're going
to try to slow the game down and pound it in the post.  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have any further questions? All right, seeing none, good
luck tomorrow, gentlemen.  
Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH JOHNSON: Glad to still be playing, that's for sure. We have a very, very
tough match-up tomorrow for us. Marquette is extremely explosive, and one of
the better teams coming out of the Big East, so I know our guys are looking
forward the challenge.  
  
Q. Trent, obviously, I'm sure about 80% of your questions almost center on
the Lopez twins. What do you think are some of the key areas that are not
being asked about with your team and some of the secrets of the success this
year that have not been about the Lopezes?  
COACH JOHNSON: Probably one of the most important things is our ability to
take care of the ball, which is going to be a key tomorrow for us. The play of
Mitch Johnson at the point. The selflessness of Lawrence Hill being an all-
league player last year and now deferring and trying to do other things
better, whether it be rebounding or defensively.  
[Fred] Washington's ability to take care of the ball and defend, Taj Finger
coming on the off the bench and probably one of our better defensive players.
Again, for us you can pick a number of guys. For the most part this has been a
very, very good basketball team. I made the comment, I want to say about a
month ago, in the PAC-10 statistics we had 6 guys in the top 20 in rebounding,
and we didn't have one guy in the top 20 in minutes played, so that speaks
volumes to how balanced the team is and how solid a team I think we have.  
  
Q. Trent, you mentioned yesterday that Dominic James was a special player.
What about him do you think is most special? Why do you respect him so much?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, number one he is probably one of the more explosive
guards in the country, and he's extremely difficult to guard, and I haven't
been seen anybody able to keep him out of the lane and where we wants to go
with the basketball.  
Then his demeanor on the floor; he is very competitive but always under
control, so he is a catalyst for their basketball team. I think the number one
ingredient is he is an extension of Tom on the floor.  
  
Q. You mentioned Mitch kind of coming out of his shell this year. What do
you think were some of the steps for that happening? Was it just a matter of
time and experience? Or was there more to it, kind of an Eureka moment?  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't think Mitch came out of his shell. I just think last
year what we saw was a very inexperienced team, and we saw a very competitive
individual, and Mitch Johnson is a winner trying to do too much at times.  
Mitch Johnson has never lost confidence. The bottom line was he is trusting
more in what we're asking him to do. And us as a staff, and me as the head
coach, we put him in a better situation where he can manage our team and be
more effective. So there's a lot of trust from me and from our staff in making
sure he's capable and he runs that team and is running the game and managing
the game.  
  
Q. Just to go a little further on Mitch. Obviously last year's tournament
game was tough for him. What was that like for you? Because you obviously put
a lot of faith and responsibility in his hands?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, it was extremely tough. I mean, I think I made the
comment on the podium at this time last year that I didn't feel like I did my
job in getting those guys put in a situation where they could be successful.
And so during the spring, during the summer there was a lot of emphasis put on
ball handling, skill development and understanding the type of situations we
were going to put in, multiple types of pressure, our ability to handle the
ball, our ability to make good decisions and our ability just to stay relaxed
and play within ourselves.  
I mean, we are who we are; make no mistake about it. We have to play on the
half court to be effective. We're not as explosive as a lot of teams in the
post. We're not as explosive as a lot of teams on the perimeter, but we do
have size and we do have strength and we do have some strength on the
perimeter, so our ability to wear people down has been effective for us this
year.  
  
Q. Notice you and Tar are friendly. Just wonder what that relationship is
like. Does it mean something to you? Probably not going to a Bruce Pearl
moment but to be that close to a women's program like that?  
COACH JOHNSON: I'm glad you mentioned Bruce Pearl, because I don't need any
color. For the most part Tar has been great to me, and I respect her in every
fashion. She's probably one of the best coaches I've been around, regardless
of a female or male, and I just like watching good basketball, always have.  
I have a daughter who was very competitive, ran track and field at Arizona
State, so I know what it's like. I just think she's been very good to me. We
talk a lot, and we're each other's best supporter, no question.  
  
Q. Does that date back to when you were an assistant at Stanford?  
COACH JOHNSON: No. When I was an assistant I was too busy trying to do my job,
which was recruit, but I was always observant, always respected her from afar.
She is a very good coach, but she is a very tough-minded person. She is also
-- she's what this game is about. She pays attention to detail and her team
has the utmost respect for her. She is a team person.  
  
Q. You mentioned Hill as a guy who is selfless this year. A lot of stuff you
hear written, he's fallen off from being a star player last year to being kind
of in the background and maybe losing some of his confidence. Do you disagree
with that? Do you feel like he hasn't fallen off?  
COACH JOHNSON: When you say, fallen off, he hasn't made the shots that he made
last year. He is shooting the same shots. He is taking better shots. The ball
is not going down for him. But we're 27-7. Lawrence is a winner. He tried to
do other things; he came off the bench yesterday and had ten rebounds. He
improved his ability to defend, he improved his ability to make good decisions
and handle the ball better.  
I think sometimes for me personally we put too much emphasis on scoring points
and all the other things. Lawrence is becoming a better and more complete
player. Most important thing is he understands the team and he understands
winning.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Just going back to last year's game, when you played these guys obviously
you've added Kevin since then. They've lost Acie, they have a new coach, so
it's not a really fair comparison in a sense, but what do you kind of expect
this game to come down to, based on what you've seen?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think they'll use it as a motivation for this year's game.
It was a close game. Went down to the wire. Both teams could have easily won
it. I thought we played really excellent down the stretch last year, as I
remember. The difference now is we got Kevin, so think it's going to be a lot
more easier. Doesn't mean we can't play hard. We are going to play hard.  
It just comes down to us being physical with them. We got to be able to match
their intensity. If we do that, we should be all right.  
  
Q. Kevin, just obviously that is going to be a key to the game is they're
going to -- they've said they're going shuttle a bunch of guys in to deal with
you. You just expect to pretty much get pounded? Are you mentally, you know,
thinking that way right now?  
KEVIN LOVE: Yes. And Coach Howland actually talked about that with me, that
they're going to send a few guys in, and they are going to pound on me. I
think I counted it was four or five guys over 6'9", and those guys are
physical inside.  
And Coach Howland said last year was an all-out battle, all-out war against
them. So I'm just going to have to go in there, and even if I get fouled hard,
whether it is a flagrant foul, I'm just going to have to keep my mind on the
game and not feed into that stuff.  
  
Q. Kevin, DeAndre was talking a lot about y'all's relationship. Do you just
talk about how you see him and what kind of friendship y'all have?  
KEVIN LOVE: He is a great friend of mine. I've known him since about seventh
or eighth grade; we've been playing against each other. We've been texting
each other back and forth now. I just saw him before I came here. He is a
great player. He's going to have a great run. I hope I get to play against him
a little bit tomorrow.  
And when he decides to go to the NBA, whenever that is, I think he's going to
be a lock for a top-five pick, just because he has the size, has the
athleticism, and he is a great kid. So I wish the best for him, and we've been
good friends for a long time.  
  
Q. And I think its fair to say, he hasn't had the season that many projected
him to have and stuff. I mean, how much have you talked to him this year? How
frustrated was he at the way it all went for him?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, you know, if I was the coach -- I was talking to Coach
Howland today, asking why he didn't recruit him. I know his mom pretty well. I
know they wanted to stay close to home, but if I would have -- I would have
had him in there. He is a great player. He is a great friend of mine as well,
so I would have had him playing, definitely.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about, as close as you and DeAndre are, as good as
your friendship is, how well you know each other's game as you play against
each other tomorrow?  
KEVIN LOVE: I think the last time we played against each other was probably
the Round Ball Classic in Chicago my senior year. And, you know, he is the
type of guy that, you know, you put up a shot, he is going to contest every
single one.  
He changes every shot, and what it comes down to when he gets picked in the
NBA draft, he might be something like an Andrew Bynum. People might pick him
as like a project, but he's got a lot of upside, and I think he can do a lot
of great things.  
  
Q. Darren, can you talk about their guards and what sort of problems they
pose for you guys? And does it matter that they can shuttle guards in and out,
because they're pretty deep that way.  
DARREN COLLISON: Just like the inside game, their perimeter is just as good.
They got a lot of good shooters. Coach was talking about one of their players
that Russ is going to be guarding that we have to step up and contain. Me and
Josh are going to be having a load on our hands. If we continue the pressure
like we've been doing last couple games, we should be all right.  
We can't let them get no easy shots. We can't leave nobody, and we just got to
contain them throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. Darren, obviously you guys will have Luc back starting tomorrow. Haven't
seen him for a few games. Do you think he is going have like a little extra
just going because he's had to sit it out last couple games? Think he'll be
particularly motivated to get back in and try to make a difference?  
DARREN COLLISON: Say it again.  
  
Q. You guys haven't had Luc the last couple games. Do you think just having
him -- him having to sit out and watch from the sidelines, do you think he's
going be bringing it extra hard tomorrow because he hasn't had the chance to
play yet and really get in the mix?  
DARREN COLLISON: I think Luc's fine. We seen him work earlier today. He looked
fine. I don't think there's no holding back. I think Coach Howland is pretty
cautious, being on the safe side, so he wouldn't get in the game yesterday.
But he is fine. He is ready to go. And I think he's going to help us out a
lot.  
The last two conference games when we won the conference championship he's
been a big part of that. If Luc can play with us, he can help Kevin on the
boards and bring a lot more to our perimeter game as well.  
  
Q. I know you don't play Stanford tomorrow, but they have a game also, and
you've played them this year with some success. What is the key to playing
against the Lopezes, and how do you get the best of them?  
KEVIN LOVE: That's a tough question, to get the best of the Lopez twins.
They're two trees in there. They're monsters. You have to try to send our
whole team at them, pretty much, just to keep them off the boards and make
their guards take tough shots and just allow them to try to rebound and limit
Brook's touches, because he's going to be another top pick in the draft
whenever he decides to go out.  
You know, talentwise those two are very, very good players and, you know, when
you think you have one up for a shot fake, you step through and the other
one's right there waiting for you, so that's a tough question.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk -- Coach Turgeon was talking about how he thought
maybe the first team to 50 points wins this game. Do you feel that way? And
after yesterday's 29-point performance, does that sound like some crazy
scoring?  
JOSH SHIPP: For us, bottom line, we're trying to win games. We don't care what
the score is. We're going to come out and play hard defense, and hopefully we
can limit teams and not let them score a lot of points. Bottom line is we
don't care what the score is as long as we're on top.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Kevin, I hate to be a broken record here, but you know just with your
back, have you been trying to like sit down a little extra when you can and
when you have been standing up today, are there any spasms or anything like
that?  
KEVIN LOVE: Not really. But I'm glad you're concerned. (Laughing).  
  
Q. I gotta write with something.  
KEVIN LOVE: I hear you. Everything's fine. I practiced on it today. It think
the game yesterday was a good test for it. I know I only played 21 minutes;
just getting into it and getting a good sweat going was very good for me and
very good for my back as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. That will do it. Thank you,
gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open things up with a statement from Coach Howland, then
throw it open to questions. Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH HOWLAND: I'm open for questions.  
  
Q. Does it do any good to look at the film of last year's game with A &M,
given all the changes?   
COACH HOWLAND: It does from the standpoint, a lot of the personnel is the
same. That was the most physical game we played, last season. I mean, no one
played us more physical than Texas A&M. I see that in them again this year. So
the good thing about it, we showed our players, look that's where they're
playing against us a year ago, they can generally get the sense of how big and
strong and tough they are and how well they shoot the ball.  
Obviously, they're very impressive, and that was a great win over BYU. BYU is
a very, very good team. So to beat BYU is obviously an outstanding win.  
  
Q. Ben, can you talk about the way Lorenzo handled love coming in here and
having to give up his position after all this time and being a senior?  
COACH HOWLAND: Yeah. Lorenzo's done a great job all year long. He as you know
started on last year's Final Four team. I think he started every game, which
was impressive in itself, because he's had a lot of injuries over his four-
year career. But he's been great all year, very supportive of Kevin. He's
helped him learn a lot of things that, you know, a senior would help a
freshmen with on the floor, the little things, and been really a good friend
to him, a good mentor, and also a great back-up.  
They've played together some. As you know, we've played them about eight or
ten minutes together in the championship game against Stanford in the
conference tournament. But Lorenzo's just had a great attitude from day one.
Really proud of him, not only as a player but as a person.  
He is going graduate on time, will be the first person in his family to
graduate from college; that's pretty special.  
  
Q. Coach, you just mentioned Stanford. I know you don't play them tomorrow,
but you've played them and played them well this year. What is the key to
matching up against the Lopez brothers? How do you have success?  
COACH HOWLAND: You don't match up with the Lopez brothers. There's nobody in
college basketball that's matching up about these two big twins. And we were
fortunate in that we played them the first game in the conference on the road
and played very well that night. That was a big win for us.  
I think they've improved dramatically as the season's progressed, especially
when you consider Brook missed the first nine or ten games, in terms of their
whole team being in sync. We were very fortunate to beat them in the second
meeting at Pauley.  
We had a free throw with a blessing from God that, you know, hit the back of
the rim, the front of the rim and rolled in there by Russell Westbrook. So we
had a lot of things go well for us in the last minute of that game. They
played very well.  
It was really a big win for us to beat them the third time in the conference
tournament. I don't think you match up, I think you got to do it as a team. We
double the post. That's what we did against them. If you try to play those two
one-on-one, I don't think you can because they're just too skilled and too
big.  
  
Q. Ben, do you need more out of Josh Shipp?  
COACH HOWLAND: Josh has helped us get to 32-3, so I think he is doing a pretty
good job. And, you know, we would not be where we are now without Josh. I
think Josh has played well and exhibit all year long.  
  
Q. Just kind of wondering how much you're paying attention to what else is
happening in your part of the bracket today. Any thoughts on all that?  
COACH HOWLAND: Not really. I'm just focused on our next game. Really, I think
any time you start to look ahead or -- I haven't watched another game since
the tournament's begun. You know, I watch Sports Center at the end of each
night and see who's won the games, just because it's hard for me to sleep. But
I do understand that San Diego beat UCONN, I think, in overtime, I think, by
one, which is a great win for Billy Grier. He is doing a great job in his
first year as the head coach, and that's an outstanding win for the University
of San Diego. I have great respect for Coach Calhoun and that program, so
that's a big-time win.  
  
Q. A lot of the A &M players talked about because of last year's game
they're not nervous or concerned about playing UCLA. I wonder how often do you
see that anymore in non-conference play or in tournaments like this? How often
any more do teams just fold when they see those four letters?   
COACH HOWLAND: We don't, unfortunately, get that luxury. I wish someone would
do that. What we see typically is a team have their best effort of the year to
play their very best game because we're UCLA. And we see that night-in and
night-out through our conference and everywhere you go. So that's really made
this team a battle-hardened team, when you have everybody giving you their
best effort.  
Obviously in the NCAA tournament you wouldn't be here unless you are a really
good team. Of course Texas A&M's played against a lot of really good programs
both in their conference and outside. We know what's in store. It's going to
be a very hard fought, tough game.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about similarities, but there are, you know, Acie Law's
gone, Aaron's gone, Kevin Love is here now. What kind of differences could
that make in tomorrow's game?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, you just named two NBA guards, one from each team that's
left and gone to the NBA. So those are both great players. Aaron was our best
player last year, and Acie Law was their best player. We've added Kevin Love;
they've added DeAndre Jordan, who is a very good, fine big man. You look at
their team, they've got a lot of players that were here a year ago. They're a
year older and a year better.  
So it's going to be -- we know how hard it's going to be. It's going to be
very, very tough.  
  
Q. How about schemewise when you look at them with the coaching change? What
is different about the way Texas A &M plays?   
COACH HOWLAND: You know, they're basically two very similar styles from Coach
Gillispie to Coach Turgeon. Both man-to-man defense, primarily. [Cell phone
rings].  
Excuse me, our bus broke down, and so I had to figure out a way to get our
team here. So we still got the guys here on time. Thank goodness.  
They run motion they do play it inside out. They get it into their bigs.
They're obviously a team that has very good shooters, notably Carter, who had
six threes last night in their last game against BYU.  
They're a very good offensive rebounding team as they were a year ago. So I
think they're very similar from one year to the next in terms of the style of
play.  
  
Q. You mentioned how DeAndre Jordan is a fine, big man. His production
hasn't been quite what people thought it would be this year. What concerns you
about him?  
COACH HOWLAND: Just the fact that one-on-one he's so big and so long; he
scores on you when he gets you angled. He is a good shot blocker. I mean, he
is seven feet tall. He poses a lot of problems in terms of changing shots and
blocking shots and scoring around the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, where did the bus break down? What went wrong and did you have to
get a new one?  
COACH HOWLAND: You know, I had to bring three of our players who were due to
be here on the podium early. I brought Kevin, Darren and Josh. The bus
wouldn't start. It went dead. I'm not sure what's wrong with it, so we had to
get four, like, vans from the hotel. We weren't at the hotel; we were at our
actual practice. We practiced at a local high school.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Okay. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Joseph, just talk about last year's game here against the Bruins. You
guys almost pulled that off. You lost by three. Kind of what do you remember
about that game, and what do you think sort of came down to the difference
that maybe you can change this time around?  
JOSEPH JONES: Last year was a great game. Like you said, we lost by three.
Both teams played very hard. A tough, physical game. They hit some big baskets
last year. I think Afflalo came in the second half, and he was doing a great
job for his team. I think they're just a great team. Nothing really sticks out
from last year.  
I think the three point at half-time is what really hurt us going into second
half. This is going be another great game, a defensive effort and hope we come
out with a win this time.  
  
Q. Does it do much good to study last year's game given the personnel
differences on both teams this year and the fact that you all have a new style
with a new coach?  
JOSH CARTER: Not so much. I mean, I've looked at film from UCLA this year. So,
I mean, they're a new team; we're a new team. So last year is kind of out of
the window. We just got to look at what they do now and what we do now.  
  
Q. Josh, you know, with the way BYU played defense, you got a lot of open
looks. Can you talk a little bit about UCLA's defense. Just how much tougher
it's going to go, those same kind of looks?  
JOSH CARTER: I'm sure they'll do a good job. I don't know what they're going
to do. I don't know their game plan, just try to get open just like every
game, and we'll just see what happens.  
  
Q. There's so much mystique associated with a number one seed. Everybody
fast-forwards them through their brackets and stuff. Can you just talk about
that, playing the number one seed. This will be the first time A &M's ever
done that.   
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's just going to be great. You know, UCLA is one of the best
teams in the nation. We got to go out there and have our hard hats. We got to
go out there and play hard, because it's going to be a physical game, going to
be mostly a defense game. So we got to go out there and just play hard.  
JOSH CARTER: I think it's good. I mean, UCLA's a great team, like Dominic
said. I mean we're just going to go out there and try to play hard and
compete. They're great team. Like to think we're great team too. We're just
going to come out and try to win.  
  
Q. Dominic, you guys are going for a second straight trip to the Sweet 16;
they're guy trying to get to the Final Four. Can you talk about both programs
playing for so much and everything being on the line?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: It's great. You know, both programs going out there to try to
get far. So try to get to where we didn't last year, just going to be a great
game. It's going be a big battle for us. It's going to be a big battle for
them. Just got to go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk to you guys just a little bit just about these four
years and what they've been like for you guys. Could you all imagine ever
having the kind of success that you guys have ultimately had here?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, it's amazing. It's just been a fun ride. Four years, you
know, it went by so fast but, you know, we had a great time, and eventually we
worked hard to try to get to this situation right here, but it came early for
us, our sophomore year, and it's just been a great ride.  
JOSEPH JONES: When we first came here we didn't think it would be this fast
and this special. Like he said, we got to the tournament early as sophomores,
and it's been great ever since, been the best four years of my life.  
  
Q. Joseph, could one benefit of last year's game possibly be y'all have seen
that so-called UCLA mystique? I mean, you've seen the team; you've played
against that team before so there's not that little mystery about playing
UCLA. You've done it.  
JOSEPH JONES: Like Josh said, they're a totally different team now. They got a
lot of key guys on the team. They're doing a great job for them this year.
They got a couple of great guys like Kevin Love, and Westbrook is starting to
play more. They're a totally different team. They run a lot of different
assists, but at the same time seeing them play last year gives us a better
look at them and just what they can do and what they have done.  
  
Q. How much has your confidence changed both as a team and you specifically
since maybe a week or two ago heading into the Big 12 tournament?  
JOSH CARTER: I'm always a confident player. I mean, it does boost your
confidence to see shots actually go down. But, I mean, I'm just going to play
hard. My teammates want me and expect me to make shots, so I'm just going to
keep shooting and hopefully they'll keep falling.  
  
Q. Dominic, can you talk about just your play, personally how you've been
the last couple weeks. You really elevated here lately. Just talk a little bit
about how you are feeling.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I'm just trying to step up for the team. Just trying to go out
there and be more aggressive than I was earlier in the year and just trying
not to just -- you know, just go out there and play hard. I know it's my last
tournament and everything. I just got to go out there and keep doing what I'm
doing for the team and just trying to keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Dominic, would it be fair to say through the ups and downs of the season
beating UCLA would make this a successful season?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, you know, UCLA is a great team and everything, but, you
know, if we beat them, you know, we still got games to go. So I mean we can't
really just dwell on that and everything. We just got to go out there and just
keep playing if we win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck
tomorrow.  
We'll open it up with a statement from Coach Turgeon, then open the floor to
questions.  
COACH TURGEON: We're excited, obviously, you know, live another day. And, you
know, you'd rather not be playing the number one seed in their backyard, but
we kind of dug our own hole, lost a few home games we shouldn't have lost, got
us to an eight or nine seed, and UCLA deserves this. They've had an
unbelievable year, won a lot of games. They deserve to play close to home.  
Be a big-time challenge for us, but I know our young men are looking forward
to it, and should be a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Mark, does it do much good to look at the film of last year's game given
all the different personnel changes for both teams and the coaching change at
A &M?   
COACH TURGEON: I haven't looked at it, and I won't. I haven't done that all
year. So I don't know if my assistants did or not, but Kevin Love makes a
little bit of difference on their team, and Collison is stepping up. Then
we're completely different now without Acie Law. So, no, we won't watch that.  
But, you know, our kids are familiar with them and of course playing them in
this building, so that helps. It all helps.  
  
Q. Coach, can you kind of contrast the ability that DeAndre Jordan has
versus maybe what he's done this year productionwise?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, DeAndre has a chance to be one of the all-time best
defenders if he commits himself to it. I think that's where his ability lies
right now. He's got great length, great body, pretty good timing, and pretty
good understanding. I think defensively is where we won at Baylor. DeAndre was
phenomenal, six blocks. That's where we kind of dictated the game.  
That's what we need him to do tomorrow when he gets in there. Offensively it's
never been easy for him. A lot of points he got this year were on dunks or he
had angles and things, so he continues to improve. He's got to get a lot
better at that end of the floor, and it's just going to take time. Whether
it's a year from now, two years, four years, I don't know. But right now he
has a chance with his ability that you are talking about to affect games more
defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about DeAndre's role tomorrow, might be a little more
than what it was yesterday with the big, physical game expected?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah. We need him to play well. He went in against Kansas and
couldn't play in that game; they went right at him and got three quick fouls.
So we need him to play well. We need him to play with confidence. We need his
length.  
We need Junior Chinemelu to play well too. It's going to be a war out there,
be very physical. They're great on the boards, but we're going to need all
four of those post guys to play well tomorrow, so hopefully they'll be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, wanted to ask you, DeAndre just a few minutes last night, was he
feeling okay?  
COACH TURGEON: He was fine. They played a small line-up, so we played Beau at
the four. I thought Junior did a great job on Plaisted when he was in there.
You know, I just thought he was more physical when he was out there, so I just
went with that line-up. That's the line-up that played well in Kansas City,
and it played well last night. And, you know, if DeAndre goes in there and
plays well, he is going to play more.  
But we're just trying to win as many games as we can here.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk a little bit about Kevin Love and what really
impresses you?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, you just got to love watching him play. A big kid like
that moves so well and knows how to play. He's got the full package. He's
become -- I just watched film from earlier in the year till now how much
better a defender he's become throughout the year. He can shoot the three, he
can post up, he can pass it, he can dribble it, he's a great screener, great
offensive rebounder. He does it all. He's good.  
Probably the thing he does the best is his outlet passes. Have you guys seen
these things he throws? You haven't seen that in years. So got to try to slow
that down somehow, because that leads to their break. So he's really good.
It's a tough match-up for us.  
And what makes him even better is they put him and Collison together on those
ball screens. You got a heck of a point guard and a heck of a big guy that can
shoot it or roll to the basket, so makes it very difficult. I think they
compliment each other and make each other look pretty good out there on the
floor.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about kind of what
Joe Jones and Kirk have given you in terms of leadership and even playing
ability. I know for both of those guys at times it's been a little bit up-and-
down this year. But later on, I mean, it seem like they really came through.  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it's a long season, and you are going to have ups and
downs. But they've been great, I think, all year. You've heard me say early in
the year this is a very immature team. We're still immature. We just hide it a
little bit better, so it was hard for them to lead this team, just like at
times it's been very hard for me to coach this team.  
But they just stuck with it and stuck with it and stuck with it and continued
to lead, and I think Beau coming to the forefront here, too, being a senior,
he has kind of stepped in there and helped them with some things. But Joe's
been great all year.  
It's not easy to lead your peers. He's been great. I think Dominic does it by
example, brings it every day, so they've been great. And they've had an
unbelievable career to this point, and, you know, last night made me think
about the K-State game, the big rebounds that Joe had and the big shots
Dominic had, then last night the big rebounds that Joe had and the big shots
that Dominic made. They've been there.  
You can tell the veterans last night, Sloan, Carter, those two guys. Those
guys were really making the plays. They've been here and done it before, but
those two have been great all year. I wish I could coach Joe Jones and Dominic
Kirk the rest of my life, then I'd be a happy coach, because they're fun to
coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you're able to get Josh Carter a lot of open looks last night. How
much tougher is it going to be against UCLA to get those same kind of looks?  
COACH TURGEON: He's not going to get those looks tomorrow. They're going
double the post; that's what they do. If we can handle that, we might sneak
one out for him. Might sneak some out in transition; you never know. He might
get some, but he won't get as many open looks as he had last night.  
We had them doubling the post early. We know UCLA is going to double us, too;
they just do it a little better than BYU. Something they do every day, and
they're very physical with it. We might sneak out a few shots, but they got
the PAC-10 player of the year that's going be in most of the night, so some
other guys are going to have to step up.  
  
Q. I know you guys are thinking about tomorrow, but he's got a lot of people
whispering in his ear, it sounds like, about the NBA. I am just wondering what
you make of that, thinking he needs two or three more years to develop?  
COACH TURGEON: I didn't say that. I didn't say he needs two or three more
years. Where is he from?  
  
Q. Riverside Press-Enterprise.  
COACH TURGEON: Here in California?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH TURGEON: I can't control any of that stuff. I can't control any of that
stuff. I just got to coach this team. That's what I'm trying to do. People
been on my ass all year about coaching, and I think I've done a pretty good
job. I'm trying to coach this team the way I can help us be successful.  
But, you know, I do think that he's got a ways to go in a lot of areas, but
he's come a long ways this year. So when I say two or three years away, you
know, what are you talking about? Talking about college or pro? But, I mean,
everybody gets better as they get older. He is 19 years old.  
  
Q. Along those lines, the players were talking about how pumped up they were
when they saw the draw and the potential second round match-up. I know you
were probably pumped up, as well at the opportunity. What does this mean to
you and trying to get this game and get this win for this program?  
COACH TURGEON: I wasn't quite as pumped up when this draw came, but our guys
were excited. I think maybe it was the west coast. I'm not sure they knew how
good BYU was going to be, and I did. So that's why I wasn't excited. Then
having to play UCLA in their backyard, this might be their best team. They've
had two Final Four teams, and this might be their best team.  
We're looking at it as a great opportunity. We played the number one seed last
week on their home court and did pretty well. I think we're a better team
today than we were last Saturday, and we'll see. Obviously we're going to have
to figure out a way to score baskets to stay in the game. If we can do that,
we'll give ourselves a chance.  
You just want to have a chance the last ten minutes of the game. You know, I
don't think about stuff like, you know -- I'll think about that after the
game. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to guard UCLA and the best
way to try to attack their defense. That's all that consumes me, especially as
good as they are and as well coached as they are; it should consume you.  
Then if we're lucky enough to pull something off then you think about what
it's going to do for your program. It's a long ways between now and that
happening. We're going to have to play one of our probably play our best game
of the year for it to happen.  
  
Q. I guess physically Joe is best equipped to bang down low with Love. When
he steps out to shoot threes, are you confident he can get out there and stay
with him when he steps outside?  
COACH TURGEON: We'll throw a lot of different guys at Love tomorrow, and all
our guys have gotten better about guarding the perimeter. I think it's been
pretty obvious. Something that kind of hit us between the eyes at Texas Tech,
and we've really worked hard at it. We did an unbelievable job on Tavernari
last night. He got a drive for a layup late, and actually Dominique was
guarding him when he hit a three, so I'm confident, you know, but the hard
thing is you got Collison coming off ball screens and then him popping, so
that makes it pretty tough.  
So you got to figure out a way to guard both in that situation. But, no, I'm
confident that our guys will be close enough to him to, you know, hopefully
play his shot on certain situations, and hopefully we'll be physical enough to
keep him off the glass.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about both teams being really good on defense. Is that
the kind of game that you want? Like a game, the first one to 50 wins or the
first one to 60 wins, because that was the score last year. Both teams were
still known for their defense.  
COACH TURGEON: I think that's what it's going to have to be for us. I mean,
we're not going to go out there and score 80. We haven't scored 80 in a long
time. And so it might be the first team to 50 wins tomorrow. Yeah, we're going
to have to make it that kind of game.  
In this building with their fans, we can't get into an up-tempo game. We got
to run when we have chances and take advantage of certain situations, but
besides that we're really going to have to execute and try to take care of the
ball best we can and just guard them. And put together a game plan that we
think is going to work and try to execute it and see what happens.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier that people have been on you all year about your
coaching. Do you sense that regularly and do you still feel like you have
something to prove to people?  
COACH TURGEON: When they're on me, I don't have anything to prove. I know I
can coach a little bit; might not be the greatest coach in the world. Don't
ever claim to be, but I'm really proud of what we've done here this first
year.  
Losing the players that we lost, new coach, the league being as good as it is,
and so, you know, and taking over, just all of us getting used to each other.  
But I just think that, you know, when we started to lose, I just thought it
was a little bit too much coming after me, but that's fine; that's part of the
business. That's why they pay us so much money. You gotta quit being so
sensitive.  
  
Q. What did you feel like?  
COACH TURGEON: I just felt like it was -- I don't read anything, so I don't
know and I don't listen to anything. But I just felt like -- I can hear it.
You can tell. You can tell.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Jerel, this is for you. Could you talk about your commitment to defense.
And I understand you sort of take it upon yourself to get people going and to
make sure you're playing hard and trying to shut them down on the defensive
end. Where did that come from? Is that the way you look at your role or at
least part of your role?  
JEREL McNEAL: I mean, most importantly I think it's just the biggest key for
us to win games. We're a defensive-minded team. If we're not putting pressure
on them and trying to turn them over and getting big stops down the stretch
and things like that, we're not a very good team.  
We're not a team that's going to come out and outscore anybody 100 to 90. That
is not the type of team we are, so I do take it upon myself to come out and
just make sure everybody's locked in defensively and doing the right thing so
we can come out and get stops then start running our fast-break and try to get
easy baskets.  
  
Q. Dominic, how important would you say guard play will be tomorrow?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Very important for us especially. You know, we've been
combatting other teams' advantage, especially in the post you know with our
guard play. Going down there and compensating for our lack of height. But we
got a guy down low that is really battling.  
Lazar Hayward and Ousmane Barro stepping up and making big plays for us. We
know we're a guard-oriented team, and it's our job, especially on defense, to
help those guys out, and on offense to put them in positions where they can be
successful and score the ball.  
  
Q. Coach Crean put such great emphasis on toughness. Can you talk about how
that carries over on the court, maybe even during practice?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think it's pretty evident. I mean, you can see it every
time we play, every time we step on the court that there's a toughness factor
that all of us, you know, we instill in each other and we bring out in each
other.  
I mean that's the way we play. That's the way this game is played now, with
toughness and intelligence, and that's what we pride ourselves on.  
  
Q. Can you talk little bit about the size that Stanford will present for you
guys tomorrow, how you plan to combat that?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I mean, you know, it's pretty obvious that, you know, they have
two seven-foot brothers. And, you know, those guys work really hard, and they
play hard, but so do we. And we got to do a good job of blocking those guys
out and stopping them from getting easy points, but they also have to guard
us. So, you know, it's just going to come down to who works the hardest, and I
wouldn't choose anybody over Ousmane to go into battle with.  
OUSMANE BARRO: Like Lazar said, its going to be a big challenge for us because
we never played, like, two seven-footers in one game, so it's going to be a
battle down there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask Dominic to follow up on that same theme. Even though
guards don't play seven-footers man-to-man, they affect the game. How do they
affect a guards game and how can you counteract such height and skill in the
paint?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Obviously we want to make this an up-and-down pace game. We
want the tempo to compliment our style of play. Just like they said, they got
to play both ends of the floor, you know, and we know they're going to be
factors on both ends of the floor.  
So combat their size with our athleticism and quickness and things like that.
So we definitely got to execute in that matter. We got our advantages and they
have theirs, but it's going come down to who executes and who exposes each
other's weaknesses from start to finish.  
  
Q. So you want to go back-and-forth tempo?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Most definitely. We want to control the tempo. We don't want it
to be a slowed-down game. We want it to be up and down. We want to expose some
of their weaknesses. We want to have our quickness and our athleticism and use
that in our favor.  
  
Q. Jerel, along that same theme, how do you think that will affect your game
tomorrow, what you can do to combat with -- both when you are playing defense
and they're pounded into the post like that and also on the boards? How do you
think that you will be able to help out there?  
JEREL McNEAL: I think more importantly we just got to come out and play the
way we always play. It's going to be a real big challenge for us, just because
of their height and size, and they have a lot of big guys.  
But we got to come out and battle and try to keep those guys off the boards
and do what we can on our low-post defense. So I think if we keep them from
getting good position and, you know, easy baskets throughout the game, that
we'll be in pretty good shape.  
  
Q. A minute or two ago you were saying that when you were talking about this
challenge of facing the big guys on Stanford that there's no one you would
rather go into it with than Ousmane. Can you describe what it is about him
that makes you feel like he's definitely the guy for the job?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: Well, you know, because I know Ousmane will always give 110%,
and he's going to always play his best. He is very tough. It's evident when
we're playing our games. And the toughness that Ous brings out in me, we play
really well together. When I'm playing really tough he plays well. So, you
know, we bring out the toughness in each other.  
And I think that's what we're going to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ousmane, how will this compare with going up against Roy Hibbert?  
OUSMANE BARRO: I mean, it was tough. He is like 7'2." He is one of the bigs in
the Big East, so it was quite challenging for me, but it was just another
game.  
  
Q. I assume he was matched up against you. What did he do to shut you
down?  
OUSMANE BARRO: Roy Hibbert?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
OUSMANE BARRO: I don't think he shut me down. The main thing was following our
game plan and staying with the game plan. That's real big when we play them
throughout the years, and especially four weeks ago when we played them at
home. We just had to stay with the game plan and tried to execute our game
plans.  
  
Q. Jerel, is there a different mindset that goes into playing the first
game, being the favorite or a lower seed at least, and the second game? You
know, now you are playing probably a favorite or at least a lower seed in
Stanford.  
JEREL McNEAL: Nope.  
I think the most important thing that you got to remember once you get to this
time of year is that, you know, there's a field of 65 teams. Everybody earned
their way in here. There's no easy games. I mean, you look at some of the
scores around the country you see that. There ain't no easy wins at this time
of year.  
We didn't look at ourselves as a favorite against Kentucky. We won't look at
it as being the underdog in this game. You got to come out and do what you do.
That's the most important thing. You got to come out and be the team that you
are and play the way you have been playing all year that got you to this
point. If you do that, you can't ask for much more. You toss the ball up and
see what happens. That's what's going to happen tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, gentlemen.  
Coach, the floor is yours.  
COACH CREAN: First off, we know it's going to be a monumental challenge to
match-up with Stanford on size alone, because not only do they have the Lopez
twins who are just dynamite and play so well together, but they have numerous
other players that make plays and make contributions. They have their
starters, they have outstanding depth. They know exactly what they want the
do. They're very -- they're creative offensively but also very disciplined in
what they want to do.  
So we've got to make sure that we do not become mesmerized by one or two
people, that we do not stand. We've got to have great weak-side defense. We've
got to have the ability to put pressure on the ball.  
You know, I don't know what the pace of the game is going to be, but we have
to be able to play inside of it, whatever it is. And our guys are very, very
excited. I mean, very respectful, and the films that we've watched I think we
have a great understanding of just how good the PAC-10 is when you watch
Stanford play UCLA or watch Stanford play USC or Arizona, and we feel like our
preparation of being in the Big East has been very good for us to come out
here and have an opportunity to play a game like this and compete at a high
level.  
  
Q. Tom, for guys who haven't seen you play a lot, how have you done in
match-ups when you have been in a disadvantage like this in size?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we've played against some really, really good big people in
the Big East. I mean Luke Harangody as a center was the player of the league
in our -- of the year in our league. We've play against different combinations
-- Rob Kurz is a really good player at Notre Dame. We never played against a
team that would have two seven-footers like that. We've had our times that
we've been very good.  
When we've been disciplined with our schemes when our ball pressure has been
good, when we understood what we wanted to do down into the post, we've been
good. When we've been a step slow or our ball pressure hasn't been as good or
we've allowed weak-side rebounding to become a big factor in the game, we
haven't been as successful.  
That's probably one of the biggest problems we had when we played UCONN. We
challenged Hasheem to beat us, and weren't too good on the weak-side board. We
had our moments against Roy Hibbert a couple weeks ago. We had 21 points, but
I thought he had to earn every one of those points, and he is an outstanding
center. Again, we've had our successes, we've had our minuses, but we've had a
lot of experience.  
  
Q. Just to put you back on that question. You place such a premium on
toughness going against two seven-footers. How do you expect that to manifest
itself in toughness, even more important in a game like this?  
COACH CREAN: I think the mental toughness is certainly going to be equal to
the physical toughness that you have to have, because we've got to be able to
play possession-by-possession. You've got to be able to talk pass-after-pass.
You've got to be able to, you know, close out, get down into the post, get
into a weak-side rebounding stance, all those different things that go into
it.  
You know, there's a huge physical element to that, but there's an even greater
mental element to that. I think when you play in a league like the Big East or
the PAC-10 you become used to that. And so, you know, I'm excited about our
team. I know they're confident and excited to play, and, I mean, they're
looking forward to the challenge.  
I mean, we know it's going to be a huge challenge, and it's far more than just
the Lopez twins because of what they do on the perimeter, how tough their
guards are. I don't know Trent very well, but I would venture to say he puts a
pretty strong premium on toughness, and they really appear that way when you
watch them on tape and even in yesterday's game.  
  
Q. Tom, Barro, when he was in high school and he was recruited, he wasn't
playing for his high school team. Can you describe a little bit about how you
guys caught on to him? What impressed you about him and where you were able to
make a connection and see him and evaluate him?  
COACH CREAN: Sure. Actually he never played a high school game. He never
played in any organized basketball competition. He did some men's league
things, I think, when he was in high school, but I got to know him through the
gentleman that brought him to the States, Loren Jackson, who was the coach at
Julian high school at the time and just had an opportunity over a couple years
to watch him grow and develop and watch Loren just do a fantastic job with
him.  
I mean, he treated him like he was as good as any player in the country, and
he never played a game for him. Whether it was 6:30 or 7:00 in the morning
workouts, whether it was practice-after-practice, you know, after school, you
know, I mean the team would practice, then he would do more work. And every
chance we had to see him, we just saw that spirit. He was a hungry, hungry
learner.  
And there was no doubt in my mind that with his personality, with his
attitude, with his work ethic that we were going to try to sign him if we
could. And I think it pretty much got down to Louisville and ourselves, and
Louisville took Brian Johnson. I very much think he could have ended up at
Louisville if they hadn't signed Brian Johnson.  
We were able to get him, and he's been a starter. He started a couple games as
a freshman and has pretty much been a mainstay in our line-up for the last
three years.  
  
Q. He said that he had been a soccer player in Africa and that when he
arrived in Chicago that was the very first time that he was introduced to
basketball. I mean, did he look like a guy who had only been playing the game
for a very, very short time when you were evaluating him?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, no question. When you looked at him, you looked at him in
just size an upside. You certainly didn't look at him in skill value at that
point, but he was always a little bit better every time we saw him. And our
looks are somewhat limited unless it's the summertime. So when you would see
him, and you might see him a month later, you might see him two months later,
there was always something he had added to his game.  
He had a real eagerness to learn. And the other thing that was impressive is
how his body was changing, because he was finally lifting weights and things
of that nature. But he's had a real interesting upbringing, and he's been a
joy to have in our program. And what's even more amazing based on, you know,
what he didn't have as far as background academically, he's going to graduate
on time in May. And that's really, at the end of the day, will be the most
special thing, because we know where he was and his background versus where he
is right now. So he's grown in every area at Marquette.  
  
Q. Tom, let's say you are able to mute Brook Lopez inside. What scares you
most then about Stanford?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think they know how to win. I mean, they're not going to
beat themselves. I know that's one of those old coaching, you know, sayings.
But they're just too good. They make the next pass. They cover the boards
extremely well. They can make open shots. I think when Taj Finger is in the
game he is as dangerous as anybody. He plays so hard. He makes things happen.
You know, he is always in perpetual motion. I don't think there's any one
thing that you can look at and say, okay this has to be done for us to win. I
think its more than that.  
And I think we're going to have to be solid, more than solid in a lot of
areas. Weak-side rebounding, our ball pressure, how we play the post, our
transition defense, you know, really. But, again, when you come out of the Big
East, it's not like you go into the Big East and think, okay, we're going to
win this game this way, or we're going to do these two things and we can win.  
You know, you have to be really strong and you have to be very much in a
possession-by-possession mentality to win. From what I see, I think the PAC-10
is exactly the same way.  
  
Q. Tom, you guys -- when people play you, you know they're going to face a
good defensive team and a team that's tough. How much of that is because of
McNeal, as far as him setting an example? And, also, I saw he was defensive
player of the year in your league last year. Did he slip this year, or is that
just one of those things?  
COACH CREAN: That was two words, Hasheem Thabeet. He was one of only four -- I
think I could be wrong on this statistic, but one of four nonbigs to win that
award. I could be wrong. I know John Linehan won it and Allen Iverson as a
sophomore. He didn't slip. Hasheem Thabeet changed everything in the lane, and
rightfully so. On our team Jerel does a great job defensively, and so does
Dominic James. Dominic can guard the dribble. He is outstanding. Wesley has
improved tremendously on defense. He can put pressure on the ball.  
Our big guys have steadily improved. We're not great up front and we're going
to have to have great team defense to be successful tomorrow, but they've all
improved. Jerel has not slipped. He's only gotten better. And one area he's
really gotten better is off the ball.  
  
Q. I understand Dominic's been a little bumped up this season, little
injuries here and there. How important has he been to this team and that he
has gotten through these things and stayed on the floor through this time?  
COACH CREAN: He's shown great mental toughness throughout the year. The injury
he sustained in the Seton Hall game back in January was needless; it hurt his
wrists. He played with that for well over a month, and it was tough to do that
because he was having such a great year.  
But what he did is he never complained; he dealt with it. He never tried to
get out of practices. I mean, I was very conscious of his minutes and very
conscious of the contact at times. He didn't like that. He wanted to be in the
action, never missed games because of that.  
And then he had an ankle injury, he got the flu before the Louisville game. It
wasn't till 4:00 that afternoon for a 6:00 game that we knew we were going to
have him. I didn't start him in that game, and it was never the same. Our team
has relied on him for a lot of things; The number one thing is his spirit.  
And he's got a great spirit. An outstanding toughness, and you see him you can
see the physical strength. He's got very good mental toughness, and when he's
been at his best is when we've been at our best.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up with a statement from Coach Howland, then open
it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach Howland, the floor is yours.  
COACH HOWLAND: We really played good defense tonight, obviously. Real pleased
with the defense. We had 13 blocked shots; that's a lot of blocked shots. I
think when you look at that right now, James had 4, Kevin had 4, Lorenzo had a
couple. But more than anything, I'm just pleased with the way that they shot
from the field. Shows that we played really hard.  
I thought that our players who came off the bench did a good job and gave us
good minutes.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Kevin, tell us about your adventure there at the start of the second
half, getting that ball down so the game could go on.  
KEVIN LOVE: The guy shot it, and it actually got stuck up there. That actually
happened yesterday in the shoot-around. I don't know if you guys could be
around even to see that, but we had to knock the ball out of there. The ref
just told me he couldn't do it, and I knocked it out. And he told me
afterwards I showed him up. I said, you know what, I had to get the ball down
somehow.  
  
Q. Kevin, didn't seem like the back was bothering you very much.  
KEVIN LOVE: No. I actually got treatment ever since the game was done on
Saturday against Stanford. And since then, just been working on it. For the
first 30 to 45 minutes, I'd be standing up, and my back would start spasming a
little bit more, but I just got some treatment. And also, you know, did a lot
of sleeping and a lot of stuff like that, just to rest my back.  
But today, it was fine. Had to get a little more loose than usual, but just
played through it, and only had to play 21 minutes today. Hope Friday that
will help me in the long run.  
  
Q. Just follow up on the back. Are you going to continue this treatment for
the foreseeable future?  
KEVIN LOVE: Just as a preventative measure. That's probably it. As of right
now, it feels fine. Feels 95, 100% I'm just going to keep it going from here
on out.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, can you take this one. Did you guys feel a little bit like you
were playing your younger brothers or kind of the boys in the school yard
against the little kids with all those blocks?  
LORENZO MATA-REAL: No. I mean, we just come out and played hard no matter who
we're playing. We don't take nobody lightly. No matter who we're playing, we
just come out and play the way we do all the time. Our defense dictates what
we do. And I feel like, I mean, we played great defense today.  
  
Q. Kevin, what do you guys know about Texas A &M Saturday?   
KEVIN LOVE: Coach Howland mentioned they're a very physical team. They have a
good friend of mine, DeAndre Jordan, on their team, who is seven foot. He's
got a real long wingspan. Their whole team's long. I think he mentioned nobody
on their team is below 6'3", so we're going to have to come out and offensive
rebound.  
Those are things we gave up a lot today in the first half. I think through the
first four or five minutes, we had already given up four or six offensive
rebounds. We're going have to get on the boards with them because it's going
to be a real physical battle.  
  
Q. Kevin, back in November, you talked about getting to this point in the
season. What was it like in your first NCAA appearance?  
KEVIN LOVE: It was a lot of fun. My teammates and coaches made it fun for me,
as well. We had mentioned a bunch of times throughout the week that a 16 seed
has never beat a 1 seed, and we didn't want to be the first one.  
So we had to come out and jump on them as much as possible. I felt like we did
that. Coach Howland also mentioned in the post-game talk that not a team since
1949 hasn't scored that many points, 29 points, so we did a great job on the
defensive end.  
COACH HOWLAND: I think.  
  
Q. You were the Defensive Player of the Year in the PAC-10 this year,
Russell. And seemed like you had a lot of help out there today. I think you
guys had a season-high in blocks with 13. Could you just comment on the team
performance defensively.  
RUSSELL WESTBROOK: We came out great on defense. We held them to the season
low, or whatever, 29 points. It think we did a great job of helping, you know,
doubling the post and rotating the defensive end.  
  
Q. Kevin, did you guys almost feel bad for them a little bit toward the end
of the game?  
KEVIN LOVE: No mercy. That's all I can really say. No mercy out there. We
didn't feel too bad for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
All right. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Good luck on Saturday.  
COACH HOWLAND: In reference to that, Stanford Speech came up with me with
about seven minutes to go, and he said, "Coach, I hope you guys win the whole
thing," and that was really classy of him to do that in the middle of the
game.  
So they have a bunch of really good kids. They work very hard. A school that
is 3,000 people, and those kids are all really good kids. I don't know if you
saw one of their kids after the game was crying his eyes out. I mean, it's
their last game as a senior. So I would never make light of, or make fun of
someone in that way. I think that's, you know, being rude.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the, I don't know if you want to call it emergence,
but make something positive out of a possible negative, the emergence, what it
seems, of James Keefe. Again, it seems solid minutes there. Do you think you
may have gotten some benefit from the Luc injury and forcing James to have
more minutes now?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, it gave him an opportunity, obviously, to play more
minutes with Luc's injury, starting with the SC game, as well as the
championship game against Stanford. Again, he came out and played very well. I
think he is gaining a lot of confidence.  
Remember, he came into this season off a shoulder surgery, so he didn't even
get to start practicing with contact, I don't think, until sometime in the
middle of November or maybe even December. I can't remember. But he wasn't
even able to be cleared for playing until sometime in mid-December. I think
originally, we talked about him playing against Idaho State, and I'm just
really thankful that we didn't red-shirt him. Obviously he's been a huge
difference-maker, and he's coming on right now. I'm really happy for James. He
had seven rebounds and four blocks today.  
So I thought we did a lot of good things rebounding-wise, though. Alfred had
six rebounds in his minutes. James had seven. Kevin had nine in 21 minutes. So
all three of those guys did a very, very good job attacking the glass. And
Lorenzo had nine rebounds. So it was spread around pretty good.  
  
Q. But when you are back at full strength, which I guess you're hoping for
Saturday. Or at least the next week, assuming you win --  
COACH HOWLAND: In reference to your question, I think is that Luc will start
on Saturday, for sure. I initially had planned on doing that. And then as I
thought about it, I felt comfortable that we would be able to probably get
this one without him. I didn't, after giving it more thought. And I think we
had a meeting here yesterday. I honestly had planned to start him today until
late last night when I had given it a lot of thought.  
But, you know, in reference to James, I think his play has earned him more
minutes and more potential to play as we move forward into Saturday's game.
And we're going to need him.  
These guys from Texas A&M, that was the most physical game we played in the
last year here in the Wooden, where Jones is just a big, strong kid inside.
Davis is huge. They have a kid with an African name that comes off the bench
now who is an animal. They're just so strong and athletic.  
Obviously, DeAndre Jordan that Kevin alluded to, they have as big a front
line, as athletic a front line as there are in the country. Then their wings
are 6'5" and 6'6." They really shot, especially Carter. So we have our hands
full and we're going to need all.  
  
Q. To get that steal when you were already up 30 --  
COACH HOWLAND: I thought it was a great play. What I always preach to our guys
is, when you don't get on the floor, and you see it happen all the time when
you follow this game, when you don't dive on the floor, that's when you get
your knees taken out and you end up with an ACL, by diving on the floor. He
actually avoided any kind of injury potential, but that was great. He dove. We
got the ball. Then there was a great finish at the other end where I think
there was a pass for a layup. And that was really, really nice teamwork and
good hustle started by Darren's hustle.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH HOWLAND: Thank you.

### [Louis Dale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18237)

### [Steve Donahue](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18240)

### [Ryan Wittman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18236)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will open up with a statement from the coach, then questions
for the student-athletes first.  
So, Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH DONAHUE: Obviously played a very good basketball team. I was extremely
impressed with Stanford, and just speaking to a lot of their teams they played
this year, everybody you speak to talked about how disciplined, how hard they
play. I think that's what you saw in the first half. I thought they did a
terrific job. Occasionally you walk into the situation, I was telling the
guys, that you can get a team that doesn't respect you. You know, then we're
dangerous.  
I think the first half they came out and really guarded us, made it tough on
us, and I thought we missed some shots we normally make. But for the most part
Stanford just played a terrific basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Wanted to get your thoughts, if you think that Cornell has faced a team
that defends with as much length as Stanford did today on the perimeter
shots?  
RYAN WITTMAN: Um, you know, probably not. They've got quite a few guys, Fields
and Hill, who are pretty long on the perimeter. So then, you know, they have
the two seven-footers down low. So even if you shot fake and try to drive in
the lane, they can alter shots as well. But, you know, they've great defensive
team, probably one of the best defensive teams we've played all year.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, for either of the student-athletes, if you feel like
you guys would have been a better match-up or had a better chance against a
different type of team? Obviously, your height advantage doesn't play as well
against the Lopez twins and what Stanford brings to the table.  
RYAN WITTMAN: You know, they're obviously a really good team. They do have a
height advantage over pretty much any team in the nation, but I think it was
difficult for us to block out. They're one of the best rebounding teams in the
country. I think it was difficult for us at times. You know, there were a lot
of possessions, especially early in the game where it seems like we played
pretty good defense. Then they get the offensive rebound and put it back in.
But that's how they beat teams.  
  
Q. This is for Louis. How do you put this year in prospective? A lot of you
guys are coming back. And sort of what you were able to do, break Penn and
Princeton's strangle hold on the Ivy League even though it ends like this?  
LOUIS DALE: We had a great season. Something to be proud of. And I think this
game that, you know, we just played today, kind of let's us know that we need
to get better for next year, and that it's still going to be difficult to make
it back here next year. And I think that's what we're going to focus on.  
And, you know, we're going to try to get better each and every day in the off-
season. And hopefully we can improve our season next year.  
  
Q. Can you comment on what Jeff Foote has meant to this team since he came
on board in December?  
LOUIS DALE: He's meant a lot to our team. He's a great defensive presence back
there, especially in the Ivy League. And he's a great offensive rebounder and
scorer. So, you know, this year he's helped us out tremendously, being a shot-
blocker and someone who you can pass into the post and who can score and can
also find open teammates. I think he's made us a tremendous team this year.
And, you know, we look forward to the future.  
  
Q. Louis, I wanted to ask you, I think you missed your first ten shots. I
might be wrong on that, but, you know, a tough shooting day obviously for the
team. How much of that do you think was Stanford playing tough defense and how
much, if at all, do you think it was being at the NCAA tournament, being on a
higher stage, you know, for the fist time?  
LOUIS DALE: I think they're a good defensive team. They're very physical in
the perimeter. I think that played a part into it, too. And so you had to work
hard to get past the perimeter defenders. And then there's two seven-footers
there waiting to block your shot. So it makes it kind of hard for someone to
just penetrate and, you know, get an open shot. And I think that played into
today's game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes. All right.  
Thank you, gentlemen.  
Now questions for Coach Steve Donahue.  
  
Q. Kenny Brown played four minutes in the PAC-10 championship game against
UCLA. Obviously he was a big factor today. Did you anticipate that? Was there
very much attention paid to him, you know, this week as you were preparing?  
COACH DONAHUE: You almost have to pick your poison here, and my feeling was
that once they saw what we were doing, that they would go to some more
shooters, Fields, you said Brown, also they play Hill, Shiller. I thought they
would do that. We were scraping from the perimeter. We just couldn't afford to
leave another big and double from the post. And I thought we did -- you know,
it's funny. These guys played the game plan. I'm disappointed in the results,
but the game plan, and someone mentioned the stage here having an affect on
them, I really don't think that.  
I think Stanford really had -- as I said in my opening comments, they have
respect for you. They play hard, disciplined, and that was the difficult part.
And my feeling was, if they brought in shooters, then our strategy's going to
be really hard at that point. And they made us pay for it.  
  
Q. Steve, you guys played Duke, played Syracuse this year. Did either of
those two games prepare you for the kind of length your guys had to shoot
over?  
COACH DONAHUE: You know what, Brian, it wasn't even the length. I said this to
Coach Johnson. His kids play this style, it's almost a brand, it's Stanford
basketball. No matter who you are going against, they're not going to allow
you to beat you with your better players. They get physical with you.  
Duke is a team, and someone mentioned a match-up. To be honest with you, a
match-up like a Duke would have been better for us. A team that's going to try
to challenge us full court, let us get loose for some shots, make us feel
good. When you got to grind it out in a half court set against a team like
this, that's a difficult match-up for us.  
So this team was way different than those two teams strictly for the defensive
ability. They're disciplined. Besides all the length you are talking about, I
respect that they play us as hard as they did.  
  
Q. Coach Donahue, what was your message for the team during half-time and
even after this game?  
COACH DONAHUE: At half-time, obviously we're in a difficult thick. And I want
to try to win four-minute segments. Let's try to get it down to ten with ten
to go.  
That didn't happen obviously. But I thought if we could make some shots early
in the first half -- second half, excuse me, we came out and ran and executed
a three for Ryan in the corner. I thought if we could start making some shots,
maybe they'll press a little bit. But they didn't do that.  
And towards the end of the game, every timeout, which is obviously very long
in the NCAA tournament when you are down, especially this amount, I just
talked about our pride, and our heart, and so many people that have supported
us, and they expect us to go out and play. And these guys did. They played
their tails off. They did everything I could ask.  
I'm more disappointed in myself that I couldn't come up with another way,
another strategy to help us compete against a team like this.  
But in reality that's a very good team that played very well today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just speak about the crowd. Coming here to California, I
thought myself that we'd be outnumbered, Cornell would be outnumbered, but it
seems as if Cornell was just as loud if not louder than the Stanford fans?  
COACH DONAHUE: It's been an amazing run. And a lot of it has to do with the
people that have supported us. And I've been at these events a lot as a fan
and as a coach at the University of Pennsylvania. Never did I see that kind of
support. I mean, not only did we sell our tickets, but, obviously, there's a
lot of people and alum in the area that came out to support us as well, which
is great. I mean, it's an unbelievable university with great people. Proud
that I coach at an institution like this, and I would have loved them to have
a better effort.  
But I think they understand that this was a very good basketball team that we
faced.  
The other thing I say is, we are very young. All these guys that you saw, six
out of seven are sophomore-eligible. This is their first experience, not only
just for the experience thing, but strength. As we get older and tougher and
bigger, we'll play better next time when we're here, I'm positive of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH DONAHUE: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement from Coach, then open the
questions from student athletes. Coach, when you're ready.  
DAVE ROSE: I thought it was a very competitive game. Both teams playing really
hard, and they got off to a really good start, hit some big shots. But we were
able to fight back and get back into the game, get a lead, and then it came
down to the last couple minutes of the game.  
And they made some big shots and got some big rebounds and, you know, we
competed really hard. Just felt like they made a few more plays than we did.  
  
Q. Is that the reason for the start for you guys, 0 for 8, then 2 for 12?
Was it nerves, what they were doing on defense, or why you guys came out so
cold to start the game?  
LEE CUMMARD: We didn't start the game with a lot of energy, playing flat, and
we were rushing shots and not taking shots that we normally take.  
  
Q. The big guys' free-throw shooting, I guess, has been a problem most of
the season, and tonight the three, you were 3 for 10. Is it physical? Is it
mental?  
TRENT PLAISTED: All mental. It's all mental. All of us have good strokes.
We're good shooters; we knock them down in practice. We practice it all the
time. Today just didn't work out for us.  
  
Q. Trent, can you describe -- a big issue obviously in the game was Texas A
&M's inside presence. Can you describe what it was like to play against those
guys and trying to rebound against them?   
TRENT PLAISTED: You know they're really big bodies, and they use their
physicality to their advantage, and they're hard to guard. You know, they had
that cross-screen going and it's hard to keep good position on them when they
get that cross-screen. But credit those guys, they gave great efforts to the
ball and they were able to pull down some big rebounds. And like I said,
they're very big, physical post players.  
  
Q. Lee, you missed that one three, I think it was three or four minutes to
go in the game. Did you have another shot on that? And how were they guarding
you?  
LEE CUMMARD: Just matching up. Kirk was guarding me, really falling out and
trying to stay with me. He is a great defender, and credit to Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Jonathan, defensively it seemed like you guarded a variety of players who
could do a variety of things. What were issues with match-ups you guys had?  
JONATHAN TAVERNARI: Well they just, you know, they're pretty good players. I
mean. They scored inside. Like Lee and Coach Rose said, you got to give them
credit. I mean, they got the ball in spots where, you know, they're pretty
hard to guard. You know, inside, outside, I mean, once you get beaten baseline
in the middle, pretty much in a help situation. So they're good players, I
mean, they're one of the best teams in the Big 12.  
They knock down shots. You got to give them all the credit in the world.  
  
Q. Lee, you guys were trying to break through for that win. It's been a long
time for BYU. What's it going to take for you guys to break through and get a
first-round win?  
LEE CUMMARD: We're going have to do a better job of defending the shot. 54%,
that's not going to get it done. Rebounding, we got out-rebounded by 12.
That's not going to get it done. And shooting 44% is not going to get it done.
So back to the drawing board. Got to compete. A little more sense of urgency
at the start of the game, and credit to Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Jonathan, after you guys wipe out that 11-point deficit and it's tied
going into halftime, did you feel like the momentum was going your way? What
was the sense in the locker room?  
JONATHAN TAVERNARI: We had a chance to win the game throughout, you know,
throughout the whole thing. I mean, it just came down to they made more plays
than we did. Like I said, they're great basketball players. We had a chance to
make plays. A bounce or two that went the other way, I mean, some shots that
went in and out and some rebounds that got tipped up, and we had the chance
to, you know, rebound, but we didn't.  
I mean, could have gone either way. But they're great ball club and, you know,
how we came out in the second half and matched up -- pretty much the second
half was pretty much back and forth, and we were just a couple plays short
this game.  
  
Q. Obviously, all of you guys get the chance to come back if you so wish.
What do you say to the two seniors as they're outgoing?  
TRENT PLAISTED: About our two seniors, you know, we love those guys. We feel
really bad for them. It's heart-breaking to end your career on a loss, but a
lot of people do it. And we wanted to get over that hump and get a few wins in
a tournament. But these guys are great people, and they're going to, you know,
be part of BYU basketball forever.  
They got a banner, a couple banners hung in the Marriott Center, and they'll
always be able to come back and be proud of what they accomplished. We love
those guys to death, and we hope they come back and stay a part of this thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for student-athletes? All right. Thank
you, gentlemen.  
We'll now open up to questions for Coach Rose.  
  
Q. Dave, could you talk a little bit about Jimmer and the effort that he put
in this first tournament game?  
DAVE ROSE: You know, I thought that Jimmer played with a lot of confidence,
and that was a good sign. Ben has had that ankle issue for the last couple
weeks and slowed him down just a little bit. Jimmer's got a lot of minutes in
practice at the point guard, and I thought he played very well in the
championship game of the Mountain West Conference tournament.  
When he came in tonight, he just came in with a lot of confidence. We were
kind of stuck. We hadn't scored for a while, and, you know, we were looking
for a little bit of lift. And I thought Jimmer did a good job of providing
that for us.  
  
Q. Is there anything that you've done during the season to work with the
guys on the struggle with free-throw shooting? Like Trent was saying, you
know, it's mental. Has there been anything?  
DAVE ROSE: We spent a lot of time with all our players. And I think that, you
know, we have had -- those same players tonight that maybe struggled a little
bit have won games for us down the stretch and helped us win, you know, our
second straight Mountain West Conference regular season championship, so it's
a situation where we need to be a little more consistent. We're very capable.  
I think that, you know, a lot more work and time and we can address that issue
of being more consistent.  
  
Q. Coach, down the stretch I know you worried a little bit about the
offensive rebounding. Seemed like in the last few minutes they ended up
getting a few extra shots. I think that was one of the keys down the stretch
of the game is the extra shots they got?  
DAVE ROSE: We did a pretty good job on the boards for the most part. I mean,
they didn't end up with some numbers like they have, 18, 19, 21 offensive
rebounds; they've had that in other games, but they got critical second shots
that really helped them, especially in that last three or four-minute period
when the game was right there on the line for either team.  
And it's, I mean, they're big, physical players, and at critical times they
made critical plays. But that's, you know, that's why they're -- they got 24,
25 wins, because that's how they win, and they did a good job with that.  
  
Q. Josh Carter is a pretty streaky outside shooter. How disappointed were
you to see him get those open looks early and get his team going?  
DAVE ROSE: We were slow, but he was quick to start the game, had a little bit
of space. When he hit that first one, you knew that it was going to be a real
challenge, because he's long and he does a good job of creating space for
himself. They screen really well. Those big post players screen you really
hard.  
And when you get knocked, when you are chasing a guy off a screen and you get
kind of hit -- the first part of the game we were getting hung up, and that
was just giving them that extra time that he needed to get that shot off. Then
he had -- hit his first two or three. He had a lot of confidence.  
Then he hit late in the first half we did a pretty good job of guarding it.
That was just a big shot. Then he hit that first one in the second half, then
we did some different things. Sam got on him and just tried to not let him
gets as many catches. And we controlled him a little bit better.  
But it caused problems for us with dribble penetration because we didn't have
as much help as we would normally have. And they're a tough match-up, tough to
cover.  
  
Q. Dave, can you describe -- you called a time-out early in the first half.
You go to the TV time-out, and you still haven't scored. How did you get the
guys to settle down, or how did you fire them up, or what are the huddles like
during that point?  
DAVE ROSE: No, I think that there are times when we called early time-outs and
really try to jump on your guys and try to get them going. That wasn't the
issue tonight. Tonight it was to try to get them in a situation where we -- we
were in a hurry. We took shots that, like Lee mentioned, maybe aren't what we
normally do. And we were just trying to kind of get our arms around them and
just get us into what we like to do. And when we did, that I thought we gained
our composure, and got ourselves back in the game.  
And that gave us a lot of confidence to continue to play in the situation
where -- last couple minutes we had that game in a position where we could win
if we had made a few more plays.  
  
Q. Dave, how much was their perimeter defense a factor in your struggles
from out there tonight?  
DAVE ROSE: Well, they were right to us on most of our catches. And it's a
credit to Mark and his staff. They did a great job of, you know, getting their
players in a position to contest us on a catch.  
And the strength of our team is that we usually most of our field goals are
assisted field goals. And we're not a team that dribbles in the shots and
creates shots for ourselves. We've got some players who have gotten better at
that, and really Jimmer has done a good job of creating shots for others and
for himself.  
But I thought that tonight, most of the time when we came off screens to get a
shot, there was somebody right there. And that's a credit to their staff and
to their players.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of reflect on your thoughts on the season as a whole
and then looking forward to the future as far as next year?  
DAVE ROSE: Well, you know, I spent some -- quite a bit of time with our team
in the locker room afterwards. And that is kind of what we talked about, was
the great things that this team has done this year. It's not going to make
anybody feel much better right now, but I wanted those guys to leave the
locker room just knowing how -- you know, how proud our staff is of what
they've accomplished.  
And won a lot of games, won them back-to-back, the Mountain West Conference
regular season championship. We beat a team ranked in the top ten for the
first time in a long while. We've got a nice home-court winning streak going.
There's a lot of good things that are going on with BYU basketball. Those are
some of the things we tried to reflect on in the locker room.  
  
Q. To kind of follow up on that, Trent said before the game that he felt
like it would take a win to separate this season from last season. Do you feel
that way, or is the season also a step in the right direction?  
DAVE ROSE: One of the guys said we're going to hang a banner in that arena,
and there's a lot of teams that are going to get beat in this tournament at
some time, and they're not hanging banners in their arenas.  
And to win a championship is quite an accomplishment. And so to separate one
season from the next, when you win a championship and you have an opportunity
to have your players wear a ring around for the rest of their life that says
they're champions, to hang a banner in your arena that says they're champions,
that's a special season.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much, coach.  
DAVE ROSE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a two-minute statement from the head coach,
then we'll open the floor to questions for the student-athletes. Coach, go
ahead.  
COACH CREAN: First and foremost, another Marquette/Kentucky game with two
teams that respect each other, two coaching staffs that respect each other,
and a group of players on both sides of the fence that have ability,
toughness, passion, and endurance.  
And it was one of those games. Again, I'm proud of these guys to my left. I'm
proud of the team that's in the locker room because they came in, and they
just put everything on playing the right way. And we knew we had to defend at
a high-level especially with the shot clock.  
We knew Joe Crawford and Ramel Bradley were outstanding players, and they did
nothing to change that opinion today only make it grow, but our guys were up
to the challenge. We never wilted. We never got that big put-away we were
looking for because Kentucky kept coming back, but we stepped up and made the
plays that we had to make, and that's what you have to do at this time of
year.  
The rebounding game was going to be huge. We were able to win that. We didn't
turn the ball over very much. You cannot do that this time of year. Your best
players got to step up and make plays, which they did. And people have to come
off the bench and really contribute, like Dwight Burke did, like Cubillan did,
like Dan Fitzgerald and Maurice Acker did. Proud of our team, and we're
excited to see who we play next.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Wesley, after what you guys have gone through last couple years in the
tournament, was there any chance you were going to miss any of those free
throws there?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: No. I mean it was just a matter of going up there and making
them. I mean, they're shots that we take all the time, shots that we practice,
shots that you been taking since you started playing this game. You know, it's
easy to make them when your whole team and coaching staff has confidence in
you.  
Coach is drawing up the play to give me the ball in that position, and I just
did my job and made them.  
  
Q. A question for Dominic: Your coach mentioned mutual respect. Can you tell
us why you went over to the Kentucky bench at the end of the game and spoke to
their guard when he fouled out?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Well, you know, that's what competition's all about, two
competitors. I know that's one thing that our coach instills in us. He's a
competitor himself. And, you know, as hard as we work out there on the floor,
you know, the game was pretty much over and he played a heck of a ball game.
35 points. I mean, you saw the performance out there, and he put his heart out
there on the floor.  
So out of respect for him and his teammates, you know, I just told him to keep
his head up and keep playing the game that he loves.  
  
Q. This question is for Jerel. Given the way that you guys got this done and
how you've gotten it done the previous couple years, do you think that this
team has more grit than in the previous couple years?  
JEREL McNEAL: I definitely believe we do. I think we just -- we've grown so
much just since my first year here. The past three years we've been in the
same situation, but we came out today and we put 40 minutes together. You
know, we had spurts through those 40 minutes that weren't always, you know,
the best Marquette team that we could put out there, but the most important
thing, we just stayed with it. Nobody dropped their heads.  
We just persevered through all the tough times and making shots. I'm just
proud of all my teammates, all those guys in the locker room, because I feel
like this is a team that wouldn't have won this game two years ago.  
  
Q. What is different about it? What do you think teams from the past would
have done in the face of the Kentucky rush that you guys didn't do this
time?  
JEREL McNEAL: We would have fell apart. Guys would have stopped talking. You
know, I mean, guys would have started hanging their heads a little bit,
getting a little bit tight, which we didn't do at all. All these guys made big
plays. We just kept pushing through, man, just unbelievable feeling just to
come out and just know that you got guys on the court with you that's going to
make big plays and not give up and keep pushing through everything.  
COACH CREAN: Let me add one thing I think is important that I think has been
totally forgotten in this week. When we came out to California three seasons
ago, these three were freshmen and played and started -- with exception of
when Wes got injured, played and started in every game as freshmen.  
We had Steve Novak as a senior. We had some other Young men, but we started a
senior, sophomore and three freshmen. Last year we played in this tournament
and we weren't nearly at full strength. You're just getting an idea of how
good Jerel McNeal is if you haven't seen us play all year.  
What you see from Dominic and Wesley is what we see every day, consistency of
effort, consistency of purpose. So, you know, this team's been in the NCAA
tournament for three years, but we've never -- we were young. I mean, they're
growing up, they're mature. They understand how to win. They understand how to
do things and they understand how to correct themselves, and I think that's
very, very important. And I think that has a lot to do with why we were able
to be successful today.  
  
Q. This is for Wesley. You said recently that even though the team hadn't --
you know, has had a lot of success in the regular season since you've been
there that it was fair to measure you on the post-season results.  
Can you elaborate on that and also how this feels now to kind of get over that
hump?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: It feels great. I mean, to -- finally after being here for
three years to finally come out and get a win. I mean, when you put so much
effort and work into the off-season and the pre-season and post-season and,
you know, during the season leading up to this point, it's just a great
feeling to finally come together as a team, as a mature team and pull out a
victory, especially against a team like Kentucky.  
What was the rest of that question?  
  
Q. Just about how teams are -- you know, it's fair to measure you on how you
do in the post-season.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I mean that's just how it is. I mean, our other past three
years we've had successful seasons. Our first year in the Big East we weren't
picked to do nearly as well as we did. We ended up fourth place in the
conference. I mean, that's just how it happens. You're measured on how you do,
you know, in the NCAAs, and it's good for us to get out on a good start right
now.  
  
Q. You three scored 17 of the last 18 points to close out the game. Do you
feel that's a fitting way for you guys to close out your first NCAA tournament
win?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Yeah. I mean, we got a coach that's confident, you know,
especially in these three guys up here, Lazar Hayward and other guys. He puts
the ball in the hands of guys he knows is going to step up and make big plays
at big times.  
We got a group of guys that want the ball in their hands. I feel like that's
the best thing about this team, is that everybody is confident in each other
to step up and make big plays. Everybody did that today.  
That's why, you know -- I mean, it's very important that we got this win and
everybody so they could make the big plays to be in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. You talk a little bit in the last few years you guys sort of fell ahead
early in the tournament. Talk about this year being able to play from ahead.  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: That's maturity. A sign of maturity. Like Jerel said, a
couple years ago we don't know if we're winning that game, if we're pulling it
out because of the run. I mean with us coming straight out of high school we
were always the go-to guys. We might have started falling apart, like he said,
or trying to take the game over by ourselves, but we're comfortable with each
other. We're confident in each other. Our coach is confident in us. We're
confident in him that he is going to call the plays then we're going to
execute them.  
So I mean, that's just what it is. We came out, we had the lead and we didn't
want to lose it, so we kept playing hard. They threw their punch and we threw
ours right back.  
THE MODERATOR: One last question for student-athletes? Seeing none, we'll
thank the student-athletes for coming out and excuse them.  
Open up the floor to questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Tom, you heard them say they felt that, you know, a year ago or two years
ago things might have fallen apart for them in the face of the Kentucky
charge.  
When did you realize that these guys were different, had a different make-up
or they matured to the point where they weren't going to let a thing like that
happen?  
COACH CREAN: It's process, you know, when what I realize is they've averaged
23 wins in their 3 years at Marquette. I realized that we started three
freshman when they were freshmen, and I tend to focus on where we're at in the
moment not where we were a year ago.  
Your team is defined in different ways throughout the season. We've had
different times these guys have been able to pinpoint where they were at.
Pinpoint, you know, that togetherness, that comradery that you need to pull
things out, and it's all part of a process. I don't have one definitive time
for you though. I mean the season's a long season. There is different places.  
  
Q. Tom, what was the game plan going in against Crawford specifically what
did you guys want to do defensively against him?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we wanted to stay down on him. We wanted to not go for shot
fakes. We wanted to make every catch with Bradley and Crawford a little
tougher than the last one and just build our intensity up as the shot clock
wound down. Early in the game, in the first half we were playing zone at the
shot clock and they made an adjustment at half-time, so we made our adjustment
to go back man-to-man.  
But he earned his baskets. He is a great player. We'll see him in Milwaukee,
you know. I don't know if he'll be a Buck but there's 29 or 30 other teams he
could play for. He'll be a pro, and I believe Bradley will be as well. Those
guys are just too talented and they're too tough. But the game plan was built
not only around those two but also on Jasper, because he can make so many
things happen.  
He is a point guard playing the four spot.  
We wanted to make sure that we attacked them on our end. We wanted to put
ourselves in positions to drive the ball, get to the free-throw line. And it
was one of those games. It was a grind-it-out game, which we had a strong
feeling it would be.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Jerel McNeal's play as of late,
including the Big East tournament and today, and how important his
contribution on offense is -- not only defense but offense is going to be
going forward in the tournament?  
COACH CREAN: Well he's got 69 wins in 3 years, so it didn't just start last
week. He's started every game he's ever played at Marquette. I don't see any
reason he won't continue to do that. And it was very, very tough for him last
year and for us to come into this tournament without our MVP, which is what
his teammates voted him last year.  
And what he's done over the year, and especially the last two months, is take
his work ethic to an even higher level when it comes to shooting and working
on his game outside of practice. You know early mornings, in between classes,
sometimes at night, always staying after practice. But that time spent is
really paying dividends for him, because his shot is crisp. It looks like it's
going in. It looks like it's going in every time he shoots it. He's always
been an attack mentality young man. He's always been a guy that plays with an
edge. That's what makes him successful, and his skills just continue to
flourish and get better.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Thank you, Coach.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Green, the floor is yours.  
COACH GREEN: Let's concentrate on a couple things. How good UCLA is and what a
class group and, you know, they're big, they're strong. When it comes to us
competing against a team like that, it would be very difficult if we were at
our best.  
You know, what you saw was no indication of what went on with this group of
guys throughout our conference. Obviously, there is a tremendous difference in
the levels. And we don't want our guys to feel like that this was their
season. I'm very proud of these three guys, and the other guys in the locker
room, and it will be a lesson for the guys that are coming back.  
But it also will be a lesson for the guys that are going on to graduate in
terms of how to compete and make something happen throughout your league play,
how you relate that to life, and, also, the experience that we had. It was a
situation that we hadn't been in, and we didn't respond and show the best of
our abilities in that situation. But, even so, we have nothing to hold our
heads down for.  
Obviously, when you talk about the stats, we didn't get back in transition and
gave them easy baskets. We had some quick shots and couldn't get second shots.
We also gave up the rebounds to them, and obviously when you do that on a team
that's so much better at every position player-by-player all the way down the
bench, you're going to get beat.  
And the score could be -- this score, it could be worse; it could be less.
Obviously it's going be very difficult to win that game. We give them a lot of
credit for being able to play every single possession as hard as they possibly
could knowing that the game was as such.  
So you are talking about a very disciplined, hard-nosed defensive minded,
skilled offensive team in UCLA. So my hat's off to them, but the I still love
my guys, and they all will be successful.  
  
Q. Stanford, you knew obviously it was going to be a tough match-up, but
just what was it like once you were out there with their bigs and trying to
contend with their defensive pressure?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, mainly the defensive pressure wasn't that bad; it was
more of the banging, bumping around. We don't see a lot of that in our
conference. And, you know, it was kind of hard to adjust.  
In our conference we get the little ticky-tack fouls, and out there you had to
play through it. And so the defensive pressure didn't bother us, it was just
the contact, the physicalness of the game. And, you know, those guys, man,
they're great. You know, most of them played McDonald's All-American games,
and they know how to play.  
So like Coach said, we played our best game; we probably still would have lost
by 10 or 15.  
  
Q. This is for all, was this a good experience for you guys? You go up
against UCLA, you said they're all McDonald All-Americans. Is this something
you can take something from later on in life?  
ERIC PETTY: Well, yes. UCLA's a great team, probably one of the best; probably
the best we've played all year, and we played some top teams. It's a great
experience. I'm Junior. I'm going to take this and learn from it and put it
into what I got to do next year and come back and make us a lot better. I can
use it and teach some of this to the newcomers that are coming.  
  
MICHAEL CLARK: I feel like Eric. Me, too, being a Junior and coming back next
year, it will help me learn what I need to get better at for preparing for
next season, being able to tell the new incoming freshmen what it takes to get
here.  
We're very happy to get here, but at the same time look down on the loss, feel
like we could have played better.  
  
Q. What will you tell people when they ask what Kevin Love was really like,
what it was like to play against him?  
ERIC PETTY: I guard him. I guard some big men this season, and he is physical.
Oh man, for a freshman, he's got an outside game. To be that big inside, I
mean, man he's going be great, I know that; he's going to be great.  
COACH GREEN: I think most of our guys, if they feel some of what I feel, it
looks like we spent one day playing and coaching in the NBA playing against
him.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for student-athletes. With that, thank
you very much.  
  
Q. Coach, that ball got stuck there early in the second half. Were you kind
of hoping maybe they don't get it down and we can just kind of get this thing
over with?  
COACH GREEN: You know, that's a difficult play, but we worked on that.
(Laughing). Our whole plan was to delay the game as much as we could, and that
was a great play. I mean, I was really a little bit excited about it, hoping
they would be a little bit distracted.  
  
Q. Maybe it's not the right time, but talk about how far you think UCLA in
your mind can go in this tournament?  
COACH GREEN: Well, you know, it's really -- they can win the National
Championship. Whether they will or not, obviously, will depend on how some
other people play on that particular day.  
To win a National Championship, it's hard to predict who will win, because I
think there's a lot of good teams out there, but I know they're very capable,
you know, because they have all the parts, and they play with the passion that
you need to play with in order to get there. So I think they have a great
chance of doing it. Whether they will or not, you know, just depends.  
Some days you shoot it a little bit better, some teams come in and do some
different things against you that maybe will exploit some weaknesses, but we
couldn't see those weaknesses for sure. There will be some teams that will do
a better job in some areas than what we could do.  
For instance, getting back in transition. That's something that will get the
them in a half-court game offensively, and then being able to play against
their bumping and grinding and having a guy that can play a lot in the post
area that maybe can come out and defend out on the court also, those type
match-ups. You never know who they'll match-up with throughout the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? I think that will do it. Thank you very
much, Coach.  
COACH GREEN: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, we'll open up with a statement from Coach, then open it
up to questions for the student athletes. Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH TURGEON: That was a great win for us. We beat a really, really good BYU
team. I think they won 13 out of 14 coming into this game. And, you know,
about the ten-minute mark they took a two-point lead and I was a little
worried. We were confused defensively.  
We weren't making open shots, but we just kept guarding. I thought defensively
the last eight minutes of the game we were really good. We gave up two threes.
Dominique helped off of a 45, shouldn't have done it. Then Sloan who hasn't
practiced with us helped off and Fredette hit a three. Besides that we were
great defensively and we rebounded.  
We really rebounded the second half. We boxed out. Our guards helped us
rebound. Offensively we were as good as we've been in a long time executing.
We really executed, executed, executed. They went box-and-one on us one
possession; we got a three for Dominique.  
We ran our plays. We got the ball into the post. The guys set good screens and
we finished. Made a few adjustments at half-time to get the ball a little
deeper in the post, and just executed at a high level. I thought Beau made a
good decision not to shoot the ball in the corner, penetrated, and he got the
ball to Dominique who hit two big threes for us like he's done his whole
career, just guarded well.  
So a great win. I'm really, really proud of our guys.  
  
Q. I'll direct this one to you, Josh. How good did it feel to get out there
and hit three three-pointers to start it out and get nine points in that early
11-0 run?  
JOSH CARTER: I felt great. My teammates kept telling me all week to just keep
shooting and it would begin to fall for you, and it was great to be able to
get off to a great start.  
  
Q. Bryan and Joe, could both of you guys talk about their big guys in the
middle and how you had to guard them better in the second half, and both --
just the whole battle inside?  
JOSEPH JONES: Their big guy, Trent Plaisted is a very good player. Coach told
us just do the best job we can. Just try to keep him away from the basket and
just play defense on him. We knew he didn't want our guards to run down and
give up a three-point shot. The game was on the big men. We got four big men,
and we were just going to keep coming at him and just try to do the best job
we could.  
BRYAN DAVIS: He just told us, "Let the bigs beat us, and make sure the guards
stayed out on the perimeter and don't sink in," and that helped to our
advantage today.  
  
Q. Josh, did you feel like you were being guarded the same way today as you
had been like in the Big 12? Like you kept talking about being fronted a lot
this year.  
JOSH CARTER: At the beginning, no. I got three wide open looks. But after I
knocked those three down, they started facing up on me a little bit more. So
early they didn't guard me, then they started guarding me just like everybody
else.  
  
Q. Dominique, could you talk a little bit about your two threes down the
stretch. You hadn't shot a whole lot during the game but you got those.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: At the beginning I really couldn't knock down shots, whatever.
And, you know, my teammates just told me keep shooting it's going to fall for
us, and, you know, just going out there and just believing in it and just
hitting them two threes and it just felt good.  
  
Q. Joseph, you led your team with 12 rebounds. Half the rebounds were about
equal between the teams, but then you guys got a lot more the second half. Did
anything change?  
JOSEPH JONES: Not really changed. We just wanted to start going and get the
ball. We feel like we needed to get some second chance points and just
dominate the boards. That's been one of our goals this whole season, dominate
the boards, box out and just keep rebounding and it did a great job for us.
Once you get them stopped from getting rebounds, you got a good chance of
winning.  
  
Q. Josh, off-and-on year, probably frustrating at times. Does it all feel
better now with this performance?  
JOSH CARTER: It feels good to have a good performance. But, I mean, we didn't
come here to just win one game. We just want to keep it rolling, and whoever
we get tomorrow we're going to play hard, and we just want to keep doing it,
keep winning.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about -- you said you didn't come here to win one
game. If UCLA wins that next game, obviously that's going to be a pretty tough
match-up. You guys played them last year. Can you talk about the team this
year with the addition of Kevin Love, how tough that match-up makes them?  
JOSH CARTER: Well, I've watched him on TV all year and they're great team. I
mean, we're just excited. They have great players. I mean, we'll start doing
scouting on them tomorrow I guess. But I mean, they're going to be hard to
guard, I'm sure, but I mean we're a great team, too, and we're just looking
forward to that match-up if it happens.  
  
Q. Your three-pointer, when you got the pass from Beau, were you expecting
to get the ball in that situation, or were you kind of surprised that he
didn't put it up himself?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Not really. When I passed the ball I thought he was going to
shoot it. But he just made a great move, penetrated. And in the pinch I was
just getting ready, man, like we do in practice all the time. He seen me right
there on the wing, and I was just ready to shoot.  
  
Q. When you guys had that 11-point lead, then they came back, what was it
that kept you guys from folding and sort of letting them taking over the
game?  
JOSH CARTER: I think we pride ourselves on toughness and being poised. We were
able to just fight through it and not get down on ourselves, like we would
have in the past, and we just come together as a team, and we were just able
to battle and keep fighting.  
  
Q. Dominique, some of the games where Josh has gotten hot early, that seems
like it turbocharges you guys. Texas, K-State, some other games. I think, does
it, as much as it seems, when he gets going early, does that jolt the whole
team?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Oh yeah. Well, when we get Josh rolling, it opens up a lot for
us, because they're going to, you know, pay attention to him a lot. Then we
just throw it down inside to Joe or B.D. or one of the big guys and just play
from there.  
  
Q. Dominique, on the defensive end, they're a team that likes to shoot
threes. How conscious were you of that and does it really keep you on your
toes, knowing no matter how far they are they can launch it?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: They're a great shooting team. Coach told us that's why we had
the big guy guarded one-on-one. We just got to stay close to shooters because
they're really a good three-pointer-shooting team. We just got to keep
battling with them. They did a great job shooting, and we just tried to do our
best.  
  
Q. With their big men, they're not very good free-throw shooters. How much
did that -- did you take that into consideration in terms of a defensive game
plan?  
BRYAN DAVIS: We just all wanted to play as solid as we can and make them shoot
overhand every time.  
JOSEPH JONES: We're not trying to foul. Just trying to play tough defense and
make the hard, tough shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Well, thank you, student-
athletes. Good luck on Saturday.  
We'll know open the floor to questions with the head coach.  
  
Q. Mark, do you have an explanation why, was it just the loss of Aci Law, or
why do you think that Josh has been so inconsistent shooting the three this
year?  
COACH TURGEON: That's the majority of it. His role changed. Went from Aci Law
on Joe's team to where he had to become a big-time scorer for us. And I had a
Sweet 16 team at Wichita State, and we lost one player and it changed
everything.  
Being the new coach here, I couldn't, you know, say Aci was that important or
missing. I couldn't make excuses for why guys weren't playing as well, but Aci
made us all better. And, you know, you lose the first-team All-American, it
makes everybody better.  
But Josh doesn't get a lot of open looks. And when he did get them, he rushed
them a little bit. And it helps us when Dominique's hitting threes or Beau
came in and hit threes. As the season wore on, we got Josh more looks. But
most of Josh's threes last year were stand-still. Kind of like Dominique hit
the one late there, now he's got to come off screens to get them. They're not
there. You can't penetrate and pitch to him because they're not going to help
off.  
So it's whole different game for him this year. And he is a much -- believe it
or not, he is a much better player than he was last year. I mean, the floater
in the lane, coming off the screen, I mean, the kid's come a long ways
throughout the season. He's got a long ways to go.  
He was fantastic. He hit his first one. That was big for us.  
  
Q. Coach, when the jump shots started falling early in the game, did you
have a feeling this was going to be one of your stronger offensive efforts
because the jump shot inconsistency has been one of the main problems this
year?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, you know the reason we got jump shots and UCLA won't do
it, or Mississippi Valley State won't do it, is they doubled our post. We got
wide open looks. And we practiced it all week. We knew they were going to do
it, and we were prepared for it and we knocked them down.  
Then it got to be a little tougher to got shots. We didn't score quite as
frequently after that started. But, no, that was nice. But we were still
disappointed that we hadn't established an inside game. I had somebody yell at
me, "Throw it inside."  
I said, "We're trying," you know, at half-time.  
We made a minor adjustment and got the ball a little deeper to our guys and
our post guys finished. But we're an inside out team. That's the way we have
to perform.  
We had 18 assists tonight. It's been hard for us to have assists, 18 assists
on 25 baskets. We're coming. I keep saying we're coming. It's just taking a
long time for us to figure everything out with this team. And we just keep
getting a little bit better in our half-court offense and our execution.  
Our execution down the stretch tonight was phenomenal. I mean, we got the ball
right where we wanted, we made plays, and against a really good defensive
team. I mean, they're only giving up about 38% field-goal percentage for the
year, and we shot 54 on them. We did a nice job tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like this was a match-up where Josh could really get
going and break out a little bit?  
COACH TURGEON: You know, with this team, I never know what's going to happen
in a game. When he hit his first couple, it just happen to be where he was
open, we did a good job of swinging the ball to him, you know, it helped. The
one thing is, and we scouted the heck out of them, we've been working on these
guys for three days. We did a great job of guarding them. They average 74. We
held them to 62 points. I feel like we knew every one of their sets. I got a
million of them.  
And we might not run them because it's just taken me so long to figure this
team out. They might not know all our sets. With that said, we snuck a couple
baskets for Josh they might not have seen. UCLA or Mississippi Valley State is
going to scout us better, see us in person, those might not be there.  
But I thought we were able to get, you know, more open shots now we're out of
the league obviously. They would probably say the same thing. But our game
plan was pretty solid and our guys did a good job defensively with it. But we
snuck out a few shots.  
  
Q. You said earlier that you knew they were going to double the posts. And
sometimes, does that mean they were sort of daring you to beat them with the
three or they were sort of giving that to you?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, they played three big schools this year. They played
Louisville, Michigan State, and Carolina, and they doubled the post every
time. We watch so much film, I can't even tell you. My assistant coaches did
an unbelievable job. I think I watched -- I think I watched about eight games
myself, which is a lot for me.  
So we felt like we knew exactly what they were going to do. And now, when
things weren't going well, we let down, we turned the ball over and let down.
But we had to take away a secondary break-point, or excuse me, transition
points. For the most part, we took care of the ball, we did that.  
The other way to get threes is when they throw the ball to the post. We took
that part of the game away. And then offensive rebounds, I thought in the
second half we limited them to one shot and it took things away.  
But I can't remember what your question was now. I'm so tired.  
  
Q. Were they, like, daring?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, they were daring us. But if I'm on his bench and you look
at us in warm-ups, I am a little nervous, too. You know, we look big and
strong.  
So it's the right game plan. We just happen to make shots tonight. We made
them, and it worked out well and gave us a nice little lead. We knew they were
going to come back.  
  
Q. Mark, all that being said, can you comment specifically on Bryan and
Joe's performances tonight? Bryan had real fluid moves; Joe with strong
rebounds there.  
COACH TURGEON: I thought Bryan was really good defensively. That's a hard
match-up for Bryan Davis, chasing that kid around all night. We got beat a
couple times on dribble penetration, a couple threes. But they were great.  
We challenged them at half-time. We didn't think our bigs were playing very
well. They weren't establishing anything. You know, I thought defensively,
Junior was playing pretty well on placed. But we really challenged them.  
Like I said, we made a minor adjustment to get the ball to them in a better
position and it worked for us.  
Bryan's jump hooks, I mean, boy, looked great. And they had a great week of
practice. Coach Smith told them before the games it was our best week of
practice with post guys, really worked hard. We got an advantage in there, and
we need to try to take advantage of it, and they did.  
But Joe stepped up and made free throws. I thought we did a great job on
Plaisted. He is a hard guard. He is so fast and he jumps into you. We did
hands-back and maybe guarding Michael Beasley a couple times this year, helped
us guard him.  
  
Q. Is this as complete a game or as good an effort as you have seen all
season from this team?  
COACH TURGEON: We've had a lot of good ones. You can always be critical. You
know, I thought we let down, you know, transition defense, and defensively
right before half-time. We made some really silly mistakes right before half-
time.  
But I think the last ten minutes, we were as good as we've been in a while. I
mean, our defensive effort, our transition, our execution, trying to take good
shots, we forced one shot. Josh forced a shot then had a silly foul. But
besides that, you can't think of many things that these kids didn't do right.  
So, you know, on a big-time stage, they stepped up for me and really executed.  
THE MODERATOR: We have to wrap it up right there. Thank you, coach.

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Robin Lopez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18336)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a statement by the coach then open up the
questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach, at your convenience.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you. I thought we got off to a very, very good start
defensively. We knew going into this game, they shot the ball extremely well
from the perimeter, and there were a couple kids on their team we knew we had
to be able to help.  
So it helps to get off to a good start defensively, Cornell, as we all know,
had one heck of a year, undefeated in league, which is really hard to do in
this day and age. And they hadn't lost in 16 games. So it was nice to see our
guys come out and be very aggressive and ready to play, and relaxed.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kenny, can you just talk about the defensive pressure, particularly on
the perimeter in the first half?  
KENNY BROWN: Our defense pressure on them? It was very important for us to
come out and defend. That's what we try to identify with, that's what try to
identify with, that's what Stanford tries to identify with. We know in order
to go far in this tournament, to go anywhere in this tournament, we have to
play defense first.  
  
Q. Trent just mentioned the word relaxed, Robin. You guys definitely looked
relaxed yesterday going into today. Was there definite a sense of calmness
about this team?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: Yeah. There was definitely a sense of calmness. It helps that --
what really helped was the experience last year. I mean, nobody likes to
mention it but that was in the back of our minds. We knew we had to be
mentally prepared for this game. As coach said, they were undefeated in
league, and they're mentally tough, so we're going to have to be mentally
tougher out there.  
  
Q. Robin, curious to get your thoughts on what it does to a team
psychologically when you take away open looks as frequently as you guys did
today?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: Um, I suppose they're just going to have to react on the
defensive end. They did for a little bit. They were playing with a lot of
energy on defense. And I believe that was the -- that's the result of taking
away open looks.  
  
Q. Robin, you definitely seem to come out aggressively, physically, to block
every shot. Was that your intent, just to show you guys obviously have more
talent than they have, just to show how aggressive you could be?  
ROBIN LOPEZ: I believe that was our team's intent. We knew we needed to come
out there and impose our will or else there would have been a good chance for
an upset. Cornell's a very good ball club.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen, for coming out. Good luck on Saturday.  
We'll now open up the floor to questions for Coach Johnson.  
  
Q. What was the plan on dealing with Wittman? I think Fred was on him in the
beginning and you ran a lot of different people at him.  
COACH JOHNSON: Basically, we had to guard him. We use the term "a lot of
help." Normal defensive principals are not going to help on penetration. I
don't want to say it's like how you're going to back to how you defend in
junior high, you face guard a guy all over the floor. He is a very good
player. We're bigger and stronger.  
But the thing that impressed me the most about Cornell is they're basketball
players. They understand how to play. They have a high basketball IQ. But that
was the plan, to make sure we made him work for everything regardless of who
was on him during the course of the game.  
  
Q. You were talking about being relaxed. Were you worried they weren't going
be relaxed in this situation?  
COACH JOHNSON: No. You know, it's interesting, for the most part, we've had
probably as good a day, good of days coming into this tournament in terms of
preparation. This is a group, like I said earlier in the year, that you can
trust. You pretty much get a good feel on what they're thinking, and their
preparation has been very good all year long.  
For me, I go back to, you know, I want to say middle of December when Brook
became eligible. I thought if anybody beat us from that point on, it was going
be because they were a better team that given afternoon, that given night. So
for the most part, I thought they were ready to play and very relaxed, yes.  
  
Q. Robin mentioned the last year was a thought process for them. It was on
their minds. Was last year a big deal, you think, leading into this game?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, you know, again, as much as I try to not deal with the
past and put it behind us, I think regardless of what you as a coach or as a
staff talk about, it bothers them. I mean, they read the papers, they listen
to the news, and they wanted to come out and be extremely aggressive. But also
they're smart enough to understand that Cornell's not Louisville, with all
respect to Cornell. Cornell's not Mississippi State. So this is a different
team. This is a different team we played. It's a more experienced team than we
have, and we understand that.  
  
Q. Trent, was there anything you were unhappy with today, and how valuable
is the rest some of your players got?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I think rest sometimes is overrated, quite frankly. I
thought we played our best basketball in the PAC-10 tournament three games in
three days. Yes, I was very unhappy. I thought the guys that hadn't been
playing a lot had a lot of unforced turnovers and we got away from what we do
from the standpoint of execution offensively and defensively, but that's what
you would expect when kids haven't played that much. From that standpoint,
still it's one-possession game.  
We're trying to get better. We're trying to improve individually and
collectively. So, you know, it's a nice win, but still there are some things
that we could improve on.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Fred and Kenny's play at the point,
especially with Anthony and Mitch in early foul trouble?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, one of the things that we identified as a staff, and I as
a head coach going back into last year a little bit, we didn't do enough job
of putting these guys in position where they could handle the ball and not be
in a turnover situation. We operated a lot out of a one-guard front. Now we're
in a two-guard set a lot of the time.  
So it takes a little of the pressure off when Mitch is not on the floor. Even
when he is on the floor that Fred can handle it, Anthony can handle it. Kenny
can handle ill. Although Kenny was out front still he was a two guard set. And
we've been able to manage. When I say manage I mean we've been able to at
crucial points in games get the ball to the right people at the right time.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask about the rebounding. You know, you won by a big
margin, 47-25 on the boards. How did you feel that the effort -- how hard did
you feel people were getting after it today?  
COACH JOHNSON: Our effort was really good. Our effort has been really good
probably the last month. And again this is a group -- they're going to
compete, they're going to play hard. Sometimes, because we have size and we're
not rebounding well, it's because we're getting outquicked to the ball and
other teams may have better athletes. For the most part today we were very
aggressive ,but we got a quickness advantage to the ball at times.  
  
Q. You are just done with this one, but do you got any sense on what
Marquette, what the match-up is like there? They got three small guards ,they
spread out I guess a little bit. Any thoughts on Marquette?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah. Everything's at the rim. We're going to have to limit
transition baskets. We got our work cut out for us. They want to play fast.
They want to pull out of pressure. It's going to be interesting. It's going to
be very interesting. Dominic James is special, O'Neal is special, Matthews is
special. But it's pretty much what we've seen all year. I liken them a lot to
USC's explosiveness. Of course, UCLA, they're explosive in their own right. So
we got a day and a half to try to inject some speed in some of our guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.
Good luck on Saturday.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you.

## March 20, 2008

  

### [Ramel Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16431)

### [Joe Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16439)

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up with a two-minute statement from Coach Gillispie,
then open up the floor to questions for the student-athletes first, then
question for the coach.  
Coach, go ahead.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I have to go for two minutes?  
THE MODERATOR: You don't. (Laughing).  
COACH GILLISPIE: All right. It was a tough loss for us. We came here with the
intent on winning, just like everyone else does. We came here to win this game
and try to move on and win the next one and try to cut down nets. That's what
we came here for. These guys to my left, that's the only thing they believe in
and that's the only way they've approached things.  
And I'm really proud of our team. I'm not excited about losing today because
that's not what we're all about, but our team never gives up. They never give
in. They've had to overcome so many things. They never whined about any of
those things. Just great effort all season long and I'm really, really, really
proud, even though today's result was not what we wanted.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up the floor to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. When you fouled-out, your opponent, Dominic Jones, came over to the bench
to talk to you. Can you tell us what the conversation was like?  
JOE CRAWFORD: It was just short. He just told me, you know, good game, keep my
head up.  
  
Q. Did you appreciate that?  
JOE CRAWFORD: Yeah.  
  
Q. Ramel, you picked up your fourth foul pretty early in that second half.
How difficult was it playing the rest of the game, as far as aggressiveness,
after picking up that fourth foul?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't think it was really difficult. I just had to watch out
and not foul again so I wouldn't foul out of the game.  
But they were doing a lot of driving the basketball, so I just had to be
careful.  
  
Q. This question's for Joe. Joe, can you just talk about your emotions. I
mean, 35 points, terrific game, but your last game of your college career. Can
you just talk about your emotions?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, you know, I came here to win. So, you know, that's what
I wanted to do. So, I mean, I'm just kind of sad right now because, you know,
I feel like, you know, we had a good chance and, you know, I'm just kind of
down right now. But, you know, overall, I'm proud of what we did as a team
through the season.  
  
Q. Could you tell us what you thought of Joe's game today and the way he
attacked offensively, especially?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I thought Joe played unbelievable for us. I mean, he kept
us in the game. I thought he made shots sometimes I didn't think was going to
go in and it still went in. I think he gave it his all. Unfortunately, we just
couldn't get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Ramel, I think they only had seven turnovers. I mean, they're really good
guard plays. How big of a key was that that you guys weren't able to turn them
over any more than you did?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I think that was key. They rely on their guards and their
guards did a good job getting the basket, and we just have to give those guys
a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen.  
Now, open up the floor to questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Billy, can you just talk about Joe's game. I mean how incredible he was.
Just seemed like for stretches there he just put the team on his back.  
COACH GILLISPIE: He's done that ever since Patrick went down, he and Ramel
both. But the numbers looked like that, I think they had 54 points today, is
that right, 54 out of 66, which is not good for our team. But whatever it
takes for those guys to give, give their team a chance to win, that's what
they've done, even before Patrick went out.  
Those guys, I was around probably the most clutch player in college basketball
last year, and this year, I think I was around as clutch a player as I've ever
been around. We had at times two. And those guys from the time conference
started, they were so clutch, it was amazing. They made so many big plays
offensively, defensively, rebounding-wise. And that on top of leading our team
on the court, off the court, having unbelievable amounts of responsibility,
and never wavering from -- they never ran from the responsibility. They
accepted it. And I really believe they really enjoyed it, and they fostered so
many other guys.  
Like I was saying before, every single time something happened, all eyes came
on Joe and Ramel. And we have a bunch of young guys; those are the only two
seniors. We don't have any Juniors. Every single time something happened, and
there was a lot of things happening, Patrick going out, Jodie in and out,
those kinds of things, that's not anything he could control, Derrick in and
out and whatever, but all eyes from those players were always focused on Joe
and Ramel. And they saw strength.  
It's hard to be the measure of strength that they were on a daily basis, as
strong as they were. And, you know, because as your leaders go, you go. And
when you look at those guys, if they have bad body language or a bad day, they
can't have one-tenth of a bad attitude for that day in our situation,
especially the way we started out the year.  
And those guys were unbelievable as far as showing a great measure of
strength. Every time someone looked at them, body language, facial expression,
any word that came out of their mouth, I've never seen anybody be able to do
as much on the court, you know, in practice and those kind of things, off the
court. Then when the game time started, they were fantastic.  
The thing about it is, everyone knew that they were going to have to play like
that for us to win. And nobody did anything -- they couldn't do anything about
it. And that's great coaches and great teams in our conference, and just like
today, it's very, very good team that has a chance to definitely move and play
for a long time if they make some shots.  
It's Final Four possible teams because of their quickness and depth, and they
knew who had to score for us. And those guys still got 54 points. So that
makes it even more amazing.  
You hate to see those guys walking out of here for the last time. They've made
a definite mark on Kentucky basketball, which is the best tradition in the
history of the sport. And they've -- I'm so proud not to see them going out
with a loss because I definitely thought we could win it all. I know that
sounds crazy, but that's the way we thought. That's the way they thought.
That's the way our whole team thought, because we became such a strong
believing group, we thought we could do anything no matter what the
circumstances.  
You hate to see them walking out, but you are really happy you know they're
walking out with a great foundation that's going to give them a chance to be
basketball players, which is what they want to do. And they're going to do it
with a degree in their hand. And they're going to walk out of here and they're
going to have a fantastic life.  
So this is only a start. It's an ending for today and for our season, but it's
start for our program and it's great start for those young mens' careers.  
  
Q. Coach, was this first season at Kentucky what you expected?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It was better than I expected. It was fantastic. I mean, as
far as wins and losses, no. I thought we would win more games. But if you
would have said that, You are going to have over 40 games missed by a really,
really, really, really good players, I would have said, How in the world are
we going to make it in the tournament?  
And, you know, but the thing about it is, the way you do that is, Kentucky has
every single thing that you need to win national championships. It's been
proven over time. And they've won a lot of them, and, hopefully, we'll win
some more. You have great fans, unbelievable fans. The fans helped us win
eight games at home in conference. I've not seen a greater effort from a group
of fans to be able to help you as much as they helped us when they definitely
knew that we needed the help.  
You have a great administration that understands the importance that it has
not only on the school and to the players, but to an entire state and to, I
mean, the big blue nation. And it means everything to them. And they're going
to give you a chance as a coach to do whatever it takes within the rules to
attain the greatest level of success.  
So for me, I'm a basketball person 24 hours a day. I love it. I couldn't --
there's never a place that you could ever see that, in my opinion, that I
could ever have any greater feeling for, because no matter what the situation
was, even though we weren't playing well, our fans were awesome to me. And
they were awesome to these players. Say, well, we had a tough spell, but we're
going to get them. I've never seen anything like it in my life.  
That's no disrespect to anywhere else I've been. I mean, it's just you are a
special person if you are associated with Kentucky basketball, you are a
special -- if you are a player at Kentucky, you are the most special person in
the world. And they're going to give you the benefit of the doubt over and
over and over and over. So for a basketball nut like myself, I don't think it
could get any better?  
  
Q. Billy, how much did Ramon getting in foul trouble hurt you?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It hurt us because, you know, they're really talented at the
guard spot. They're really hard to guard off the dribble. But I didn't think
we guarded as well as we needed to off the ball. I thought -- they're very
difficult to guard because they can -- they have very, very good skill with
the ball, great quickness and great athleticism. I didn't think -- once they
got past our first defender, we came over and helped. So it meant quite a bit.  
But I thought Mike Porter played great. I thought -- he was great on Saturday.
I thought he's been really good down the stretch for us. I thought he played
really well for us today.  
So, I mean, it's just one thing after another, you know. It's the way the game
goes. We were in pretty good foul trouble over the entire game. Joe was in
foul trouble. We managed to get through the first half with that. But we just
had to kind of work through that a little bit. But we like to have Ramon out
there. He's been a great player for us. And he is a very determined player.
And he's never satisfied, and it's been great to see his growth along with all
the other players.  
But, you know, I thought that Mike gave us some minutes that were really good
today.  
  
Q. Obviously, you have missed Patrick the whole time he's been out. Do you
feel like you missed him even more today considering you really could have
used another option besides Ramel and Joe offensively?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I think, and I thought this would happen, not saying that I
know anything about anything, but I thought the longer we played, the more we
would probably miss Patrick. I'm very, very proud of Perry, and I'm very proud
of all the guys that we had. But the longer you play, the more tape that you
present, and those kind of things, I think that it definitely makes a
difference.  
And, you know, we're asking Derrick Jasper to play out of position. We're
asking Perry to be a low-post presence at 199 pounds and those kind of things.
Our roster is not nearly as complete as it needs to be as far as to be able to
do much flexibility-wise.  
But I thought that, you know, in the Georgia game, even I thought that it
really started to show the definite benefit of having Patrick in there. I
mean, any team would benefit from having him. He is an All-American-type
player, in my opinion, in the future, hated to not have him. I thought it
would probably get worse as we went along and it probably played out like
that.  
But I was proud of the guys we had out there. They tried their hardest. They
played a very, very good team and had a chance to win. Just didn't make enough
plays at the time we needed to to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we'll conclude the interview.  
Thank you, coach.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. For all three of you, when you happened to look at who was going to be in
Anaheim, did you happen to notice Kentucky was here and just kind of slap your
forehead and go, "Oh, our old coach is going to be in the same town"?   
JOSEPH JONES: Yeah. Yeah. That's something that came up. I've been watching
the show. We also seen they haven't called that name yet, and they haven't
called that name, so we thinking we might get messed up with something the
media might want to do. But the next day we were kind of surprised to see them
here with us.  
THE MODERATOR: Dominic or Beau, do you guys want to comment on that.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Just like Joe said, we were surprised, you know, they picked
the same, you know, place to play at and everything. We thought it was going
to be get messed up. I thought they were going to select there, but they
didn't. But we are at the same place though.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about how Donald has handled everything that
happened this week and kind of what you guys have done to kind of help him
through this?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think he handled it great. You know, even though -- I mean,
even though it hurts to lose a loved one like that, you know, we went out
there and supported him. And it just -- we just have to be strong for him. I
know he's going go out there and play his best. So we just are out there being
strong for him, and I think he handled it real good.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys. I'd like all three of you all to respond to
this. When you all hit the court tomorrow night, you three guys are going to
play in your third tournament, you'll be representing what has been the best
three-year run in A &M basketball history. I was wondering, you're seniors,
what does that mean to you all, how far the program has come your entire time
in Aggieland?   
THE MODERATOR: Beau, why don't you take that first.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: First off, it's a blessing to be here. I know everybody's happy
to be here, and it's been a good ride. It's not over yet. We still have to
play tomorrow night, but just going to go out there and give it our all.
That's all we'll do, and just compete. And we compete on a daily basis and
just bring our best effort tomorrow.  
JOSEPH JONES: Just like Beau said, it's been a great ride. It's not over. Just
being here the past few years has showed you how the program's on the upward
bound and how the program's starting to become a nationally recognized
basketball program, so it feels good. It feels great, actually, to be here all
three years. So we're just going to come out and put forth a great effort
tomorrow and try to come up with a W.  
  
Q. Direct this towards Beau. This is kind of unique for you to be up there
and, you know, been talking to everybody and I just want to talk to you a
little bit about -- or have you talk a little bit about what it was like going
from being on the scout team last year and this kind of situation to where you
are now going to probably play a vital role off the bench in the NCAA
tournament?  
BEAU MUHLBACH: My whole deal is this is just a dream come true. You know, I'm
the type of player where I'll do anything for the team to win. If it is to be
on the scout team, just getting my teammates prepared, then that's fine with
me. Deep down inside, I just want to win. And these guys want to continue win,
too.  
And like I said, it's a dream come true that I'm starting to play just a
little bit more now and just got to embrace it and be there for my teammates,
whatever they need me to do to help win.  
  
Q. Joe, can you talk about the last couple of days you guys go to Dallas,
you're there for Donald, you have a hard time getting out of Dallas, you get
in here late last night, and finally being able to be here. Can you talk about
what that experience was like?  
JOSEPH JONES: We wanted to go to Dallas and show our support for Sloan. It was
a terrible loss for him. We wanted to go up there and show our support and be
strong for him and let him know we're there for him, anything he needs. Like
you said, traveling-wise, things like that happen. We got to let it go and
just come out and perform tomorrow night.  
Coach said this morning, we came here to have fun, but last night wasn't that
fun, sitting on the plane that long. But you got to forget about it. You got
to come ready to play tomorrow and give it our best effort.  
  
Q. What do you think the run last year did in terms of changing the
perception of your program nationally, the run in the tournament?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think it was a great run for us. We went out there and we
competed, you know, the first two rounds and even the Memphis game we competed
real hard. Just real great for the program.  
I think it's just going to get better by, you know, the years going by. And I
think we're just going to have to continue to just play hard, continue to
compete this year. Hopefully we can get back there.  
BEAU MUHLBACH: In addition to that, I just think that it goes show to that we
can compete with other people on this level. Even with the elite teams, that
we can just -- we can fight till the bitter end to get a W. And it's just, you
know, what this program's about, just toughness and playing hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Could you give us, Dominique, could you give us a scouting report on your
opponent, what you have noticed about them. Same with you, Beau.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Well, we went over some yesterday and today, and we know that
they got a great team. They got a team that can really spread the floor. They
really play, like, four out, one in. We know they got some guys that can
really shoot the ball, and they got a big man that can really pass it. So
we're just going to have to play team defense, go out there and try to compete
with them.  
And we know they got a great coach over there and a great team and we got to
go out there and play.  
  
Q. Does BYU remind you of any team you've seen this season that you've
'played?  
JOSEPH JONES: I really don't think we've seen a team this season that can
shoot the ball as well as BYU can. They got -- it's basically like a four-
guard offense around one. So we really haven't matched up with any teams this
year that had that kind of offense and the offense capability as them.  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: Just like Joe said, I really don't think we faced a team like
that, that can have four people out there that can really shoot the ball and
have a big guy that can pass the ball like that. I think the closest team is,
like, Nebraska that we played against, that really has four guys that can
spread the floor out and have a big main side.  
Other than that, BYU is a team that we really haven't seen.  
  
Q. Dominique, with the run you guys had in Kansas City, two wins and you go
toe to toe with Kansas, are you guys in a pretty good frame of mind right
now?  
DOMINIQUE KIRK: I think we started to build confidence as a team. I think we
-- I think we learned how to start to compete a lot better now, and I think we
just have to continue to do that. You know, as far as the play against a team
like BYU, we just got to go out there and just give it our all. Give it our
best, and hopefully it will take care of itself.  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we're going to release the student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
We'll open up with a statement from the coach, then open up the floor to
questions.  
Coach, whenever you're ready.  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously excited to be here. You know, pleased with the way we
finished in the Big 12 tournament, down the stretch in the league, then in the
league we played well. So we're looking forward to this. We know we got a
tough draw in BYU. But, you know, if you look around, all the brackets
everybody's got a tough draw.  
So we're looking forward to it and we know we got a very skilled, very smart,
very intelligent, very tough team that we're getting ready to play tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about what Beau's brought to you guys
this last five, six games? And what kind of person he is to come from, like,
just practically playing on the scout team most of the time to doing what he's
doing now?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, obviously very proud of him. We gave him chances earlier
in the year, and he didn't do quite as well. And we have been looking for
someone to step up for us. And, you know, we opened up practice, opened up all
the starting spots after we lost at home to Nebraska, and we took advantage of
it, and he's played well in the games.  
Beau's always been a really good practice player, but hasn't performed as well
in the games. And recently, he's performed well. I think what he gives us is
we're a much better defensive team, team defense, individual defense. When he
is on guys, he's got some strength. And then he gives us versatility, which we
didn't have. I mean, we can go big, you know, with him at the three. We can go
small with him at the four. So it will help us against a team like BYU that
can really stretch you at the four position.  
So it's been a pleasant surprise. He's made some open shots for us, too,
which, as you know, we're always looking for that. So it's -- he's been good.
I'm really proud of him, the way he's handled it. I just want him to stay
within himself, not try to do more than he's capable of doing, and continue to
play with the toughness that he's played with.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last couple of days, Coach. You know, you go to
Dallas for Donald, you have the trouble getting here, you finally get here
late last night, and now, finally being here and getting ready to workout?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, yesterday was a tough day. We were hoping for a Friday
game, but it didn't work out that way. But, you know what, mother nature had a
little bit to do with it and you can't control that. The charter, I thought,
was way too late, but it happened. We got in late. We let the kids sleep in.
You just -- players are resilient. It's the greatest time of their life.
They'll be ready to go.  
Yesterday was a tough day. Then just being -- you know, Sloan's mom's funeral
was tough, you know, to see your teammate in pain like that, or one of your
players in pain, it was difficult. But I'm glad we did it that way.  
Inconvenienced a lot of people. We had to ship our families and everybody up
to Dallas to catch the charter, but it was worth it. And so, you know, we got
a good night's sleep and we're excited. They'll sleep well tonight and be
ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think it was a complete accident that Kentucky ended up in
Anaheim? And did you, at least, slap your head and have a little bit of a
smirk that they were here, and that Coach Gillispie was here, too?  
COACH TURGEON: I didn't really think about it till I was going to this coach's
meeting today, and I said, "Billy's going to be here."  
But I really thought, and they say they don't do it, but I really thought we
were going to be playing Kentucky. Originally in an 8-9 game, then they lost
to Georgia, so I thought, well, maybe we moved up to 7, and they were going to
put us in a 7-10 game. I was hoping they wouldn't do that to the kids, the
players, and to Coach Gillispie. But, no, it's -- you know, I've heard a lot
of good things about him since I've been there. It's tough shoes for me to
fill.  
The guy was real successful in College Station. But I don't think it's that
big of a deal because we won't see them play. They're in the early game, we're
in the afternoon game, and it's big city, so won't see him a lot.  
  
Q. Following up on the big shoes to fill, if you could talk about what it
takes to sustain success at a program that hasn't always had, you know, great
basketball tradition and what's that been like for you?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, we won 24 games this year. I think it's the third most in
our history, maybe tied third most. And we spoiled them quick in College
Station. You know, I think at times they thought they picked me up off the
street, you know, to coach this team. Personally, it's been tough, but we've
overcome it. The kids have bought into me. We're starting to play at the level
I thought we could play at. And, you know, we have a lot of limitations as a
team, but we're overcoming them.  
With that said, we got to recruit well. We got to continue to recruit well.
Had a lot of national TV games this year, which is good for our program. We're
back in the NCAA tournament three years in a row. We'll see what happens in
this tournament, but that's important.  
But for us to sustain it, we got to continue to recruit in-state well, and
continue to get good players. And this year was tougher because our league was
so darn good. Our league was better than it's been in three or four years.  
But it's all about recruiting and getting players to sustain it. But getting
into this tournament really helps, really had helped.  
  
Q. Mark, do you think all the things that have happened over the past week
in a kind of weird sort of way can serve as a rallying point and serve to make
your team better?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, our guys are better when their backs are against the
wall. You know, we lose three in a row, backs against the wall, we play well.
Lose three in a row again, we play pretty well. We had to win at Baylor, had
to to get in the NCAA tournament, we did. We had to perform well in Kansas
City to get in the NCAA tournament, we did. And now the guys don't want their
season to end.  
You know, I expect us to be pretty good tomorrow. Whether it's good enough to
win, we'll see. We're playing a heck of a team. But I think we've come
together. You know, I think we had some guys step up in Kansas City, whether
it was Beau or Chinemelu Elonu step up, and it kind of brings your team closer
together. Then to go through what we went through yesterday, you know, that's
tough. That's tough.  
And I know that the relationship with our players and Sloan have changed, and
my relationship with Sloan's changed. I feel closer to Sloan than I've ever
felt because of what he's gone through and I think he's had to lean on us
during this time.  
So, yeah, I do think we're closer. Is it going -- you know, I don't know how
much it affects us, but, you know, I know when we were sitting there
yesterday, and I was sitting behind the players, I know a lot of those guys
were thinking about their moms, and feeling lucky they still had theirs -- and
most of them. But I think its bringing them closer together. Then to see Sloan
smiling today for the first time, I mean, he seems to be back.  
Has it brought us closer together? I think it has. Is it going to be the
difference-maker in this tournament? I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. But I
do expect us to play well.  
  
Q. Coach, where in particular do you think you guys need to be really good
tomorrow?  
COACH TURGEON: Transition defense and guarding the three-point line is
everything. I think defensively they're fast and great passers, and they
really stretch you, one through four. Then the sub, you know, sub-shooters.
Those are the two things.  
Then Cummard, you know, just does so many little things. You know, how we
handle him is going be a big part of it. Keep him off the offensive glass,
make him shoot jump shots overhand, just being aware of him. Making it hard
for him to be a great passer, which he is. He just does so many little things.
I think that's important.  
Then, you know, we have a lot of big guys, and how we do on Plaisted is real
important. We're going to throw a lot of bodies at him and, you know, see how
he handles it. Those two in particular. Of course, Tavernari, big time
shooter, that's hard for us. If this game would have been played, you know, in
January, we wouldn't have won this game.  
But we've had to adjust, get use to quicker, shorter teams that shoot the ball
well. We've become much better at that over the last two months. Now, whether
we'll be good enough tomorrow, we'll see. But guarding the three, transition
defense, and handling those two guys that I talked about, you know, earlier,
is, I think, the key. We got to make shots. I mean, it's hard for us to score.
I mean, I don't have to hide that from anybody. We scored 71 against KU, felt
like 200 for me. So we got to make some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess from your days at Wichita State to now, and the conference
play, what kind of an advantage is that to compete against the Kansases and
Texases and do your players maybe not buy into a Mountain West Conference
opponent sometimes with that?  
COACH TURGEON: No, they're buying into this team because we know how good --
we can show them film of beating Louisville, taking Carolina to the wire, and
Michigan State to the wire. So they're buying into this team, but -- and
they're favored. I mean, they're an eighth seed and we're a nine seed. So
we're going to be wearing the dark uniforms, they'll be wearing the white
ones, and so our guys will be dialed in.  
You know, you just -- you can't take anybody for granted. I just think those
numbers in front of people -- I mean, you look at Notre Dame, I think they're
a five seed. They got George Mason. I mean, they just got to be thinking, what
the heck. I mean, we had a heck of a year and did a great job in the Big East,
and they get George Mason. I mean, there's just no easy games at this time of
year.  
You know, I've watched BYU enough to know that if they would have played in
the Big 12, they would still have been an NCAA tournament team. They got
enough good players, enough maturity, and they got all kinds of skill, and
they got a toughness about them that they'd still be in it. So our guys will
be really dialed in had tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you very much, Coach.  
Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Kevin Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18266)

### [Josh Shipp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17143)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We can open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. Kevin and Josh, first of all I'd like for you to talk about the condition
of your back. How much do you think it will limit your -- if you think it will
limit you at all? And how you guys feel about being such a big favorite in
this contest?  
KEVIN LOVE: Well, to address your first question, my back is fine. We're
actually in practices yesterday with, you know, Josh right here and Russell,
we were actually having a dunk competition yesterday. So my back is fine. It's
not going to limit me at all. I got good work with my trainers and everybody
else who is helping me stretch out, you know, get it iced, get it rubbed down
and doing electric stim and things like that on it. So my back will be 100%
come game time.  
To address your second question, being such a heavily favorite team, and we
know that 16 seed has never beaten a 1 seed, and they're 0-92 against the one
seeds, we're just going to take it like any other game. They're guys are going
to come out and know we got that bull's eye on our chest, knowing that we are
UCLA, and we're just going to go out there and fight.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys have been in some blowout wins this season, 30-something
almost, one game, 40 points. When you are in those kind of games, you know,
what's your mentality in terms of keeping your minds in it, what you are
working on in the game. What can you benefit from when you are in that type of
situation?  
KEVIN LOVE: Um, you know, I can just say probably looking at the bigger
picture. We know we have a bigger goal in mind. And, you know, if you take a
playoff, anything can happen. You can get hurt and you just got to keep
playing as hard as you possibly can when that stuff happens. We might get a
chance to rest, you know, for the next game, which is going to be crucial
coming down the stretch here. Because you saw that in the PAC-10's, as well,
PAC-10 tourney, and when that happens, we just have to keep our mind focused
on, you know, what we want to accomplish.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys have been setting your sights on some big goals here this
year, including a national championship. Is there a line you have to guard
against between being almost overly ambitious and not focusing on the
immediate task at hand?  
JOSH SHIPP: I think our mindset is simple. It's been the same thing for the
past few years, since I've been here, we just focus on the next game at hand.
We do set goals at the beginning of the year, but we do them in sort of
stages. First was the PAC-10, and then the PAC-10 tournament, and we
accomplished those. Now, we're trying to get the third goal, to win the
national championship. The main thing is just to take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Josh, you've been in a couple of these kind of, looked like, mismatches
on paper before in the first round. What kind of things does Coach Howland say
to try to keep you guys from being overconfident or keep you focused on the
task at hand?  
JOSH SHIPP: He just makes it a big point of emphasis that anybody can lose on
any given night. I mean, if we don't come out and play, we could easily go
home. For us, when the guys hear that, hopefully it keeps them focused and
hopefully we're fortunate enough to win this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Josh, you've been here before, so you know what the big lights and the
bright lights are on this particular level. What information or what advice
can you give to your teammates, such as Kevin even though he's PAC-10 player-
of-the-year, that will help him get through all of this?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, we've had a couple of tournament like-games this year, a
lot of close battles. So, I mean, those guys, they have that experience. They
know how to play in those games. I mean, Kevin, he's very mature for his age.
I mean, we're not worried about him. We know he's going to come and play and
bring it every game.  
  
Q. Kevin, could I ask you, even though you are new to this stage, as Josh
just said, can you talk about what you feel March Madness has become? Is it
something that's sort of like the whole nation focuses on a little bit even if
they're not sports fans?  
KEVIN LOVE: I think so. Especially because, you know, this is when it really
starts to get fun and you see the upsets, you see, you know, different teams,
you know, bubble teams getting in, certain things like that. You see the
George Masons getting to the Final Four. So it makes it real fun.  
But also you get Cinderella stories, everything like that. I think everybody
does focus on March, and they have good reason to just because of those facts
alone, and we're hoping to make a run of our own.  
  
Q. Does it transcend sports fans. Do you have people who maybe don't follow
the sport, who suddenly when March comes --  
KEVIN LOVE: I think so. It's funny, everybody is filling out the brackets,
even the people that only pick the mascot in the next game for the bracket. So
it's kind of fun.  
  
Q. You guys often talk about your defense is kind of the key to winning. Can
I get each of you to describe your half-court offense and how you guys each
feel about that?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, we feel good about it. I mean, it's stagnant at times.
Sometimes we have our problems. But, I mean, like you said, our defense is the
main thing. As long as we're playing that hard D, we have a chance to win on
any given night.  
KEVIN LOVE: I feel the same way. You know, if our D's on top of our game, our
offense is going to come. Even if we're struggling a little bit, and we're
kind of getting short in there and it's tight inside, our defense will
helpfully pick us up. Our high court offense, we have to be able to hit the
three-point shots, spread a little stuff out for me inside so they can't
double- and triple-team. And I got to find cutters, you know, find Josh on the
weak side, and Darren on the weak side.  
Darren is on top of his game right now. So we're hoping after that PAC-10
tourney, he'll come steam rolling into the NCAA tournament as well.  
  
Q. Josh, after the last two post-seasons and two Final Four runs, is it
almost to the point that if you don't win a national championship, this season
will be something of a disappointment?  
JOSH SHIPP: I mean, it's tough to say it will be a total disappointment. I
mean, we've had a great run so far. Like I said, we do have another goal that
we want to accomplish, and it would be a great season if we do accomplish that
goal.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys have been down here, you particularly have been down here,
playing in the Wooden Classic. When you come here, does it -- is there an
extra comfort level that maybe you don't have in another arena where you sort
of know the lay of the land, you know the shooting background, just everything
that might trip you up in another place, you don't have that here?  
JOSH SHIPP: Just being so close to home is definitely a huge advantage. Have
your friends and family be able to come down and watch you play, that's
definitely big. Like you said, we played in this gym before. It's not a new
court to us, so that should definitely help us out, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Kevin, you want to discuss that or talk about that, just
playing here?  
KEVIN LOVE: I mean, we've only played here for one game, but, you know, we got
a win here, and also, like you said, we played down here for the Wooden
Classic. But this is only my first year at the NCAA tournament. I'm just
trying to look up to Lorenzo and all the upper-classmen that have been here
just to learn stuff from them.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how much you guys feel a sense of responsibility because
you play for UCLA to do things like win national championships, or is that
ancient history?  
KEVIN LOVE: No, I think we got to, you know, make the people that have came
before us very proud. And Mr. Alcindor, Mr. Walton, all the way back to Mr.
Hazzard, they won those national championships, Coach John R. Wooden, the
greatest coach in basketball history, we're trying to make those guys proud.
We wear that UCLA symbol across our chest, you know. We got the -- seeing gold
for the Hundred National Championships. We're just trying to hang another
banner up there and go for number 12.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions. Seeing none, we'll excuse the student-
athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow. We'll open up were a statement from
Coach Howland, then open the floor up to questions.  
Coach, as soon as you're ready.  
COACH HOWLAND: Happy to be here. Looking forward to playing tomorrow. Excited
that we fulfilled our goals in the regular season, which was to win our
conference, win our conference tournament, and, therefore, play as close to
home as possible in the NCAA tournament.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Ben, can you just give us an update on Luc. How he's looking?  
COACH HOWLAND: In practice today -- he did some shooting, but today he went
through a full practice. We only went for about an hour. We probably did
contact for about 15 minutes, and then a number of other things, five-on-zero
at full speed. And, you know, it still causes him some pain, to cut on it in a
certain way.  
But he'll start tomorrow. And he'll battle through, you know, the pain, and I
think it helps him to play tomorrow to get ready if we're fortunate enough to
win for a Saturday match-up.  
  
Q. Just wondering, in the course of just normal preparation, is it a little
tough tracking down, like, video on a Mississippi Valley State?  
COACH HOWLAND: We're one of the few schools in the country that I'm aware of
that does such a good job of archiving games throughout the year. So I have an
administrative assistant, Doug Erickson, along with our video coordinator,
Clay McKnight, but primarily Doug Erickson, and one of our managers that works
recording every game in the country that's on television throughout the entire
year. So we have over 1200 games when that tournament comes out on Sunday.  
We had three games on Mississippi Valley State because that's how many times
they played on TV on some satellite we were able to pick up. We had 11 on BYU
and 27 on Texas A&M.  
And so we're able to go to work right away as soon as 4:00 rolls around and
get our assistants going, and that makes a big difference. We have since sent
out and received more video on Mississippi Valley State. So we have about six
films on them now, which is, you know, about normal in preparation for a game
as we get ready.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their bigs, specifically Larry Cox and what you think
of them?  
COACH HOWLAND: I think Cox is really a good player. He's long. He's athletic.
He's got a very good jump hook. You know, he can face up and shoot at 17 feet.  
I like Speech. He's a very good shooter. He started, as well as coming off the
bench.  
Lucas is an outstanding player.  
Watson is very long and athletic.  
Clark can play.  
They have a lot of good players. And their two-point guards are very good,
Harmason and Davis. Davis is a young man originally from Los Angeles, very
quick, handles the ball well. So they're a team that, you know, out of this
SWAC conference, typically most of those teams have to play a murderous non-
conference schedule to earn revenue for their school.  
They probably play seven or eight guarantee games all against power
conferences, which is brutal. But when they got into their conference, then
they start to gain some confidence. They were 12-6. They finished in second in
their league, won their conference tournament. They're a team that's a veteran
team that primarily plays juniors and seniors for the majority of their
minutes.  
So we understand that we're going to have to play well to be successful
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Ben, you've had such great tournament runs last couple years and you
mentioned you've accomplished your regular-season goals. The post-season goal,
I am assuming, is a national title. Do you have any concern level at all that
if you don't reach that ultimate goal, that some people in the program are
going to be a little disappointed with this season?  
COACH HOWLAND: What people and what program?  
  
Q. Well, whether it be your own players or even boosters, alumni?  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, of course we'd be disappointed if we don't win out. I
mean, but I think there's a lot of teams that feel that way.  
I mean, there's a lot of teams that enter this tournament, and I think that
there realistically is probably as many as a dozen teams that would have a
good shot of winning this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right seeing none, we'll thank Coach
Howland.  
COACH HOWLAND: Really? Is that all there is? I walked all the way down here
for four or five questions.  
  
Q. At Pittsburgh and NAU, I think you went to Utah, how much of it is an
advantage, like today. You were able to practice at Pauley, you know, 24 hours
before the NCAA tournament. How much of an advantage is that instead of
getting on a plane, getting into a hotel, finding a place to practice?  
COACH HOWLAND: No question it's an advantage to play close to home, also for
us, the fact that we're in finals right now, we had to move finals up. We are
actually in finals week. We had players that are still studying for finals. We
have a couple, you know, still taking finals tomorrow on the road or, excuse
me, Friday, being proctored. We're -- or back at school depending on our win
or a loss.  
But there's no question that being closer to home is an advantage for us to
not have to get on another plane at this time, and we earned that, though. We
understood that that was a goal of ours, was to be able to stay close to home
by winning the conference and then ultimately winning the conference
tournament.  
  
Q. Did you even speak about it in terms of more so than a one or two seed,
it was just staying in Anaheim?  
COACH HOWLAND: For me the most important thing, regardless of our seed, was
going to be to be kept in the west. Now, my understanding is that you're only
protected in that respect in the first or second line. So unless you are a one
or two seed, you could be sent out of the area. But that's why it was
important to be at least a two seed.  
  
Q. This team won some games early in the season by 30 or more points. When
you are in that kind of situation during a game, what is it that you look to
accomplish or maybe set yourself up for for the next game, whether it's
getting some guys rest or what can you make in those situations that will help
you down the road?  
COACH HOWLAND: Boy, I just hope we have another game like that, that would be
great.  
We did have a game like that against Cal last Thursday in the first round of
the PAC-10 tournament. We were up 30, and that actually afforded us to get
some rest for the guys for the next game the next day. But that's a good
problem. I can't even imagine thinking that way right now.  
  
Q. How much time do your assistants -- I know you already, when you get the
first and second round match-ups or potential match-ups, assign assistant
coaches to those other teams. How well do you know BYU and Texas A &M at this
point and how much time --   
COACH HOWLAND: Pretty good. There's probably four or five films watching each
of the opponents in the second round. If we get past the first, then obviously
we'll watch more including tomorrow's game, which will be the most recent game
they've played to be able to study.  
So we try to do a good job in that way.  
Thanks. Appreciate it.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Taj Finger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18249)

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Mitch Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18248)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get, Mitch, your impressions of Cornell's three-point
shooting ability and what you feel Stanford has to do to try to limit those
open looks?  
MITCH JOHNSON: From the film we've watched, definitely very good shooting
team. I think we watched some of the game film against Duke, and they
definitely didn't look very intimidated at all and played very aggressively
and seemed like they do a lot of good things to get their perimeter open for
three-point opportunities. I think they shoot over 40% on the year. So that
will definitely be something we'll focus on going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. And if you could extend that also to Wittman, in particular, and how he
gets his open looks and what Stanford has to do against him?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think they do a good job of floor spacing. I think he does a
very good job, too, of, especially early on in the play, kind of getting his
feet ready. He catches and shoots pretty quick. I think we'll just have to do
a good job of staying with him and not really getting lost in transition and
giving up some three-point shots in transition.  
  
Q. This is for both players. How are you guys handling this? You know, you
guys are expected to win now. It's different for you guys. I mean, how are you
guys handling this as the favorite?  
TAJ FINGER: You know, basically just like any other game. We know that
Cornell's a tough team. Obviously, they won the Ivy League. Anybody can beat
anybody on any given night if you are not going to play 100% and play real
hard. So everyone's real focused and we're just going to play really hard no
matter who we play.  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think, like Taj said, I mean, it's the NCAA tournament, so
you think everyone will be up and ready for the game. You know, now, if you
lose, there's no second chances, no tomorrows. So I think everyone's playing
with their backs against the wall. And we're just excited to go out there and
play in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. This is for Mitch. Does it ever enter into your game preparation or
thinking about your opponent, someone like Cornell who you know, are going
through some of the same academic difficulties that you guys might be going
through. Does that help in your preparation or is this just basketball?  
MITCH JOHNSON: It's just basketball. I think, you know, however people's
schedules fall for academics and things like that is pretty minor. I think at
this point of the year, you play 30-odd games, you've been on the road so you
know how to kind of juggle all that at this point. If you've been successful
enough to get to the NCAA tournament, all the outside factors are basically
thrown out the window and it comes down to that 40 minutes of basketball.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, Mitch, then, what do you think of the people
who are calling this the battle of the nerds?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I mean, that's fine. I mean, we both go to two good academic
schools. And I guess I'd rather get publicity for going to a smart school than
not a smart school. So at the end of the day, I guess it's just another
feather in both our hats and Cornell's, that we're able to be successful in
basketball and be able to go to such successful academic schools.  
  
Q. Mitch, curious, when you saw film of Louis Dale, what your impressions of
his game were and what he does within Cornell's system?  
MITCH JOHNSON: I think he a key to a lot of what they do. I think he plays at
a very good pace. I think he pushes the ball, but really never gets too out of
control, from what I've seen. He makes a lot of those guys better on his team.
And seems like he hits a lot of open jump shots when you might start helping
too much on the other guys. So I think he kind of is just their general and
does a lot of things.  
And, you know, he's a tough player. Be exciting to go up against him. I think
he was player of the year, too, in their conference, So he is obviously a big
part of what they do and will probably come out and be very aggressive
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Taj, you guys obviously are going to decide things on the basketball
court tomorrow, but if it came down to a classroom match-up which school do
you think might prevail?  
TAJ FINGER: I'm not going lie it's probably going be them. Hopefully tomorrow
we'll show we're the better basketball team. But, you know, we have a ton of
smart guys on the team, but I think we might be a little bit more geared to
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Taj, I will ask you, being a New York
native, are you familiar with Cornell?  
TAJ FINGER: Not really. I think I've got one friend from high school who goes
there, but I think it's about five hours from my hometown, so not really.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll dismiss the
student-athletes.  
Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.  
We're joined by head Coach Trent Johnson. As usual, we'll open it up with a
statement from the coach, then open the floor to questions.  
COACH JOHNSON: Needless to say, we're excited to be here, and, you know,
probably more excited to be out of an extremely tough PAC-10 conference season
and PAC-10 tournament. So we're looking forward to playing somebody else quite
frankly.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up the floor.  
  
Q. You were talking about the PAC-10 and everything, and how much of a toll
do you think that takes on teams as opposed to how well it prepares them for
something like this?  
COACH JOHNSON: I think the most important thing is it prepares you for
something like this. You know, there's not a level of skill, level from a
player's standpoint, there's not a team in terms of what they can throw at you
or throw at us, that we haven't seen up all year. So I think more importantly
it prepares you for the NCAA tournament. Throughout the year, if you lost
focus on a possession defensively or offensively, in our league, you were
going to struggle and probably going to get beat.  
Now you go into the NCAA tournament, where it's one game and if you don't play
well you go home. So I think it's prepared us.  
  
Q. For years, the PAC-10 and the Ivy League were the last two conferences
that didn't have post-season tournaments. Now obviously the PAC-10 has one and
the Ivy still doesn't. Are there any disadvantages or advantages that you see.
I mean, Cornell's had a lot of time off.  
COACH JOHNSON: They're probably more rested and fresh. No, not at all. I don't
think there's any advantage or disadvantages. You know, for us, we just know
there's about three to four things that we need to do really well that we've
done decently well all year - that's defending, rebound, and take care of it.  
Cornell is a basketball team that's won 15 in a row. Their last lost was
January 6, versus a very exceptional Duke team at Cameron Stadium. They beat
Siena, which is a basketball team we couldn't beat. They dominated Yale, and
Yale took us to a six- or seven-point game at our place in Maples. So we know,
for us, we need to be ready to play as well as we played all year to be
successful.  
  
Q. You played, I think, it's your sixth game in about the last two weeks and
here in Southern California, kind of mixed success - that heart break against
UCLA, won two games in the PAC-10 tournament, do you feel comfortable being
down here or would you rather be some place else in light of some of the
endings you've had in some of the games down here?  
COACH JOHNSON: I feel comfortable playing this time of year, no question. I
feel comfortable being here or anywhere else. Anywhere they want to send us.
As long as it's the NCAA tournament, we're comfortable. Six games that my kids
would much rather be playing than practicing, trust me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, you want to address the size difference between your
team and Cornell. Obviously, the Ivy League, they have one seven-footer, you
have the Lopez twins. What's the difference or the challenge for you guys.  
COACH JOHNSON: The challenge is going be for us to be able to defend their
shooters. I mean, they have five or six kids that can shoot the ball from
deep. We're going to have to guard the three-point line. I don't think our
size is an advantage. We had two seven-footers and we've had a size advantage
all year long. At this nature of the game, I think the advantage, if you have
any, is who going to play, and play like they played all year long and be
relaxed in this environment and be able to play. That's the advantage, the
kids or team that's able to just relax and enjoy being here and play like they
played all year long.  
  
Q. What types of things before the season did you tell Brook you wanted him
to develop and improve upon and how did he do that, whatever those things
might have been?  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't know if I can say those things on the air (laughing).
For the most part, just wanted him to improve his practice habits, improve his
rebounding, improve his defense.  
Brook is very, very gifted offensively. And that's one of the areas as a coach
that you have to be smart enough know not to mess with. But, you know, Brook,
Robin, all our post players, I think the reason they're having so much success
is because of our perimeter play. As valuable as Brook Lopez is to our
basketball team, Mitch Johnson has done an exceptional job of be doing one of
the lost arts in basketball, that's being able to feed the post and manage the
team without scoring.  
You know, so Brook, Robin, Todd, Lawrence, without the play making ability of
Mitch, without the play making ability of Fred Washington, Anthony Goods, and
guys like that, I don't think we'd be here right now.  
  
Q. Why do you think that has been a lost art, being able to pass the ball
into the post, and what's the toughest thing about that?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I think because so much emphasis on what you see on TV is
the guy who scores, the guy who dunks, there's not a lot of paying attention
to the fundamental essence of what the game's about, passing and catching the
ball and being able to understand angles, being able offensively and
defensively. I mean it's the fundamental issues that sometimes we lose sight
of.  
And, yes, there's something to be said about a kid who can shoot a deep three
or a kid who can jump over the top of somebody and dunk. But, you know, when
you can pass the ball in the post, you can catch it with two hands, you can
set a good screen, all those plays are just as valuable as scoring the points.  
  
Q. Obviously we can see that the Lopez twins, their game is a little bit
different, their hair has gone in different directions. What are the
differences in their personalities both on and off the court?  
COACH JOHNSON: Robin is probably the more emotional one, and Brook is probably
the one that's more quiet. Although, you know, you put a microphone in front
of him on a good day, he'll talk to you, too. But the I think the safe thing
to say is Brook's a little quiet and more reserve, whereas Robin's probably a
little more emotional.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wonder what you said about getting into a comfortable
pattern of play, getting comfortable in this setting, and if it makes any
difference if you are a slow-down team or a team that wants to pace the game,
as opposed to speed it up, in terms of getting into a comfortable feel?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, you have to do what you have done all year long to get
you here. And it's been my experiences in basketball at all levels that when
you get to all championship-caliber play, the game starts to be a half-court
game.  
So I think we're prepared to play a half-court game. We're prepared to play
fast. Probably not because that's not what we've done all year long. So we're
going to defend, we're going rebound. We're going to try to limit a team's
transition baskets. We're going to try to get the shooters. We have to take
care of the ball and somewhere along the line, efficiency on offense is going
be important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? Seeing none, we'll thank you, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions.  
  
Q. This is for Ryan. Just wondered if you talked to your dad at all about
his experiences in the tournament, and obviously he had a lot of success, went
all the way, and how maybe that might benefit you at all in this experience?  
RYAN WITTMAN: You know, I've talked to him a little bit, but I think this is
kind of something you have to experience for yourself. There's only so much
you can really say about being in the tournament and stuff. He just told me to
go out and have fun and enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. This question is for Louis. Considering the difficult nature of the
academics at both universities here, Stanford and in Cornell, do you feel like
that helps you understand your opponent maybe a little better knowing they're
going through similar things that you guys are going through?  
LOUIS DALE: I just think -- I don't really think that helps very much. We're
going to play a basketball game, so, you know we're going to look at that,
focus in on what they do, how we're going to try to beat them. So I think, you
know, that's pretty much, you know, what we're focusing on.  
  
Q. Jason, it's been a long, long way for you. You're a senior now. You have
battled through injuries and now you are finally here. The team has finally
made it in 20 years. How are you feeling and can you describe this
experience?  
JASON HARTFORD: It's pretty hard to describe. I mean, you can't really put it
into words. I didn't even know I was going to have a chance this year to play.
But now that I have, being a part of this team, it's just unreal.  
  
Q. It's a question for both Ryan and Louis. Last year when Adam got hurt,
you two both had to carry much more of the burden of the scoring and leading.
In what ways do you think that that is paying dividends during this season?  
RYAN WITTMAN: I think it gave us some experience last year, definitely. You
know, going into the year, I think we were really going in planning on relying
on Adam, then seeing him go down in the first game, it was tough for us. But
it obviously hurt us as a team. But in terms of getting a lot more playing
time, I think it gave us more time to adapt to the college game being as young
as we were and everything.  
LOUIS DALE: You know, when Adam went down, I think my role on the team kind of
changed. I felt more like, you know, I had to carry some of his slack as far
as scoring. And, you know, it helped my confidence a lot. And, you know, it
definitely, you know, we played a lot more minutes in the game, I did. And so,
you know, that helped with the experience as well. So I think that kind of
transitioned over to this year, and so, you know, becomes more confident
player and just, you know, being a better college basketball player.  
  
Q. Adam, I guess how much of a concern has perhaps fallen into the trap of
just being happy to be here, and what has the team done and talked about this
week in terms of avoiding that trap and trying to win?  
ADAM GORE: I think that's something you have to worry about coming in here. A
lot of teams, maybe at all levels, like you said, are kind of just happy to be
in this situation. But I think Coach has done a good job of explaining to us
that, you know, we're good team. We think we have a chance to win a game out
here.  
You know, practices have been pretty intense. We've been working really hard
trying to see what we can do to better our chances against Stanford. So I
think the team has the right focus right now of thinking we're a good enough
team to go in there and win a game.  
As of right now, I don't think we've fallen into that trap. So we'll see come
tomorrow, I guess.  
  
Q. This is for Adam. Where do you think this team would be right now without
Jeff Foote, and particularly, both the season and also this match-up in
particular?  
ADAM GORE: I don't think we'd be sitting here talking to you, honestly. I
think adding Jeff, as just one more, you know, inside presence really changed
this team around. I think he came in kind of right at the beginning of our
transition phase, you know, kind of in a rough point in our season. That's
when you got to start playing.  
And the way he helped us out in the Ivy League season, creating really hard
match-ups for some of the other teams, I think really maybe pushed us over the
edge to get that Ivy League championship.  
So I think he is one of the main reasons why we're sitting here talking to you
guys today.  
  
Q. What about this game?  
ADAM GORE: Obviously, Stanford has two seven-footers. We only have one. But,
you know, it helps I guess, you know, with that match-up a little bit. I mean,
he's going to have a hard job, as well as Jason Hartford and Alex Tyler, but
he kind of helps. You know, that size advantage they have on a lot of teams,
he helps it a little bit, not a whole lot.  
But as far as being able to match up with these two a little bit better, he is
a really big part of that.  
  
Q. This is for Jason. Jason, what are your thoughts are going up against the
Lopezes?  
JASON HARTFORD: We've been watching a lot of film on them and we noticed we
have a couple strategies. But they're two big kids, you know, a lot bigger
than what we're used to in the Ivy League. It's just going be a challenge. I
think our biggest challenge, actually, is just to keep them off the glass. We
have to box out, create a big umbrella, and just battle with them nonstop the
whole game.  
  
Q. Louis, just wondered, what do you hope to do with your degree in policy
analysis and management?  
LOUIS DALE: Hopefully, you know, I can -- I want to go into investment
banking, you know, look at that. Policy analysis and management is sort of
like a business major with, like, a little side of policy, I guess. So that's
what I'm looking to do.  
  
Q. Adam, some people have called this sort of the battle of the nerds,
because obviously, these are two high-quality academic institutions. What's
your take on that?  
ADAM GORE: I've heard that a little bit, I guess, a lot of reporters asking
that question. But I don't think -- I'm sure if you asked Stanford the same
thing, we're not really focused on how hard Stanford's classes are or how well
they're doing. I think it's more we're focusing on the athletic side of it.  
Obviously, they're very good team. It just so happens to be they're a pretty
good institution as well. So we're not really focused on that part of the
match-up.  
  
Q. Louis, with Conor Mullen, your teammate playing with Mitch Johnson in
high school, have you been prying him for any strategy?  
LOUIS DALE: Yeah, Conor, you know, he's told me little things that Mitch might
do and what moves he might like to do. And, you know, maybe that will help
throughout in the game. So, you know, we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, seeing none, we'll dismiss
the student-athletes. Good luck tomorrow.  
Now we'll have Coach Steve Donahue. All right. We'll open this up with Coach
Steve Donahue with a statement from Coach, then open up the floor to
questions.  
STEVE DONAHUE: Obviously, we're honored to be here. This is an exciting time
for ourselves and our league. And it just has been a pleasure coaching these
guys. And we're excited about playing a team like Stanford, and obviously
playing in the NCAA tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Coach, did you guys have a little adventure coming over here on the bus
today?  
STEVE DONAHUE: About the what?  
  
Q. You guys were running a little late today. Was there some glitch with the
bus?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I don't want to point fingers, but a guy named Jeff Hall [] was
a little late getting to the bus. The guy's suppose to be running this trip
for us. I apologize.  
There was no real adventure. The NCAA has been unbelievable. We were actually
concerned getting out of Ithaca. We don't have a real close airport that can
usually handle bigger jets, so we were able to charter right out of Ithaca
into -- cold weather and get to warm weather, direct flight. It's been a
pleasure. And I'm pleased that the NCAA does things so nicely for us.  
  
Q. Coach, with you being the assistant head coach at Penn while they were
winning the Ivy League championships, can you reflect and tell us the feels
that you have now of actually being at the head of an Ivy League championship
winning team?  
STEVE DONAHUE: Well, it's obviously been a while since a non-Penn or Princeton
team has been here. So when I was at Penn, you know, I never took -- never
even thought about what it would feel like to bring another team here. But now
that we have, it's been a long time for me personally. It's been eight years
since I remember what this felt like.  
Over the last couple weeks, just to see the excitement in our campus, and from
our President down to the student body, as you well know, it's been so
gratifying to see all that excitement on our campus at this time of year. And
for us being here and just been a great ride. Obviously, we want it to
continue.  
  
Q. What were the reasons as you look back on it, why Penn and Princeton had
such a hammerlock on this thing? And what were the couple of key things to
breaking it as far as your program was concerned?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I think that's a great question, Mark. People ask me that quite
often, why can one league be dominated by two teams like in other leagues in
the country. As I said, I was there for ten years, and I didn't realize until
I went somewhere else, it's pretty simple. There's no quick fixes in our
league. We don't have scholarships. So you really got to recruit kids that fit
the mold of the Ivy League. And that type of kid -- and you're not going be
able to do that pretty quickly.  
As those two teams dominate, they continue that trend of taking all the kids
that are thinking about academics. And it just snowballs. And what I think has
happened over the last eight years since I left, there's been way more
aggressive recruiting, commitment to basketball at the other six schools. You
notice it in every aspect.  
And now I think you'll see great parity in our league. I have great respect
for the other teams.  
For us to go 14-0, we never have imagined we'd be able to do that. One,
because of our youth, and two, because I know the balance in this league. I
know it's strong and it's going to continue.  
  
Q. Steve, what do you tell your kids so that they don't get caught up in the
we're just happy to be here routine that some schools who rarely appear do?  
STEVE DONAHUE: You know, this group has really amazed me in their levelness of
their approach. Almost to -- I was upset at it, because of the lack of
enthusiasm and energy sometimes these kids show. But we went to Syracuse, and
I thought we played not to win, and that was disappointing. But I didn't feel
a tentativeness. I just felt they didn't understand what a great opportunity
it was to play the team. Ten days later, we turn around and play at Duke. Once
again, I looked in the locker room and I didn't sense an excitement or
nervousness.  
Then they go out and play and execute and do all those things that you need to
and that was a game that went up and down. And we had every chance to win the
game. It's just not a group that's, you know, amazingly as young as we are,
they're not overwhelmed by this situation. If we lose, I feel confident that
we're going to lose because Stanford's a better basketball team and not that
we're overwhelmed with this stage.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you say the teams health is right now considering the
long flight. Would you say they're just running on emotion now or do you feel
like everybody's fully rested and back to normal?  
STEVE DONAHUE: I think we're in great shape. We had -- obviously, we hadn't
played in about 12 days. Everybody's healthy. I think the energy level's
great. Typically, this time of year, teams that played three or four games
over the last weekend, we didn't. I think we're in great shape for that.  
I think that's an advantage. I know that the layoff -- you can say those
things, but this time of year, I love that our guys are fresh, really do.
Especially the way we got to play. To play a team that's as physical as
Stanford we're going to need our legs. We're going to need to be able to shoot
the ball from far late in the game. I think all of that is an advantage for
us.  
  
Q. What was Ryan Wittman like in high school? What was the recruiting
process like and who did you have to compete with to get him?  
STEVE DONAHUE: A lot of this stuff happens, luck, Mark. Ryan was probably a
little less developed than most guys at that age. So as a Junior, he's a
little frail, a little less tall than he is now. And then the key part of it
is in recruitment he had an injury, his deep thigh bruise in July going into
his senior year. So he just wasn't moving like a Division I player. So I think
guys just moved on. We were fortunate enough that my assistant Izzie met --
saw a lot of him in his junior year, saw him playing healthy, talked to his
dad and just saying how he was a late bloomer, that he's going to grow and all
those things. And by the time he walked on our campus, he was already more
developed than I could imagine physically and basketball-wise.  
And he's obviously a terrific all-around player who works extremely hard at
his game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, with that, thank you, coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
STEVE DONAHUE: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. Larry, can you talk about UCLA's front court, what sorts of problems they
present, what you have seen from them on film.  
LARRY COX: Yeah, they're all big, fast, something we usually don't see in our
conference. But, we're going to be up for the task tomorrow.  
  
Q. Stanford, I'm just wondering from your perspective, you kind of had to
know going in you were going to get a tough draw. Does it really matter to you
who specifically you ended up drawing for this game?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, it really didn't matter, because out of a lot of top
teams like North Carolina, Memphis, they're all tough. But when we found out
who we were playing, I talked to one of my teammates and laughed a little bit
saying, "We're going to Disneyland."  
But we didn't come out here to go to Disneyland. We came out here to play a
game. And we just want to be the best 16 seed in the tournament.  
  
Q. It's a question for all of you guys. The problem for the 16's, none of
them have ever won. Why could you guys be the first?  
THE MODERATOR: Carl, why don't you take that first.  
CARL LUCAS: Well, I think if we come out and play the kind of game that we've
been playing the last ten games and play together, play as hard as we can, we
can probably give ourselves a chance. Because, you know, we're the number 16
seed, and they're number 1. That's all we can do, is come out and play hard
and give all the effort that we have. I have faith in that.  
LARRY COX: I have trust in my teammates and the coaching staff. They prepared
us good enough to come play hard. We've been doing that all year. We're not
going to change anything. We're going to go play our game like we've been
doing all year.  
STANFORD SPEECH: I just want to say, do you guys remember Appalachian State?
How many of you guys picked them to beat Michigan? They say college
basketball, the parity level is going up and we just want to go out and give
ourselves a chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Stanford, what happened against Washington State?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, you know, it was a little bit, you know, we kind of
tried to go with the game, coach gave us a game plan, and we tried to follow
it. You know, we didn't make shots and, you know, that's what happens when you
play a top team. They were bigger. We didn't have any size. There's a lot of
things you can see happened, but we just didn't play as well as we should
have.  
  
Q. Are you confident this outcome could be a little different than that, and
why will this be different than what happened up there?  
STANFORD SPEECH: We're not the same team at the end of the season. We didn't
have Larry and we're playing better now. So, of course I think we should have
a better chance than we did then.  
  
Q. This is for Stanford. You guys will on a national stage tomorrow. A lot
of people might not know much about Mississippi Valley State. What will you
hope they learn after tomorrow's game, win or lose?  
STANFORD SPEECH: Well, you know, I just want them, after the game, to know
that Mississippi Valley State is a group of guys who are going to play hard,
play together, and, you know, just, you know, a defensive-minded team, you
know, love playing basketball, all the good things you want to know about a
team.  
I want the fans that came out to see that we think we can win, you know. We're
not looking at this game -- we know the odds and we're going to go out and
give it the best shot we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Gentlemen, thank you for coming up.  
Coach Green.  
COACH GREEN: Obviously we're excited to be in the NCAA tournament. I'm very
proud of our guys. I think they worked very hard to earn it and have an
opportunity to come out and compete. I heard you ask questions about which
number one seed, and obviously in this part of the country if you got a chance
to play a team like UCLA with all the tradition, it's something that our kids
will be able to remember for a long, long time.  
And obviously we need to be thinking about playing basketball and try not to
be in awe of playing against them. And that's not an easy thing to do, but
that would have to be our goal in order to have a chance to play against them.  
  
Q. I know you have a friendship with Tim Floyd that goes back, and I know he
said he gave you a call. Just wondered, has he given you any little background
on playing UCLA, any help that way?  
COACH GREEN: No. No.  
You know, I think -- he called and just congratulated me after we played our
tournament. And, obviously, he's busy worrying about himself. So, you know, he
did call after we played on Saturday in the tournament and congratulated us on
making the tournament.  
  
Q. You guys are on a nice little winning streak right now. What's maybe been
there that was absent before in terms of the play way you're playing?  
COACH GREEN: I think we had a lot of new players coming into the mix. After
our first semester, we added Larry Cox back who had been out with an injury
during the first part of our season. And Chris Watson is a player that became
eligible at semester. And I think if you combine that with playing a lot of
players that had not been in the program, I think it just took some time for
them to come together as a group. I think we were competitive.  
I think we lost five of our six games within the league by four points or
less. We started off 0 and 2 and was somewhat up and down emotionally. Played
well in some games, then not as well as we needed to in some games.  
And I think one of the things that really helped this group was playing an in-
state rivalry on their home court against Elkhorn and getting beat on a last-
second shot in overtime from three-quarter lengths of the court really did
something for us.  
And we were able to win four out of six on the road to finish up our
conference season, and go into the conference tournament and play three teams
that we've played the last three games of our season at their place. And to be
able to do that and then win those games again in the conference tournament, I
think was something very good for our players.  
But I think overall it was just a determination, became a lot stronger after
that shot at Elkhorn. Not that we weren't making progress throughout the
season, but I think that really elevated us to a new level of intensity. And I
think we just decided whatever it would take, no matter whether it looked good
or didn't look good, that we just needed to try to find a way to win games.  
  
Q. Coach, quick question. One of the things that Coach Howland brought up
was the fact they were able to get video of you fairly quickly. What video
have you watch on UCLA and what do you think of the Bruins?  
COACH GREEN: Well, we watched a game against Washington. We watched some film,
different games. They played against Memphis, which is in our area, games that
we could pick up. And they're very good. They're very tough. I mean, they're
players that play for UCLA. That's the number one seed. And, you know, they're
quick.  
Obviously, Collison [] is very tough up front, and Love inside. Their size and
strength and their determination on the defensive end is something that will
be very tough for us to match up against.  
But we have to try to do the fundamental things of team basketball in order to
have a chance to play against them. And that's basically pass and catch, and
if we have layups, be able to make layups. If you get free throws, make your
free throws, make sure we understand the shot selection, try to get back and
not give them easy shots, things of that nature.  
  
Q. Coach, your players mentioned it, and I think everyone around this game
has, the fact that 16 seeds are 0-92 in this match-up with a number one?  
COACH GREEN: That's encouraging isn't it (laughing).  
  
Q. How do you approach that subject with your players?  
COACH GREEN: Well, one of the things that, again, we go back to the first
people that we have to compete against is ourselves, and make sure that we're
determined to go and do the best that we can. Hopefully, people will be able
to recognize us as a team regardless. Of the difference in the levels of the
two conferences or two teams, that we try to go out and do the things that it
takes to play basketball.  
But we've got to try to be the best number 16 seed that's ever played in the
tournament. You know, and even if we do that, even if each one of our players
played the best game that they've ever played in their life, and we played the
best game that we played all season long, the odds are still against us. But
at least at that point, we'll be able to see where we are within the game if
we could have those things happen.  
But that's the type of effort that it takes, and that's the type of motivation
I want our guys to have. If, for some reason, it doesn't happen that way, then
I don't want them to consider themselves as losers, because they earned this
opportunity. Not in the game that we're going to play, but the things we were
able to do down the stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, in the overall scheme of things, what does it mean to Mississippi
Valley basketball program to make the tournament and also play UCLA tomorrow
night?  
COACH GREEN: Well, I think obviously it means quite a deal to our university
which is a fine university. You know, most people know us as the school that
Jerry Rice attended. But at the same time, I think it gives us something as a
university, as a community, as alumni and fans, to be very proud of. That
we're a small school, our budgets are not nearly the same, but at the same
time, here we are in a situation that we're represented, like a lot of other
people will be represented in this tournament.  
And, you know, from this day on, there's going to be -- how many teams play,
64? After that first round there will only be 32. So those teams are going to
get the publicity until you're out.  
So that's something that we can't pay for at Mississippi Valley. And I think
it gives our players a lot of pride in what we try to do.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you get the team to, I guess, kind of recover and respond
after the Washington State loss?  
COACH GREEN: You know, we try to keep those games in perspective. Obviously,
that was a tough situation for us. Again, we're playing with two different
players that we didn't have at that time. It was very, very early in our non-
conference. I thought they played very well. Their size was a huge factor in
us not being able to score the ball around the basket and we didn't shoot it
well from the perimeter.  
But when you play as many guarantee games, as we call them in the coaching
profession, as we have to play, you have to put all of those games behind you
once you play them. We go into those games trying to learn, trying to get
better, trying to have an opportunity for our guys to play against some of the
best players around the country.  
So our goals in those games - obviously, we want to win the game. Don't have
no mistake about that - is that we're playing, we prepare to try to win. But
we try to be realistic. And that's something that's -- there's a fine line
between being realistic and believing that you can win. But we believe that if
we do certain things, that we'll have an opportunity.  
Now, physically, or from the standpoint of God-given ability, sometimes we
can't get those things done. And so we were able to put that behind us and
move on to the next game and find some things that we did positive in that
game. And obviously, we realize that that can happen to us. So we're a little
bit more guarded against that.  
  
Q. By any chance have you heard from Jerry Rice since this all came about?  
COACH GREEN: I have not personally heard from him. But, you know, we've been
fairly busy. I think he possibly may have made contact with someone at the
university. But not myself personally.  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach.
Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH GREEN: Thanks.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Trent, have you looked over game tapes? Could you break down this match-
up for us and kind of what you guys need to do?  
TRENT PLAISTED: Um, obviously I'm not a coach, so I don't really -- I get to
say what I think, but they'll tell you probably something different. They're a
really, really good team. From top to bottom, they're' very talented. Their
inside guys are big and physical. They're relentless on the offensive glass
and their guards are capable of really getting going and lighting it up from
outside as well.  
So we got our hands full. So we got to come up, and we have a good game plan
ready, and hopefully, we'll be able to get a win.  
  
Q. Sam, how do you guys feel about the seeding? Are you guys okay where you
are? Do you just feel like you just play who you get? Or do you worry about
things like where you are seeded?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, you know, of course we're happy to be in the tournament,
regardless. And I think you hope for the best. And, you know, of course we're
hoping for a little better seed, but, you know, we're happy. We know that all
the teams in this thing are great teams, and so you're going to play a good
team regardless of your seed.  
And so, you know, Texas A&M is a great team and we're happy about it and we
know it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Sort of following up on that, if you look ahead, and I know everybody
does look ahead, you can't say that you don't, you would possibly face a
Number 1 seed. And when you think about your seeding and what a possible
second-round match-up is, do you get disappointed a little bit obviously what
would be a tall task?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, yeah, just, you know, if we happen to get there and play
UCLA, that's an unbelievable team and program, and we played them last year,
so we're not unfamiliar with teams like that. And so you're right, it would be
a great team in the second round, and if they would win. But that's -- you
know, they're all good and you're going to have to play a good team sooner or
later, that's the seed.  
  
Q. For Sam. UCLA obviously has a lot of great basketball tradition. What's
it like being in a place where you're trying to build that tradition, and sort
of from the ground level?  
SAM BURGESS: Well, you know, since Coach Rose has been here, this is his third
year, and, you know, the program's just, as far as our seasons, have taken a
step up every year, and we're hoping to just build on what we've done the last
two years, and hopefully make some waves in the tournament and get some wins.  
And so, you know, it's a big deal. And we're happy to play teams like that.
UCLA and Texas A&M, they're great schools and programs. And so we welcome that
and we're ready for any challenge.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to take this, BYU's been to the tournament a lot, four
other times, this being the fifth in eight years, but hasn't gotten out of the
first round. How would you guys maybe explain that?  
TRENT PLAISTED: This is only my second tournament, so I don't try to explain
what happened in the previous tournaments and stuff like that. But that
stuff's all in the past, and we're looking forward to this year. And this is
-- you know, we're the same seed as we were last year and we're in a good
situation to hopefully come out and play well and get a win.  
Obviously, we want to advance in this tournament, every team does, but all we
can do is focus on our effort and come out and play our best game and play
hard and that's all we can control.  
THE MODERATOR: Lee do you have any thoughts on that?  
LEE CUMMARD: No. What he said was great. (Laughing).  
  
Q. Lee, what experiences from last year's tournament trip do you take with
you this year that you think will help you in this performance?  
LEE CUMMARD: I think last year, I mean, going away from the game, I felt like
I didn't play my best game and didn't contribute as much as I could. And what
I can take away from that is not, you know, play so you don't have to have
that feeling again and contribute as much as you can.  
As far as the team, I thought we played collectively pretty well as far as
effort. And we got to do the same thing again this year. And hopefully we can
make more plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what a physical style you expect from Texas A &M
inside tomorrow. They seem to be one of those teams that's very physical.   
TRENT PLAISTED: Yeah, um, Texas A&M just like all schools kind of have those
two big post guys they play at a time. You know, they're on the offensive
glass and guarding the post, I mean it's hard to describe. Like this year,
we've played teams like Michigan State and Louisville. These are teams that
are all physical, similar to Texas A&M. So it's going to be a challenge
keeping them off the glass and doing things like that.  
But, you know, as hard as it will be to match up with them, I think we present
our own match-up problems as well.  
  
Q. For Lee. I'm sure you guys know about Josh Carter, Dominique Kirk got hot
last week in the Big 12 tournament. Can you just talk about what you have
heard or what you have seen and what you guys know about Texas A &M's back
court?   
LEE CUMMARD: All we heard is they're great shooters and they can shoot in
bunches. Also heard Carter led the NCAA or the nation in three-point shooting
last year. And so we're going to have to go after the shots and also just keep
our man in the front of us and not let them get to the middle so it creates
more open shots.  
But great players from what I've seen and really good shooters.  
THE MODERATOR: Trent, you said that you think you guys present some match-up
problems as well for them. Do you want to expand on that a little bit.  
TRENT PLAISTED: No. I'm good where I'm at right now. (Laughing).  
THE MODERATOR: Do you have any other questions?  
  
Q. Trent, wanted to ask you, how strongly did you consider Texas A &M coming
out of Clark High School?   
TRENT PLAISTED: Coming out of high school, to be honest, not so much, just
because I had other interests. BYU obviously was high on my list due to the
fact that I'm a Mormon kid and stuff like that. But, you know, A & M's built
such a great program since I left high school. When I came out of high school,
I was getting recruited by the former coach before Billy Gillespie even came
there. Since Billy Gillespie got there and what has continued on since then is
totally different from when they recruited me.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions?  
  
Q. Lee, could you guys learn anything from the last game that you played and
maybe apply it towards this first-round game?  
LEE CUMMARD: Yeah, we got to show up in the second half. But watching the film
that the coaches showed us, it looked like we just -- we rolled over and kind
of just took it. We didn't play our game in the second half. Energy wasn't
there. We got to play for 40 minutes if we're going to be successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? All right. Seeing none, we'll excuse the
student-athletes.  
Good luck tomorrow, gentlemen.  
We'll open up with Coach Rose's statement. Go ahead, Coach.  
COACH ROSE: First of all, we're really excited to be in the tournament. And we
-- and I'm very proud of our team and how we have responded over the course of
the year. We've been extremely consistent, being able to win the Mountain West
Conference regular season championship is a big accomplishment for our team,
and we're looking forward to a very talented Texas A&M team. And know our
players will be ready and it will be real competitive game.  
THE MODERATOR: Open up to questions.  
  
Q. Dave, as a player at Houston looking back, did you appreciate how hard it
is to win NCAA tournament games compared to being a coach now?  
COACH ROSE: Well, the first -- my first experience, we got beat in the first
round by Villanova in Charlotte, and I just remember as a player how much I
wanted to have the opportunity to get back in the tournament and play again.
And the following year, I had knee surgery and red-shirted. Then the next year
ended up being my senior year, we had that opportunity, got back in the
tournament, made a nice run, made it to the championship game. And I do
remember the time between our first loss in the tournament and the opportunity
to play again, about how I just wanted another opportunity to see how we would
do.  
  
Q. Dave, does Texas A &M remind you of anyone that you have played this year
so far? Do they match up the same way?   
COACH ROSE: Well I told our team the other night as we were going through some
scouting reports and personnel issues, it reminds me of TCU in our league of
how they play. I think that they're a lot more physical at the guard line,
have more depth at the guard line and in the post, they're bigger, stronger
players. But they play kind of the same way. They really rely on offensive
rebounds to score. They set a lot of ball screens, a lot of their guards allow
their guards to penetrate and make plays. Then it's great rebounding team. And
those are things that we'll have to try and prepare for.  
  
Q. How do you feel about seedings, or are you a guy that doesn't worry about
seedings, you just go play who you play and you're not too much worried? And
my follow-up question to that is, when you were at Houston and Number 6 beat
you guys for the championship. So where do you fall on seeding?  
COACH ROSE: Well, the thing is, I believe that, you know, seeding is very -- I
mean, it's a very real part of the NCAA tournament, but match-ups also become
a real key. And there are some teams that are seeded, you know, maybe a lot
higher that you might match-up a little better against or worse or whatever
the situation is.  
But once the bracket's announced and you have been assigned who you are going
to play, it's time to go to work and, you know, deal with the challenge that
you have. And so that's exactly how we felt at about 4:45 on Sunday afternoon.
We got a big challenge, we're playing a good team, and we're really excited to
be in the tournament and let's get ready.  
  
Q. Dave, could you describe your vision on how far reaching a win at this
tournament could be for your program?  
COACH ROSE: Well, right now, we're in the process of preparing to win a game,
and that process seems very, very familiar and normal for us because we've
been doing this for three or four months now. And that's really about as far
as I can think. We're preparing for this game. We've got a challenge. We've
got a game plan that we're trying to get our players more familiar with as we
approach the game tomorrow.  
And we'll spend time between now and then trying to help them get in a
situation where they can execute that game plan, and then look forward to the
tip.  
Then once the game starts, you've got your challenge, then we'll see what
happens afterwards.  
  
Q. Follow up on that, though, how important is being successful in the
tournament in terms of a program's national reputation or establishing a
national reputation? Where do you think tournament success rates in that?  
COACH ROSE: Well, I think that, you know, in today's era of college basketball
that, you know, media, fans, everyone starts -- they start talking about
teams' resumes in November for the national tournament. And so now that you
are here, you want to seize that opportunity and do the best you can. And
that's what we'll expect our players to do, is to give their very best effort.
And, you know, our goal is to advance in this tournament, see how far we can
go, and see what we can do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the Aggies' inside game, just kind of what
match-up problems they give you?  
COACH ROSE: Well, you know, they've got five really good post players, you
know. And DeAndre is really, really long and Jones's got a lot of experience,
is extremely physical, and Davis can really -- has got really good footwork
and is good around the basket. And I don't know how to say it, Number 41
(Chinemelu Elonu) is a real athletic type player. So their post presence on
the floor at all times will be an issue with our team.  
The biggest key for us, I think, is to try to keep them away from the basket
as much as we can, not only on the offensive end, but after the ball's shot to
try to keep them away and just limit them to one opportunity. It's a very good
offensive rebounding team. It's a team that really tracks down loose balls
very well. Very physical and athletic. So those are issues that we'll have to
deal with.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right, seeing none, thank you,
Coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH ROSE: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
ANAHEIM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+ANAHEIM)

  

## March 19, 2008

  

### [Ramel Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16431)

### [Joe Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16439)

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open the floor up to questions.  
  
Q. This is for Joe. You know, it is seems like this March so much attention
is going to some of the freshmen out there who are making a big splash. Can
you talk about being an upper-classmen and maybe what you've learned over the
time of being in the game that can help you at this time of year?  
JOE CRAWFORD: You know, just experience. You know, I think a lot of freshmen
don't realize, you know, how important it is at this time to just play your
hardest. A lot of things ain't going to go your way. You know in March, you
just have to play your toughest.  
  
Q. Do you ever feel like the old guys get overlooked sometimes because
everyone's wondering about the one-and-done types?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, well, they're great players, you know, and they're
having tremendous years. So I think, you know, they deserve some of the
recognition they're getting.  
  
Q. Ramel, could you just talk a little bit about the whole atmosphere. You
guys are down here in California. Just talk about how special this tournament
is to you.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, it's very special to us, and I think this time making the
tournament is even more special because of, you know, where we came from in
the beginning of the year. We weren't playing really good and everybody had
us, you know -- just counted us out. To see us go through so much improvement
to make the tournament is just really special.  
  
Q. For both you guys. Could both of you all talk a little bit about how
coach influenced you all's turnaround, and what was it like with him here in
this first season and just talk about the big picture of working with Billy.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think, you know, in the beginning, it was pretty tough
because there was a lot of things that we weren't use to it, was just so tough
for us, you know, as far as just conditioning and just, you know, preparation
for practice and those things, just things we weren't use to. It took sometime
for us to, you know, kind of understand and just learn the things that coach
really wanted from us.  
You know, it's been if not probably the funnest year, you know, of my college
career, and, you know, just to see us improve each and every day.  
JOE CRAWFORD: I think the biggest difference for me was a change, as well. You
know, just going through a certain thing for three years and to have a new
philosophy, you know, to totally adapt to, was the biggest challenge for me.  
  
Q. It seems strange to think of Kentucky as an underdog. Given your history.
Do you guys think of yourselves as underdogs in this tournament?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think we do, just from the perspective of, you know,
just the media and, you know, how people just count us out and don't think we
can win and things like that. But I think that's the best place to be in, you
know, when no one believes in you and you just have to in yourself and just
come once together as a team. Think those are the best positions to be in.  
JOE CRAWFORD: Yeah, I think, you know, we're looked at as the underdog this
year. But I think, you know, it's working to our advantage. I think it allows
for some of the Younger players to have some pressure, you know, off of them
and be able to perform.  
  
Q. Guys, for both of you, do you all remember watching the '03 game with
Marquette for a chance to go to the final four? Do you remember that game at
all?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't remember it.  
JOE CRAWFORD: I kind of remember it. Dwyane Wade kind of put on a show. That
was just kind of the story.  
  
Q. Question for Ramel, who I believe is also from that city. Earlier in this
season, Patrick Patterson said that you're calm and cool and not screaming and
yelling as much any more. Is that true and what brought about the change?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I don't know if that's totally true. I just think, you know,
just having a coach like Coach G, and a very great coaching staff, they just
kind of help me and Joe both learn how to lead and just learn the right way
and the things to say at the right times and those kind of things that we
didn't understand in the past.  
  
Q. Ramel, this is for you. Joe, kind of talked about it earlier, can you
just talk about how much you think your experience especially in the
tournament can help you guys and what lessons you learned from your guys
previous experiences in the tournament?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think the main thing that you learn is, you know, when
it's -- because the game is about runs. In the NCAA tournament, everybody can
be a little tense because if you lose, it's all over. So I think you just have
to learn and be poised.  
Teams are going have runs, you just have to learn how to pick and choose and
to make your moves.  
  
Q. Ramel, forgive me if this has already been asked because I kind of just
walked in here but earlier in the season you guys lost some games that
probably you guys didn't think you should have. Did you envision at that time
or did you doubt that you might actually make it to this?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: Well, I think for, you know, representing the University of
Kentucky, you never doubt that you are going to be in the tournament. But I
think I just think knowing that our coach, he just has so much belief in us,
you know, it was hard for us to doubt ourselves.  
So, you know, he just continued to tell us, hey, around SEC time, we're going
to pick things up and be right where we want to be. Surely enough, he was
right. We just kept improving each and every day.  
And here we are.  
  
Q. For both guys, what would you say the lowest point was this year?  
JOE CRAWFORD: I mean, I can't pick a specific time. I think probably the
beginning of the year when, you know, we weren't winning the games that we
thought we should have won, it was probably the lowest point, I think.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: I think, I mean, we lost to Gardner-Webb, you're like, this is
ridiculous, things can't get any worse at Kentucky. But then when you lose --  
JOE CRAWFORD: To San Diego.  
RAMEL BRADLEY: -- to San Diego, it can get worse. You're just like, oh, God,
like, just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. I think those are
probably the low points.  
  
Q. For Ramel again. Speaking of things getting worse, what was it like last
weekend in all that mess?  
RAMEL BRADLEY: It was chaotic. I mean, first we were reading, you know, just
ready and focus to come out and play against Georgia that Friday night. And
then as the tornado and the game gets cancelled and then, you know, just -- we
just kind of lost the opportunity for having a bye, because it gives Georgia
another day. Then we play the next day early in the morning. It's small gym.
And I don't know it was just -- it was really just chaotic.  
THE MODERATOR: Joe, you have any thoughts on that?  
JOE CRAWFORD: Like Ramel said, we lost our opportunity, the advantage of
having a bye. Then all of the mental preparation it takes to get prepared for
a game, you got to do the same thing over again for the same team. It's kind
of draining, I think. That was tough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, student athletes. Good luck tomorrow.  
We'll start this off with a statement from Coach Gillespie, then we'll open it
up to questions.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Really excited to be out here in California, and I look
forward to playing against a very, very worthy and deserving opponent in
Marquette. A very, very difficult match-up for us. But we're excited about
what we've been able to accomplish over the last couple of months. And we're
looking forward to continuing to play and continuing our season.  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up to questions.  
  
Q. Simple question for you. Has your dream job been all you thought it would
be?  
COACH GILLISPIE: It's been fantastic. Every job I've ever had was my dream
job. And when I was coaching at Ellisson High School in Texas that was my
dream job at the time. People say things about dream jobs or whatever, some
aren't true, some are. The dream job I have right now is at Kentucky, and I've
-- it's been -- I knew it would be great and it's been better than I thought
it could ever be.  
  
Q. Is that because of just the challenges that come with it, the challenges
of the season, the expectations of the fans, just all of it?  
BILLY GILLISPIE: Everything. There's so much passion there it's unbelievable.  
The passion of fans, and it's from seven-year-old youngsters to 89-year-old
people that are getting up in years or whatever, and no matter what age, no
matter what gender or whatever, everyone has a sincere passion for it. It's
not three or four months out of the season. It's 365 days a year for some that
would be too much. For me, it's a perfect situation because that's the way I
am as well. And the resources, the support that you get, I mean, there's a
reason that they've won more games in college basketball than anyone else and
won more tournament titles than anyone else other than UCLA. So they have
unbelievable support. They do whatever it takes for you to have the best
chance to win.  
That's why they've been able to attract the absolute best players year after
year after year for so many years. And hopefully we'll continue to do that.
And you get the as good or better exposure as anyone in the country and that
where recruits want to come and play. So there's just so many things that are
going into your favor.  
  
Q. The win over Tennessee seemed to launch this run to the end of the
season. At the time, did you sense that that could happen, or did you -- I
mean, because you guys had come out of a bad patch at that point. Was that
kind of a turning point for your team?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Really we hadn't been in a bad patch. The game before that,
we lost at Florida in overtime. The game before that, we played without Jodie
Meeks and Derrick Jasper and lost by five at a very, very underrated
Mississippi State team. The game before that, we beat previously undefeated
Number 13 or 14 Vanderbilt team on our home court. So I don't know what kind
of bad patch that is.  
But we had been playing very well going into that. We didn't play very well in
November and December, if that's what you were referring to. But once we got
in the conference, we played very well with the exception of one game.  
We had -- counting the conference tournament, we had 17 games, and 16 of them
were decided in the last minute. I think that's something that really bodes
well for you for your post-season opportunities and post-season chances. We've
had so many great players. I mean, great plays made by Ramel Bradley and Joe
Crawford, clutch seniors. And that's what we've tried to do. We try to really
get good at defense and rebounding. Try to limit our turnovers and those kind
of things, and let those guys impose their will the last five minutes of the
game and they've been solid as a rock every single time.  
So as far as launching anything, I think that if you have the correct
philosophy, you don't look for something to happen, I think that you have to
have great consistency with your workouts, with your attitudes, with your
resiliency, and all those kind of things. And I think that if you continue
those things over time, then you're going to be happy with the results over
time.  
I don't think that you hope, hey, we're going have a big day today, but next
time, it's not going to be very good. I think when you have great practices,
when you have great attitudes, when you have great intangibles that this team
obviously has possessed, then you have a chance to get on a roll and win 12
out of 14 games in the Southeastern Conference, one of the best conferences in
the country.  
  
Q. Coach Gillispie, you guys are coming from Kentucky all the way to
California. Cornell is coming from New York all the way to California. How is
your team dealing with the travels and what type of schedule are you guys
operating on and what are you doing to reduce the affects of such travel?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I didn't hear one of those.  
THE MODERATOR: What are you doing to the affects of jet lag, travel lag coming
from the east.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I'm not in all that kind of stuff. I'm old school on a lot of
things. And Marquette's coming from a long way. Cornell's coming from a long
way. Stanford's coming from a short distance. But we're -- we came out here to
play basketball. They'll tip it up tomorrow and we'll play the best that we
possibly can. None of those kind of things -- I probably should be more in
tune with them.  
Other than drinking a lot of water, and I think water is a miracle drug. And
we make them drink a lot of water. But there's -- so different than when we
would if we were travelling a short distance. We'll be ready to play. It won't
have anything to do with whether it's good result or bad result tomorrow, it
won't have anything to do with where we were sent to. We're very, very
grateful to have the opportunity to be in the NCAA tournament, as all 65 teams
should be.  
  
Q. After watching those 29 tapes or those 29 videos on Marquette, anything
surprise you, anything stick out besides what you already knew before you
watched the tapes?  
MODERATOR: I tell you what, what I just mentioned a little bit, but not about
them. But what really -- as a coach, what I really respect is how they played
good. I haven't watched all 29 games, but I've watched most of them. But what
really amazes me is their consistency with their effort, and they really
played well together. They pass the basketball really well. But their effort
is consistent. And, I mean, I really do appreciate that kind of thing. They've
won most of their games this year. The ones they haven't won, they've been
right there and had a chance to win them.  
But it's all about they play hard every single time, and as a coach that's
what I appreciate the most.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how different things are for you right now than a year
ago when you took Texas A & M to the tournament?   
COACH GILLISPIE: As far as different, I don't think there's any difference. I
think a coach comes here and you perform your responsibility. You have your
team with you and you're ready to play basketball, and, hopefully, if you get
a chance to advance, that's what every coach's dream is right now, to continue
to advance, then you'll try to get ready to play the next game.  
But as far as -- I don't see any different as far as from one school to
another.  
  
Q. Coach, you nearly hired Dave Rose as one of your assistants at A &M a few
years ago. Now you have been at the same site as head coach. Curious if you've
followed his path at all?   
COACH GILLISPIE: Dave Rose was on my staff?  
  
Q. You were looking at hiring him.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I didn't think he was on my staff, but I have some memory
lapses every once in a while. Tell me your question again.  
  
Q. I was curious if you just followed his path at BYU. You have been at the
same site two years in a row. I was curious if you followed that at all?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Ive' always had a great respect for David. He is a fantastic
human being number one. And he is a great basketball coach. He's done a great
job over there. I haven't had the opportunity to study their team much. I did
see them playing against Louisville earlier in the season when we were
preparing to play against Louisville. I haven't studied him lately. There's no
question he is one of the better coaches in the country.  
It's always good to see Dave because he always has a smile on his face and has
a great attitude and you are happy about the success he continues to have. But
it doesn't surprise you. And I wish he would have come on our staff. I
couldn't talk him into it.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't keep up with your team day-to-day, what's the
status of Meeks?  
COACH GILLISPIE: You are the only one that doesn't keep up with our team on a
daily basis. But that was suppose to be funny. Obviously it wasn't.
(Laughing).  
  
Q. I got it.  
COACH GILLISPIE: I know you did. Some of the others I was worried about. I
don't know. I mean, he told me last week he wanted to try to play and he's
been trying to play. I would say he is very, very doubtful. But we haven't
done anything today. He's moving around better than he has been in a long
time. Does that mean he's going to be able to play? He's been a long ways away
from being able to play. So I would doubt he's going to be able to do
anything.  
  
Q. The second question is, earlier in the season Patrick Patterson said that
Ramel Bradley had changed, he wasn't yelling and screaming as much as he used
to. What changed with him and were you responsible for bringing something else
out of him that he had not shown before?  
COACH GILLISPIE: As far as changing Ramel, I don't know. I like it when Ramel
yells and screams. Maybe Patrick did or didn't. I've not been around a more --
I like to recruit spirit. And, you know, that's one of the things think that
we mess up on too many times is not recruiting spirit. Because basketball
seasons are long. They're basically 365 days a year these days, and I like
guys that have spirit.  
Ramel Bradley has more spirit than anyone I've ever been around.  
I can't remember one day when he came to workout or a game or any time that he
ever came by the office or -- no matter what his task was at hand in that
particular day, him not having a smile on his face or him not coming to
workout and going twice as hard as you would think he possibly could because
we had a late night last night or whatever.  
And he's been amazing in that respect. That's no disrespect to any others.
We've coached a lot of guys with great spirit. But his spirit is something
that's going to carry him so far in life, it's crazy. And as far as us
changing, I think maybe the change that we've had to make with Ramel is, he's
always been a really good player. I think we probably put more responsibility
on him than he ever has had placed upon him. And that's because he was a
senior and that's because of the injury situation that we had. He's had to do
more. He was one of the top five or six defensive players in our league. He
was all-defensive team in the Southeastern Conference. He's been as clutch a
player as I've been around and just has great spirit. Offensively he has to do
everything for us. Defensively he's done everything for us. So it was him
continuing to evolve as a player and having a fantastic senior season. But
he's got spirit, and I don't think he should ever try to change that.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you talked to Buzz Williams at all since Sunday, and
what your relationship is with him?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Buzz is a great person. And we talk quite a -- we talk quite
often. Buzz probably knew that I didn't have time to talk to him these days,
and I knew that Buzz probably didn't have time to talk to me because I would
assume he's doing the scouting report on our team. And he knows -- I know that
he's going to help their team prepare as much as possible. However many hours
there were since the selection was announced, he's going to be working. He
probably feels the same way about me.  
So Buzz is a great person. And he's a great coach. And I know that they must
be happy to have him on the staff.  
  
Q. What made him such a good recruiter for you when you were at A & M? He's
brought in a number of guys at Marquette the short time he's been there.   
COACH GILLISPIE: He is a tenacious guy. He obviously enjoys it. He is very,
very well organized. He's -- his tenacity is probably unmatched. He just goes
after it. Everyone likes him. If they don't start out liking him, he forces
them to like him. And that's a great quality to be able to have. And he just
goes after it hard. And he's not only a good recruiter he is a very, very good
basketball coach. And he's a -- he does whatever it takes to help your team
win, whether it's academics or whether it's taking care of stuff in the office
or whatever. He is not just a recruiter he is a total basketball coach and a
guy that gives you the best chance to win over a long haul. I know that. So
it's -- he's something else.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the irony of being in the same
location as your former club. Have you kept in contact with them at all, and I
guess your assessment of their season as they prepare for BYU and Texas A & M
of course?   
COACH GILLISPIE: I am totally immersed in our team. And I know that they're
probably excited to be in the tournament. I can't speak for them. There's a
lot of friends that I have back in those places. I think if you are a
relationship person like I am, I think that's why you coach. I think that, you
know, I'm happy for them to be in the tournament. As far as the details and
specifics, I don't know much about their team. I've watched them play just a
couple times on TV. TV. I know both those teams BYU and Texas A&M will be a
very fun match-up I would think.  
I hope nothing but the best for them and have great relationships with a lot
of folks there including a lot of players. But you can't speak with the
players because you would be breaking NCAA rules. So unfortunately that's a
rule I wish we could get changed.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to wrap it up there. Thank you very much, coach.
Good luck.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Thank you.

_ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Dominic, you guys were in this tournament, of course, last year. What's
the difference between this team right now and your attitude going in compared
to how you guys were last we're?  
DOMINIC JAMES: You know, we got the experience now. You know, this is our
third straight year for guys like me, Ousmane, Wesley, and Jerel. And
obviously, you know, when Lazar Hayward plays, I feel like he understands
entering this tournament, how important it is for him just to be poised and
being the leader. Last year he was a freshman. And for any freshmen playing in
the NCAA tournament, feel like you are probably a little bit nervous, and it's
first-time experience for you.  
But I feel like the experience and the maturity of this team, you know, coming
in this year, is going to play a major factor in how well we play tomorrow
again Kentucky.  
  
Q. Dominic, can you talk, Ramel said earlier how he views Kentucky as the
underdog. Do you have the same view or how you are your views that?  
DOMINIC JAMES: We're not getting caught up in the seedings or who is the
underdog or anything like that. We respect the fact that we know that they had
to fight to get into the tournament. You know, if that's their motivation
coming into this game, well, you know, that's on them.  
But we got the motivation that we haven't had a quality win in March. We
haven't won a tournament game since I've been here. That's our motivation. I
mean, each team has to have some type of edge coming into any game for added
motivation. If that's their war cry, then we got ours, as well.  
  
Q. Wesley, for you, it's your third year in this tournament. And you guys
were just talking about how Lazar's done. But for you, it seems to be, you
know, something a little more where you're the guy that they look to to get
hot early. Do you feel that way in this offense?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I never real thought about it like that. I mean, with this,
the offense, anybody can get off at any point and time. Just the way we play,
we push the ball, we throw it ahead, everybody touches it. If I get going
early, then I think that opens it up a lot for these three guys. Because now
the focus is more -- now they have to focus on everybody. I mean, I'm not out
there searching for my shot. I'm just taking what's given to me, and then
hopefully that's enough.  
  
Q. Question for Dominic. Some people say they remind them of Pitt. When you
look at them on film, is that the way they strike you?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Kentucky?  
  
Q. Yes.  
DOMINIC JAMES: Man, I wouldn't say that. Obviously, you know, they got strong
guard play. Pitt had strong guard play. They do got a presence down low, as
well.  
But, I mean, I feel like that's the best thing about the Big East, because you
get so many different styles. They may be similar -- may be similar in some
ways, but I really wouldn't put them in comparison with Pitt, me, myself
personally.  
  
Q. How good are their guards?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Good. Very good. We've been watching a lot of film. Ramel
Bradley his ability to get into the paint and his ability to shoot the ball. I
feel like his game compliments Crawford along with Jasper. They play well
together and give each other open shots. Obviously, that's the reason they've
been so successful in getting to the tournament.  
  
Q. Wesley, the first half of your Big East season, and the second half, it
seems like they were very different seasons. For those of us who didn't see
you play as much, what changed for you guys the second half of the year, and
how were you able to come on so strong?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Just being aggressive, I mean, a whole 'nother mentality,
just attacking, you know, putting defense in the forefront of my mind, rather
than offense. I mean, our team is predicated on getting stops, you know,
turning you over. Because defense is our best offense.  
So I think when I come out with a defensive rebounding, mentality, I mean,
that instinctively just makes me more aggressive. Then that carries over to
the offense.  
  
Q. Was the effort a question defensively, or what was the problem?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: Effort's never a question with anybody on this team. It's
more of a, you know, just locking in and knowing what it takes to get it done,
and that's defense.  
  
Q. Lazar, this is your second year. You said you guys talked about how
different is. What have these guys next to you, and also Coach Crean, how have
they approached you as the season's gone on getting into the Big East
tournament and now the NCAA tournament?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: We pretty much have the same approach. You know, coming in to
important games. You know, it's really not a hard thing to get me going for
games like this. And I think the good thing about, you know, us being here
again and trying to get our first win together is, just like Dominic said,
we're a mature team, and we're so eager to win. You know, this team is just --
it's a whole bunch of winners on this team. And that's a really good thing to
have when you are going into a game like this. And you know that everyone's
going to give it their best shot. So it's great thing to have.  
THE MODERATOR: Ousmane, as the lone senior up here, would you like to comment
on that.  
OUSMANE BARRO: Like this guy says, we've been here for three years straight,
and we haven't had a win yet. So as a team, we're just trying to give our best
shot, and, you know, make sure that we get a win. But we got a great opponent
in front of us, which is Kentucky. So it's going to be a good challenge for
us.  
  
Q. Wesley, do you have any memories of that 2003 Marquette/Kentucky game?
Just wondering if you watched it having grown up in that era?  
WESLEY MATTHEWS: I think we all watched it. We all remember it. Yeah, I mean,
it was a good game. You know, just being a basketball fan at that point, you
know, it was just exciting to watch, especially with it being Marquette.  
THE MODERATOR: Anybody else up here watch that game, have any memories of it?  
DOMINIC JAMES: That's probably the first time I really heard of Marquette. I
feel like that's the first time Marquette became a household name to the
entire country. I know it's great to follow in the footsteps of guys like
Dwyane Wade and Travis Diener and Steve Novak. I feel like those are names we
all know and reasons why we all came to Marquette.  
  
Q. I just wanted to follow up. Did that game have a lot to do with your
coming to Marquette?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Just like I said, for myself, I know it did. You know, I feel
like it just goes to show that you trying to rebuild a program, and, I mean,
you go back to the history of Marquette, you know, the '77 team and Al McGuire
and trying to rebuild a program and be a part of that. I know that's one of
the reasons why I came here, along with these guys that were recruiting when I
was coming in. And, you know, just to be a part of that and trying to get back
to that stage is something I want to be a part of.  
  
Q. So you were a high school, what, junior or senior when that game was
being played?  
DOMINIC JAMES: Sophomore, going into junior year.  
  
Q. At what school?  
DOMINIC JAMES: I'm from Richmond, Indiana.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions. Seeing none, we'll thank the student-
athletes for coming up here.  
THE MODERATOR: All right we're joined by Marquette head coach Tom Crean. We'll
open it up with a statement from the coach then open it up to questions.  
COACH CREAN: We're honored to be here. It's our first trip to Anaheim. It's
our first trip to the Honda Center. But it's our third straight trip as a unit
to the NCAA tournament and we're excited about that.  
You know, we've got a great tradition at Marquette, and we know that we're
playing a team, absolutely one of the best in all of college basketball. And
this is the first time since 1980 that a Marquette team has gone to the NCAA
tournament three years in a row. So that's something that we're proud of
inside of our program, which means absolutely nothing tomorrow.  
We know we're going to have a great battle with Kentucky. They are game tough.
They know how to win at home. They know how to win on the road. They know how
to win on a neutral court because they have great physical and mental
toughness. They play with the passion that Billy Gillispie coaches with, and
they play with the intelligence that he coaches with. They're a very, very
smart, cerebral basketball team. The more you watch them on film, they know
how to play early on the clock. They know how to play deep on the clock.
Offensively, obviously their defense has gotten better as the entire year has
gone on. They can put great pressure on the ball. They have outstanding help.
There's really not a lot of weaknesses.  
The one thing that's been such a tribute to the way they have played this
year, and the way Billy has coached them, is ever since -- you know, from the
films we watched from when Patrick Patterson went down with the injury,
they've kind of reinvented themselves a little bit with the perimeter play in
the sense, the perimeter guys had been great all year long - Crawford,
Bradley, Jasper, have been outstanding, but they even opened up the floor that
much more. I think that's a real tribute to how good they are and what they're
capable of. And they found a way to win a lot of different ways this year.  
  
Q. Tom, I mean, you guys play a very intense defense. They run the clock all
the way down. I mean, is that a concern to you for, you know, maybe these guys
getting tired at all early on or anything like that?  
COACH CREAN: No. I think we've just got to stay mentally sharp. And we've got
to build intensity as the clock goes down. Because, again, they can score
quick. They can get out on the break and make plays. They're not a deliberate
team. They just -- they know what they want to do. And inside of that, you
know, there's not a lot of situations that they have not encountered this year
that they're not or that they haven't been successful with.  
So, no. We've just got to stay disciplined. We've got to stay in an attack
mode, and we've got to stay really alert and sharp as the game goes on, and
our depth has got to be able to do the same thing when we go to the bench.  
  
Q. Tom, can you just tell me, when you talk about Kentucky having to
reinvent itself, from just a coaching perspective, how hard is that to do
three games from the end of your regular season?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think it helps when you have the perimeter players
they've had. But when you watched their earlier films, Patrick Patterson was
such a big part of what they did with getting the ball into the post. And they
still seemed to have run the same things out of their two-game offense, it's
just -- the floor's opened up that much more. And I think that's -- you know,
that's what great coaches do, like Billy is. You just figure out ways to win.  
But as solid as their offense has been, is disciplined, and as attacking as it
has been, they've won because they defend at a high level. I mean, you can see
that. There have really been no changes there. I mean, they really defend.
They guard the drive. They guard the dribble. They guard the pick-and-roll
outstanding. Their help defense is very good. Their four and five men do a
really good job of protecting each other and helping each other and covering
for each other in situations.  
So as their season has gone along, the defense has continued to strive and
improve. Then, obviously, when they had the change with Patterson, their
offense just -- you know, it was able to spread it out a little bit more.  
  
Q. Earlier your players were talking about how improved Lazar has been. How
important do you think that will be this time in the tournament compared to
last year when he was a freshman?  
COACH CREAN: I think every game he's gone through this season has been big for
him, when he's been successful, and even when he's not been successful,
because it's experience. He played a lot for us last year, but there was not
nearly the responsibilities that he has this year. And he's been a guy that's
improved since the time he got to Marquette.  
I think having played in an NCAA tournament game of the year is good, but I
think the big games, you know, we've played so many big games, as you know, in
the Big East. He just came off three last week in the Big East tournament. I
think obviously, Kentucky is game tough, and I'd like to think that we are as
well because of all the battles that we've been through. And Lazar's been a
big part of all that.  
  
Q. Talk about the Big East, I mean, a few years ago with restructuring the
Big East. Everybody talked about how difficult, there would be years when NCAA
level teams didn't get to the tournament. Eight teams, about right, this year?
Obviously Syracuse was close.  
COACH CREAN: Syracuse, when we played them, there's no question we felt they
were an NCAA team coming out of the game. Eventually, that's going to happen
in our league. There are going to be nine or ten teams who are going to get in
because you won't be able to say no. There's too much quality. For there to be
eight teams says a lot, not only about the depth of the league, but of the
quality of the league. And also, you know, looking at what South Florida did
with taking Connecticut to the wire, beating Syracuse, Rutgers wins, they took
Notre Dame to the wire, but they beat Villanova and Pittsburgh when they were
ranked. You can go down the line. That's what makes it such a great league, as
the SEC, as well.  
We're proud because in the new Big East, in the first three years, there's
been three teams win ten or more winning the conference. Georgetown,
Pittsburgh, and Marquette. So we feel like we've had a chance to go through
some battles and earn some victories, and hopefully that will help prepare us
as we play a great team tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you talk about being in the tournament three years in a row, in
reality, basically every game you played in the conference is an NCAA-type
game?  
COACH CREAN: The intensity level sure is. I know there have been many times
this year we said, okay, that felt like a final-32 game, or that felt like a
Sweet 16 game. And you try to get that in your players' minds, that that's the
intensity level those games are all about, knowing that any game you play, if
you are playing with intensity, you are playing with passion, you are playing
with energy, and you're executing under pressure, that's what you have to be
able to do in the NCAA tournament. I think that's a big reason that Kentucky
had the year they had, because they seemed, when you watch them on film, to
really understand those values of how you win. And Kentucky did not beat
themselves.  
I think that's one of the greatest tributes to the process of change that went
on at Kentucky this year, with a new coach is, they got better. They really
were able to win and put teams away because they knew what to do. You got to
go through that change.  
I mean, we didn't spend any time looking at November tapes or December tapes.
You know, it's totally different team, totally different. I think it's their
toughness physically and mentally, along with that experience of going through
a tough league.  
  
Q. These two teams have a pretty good history in the NCAA tournament.
Obviously, you're aware of that because you are a part of that history. Are
the players even aware of that?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think they are, because they had a chance to see the
game. You know, that helped with recruiting. But the only people that were
around, our security director Leonard Hardison, our doctor Darin Maccoux, and
our priest, Father Kelly. But Father Kelly has been around since basketball
was invented, so he's seen a lot of games, Al McGuire, the whole thing. But
that was a special day when we beat Kentucky. It was an incredible game. And
we knew what kind of team we were dealing with. We had great confidence that
day.  
So I think any time, you know, Marquette and Kentucky, I'm sure Kevin O'Neal
would say the same thing, he played Kentucky when Rick Pitino was there in the
NCAA tournament. Every time there's been a Marquette/Kentucky game, it's had a
special feel because we know how good they are and we know what their
tradition is all about.  
  
Q. Were there any kids on your roster who you were recruiting them that ,
that game, came up or they said -- Dominic was telling us that kind of put you
on his radar screen?  
COACH CREAN: I'm sure it did. It was still -- the seniors would have been
people that would have been juniors in high school when we played that game
that we were recruiting for the following year. Obviously, when you beat a
team like Kentucky, I mean, I think they had a 26-game winning streak. When
they had been behind, it was all of eleven seconds that year. So, you know,
when you win a game like that, you are beating a great team. Especially on the
stage it was on and the way Dwyane Wade played that day and the way Robert
Jackson played. I'm sure it helped.  
Any time you are in the national spotlight, it's going to help in recruiting,
there's no doubt, and there was no bigger spotlight for us than that point.  
  
Q. Obviously, getting to the semis in the Big East was big for you. How much
does that translate now to the NCAA tournament, where these guys haven't had a
chance to win yet?  
COACH CREAN: We'll see tomorrow. I think the most important thing is that the
more big games you play, the more, you know, pressure packed games you play,
the more confidence you build inside of those games, the more it helps you as
you go down the line. And I think that's the only thing we're focused on. You
know, we're not focused on last year. We're not focus on two weeks ago. Last
week a little bit, because we played three games in three days and there's
things to take from those games. There's things we did very well. There's
thing didn't do as well. Those are the things we've tried to build on.  
So it's not as much as getting ready for the NCAA tournament as it is getting
ready to play a really big game and make sure that we understand the process
we have to undertake to get ready for that.  
  
Q. Tom, I just wondered about pace of the game and how Kentucky's been
trying to tempo games. As you guys, as I understand it, like to run, how
important is pace?  
COACH CREAN: I think when you get to this time of year and you're in the NCAA
tournament, you've obviously won enough games, and they're never the same. You
know you can win them in a fast pace. You can win them in a slow pace. You
have to be able to do your best to get to your tempo, but you have to be able
to play at the tempo the game is being played at.  
I think Kentucky has been able to do that. I think we have been able to do
that. And I think most teams that would be in this time of year have done
that. And every once in a while, you are going to have a team that gets into
the conference tournament and wins and again, they're a great story, and
that's fantastic. But for the most part, this tournament is about teams that
have done it over the course of this year, and there's a lot of different ways
to do it. And we've got to be able to play whatever way the game dictates
itself tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? All right. Thank you, Coach. Good luck
tomorrow.  
COACH CREAN: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from Coach Stevens
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STEVENS: It was a great college basketball game between two pretty darn
good teams. And we came out on the short end, but due to no, certainly both
teams played valiantly and played with terrific effort. And I think it was
just a game of inches on a lot of occasions.  
We didn't get a couple bounces that we probably needed to go our way to finish
it off. But I have great respect for the way that Tennessee plays, I think
they play extremely hard. I think they put you in touch positions and they get
a chance to move on.  
But certainly I am proud as I could be of our guys effort. I told them in the
locker room that it's more than a game when you have five teammates like these
seniors have been. And that's what we talked about.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For A.J., you maybe have not had a lot of time to reflect, but even in
defeat do you think you've, Butler's made it pretty clear that you're one of
the top teens in the country, this team was ranked number one just about three
weeks ago and you took them into overtime.  
A.J. GRAVES: Well, yeah, I would hope so. That's something that we're trying
to do here is trying to create, add to what tradition that has been
established over the years. This isn't the only time Butler's been to the
tournament, they have been here before and won some games.  
To get paired up with Tennessee in the second round, to play a very
challenging team and to put them into overtime, that's tough to do. And a lot
of teams didn't get to do that.  
  
Q. Mike, Tennessee obviously has really good shot blockers, athletic guys
inside that can jump. Did those guys get you thinking, have you second
guessing your shot when you drove to the basket?  
MIKE GREEN: Sure, it happened a couple of times. The other times it was just
me and the rim and I failed to finish. Those shots that I've been making all
year long and for one reason or another they didn't go. All of them didn't go
today.  
  
Q. There were a lot of point characteristic numbers, 18 of 28 from the free
throw line, guys missed a couple of easy ones. How much of that was
Tennessee's size and athleticism and how much of it was you guys just had one
of those games?  
MIKE GREEN: I think you got to give credit to both. Tennessee has some
athletic guys that contested a lot of shots and at the same time sometimes it
just don't work your way. And I think it was both today.  
  
Q. A.J. in that last minute of overtime it looked like you had a pretty good
path to the basket and then did it seem like Smith just came out of nowhere to
block that? Because it looked like that was going to be a tying field goal.  
A.J. GRAVES: Yeah, I thought I had a clear way, we ran a high on ball and
hesitated and I thought there was an opening and I took it. And I did see
someone out of the corner of my eye and that's why I tried to, I didn't go all
the way to the rim, I tried to, I lofted it in the air to see what would
happen. And he got it. So that just happens.  
  
Q. All you guys, what are some of the things that you guys have shared with
each other as seniors, in the few minutes after the game, after a very
emotional game?  
DREW STREICHER: I would say the consensus was just thankfulness. How much fun
we have had going to work every day with each other. Just going to battle with
each other. How we have all come together. We have got three transfers and
they came from all different backgrounds and just how we were able to come
together and really just be like a family. And how much fun we had and playing
off each other, it's just been quite a ride.  
MIKE GREEN: Drew pretty much summed it all up. We just gave out hugs and a
bunch of thanks and pretty much talked about the season in short.  
  
Q. A.J., most of the game if you guys are aggressive with the ball, drove to
the hoop, you could maybe get a free throw. The last two minutes if you were
aggressive going to the hoop, you got fouled the official said you got to put
the ball in the basket, they weren't going to let you go to the free throw
line.  
A.J. GRAVES: I think that's the nature of the NCAA tournament. You got to go,
if you're going to go to the basket you need to put it in there. You can't
expect calls. And I don't think we were expecting calls. We were just out
there just trying to play. And that was kind of our strategy towards the end
was to try and go to the hoop and if we got fouled, we got fouled. If we
didn't, we were going to try and get the layup. And we had shooters spot up on
the perimeter and Tennessee decided to stay tight a few times and that's why
we kept driving it in there. But those just didn't go down and like Mike said,
sometimes that happens and sometimes that's because of the other team as well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you guys have been always been very humble, very
respectful and really don't make very many statements about what you think you
might do. But can you say now, can you, it seemed like there was that sort of
a you know stated belief that you all had that you really, you thought you
could go to the Final Four and win a national championship. Is that, did you
have that feeling deep down that you could do that?  
MIKE GREEN: Definitely. Why wouldn't we? We played our hearts out. We play our
style of basketball and it's been very effective.  
We came up short a couple times. Four times out of a possible 34 times. So
there's no reason for us not to think that we're good enough to play against
any team in this tournament. And we dropped one.  
DREW STREICHER: I think that we can play with anybody. I think we showed that
all year. That's definitely our ultimate goal. We're all pretty disappointed
we didn't reach that. That's been our ultimate goal for the whole season. So
we had the mindset that we could do that and obviously we're disappointed.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. You guys can head back to your locker room. Thank you,
guys. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Bruce Pearl said that he thought it was both unfair and an unfortunate
thing that two 30 win teams were facing each other in the second round. What
were your feelings along those lines?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, last week we just decided this is what's been
given to us and we got to go out and play and compete. And we just heard the
question about, did these guys believe that they could play with anybody or
beat anybody in the country and the answer was yes. So we said whatever the
bracket may be, we're going to go compete.  
And it just so happened that Tennessee was our second round opponent. I think
Tennessee is an obviously, if they were ranked number one in the country in
the RPI and number one in the country three weeks ago, that I think they're a
Final Four caliber team. So I was proud of the way our guys competed and I
don't really have any thoughts on the draw per se.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Tennessee did differently against Pete Campbell
as opposed to what South Alabama did in the first round?  
COACH STEVENS: I think that I was in here towards the end of Bruce's press
conference and obviously they were switching ball screens to avoid rotating,
so to avoid losing him more often. And I thought Mike did a great job on more
than one occasion of just breaking the guy down off the top, a little action
where we isolate Pete in the corner and Mike's got a decision to either take
it to the rim or kick it out. And Mike made the right decision a lot tonight.  
That was without a ball screen too. So that was how Pete got some of his looks
and then obviously you take some things away when you switch and as you get to
playing the best teams in the country, they do a formidable job of being able
to contain your guards, even with their bigs. It's very few, very select few
that can do that. And Tennessee is one of them.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how important it would be to maintain your
poise throughout the game. When you fell behind 13-2 how did you guys sort of
hold it together?  
COACH STEVENS: We talked about it last year it was 22-9 at Madison Square
Garden. You know, they are a tremendous team of runs. And you just have to
weather some of that and then you have to just keep playing the game. This is
a long, a long game. And I'll tell you this about this team, we haven't been
out of a game in a long time. In fact, I don't know, I would have to think
back to last year, maybe one was double figures. But this team's had a shot to
win it at the end almost all the time. And all four times this year. You know,
you think about what this group's accomplished in two years, it's absolutely
incredible. And I'm proud to just be a small part of it.  
  
Q. It seemed in the first half that possible you weren't taking shots deep
in the clock. It seemed like you were shooting earlier than we had seen you at
least Friday anyway. And making a comeback do you think fatigue played a
factor in the free throws at the end?  
COACH STEVENS: I think we were -- I'm not sure, but I think we were perfect
from the line in the last six or eight attempts. I'm not sure about that. I
think we were 8-14 at half time and then 10-14 in the second half. So I don't
know that it played a factor in that, but it probably, I'm sure it played a
small factor in the game as a whole and that's the way Tennessee plays and
they do a great job forcing tempo and it makes it difficult.  
  
Q. You mentioned how Mike went to the goal so frequently and trying to draw
the defense and so forth. Was he perhaps late in the game and during the
overtime perhaps trying to take too much of the game upon his own shoulders
and not passing off to people as he was going to the goal?  
COACH STEVENS: You know, you take what the game gives you. And they're not
going to leave our shooters. Obviously Coach Pearl is familiar with our system
and as Pete hits a couple in the first half they become even more consumed
with him. And you got to get it in there and make plays. Mike did a great job
of doing that. He missed a couple that he usually makes, but that's the way
the game goes sometimes.  
  
Q. Did you see the replay? I know you're upset when on A.J.'s shot that was
blocked --  
COACH STEVENS: I was upset but I didn't see the replay.  
  
Q. You didn't see it?  
COACH STEVENS: No, I didn't see the replay.  
  
Q. You said you felt Tennessee was a Final Four caliber team. Did you feel
like your team was a Final Four caliber team too?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, I've never really gotten into -- I feel like we
can play with anybody on any given night. I think the group last year proved
that when they got beat by the national champion. I just think Tennessee, like
a bunch of other teams, has a great shot to make it there. There's a lot of
parity in college basketball and we're not really focused on -- and we have
said this before, we haven't been focused on the end result all year. We have
just been focused on the next game and, you know, we thought we could compete
with Tennessee and I'm so proud of our effort. You think about the fact that
we went to overtime with probably the number one or number five or whatever
they are, one of the top eight teams in the country, easily top three or four
teams in the country easily. And we shot 36 percent.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you.

### [Jerry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18429)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take an opening statement from Coach Pitino
and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH PITINO: We played a good game against Boise and tonight we played a
great game. Both at offense and defense, we had two turnovers at half time. We
really didn't turn it over at all in the second half until the final few
minutes of play and everybody on the team did something really well.  
I'm real proud of our guys, real proud to be in the Sweet 16 and we're excited
to be going to Charlotte.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jerry David Padgett talk a lot about scouting reports? First, how well
did the coaches do with the scouting report, concerning the turn around and B,
how well did the players do executing it?  
JERRY SMITH: The coaches did a great job. They prepared us well and we really
focused in on everything. Coach said the main thing would be concentration.
With a great team like Oklahoma, and we tried to pay attention to every facet
that they would do.  
  
Q. The celebration at half-time was obviously a lot more intense than at the
end of the game. What kind of confidence did y'all take into half time? Did
you feel like it was pretty much over at that point?  
JERRY SMITH: Well, with a great team like Oklahoma, you can never feel like
the game is over. They're such a powerful team. They can come back in a heart
beat and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to stay after them.  
  
Q. Can either of you talk about -- you guys played a lot of players, looked
pretty deep, you have to play a team out there, Tennessee, that's also pretty
deep. Can you talk about your depth matching up with others around the
country?  
TERRANCE FARLEY: We don't really try to worry about how deep they are. We try
to concentrate on what we need to do to finish the game off. We know they're a
good team, more like a great team. But I'm sure we can compete with them. We
got a great matchup at each position.  
JERRY SMITH: Tennessee is a great team. We know that. But we're just very
excited about the Oklahoma win and going to the Sweet 16 in Charlotte.  
  
Q. Jerry, coming in to the tournament, there was a lot of talk about how you
guys had lost two games in a row, I know those were to two pretty good teams.
Did something click in the time before this tournament? It looks like you guys
might be playing your best basketball?  
JERRY SMITH: I definitely think we're playing our best basketball right now.
Like you said, we lost to two great teams. And they were playing, they just
out-played us, I guess, those two games. But we're clicking right now, we're
really focusing in and we are here to win.  
  
Q. Could the players talk about what it's like when you're on a run like you
had in the first half and it's 23-2 and you're getting steals, and getting
dunks, and just the momentum that that brings to the bench and to the players
out on the floor.  
TERRANCE FARLEY: Not only does it bring momentum to the players on the floor,
but it gives us great confidence off the bench too. Like take example for
myself, I came in to the game really pumped because we made this huge run and
I was really proud of my guys about that and there was no other feeling like
it, to tell you the truth.  
JERRY SMITH: Just got the momentum going, and everything's feeling great.
Don't want to let it die down.  
  
Q. You were a freshman the last time ya'll went to the Sweet 16, how
different is it for you this time around?  
TERRANCE FARLEY: Oh, as a freshman it wasn't really, we were close as a team,
but this year being the older one of the group and we're a lot more closer,
it's a lot more special. Hopefully we'll just make a run. And I wish us the
best, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. If y'all would like to head back to the
locker room, that would be fine. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Follow-up, just as with the players, that run the 23-2 run was really
pivotal and I mean is that what you were looking for to maybe use your
pressure to try to turn them over and take control of the game early?  
COACH PITINO: It starts with good shot selection. That's the key. Because you
can't press unless you shoot a high percentage shot. We obviously don't press
on misses. So it's important that you take, it starts with the execution
offensively, but offensively and defensively we did a beautiful job tonight.  
I really can't find a weakness in the way the guys played tonight. They did a
tremendous job. They didn't turn it over, they went inside out, made high
percentage shots, made the extra pass, and then turned around and played
fabulous defense both man and zone and pressed very effectively.  
  
Q. You said you played good against Boise State, great today, do you think
this is the best game you've played all season long?  
COACH PITINO: No, I really don't. I think we played really well tonight. I
think we played great but we played early in the year you all know how good
UNLV was, we played really well, beat them by 18. At Pittsburgh, Marquette --
we played a really tough schedule. Now I think that you can say this is the
best because it means the most. It means a trip to the Sweet 16. So without
question this is the most meaningful game that we have played.  
  
Q. You've been through this tournament many times, is there a sense that
this team is peaking at the right time or a sense that they're head hitting on
all cylinders right now?  
COACH PITINO: I thought we were peaking last year. And we just, it's just like
the question that was just asked about the last two games of the season. I
thought we played great in both games. To play Georgetown on Senior Night for
the conference title, playing to the mat and to the wire, on the road. Played
a great 40 minutes against Pittsburgh, played a very poor five minutes in
overtime. We played two great games. That's why I didn't understand the
question about the two losses.  
If you have two blow-out games against home week competition what does that
matter. If you study the game of basketball and see you're playing really well
it's not going to affect a team negatively. And that's what I told the guys
after the losses, you played terrific basketball. We played a terrific game
against Texas A & M last year, only difference with us is we give credit to
our competitors when they beat us. And that's exactly what happened. We just
gave credit to Pittsburgh and Georgetown and got on with ourselves. But we
were peaking last year at the right time and we're playing good basketball
right now.  
  
Q. Free throw shooting aside for Terrance Farley, what was it like to see
him give you some big minutes in the first half and just to perform like that
in a big game?  
COACH PITINO: We got a lot of confidence in Terrance. He's really improved his
low post game, and I'm not afraid to use him in crucial situations. So,
outside, you're right on his free throws, and especially the one that I
thought it was really unfair of the police because it's -- you see how many
police we have here. They opened up the arena doors just as he was getting
ready to shoot and forced it wide right and if they would have kept that place
shut he would have at least hit the rim. But the wind came up, everybody was
trying to let people out, but that was really disturbing on their part. He
told me he was okay after the miss though, he was okay about it. I said, "I
know you're okay, hit the rim."  
  
Q. Will you talk about your defense against Oklahoma, I don't know if they
have seen that too often, up and down the court, in fact, there's too many
games these days that go 50 to 48 and you played up tempo. Why we don't see
more of what you do.  
COACH PITINO: That was probably asked of me 25 years ago. And the answer is,
it's very difficult to do because the players have to really sacrifice at all
positions and it's not easy to do. It takes very focused players. Tennessee
plays that way, we play that way, Memphis plays that way and a lot of teams in
the country play that way. It takes dedicated basketball players to give that
much energy at every level of the court.  
So it's a credit to the players who work so hard to play that style.  
Even my first few years at Kentucky we had -- we didn't have the best pressing
teams, we had guys that I could beat in a foot race. But they still gave
everything they could as a team that lost to Duke, with the exception of Shawn
Woods and Jamal Mashburn. That was a gifted team, but they pressed their tails
off and gave everything they had.  
So, I'm real proud of the way our guys gave their energy, it's exciting to see
you feed on it, you get easy shots and the good thing about this pressing team
this year is that we don't give up a whole lot with our press. We press with
really good intelligence. We run and jump a lot rather than run and trap. So
you're not getting caught leaving the basket naked and 2s on 1s and 3s on 2s.  
  
Q. Obviously, it was necessary to win the game. But with Scott's shot at
half-time, was that neat for you to watch?  
COACH PITINO: It was. We put him in to get a corner shot. He made a lucky
prayer there. But it is fun because Will's a very good shooter, that was a
lucky shot but he worked real hard all season and even a young man like
Preston Knowles gives us a big lift for the amount of minutes that he plays
and but, yes, that was -- it like it was going to be our night when that shot
went in. It looked like everything was going well for us. It was one of those
nights.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay thank you, coach.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

### [Ramar Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18427)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. Take an opening statement from
Coach Pearl and then go to questions.  
COACH PEARL: We're very pleased to have survived and advance. We're about to
head to a place we have been before and we've not been able to go past and
that is to get to the Elite 8.  
Once again, what more can you say about Butler and the way those kids played,
how they honor the game with the way they play and I thought Graves and Green
were both terrific.  
I think we did a good job on Howard in the inside and that was a big factor
for him. Our inside guys did a terrific job. And to be able to win the battle
of the boards and be the more physical club, which we should be coming out of
the SEC, I thought that was very, very significant for us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now, please.  
  
Q. Tyler, could you talk about that block? Did you think that you caught it
on its way up?  
TYLER SMITH: They gave it to me, so I was happy they gave it to me. I don't
know if I caught it on the way up or down. But I was just happy to get to the
ball.  
  
Q. What makes Butler so difficult and unique to play?  
WAYNE CHISM: They got two guards that can play. And then they got a shooter
that can shoot the ball. And they do a lot of screening. And we already went
against that in the first round. And they kept screening the whole game and
getting open looks and penetration. But we sat back and played a good defense
in the first half and we played a good defense in the second half, but we had
a couple of fouls and then they went to the line, but we still made it hard
for them to get off a 3-point shot.  
We contested most of them and half of them went in, but we still played good
defense at the end.  
  
Q. Ramar, talk about the break-away where you scored 26 seconds to go, was
that something that just developed?  
RAMAR SMITH: No, Chris got the ball and I just tried to run the wing. He got
it to me and my main focus with to get the ball up on the rim and score.  
  
Q. Tyler and Wayne, could you talk about the attention you paid number 34,
Pete Campbell in the second half, because I can't even remember him getting
and hitting a three in that half.  
TYLER SMITH: We saw him shooting the ball with the lights out two days ago.
And our main focus was to make sure to run him off the deep line. Because he's
a great shooter and sometimes he will run the three and the four, but coach
got us defensively where we were switching everything and also the guards
helped us out on that a lot.  
WAYNE CHISM: We came, when he played the four, we even ran a couple of
different guys at him and I went on him a couple times, Tyler went on him a
couple times, we had everybody rotating on him, don't matter who it was. Just
staying in his passing lane in the second half. I think he hit like one, I
believe, but other than that, he was missing because he was taking contested
jump shots.  
In the first half, he was coming off drive, draw, dish and he was hitting
them. But we came in the second half and contested all his jumpers and then
after that he couldn't touch the ball any more.  
  
Q. I know you ran in to some foul trouble and had to sit a long time, could
you talk about coming in to overtime and how comfortable were you running the
offense again, despite all the recent struggles back there?  
RAMAR SMITH: It felt good just to -- the team stepped up for me. I came in and
backed my teammates up. I tried to make play, defensive plays and on the
offensive end and I came out there and played my heart out for my teammates.  
  
Q. For Wayne, again, foul trouble in the first half, you only got in nine
minutes, I think in the second half. Can you just talk about your mindset? It
looked like you were really demanding the ball in there.  
WAYNE CHISM: That's what we needed and coach gave me the calls, but in the
first half with the two quick fouls, the same thing happened to me two days
ago. But I kept my head. Like coach said, you got to keep it in the
tournament, if you don't, you'll lose all your focus.  
I kept my focus in the first half, and in the second half, I came out and
played good and hit inside shots so coach started going inside because their
big man was in foul trouble, but even though, he was still in the game and we
still went inside. I hit a couple of shots then and we had a bunch of inside
shots and inside rebounds, that's why we won the boards.  
  
Q. Did you guys get the sense that Mike Green was maybe getting a little bit
tired or that he was trying to draw contact so hard that maybe he was taking
the focus off his, off the shot?  
TYLER SMITH: Our main focus was to make him make tough twos. He was getting to
the rack a lot, but he really wasn't trying to pull up, he was trying to
commit fouls. So we were just trying to make him make tough twos and keep our
hands straight up.  
THE MODERATOR: No more final questions for the student-athletes? You can go
back to the locker room, guys. Thank you. We'll now take questions for the
Coach Pearl.  
  
Q. You saw plenty of Butler during your days in the Horizon League, as I
asked those guys, what makes them so unique and difficult to play?  
COACH PEARL: It seems like they have got five seniors every year. Their system
is built to beat the best teams in their schedule.  
With their ball screening and their flare screening and the fact that they
will put four or five guys on the floor that can shoot the three ball.  
With Howard on the inside, it's made them a more balanced team. Now, when he
got in foul trouble and we did a good job guarding in the post, they lost that
element, they lost that dimension and that's why they -- part of the reason
why they shot 36 percent. They played great defense. They're fifth in the
nation in scoring defense, because they have five guys helping one another.
They actually defended like we defended tonight. A lot of switching, and just
very physical. They're a very physical team.  
Todd Lickliter's teams were very physical. And that's been a terrific carry-
over to Brad's teams.  
  
Q. It was obvious their strategy may have been in the last ten minutes to
drive to the basket, either score or draw a foul. What were you telling your
team to counteract that?  
COACH PEARL: I want to give you one more: The Horizon League, Detroit,
Chicago, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, there are tough kids in that league. And
that league has always had tough, physical, hard-nosed players.  
It's almost like Big-10 basketball but even tougher. I'm sorry, I apologize,
what was the question?  
  
Q. They were driving to the basket the last ten minutes and trying to draw
fouls. What were you telling your team to counteract that?  
COACH PEARL: Like Tyler said, we were trying to show our hands and trying not
to draw fouls and they did a good job of jumping in and drawing contact. We
tried to make them make tough twos, and the fact that they only made three
threes in the second half and overtime combined was key. That's the first game
Butler's lost when they have made eight are more threes this season. They
normally make more.  
I think fatigue was a factor at the foul line at some point for them because
the way -- I thought the way we guarded, I thought Tennessee really played a
great defense tonight and we did what we needed to do on the boards.  
Coach Summitt called me this morning and she reminded me about the physical
players in the tournament. And she said, because she saw the game early
against American and she said just, "Tell those guys to rebound the
basketball." I thought the way we started the game was extremely important. We
sent a message right off the bat that we were going to represent the SEC, and
I thought we showed a tremendous determination to advance.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the point guard play and then also winning
without Chris or JaJuan and really getting it going from the perimeter.  
COACH PEARL: I thought J.P. Prince played well. I thought he did a lot of good
things whether it be offensive rebounds or taking charges or making plays. Our
execution down the stretch was challenged because he's not, I mean how about
never being in that situation and finding yourself in that situation for the
first time as a point guard in the NCAA tournament.  
I thought he handled it well. I told the team, I said, "J.P. and I did not
close out regulation well." We didn't. I didn't play call well, and no fault
of his, he's never been in that situation. So I said, "Bail me out." That's
what I told him. I said bail me out. And I went with Ramar just because I knew
we were going to be in a close game-out situation and even though we hadn't
been getting great plays from Ramar, he's been in that situation before and he
obviously delivered.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday it's a bad time to mess with the point guard
position, how do you use these five or six days to get that back up to
speed?  
COACH PEARL: The deal is this: I just thought that the point guard play we
were getting wasn't going to win a national championship. So, if we make the
decision and it doesn't pay off and I'm sitting here in front of you and
explaining why I made that choice and we lost the game, I could go to bed
going, it's okay. I don't think this is going to help us advance. Watching
tonight gives us a better chance to win Thursday.  
It's not a panacea, but we got five guys out there with J.P. in that position.
I was able to do some different things offensively. I was able to do some
things that Butler hadn't seen. And that was fun. Actually, it was fun.  
  
Q. You juggled your point guard position, Lofton doesn't score in double
figures in either game, and you still are going to the Sweet 16. It looked
like you guys didn't play your best, but you got out of here with two wins. Is
that how you look at it?  
COACH PEARL: Boy, I thought we played pretty well today. I really do. Butler,
they have held 13 out of the last 14 opponents to 55 points or less, or
something like that.  
We scored 76 points. I thought we played awfully well. Turned it over a little
bit too much. We had some unforced rushing, but I thought we made a lot of
progress today.  
And yeah, we're thrilled to survive and advance, that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. You don't think great guard play's necessary to advance? You're going to
see if you can prove to do it without a true point guard?  
COACH PEARL: Well, you know, let's see, J.P. was four for five, he had seven
rebounds and five assists. He did have six turnovers. Okay. So that's nine and
seven. Ramar had eight and three. So we got 17 points and ten rebounds and he
had an assist, six assists, I thought we got pretty good point guard play.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask Brad Stevens the same question, about you did you feel
it was unfair or unfortunate that you have two 30 win teams facing each other
in the second round the earliest that's ever happened?  
COACH PEARL: Yes. A little unfair. And a little unfortunate for whoever's
going to lose this game. This is usually a Regional Final number. Butler was
ranked 10 or 11 in the country all season long. But you know what, Brad will
tell you, listen, you you're going to play great teams to advance. He'll tell
you that.  
This is the best Butler team that I have seen and how many times was Butler in
the 5-12 game? And they were seven. I mean you know it's interesting. And see
why we talk about it is, we as coaches try and schedule and figure it out so
that we can put our teams in the best position to advance. That's what we do.
So it's really not about, nobody's complaining, we're trying to learn, we're
trying to figure it out. I'm sure Butler's trying to figure, what do we got to
do, they were 30-3 or whatever they were, you know.  
  
Q. When Pete Campbell hit that unguarded three right at the end of the first
half, did that give you a teaching point for half time?  
COACH PEARL: We had him, we had that identified. We had that taught. That
would have been a breakdown.  
But Wayne I think made an excellent point. That when you switch like we were
switching, it's not always going to be the same guy on 34. And so there were
times that if one guy misses, doesn't stay in his passing lane once and one
another guy misses once next thing you know he's got three of them. So that
was a breakdown. He was a no-leave guy, he never should have been able to
catch that, been in that passing lane. We were to let somebody drive the ball
to the basket and make a two versus leaving that passing lane, and yet we left
it.  
  
Q. You said that you told them that it was your fault and J.P.'s at the end
of regulation, to pick you up in OT, how did he do it? Just poise?  
COACH PEARL: You know what, sometimes you tell them that, because they're
looking, it he they didn't want to be in overtime. And they're looking for
somebody to blame. So go ahead and blame me. And let them band together. And
if they love me, they will bail me out. And Ramar has been -- I love Ramar.
I'm on him pretty hard. And his teammates have got confidence in him to go
make plays. And you know, I thought, defensively, I mean, we did okay. And we
held them again they shot, they didn't shoot a good percentage in overtime, we
did. So it's just away to get them to band together.  
  
Q. Now you get to go to Charlotte next week and another level. Playing a
tough game at this level, could it be now that you won it, an advantage,
because you got one of these under your belts, they always talk about you have
to struggle to get to that next level.  
COACH PEARL: We struggled plenty. We struggled last year against Virginia, to
advance to San Antonio in that game. So there's no question I think that
winning these games does give a team confidence. The one thing about this
basketball team, I coached a lot of teams, this has been my most resilient
team. They do find ways to win and I think it's because this is a close team,
there's terrific chemistry, we have too many weapons, and they count on one
another. And you take the play of Ramar Smith and J.P. Prince at the point
guard and that says it all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [David Godbold](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16982)

### [Taylor Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18176)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Oklahoma news conference. We'll take
an opening statement by Coach Capel and then take questions for the student-
athletes.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, congrats to Louisville, they were very, very good
today. They were very good on Friday as well.  
They're playing at an extremely high level and they shot it well today. They
defended really well, which they have been doing all year.  
So first of all, I want to congratulate them. It's disappointing today, I was
really proud of our team for our season. This won't diminish the body of work
that we have done all year. And it's been a group that's been great to coach.
We fought through all kind of different types of adversity, and these guys
just kept giving you the honest effort every day. And these two guys beside me
are a big part of that. David being a four year guy, and really going through
a lot during his time here. But to stick it through and to get this program to
be a big part of getting this program back to somewhat of a level of where it
was when he first got here I think speaks volumes about him and Longar.  
Taylor being his third year, I thought that he helped us have a really good
season this year.  
So we're proud of that, this hurts, it's disappointing, but like I said,
that's not going to diminish everything that we have done this year and all
that we have accomplished.  
So I'm sure after a few days and we'll get this taste out of our mouth as we
get this taste out of our mouth, we'll be able to reflect back even more on
the season that we had and I hope these guys are as proud as I am of what we
have accomplished this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Guys, if you will address the defensive pressure that they put on you,
because I know you played some teams that played good defense, but that was
pretty intense, wasn't it, what they did defensively.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, they stayed really active, they didn't back off at all.
And I congratulate them on that. They even when we broke it a couple times to
get a score, they kept with it and I know their coach was really pleased with
that. They just kept a lot of energy and they did a good job today.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: They did an excellent job pressuring us, especially in the
back court. When a team does that, it makes it a little bit harder to get into
your offense and it slows you down, so by the time you cross half court, you
hardly got seven, eight seconds, knocked off the shot clock.  
So they did an excellent job defending us that way and we just got to be able
to handle it better.  
  
Q. Taylor, I know you're coming off a tough loss right now, but I was
wondering if you could talk about David and what he's meant to this team,
especially these last two days, the way that he played and just throughout his
senior year for you guys?  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: Yeah, David and Longar both are really the only two guys on
this team that experienced a win in the NCAA tournament, as far as players go.  
The way he played yesterday, and just different moments throughout the season,
when he stepped up and hit a big shot or had a big game, it speaks volumes.
He's, David's kind of, he's a leader, undoubtedly, but he leads more by
example I think than anything. And the example that he kind of laid the
foundation for guys like Cade and Tony, guards that their first year here,
they kind of have a role model or an example to look up to and kind of model
their work ethic or their game after.  
  
Q. David, what will you take for your OU career and how this program has
grown under you and under your new head coach Jeff Capel here?  
DAVID GODBOLD: I'm really proud of just this season how we bounced back from a
very, I say just not good season the previous one, and I know Coach Capel's
going to bring in guys and the guys he still has here, hopefully they see what
happened this season and hopefully take another step further than what we got.
We kind of got the bumps and bruises this year and kind of set the foundation
for hopefully putting Oklahoma back to where it used to be before I got here
and before any of those guys used to watch OU basketball.  
I'm just really proud of my career here and I'm sad it had to go, but it had
to go sometime, either I would have won the last game or I would have lost the
last game. So I have no regrets about the season and, no, I just look forward
to having Taylor and Austin stepping up next year, along with Omar being those
seniors and I hope they have a good season.  
  
Q. David, you hit three three's in the span of a little more than two
minutes. Shortly after that's there was a TV time out. It seemed like it was
really hard for you to get another open look it seemed like they were trying
to lock you down after that happened.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, they, I heard Coach Pitino calling out, "Shooter,
shooter", every time I caught it and the guys responded by getting out to me,
but once they did that, I had no hesitation about throwing it inside to the
big guys. I know they can hold their own with anybody in the country and
unfortunately it just got a little out of hand and they made a big run and we
couldn't really respond to that. But I give all the credit to Louisville, they
played a really good game. They had a great leader ship out there, they played
as a team, and they came out with a victory today.  
  
Q. Taylor, I wonder what kind of advice you're going to give your brother as
he thinks about his options.  
TAYLOR GRIFFIN: One thing we agreed on was not to talk about it until the
season was over and obviously we're to that point now. You know, I'm kind of
split just because as a brother you want what's best for him. As a teammate, I
would want what's best for this team.  
Ultimately, the brother comes out more than the teammate. We're going to talk
about it as a family. He's been, he'll talk about it with my parents, Coach
Capel, some of the people that are really close. I really can't tell you
anything about what I think he's going to do or whatever, but I want him to do
what's best for him. As we get closer to figuring out what that is, we'll see
what happens. But as of right now, I'm behind his decision as long as I think
it's what's best for him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. Head back to your locker room, if you would
like. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, it seemed like it was whether it was their zone that pressure, it
was tough for Blake just to even get shots of the he only took six shots for
game three in each half?  
COACH CAPEL: Yeah, it was tough. Blake sometimes has a hard time against
zones. Because he doesn't really shoot the ball outside of the paint or around
the block area.  
Their zone really pressured our guards. One of the things we didn't get, we
didn't get any penetration against it for awhile there in the first half. All
we did was just settle for 3's. It was almost like the 3's that we hit early
were a little bit of fools gold.  
And I thought we settled sometimes when we had opportunities to drive and we
also had opportunities to flash. We didn't do that.  
But as much as you go over stuff in practice, you watch tape, a short amount
of time to prepare, when you get out there and that pressure hits you, and
that speed and that athleticism and the length that Louisville constantly
throws at you, it becomes more difficult to do what you know you're supposed
to do. Sometimes it becomes a little bit more difficult to think because
you're trying to figure out how to get, you know, how to get out of this
pressure that you're in. And give them credit, they keep the pressure up, they
have the bodies and athleticism and the length. Those guys are in really good
shape and they can keep it up.  
  
Q. We asked coach Pitino about his style and of playing all over the court
and the pressuring and then playing up and down. And he attributed being able
to do that to having players who could do that. As you get better players,
will your style of ball change any? Will it be more to what this style that
Louisville had?  
COACH CAPEL: We went to play a style that's going to win. First of all. I
think we did that this year.  
As we continue to build our program and add through recruiting, and then
hopefully our guys get better. That's a big thing. When you look at
Louisville, when you can bring a guy like Earl Clark off the bench, Earl
Clark's a pro. When you can bring a guy like that off the bench, that speaks
for the talent that you have in your program. Caracter was a Top-5, Top-10
player coming out of high school. He was a guy that played 11 minutes tonight.  
So they had big bodies, long, athletic bodies so they can do that. Hopefully
as we continue to build and add we will be able to do those things more. You
have to coach what you have and I think our staff and our players did a great
job of that this year of playing a style that was conducive for us winning
this year.  
As we continue to add -- you know, every team is different. If you watch Coach
Pitino's teams when he was at Kentucky, I don't think they ever played zone.
They just pressured you throughout man, things like that. They're primarily a
zone defensive team now. They get back in man after misses. They didn't miss a
lot tonight, so they were in zone a lot.  
But that's what they are. So he's changed as his personnel has changed. And
they do different types of pressure now. It's a zone press, back to a zone,
off of free throw throws or dead balls they will go to a man press, back into
a man at times, or they may fall back in zone.  
  
Q. You only had 16 turnovers I say only people probably think you had more.
But was this a game where that pressure those numbers don't really tell
because it looked like they just disrupted you so much you didn't even really
run your offense at times or you just barely got it over half court.  
COACH CAPEL: Bad shots are in my mind turnovers too. They don't show up, but
bad shots or hurried shots or rushed shots those are turnovers. When you look
at opportunities, the few that we had, in transition, where we don't convert,
they may show up as a missed field goal attempt, but when you don't convert
them in my mind those are turnovers as well.  
So I don't think the 16 probably tells the story. We were just rushed and
hurried all night. And we talked about since we found out we were playing
Louisville, we talked about our guys having poise. And really having poise.
And being confident and playing strong.  
Unfortunately, we didn't do that today. And like I say, you give all the
credit to Louisville, because they made us play at their pace. And we couldn't
keep up.  
  
Q. What did you learn from this year's second season about this team and
what's the next step for your Oklahoma program?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, first of all I learned that these guys are kids of great
character. And we over came a lot this year from injuries, to losing guys,
before the season getting rid of guys, during the season losing a guy. Guys
missing games because of injuries, missing practices because of injuries. But
yet this team always found a way to respond. We were counted out and kind of
left for dead whether it was at the Stephen F. Austin, after Colorado, after
Nebraska, this team responded and so I think they showed a lot as young men
growing and becoming men, because you can do that and learn that lesson and in
college, especially through there you through athletics, I think that bodes
well for them for the rest of their lives.  
With me, I think this is a really big step for us. To get to the NCAA
tournament, to get to the second round of the NCAA tournament, obviously today
is really disappointing, but like I said, earlier, when you look back on our
body of work and what we have done all year, I'm really proud of our guys. I'm
really excited about our future. I think we have a good class coming in. With
the four young men that we have signed. I think we have some guys coming back
that are good players. And we'll figure out what Blake wants to do. And I'm
like Taylor, whatever he wants to do is fine with me. It's his decision. His
family's decision. I'll help them as much as they want me to. But I'm excited
about the future of our program and where we go from here.  
  
Q. I know you talked about it locally, but you're up here on the big stage
so I'll ask, is there any chance you listen to South Carolina and any chance
you won't be at Oklahoma next year?  
COACH CAPEL: You know what? I don't think so. We just lost by 30. So I don't
really want to entertain questions about anything except for our program and I
just talked about our future, so obviously I'm planning on being here
hopefully for a long time.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH CAPEL: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
BIRMINGHAM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BIRMINGHAM)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Terry Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18414)

### [Terrence Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17013)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the bench play the last few games, Earl coming
off the bench now it seems like you guys have really got a huge lift from your
bench the last few games.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Yeah, we kind of gotten people, anybody can start,
anybody's capable of starting. So that just shows you, Earl started a lot this
year, so he's really a starter, everybody is pretty much a starter. It's just
we don't fall into the who starts and who don't start type of attitude.
Everybody just comes out and play. And that's indicative of our bench every
night.  
  
Q. For both of you start with you Jerry your impressions of Oklahoma, if you
have been able to see anything on them yet and do they compare to anybody in
your league?  
JERRY SMITH: Well, Oklahoma's a very big team, they compare like a lot of
teams, they're very physical. They got great inside play, big guards, and he
they shoot it well as well. So they're a lot like our team. A lot like our
teams in the Big East.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: I would agree with Jerry this will be kind of the battle of
our bigs and their bigs, with Blake and Longar, but we can't make it as just
David Padgett and Earl Clark versus them two, we got to make it a team game.
But we seen them play against West Virginia when they went to two over times
and they had a good showing in that game and we seen their game yesterday, we
watched film. So this will be a very fast paced game, a lot, a real physical
game, a Big East type game. So it should be fun.  
  
Q. Talk about what last night may have done for you guys, some talked about
inconsistent shooting, this and that, coming off two losses, I would think
that would have been a big confidence booster for both of you.  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Yeah, whenever you get back on track and other times, but
now you get back on track of winning, it boosts your confidence, I don't know
what we shot from the 3-point line or what we shot for the game, but I felt
that we shot the ball well and if we're going to play here for two games, I
feel this is a good gym to shoot well in. I think that it kind of showed that
nobody had jitters. I thought some people would be nervous and scared, but a
lot of people didn't, everybody came out to play. So hopefully that can carry
on throughout the tournament.  
JERRY SMITH: I agree with what he said. Nobody came out with a lot of jitters
last night, kind of just flowed into the things. Offense was flowing, we were
getting stops defensively and I think that was key.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, guys. We'll have an opening statement
from Coach Pitino and then take questions.  
COACH PITINO: We're excited, obviously, to advance. We know we have a tough
ball game against a very physical team. A team that can do damage in so many
ways with so many different players. So we're excited about moving on to the
next round and hopefully our players will be up for the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions.  
  
Q. Give us your assessment then of this Oklahoma team the challenges that
they put to your ball club.  
COACH PITINO: They have got a terrific low post presence. They have got good
senior leadership. They're very good at the defensive end. You really don't --
you understand that there are certain people you have to stop because they
shoot a high percentage, but other players crop up and have big nights as they
did last night and certainly we know definitely we have our work cut out for
us.  
  
Q. How much does experience coaching-wise mean in a scenario such as this as
opposed to say Jeff Capel's experience as a player in scenarios like this
would you think?  
COACH PITINO: I don't think either one's a factor. I think players win games.
And I know that Jeff is not only a capable basketball player, but that's not
going to help his coaching ability right now. And his lack of tournament
experience is not going to hurt him. He's a terrific, terrific young coach
that his players are going to dictate when he wins or loses and he's going to
do all the right things to get them ready.  
  
Q. You mentioned young coaches last night, there seem to be a lot of them,
do they have any advantages or disadvantages do you feel?  
COACH PITINO: In what regard?  
  
Q. Well just you have 30 years of experience, Brad Stevens has one. Those
sort of things.  
COACH PITINO: Well Brad's one of the guys that I was alluding to last night as
one of the premier young coaches in our game. There's no advantage or
disadvantage. Really it's the makeup of your basketball team. I think you
learn obviously, when you're in the business a long time you learn what not to
do. You don't necessarily know any more than any young coach. You just learn
what not to do in certain situations. And that's just time and experience. As
time goes along you learn what not to do, what paths not to take, and you sort
of learn to take two steps back in certain situations so you can take ten
forward. And that's all experience does for you. It's learning what not to do.  
But these young coaches really have a good concept of what to do offensively
and defensively and they're on top of their game.  
  
Q. Then it seems like the low post, traditional low post offense is sort of
a dying thing. You've got one of the few traditional low post players left in
the tournament. Wonder if you would agree with that that it's a rare thing?  
COACH PITINO: Well not in the Big East. In the Big East the low post game is a
big presence. You get it with at Pittsburgh, at Georgetown, with Padgett and
Caracter with us. So in the Big East it's a lot different. Nova doesn't have
a, or West Virginia, a traditional low post offense, but in the Big East,
you'll find that a strongly post presence is there.  
I think it varies from conference to conference. I think big men go to the
pros a lot quicker. Connecticut had a strongly post presence with Adrian. So
in the Big East we seem to have a dominance on five men and low post play. But
I understand where you're coming from and I think you need both. I don't care
if you're undersized, I think if you're just, if you're just perimeter and you
don't work inside to out, you can't shoot a high percentage. On a given night
you can, but the nights that you're off and you need to go inside, you don't
have it. So I think you need both.  
  
Q. How important as a motivational tool is a loss in the tournament the guys
talk about that loss to Texas A & M last year it's something that drove them
all summer that they don't want to have that feeling again.   
COACH PITINO: I think all those, the motivational aspect is great because look
at how hard they worked. And that's great. But when it comes to game night,
it's not going to, again, it goes back to offense and defensive execution.
Everybody is -- one of the questions the other night was about Boise State, if
we felt that they would be more motivated because they hadn't been here and I
said absolutely not. We could lose to them, but they're not going to play with
any more hunger than we will.  
It's the same thing with the Oklahoma game, two teams are going to want it
badly, the motivation comes from the hard work and perspiration you put in the
off months to try and get better, personally, as well as team-wise. But come
game night it's going to boil down to execution at the offense and defensive
ends.  
  
Q. Not expecting you to reveal how you plan to play against Blake Griffin,
talk about the importance of putting pressure on him since he's a young guy
and maybe just him specifically.  
COACH PITINO: Well, you're right, I'm not going to talk about it because it
makes no sense for me to talk about it. Because I would lie to you and I don't
believe in lying to the press. I would tell you the truth.  
  
Q. Talk about the --  
COACH PITINO: I think he's tremendous, but Longar Longar is also a big problem
in the low post. He's a big offensive threat as well. So you got a double-
edged sword there, it's not just one player. One player obviously shoots 57
percent from the field he's one of the premier freshmen in the nation and
takes great shots.  
  
Q. Who have you played who reminds you of teams you play in the Big East or
non-conference that anybody that you've even before?  
COACH PITINO: They have got a little bit like Pittsburgh. Play a little bit
like them. They're very physical. Very good inside presence. Very good
defensively.  
  
Q. When you go up against a guy you've never coached against or a team that
you haven't seen, what does David Godbold's 25 points present in your
defensive scheme when normally he isn't the scoring guy. Is it a confusing
fact, is it more confusing or is it you have to do more tape work or do you
just rely on your own players capabilities?  
COACH PITINO: You never know who is going to step up in a basketball game. I
remember clear as day in 1987 playing Georgetown and the MVP of the game was
our 7th man, Darrell Wright. He stepped up and had a great night.  
So it really doesn't, you don't know, it is your defensive scheme of what
you're trying to stop. And what you're trying to do to each player on the
basketball team. Obviously last night we were trying to stop the 3-point shot.
We were trying to keep them out of the middle of the floor. We were trying to
create turnovers. And make sure that they didn't have their legs when they did
get the 3-point shot. So every opponent brings a different set of
circumstances that you have to stop.  
  
Q. Big East now with the West Virginia beating Duke, 8-1 so far in the
tournament, did you think it would be that strong and, two, did you see the
shot that Rodgers hit for Western Kentucky and what was your reaction to
that?  
COACH PITINO: I thought it was a very difficult shot. He had three guys
hanging on him. Great victory for Western Kentucky. It's tough when you have
that lead and you lose that lead and then you come away with a loss, that's a
bitter pill to swallow. So they came away with a victory and not only a much
needed victory, but one that they truly deserved because they played terrific
basketball and Drake had a great see some.  
The Big East, I call it the Big Beast, because that's what it is, and the good
news is the Big East was a very strong league this year as we anticipated. The
bad news is they will get stronger next year because every team has just about
every player back. So it's a very competitive league comprised of tough kids
and very talented teams that as we all know just from watching earlier in the
year, I happened to watch it, I don't know why that night, but West Virginia
had a heck of a basketball with Oklahoma in a double overtime loss in the
State of West Virginia.  
So it's, West Virginia is a heck of a basketball team and all these teams that
are left are really good basketball teams. Connecticut was the lone team that
ran into a great night by San Diego in terms of shooting the ball.  
  
Q. (Question about injuries.)  
COACH PITINO: That happens in games, that's not a reason to lose the game,
you're going to have an injury in a given game, but Big East teams are all
strong enough to overcome that.  
  
Q. Can you remember when you were a young coach like Jeff Capel, 33, that
experience factor you talked about, earlier that you thought after a game, you
went against a coach that was maybe in his 50s and his experience was an
advantage for him?  
COACH PITINO: I really mean this: It's not a factor in the game. It really
isn't. It's not a factor. It's just, I mean, if you watch Butler play, you
realize the age of their coach is not a factor. Last night how much did Jim
Calhoun's age determine whether they win or lose? It's the players on the
court. It's the same everywhere. I mean, somebody's age is not a factor in
this whole equation or how many years of experience he has. Sometimes it's in
the way you travel and the way you prepare, you've been through it so many
times, but come game night the players are going to dictate whether you win or
lose, not the coaches.  
  
Q. Does the fact that y'all have played at several different styles this
year alleviate maybe some of the concern over playing two teams with different
contrasting sometimes such as Boise State and Oklahoma with the short-term
turn around?  
COACH PITINO: I think we're ready for any style, but I think so is Oklahoma.
Oklahoma plays in a very strong conference where they see every style as well.
So I don't think it's an advantage for us or an advantage for them. I think
when you play in conferences like we play in, you see every style. We, ours is
just a little bit bigger than everybody elses.  
But it's, they're from a very tough conference, two teams, two conferences
that happen to be very strong this year. You all know the way that works, it's
cyclical from year to year. This year the SEC may be a little down and next
year it could be some other conference a little down. It changes year to year.  
  
Q. Earlier among the same lines of talking about coaches facing each other,
Jeff Capel said if it was you and him one-on-one he likes his chances. Do you
think you could take him outside and drive past him and beat him in a one on
one game?  
COACH PITINO: Not any more.  
(Laughter.) He's right on that one. He's got me.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Last few games you've brought Earl Clark off the bench, what went into
that decision making and how has that improved your bench play with him?  
COACH PITINO: I just go with the guys who I think are the most focused from a
scouting report at the beginning of the game. It's not about talent, it's
about the guys who we can really rely on making sure that they do the right
things at the beginning of the game so that you get off to a good start. And
that's why I start McGee, I start two juniors and two seniors, it's not based
on talent.  
  
Q. When you came into Kentucky and into the SEC a few years ago you talked
about the conference needing to go deep into the tournament to really
establish a reputation. I'm curious now if, how important you think conference
reputation still is nationally and even for seedings and tournament bids like
that?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's a, again, it's almost like recruiting, you know, in
high school. One year New York city is awesome, next year Chicago, next year
L.A. and it changes just like conferences. It's a, the conference is, right
now in the Big East, is very strong. We knew we were rebuilding the year
before and now we know we're very good this year and we know we're going to be
awesome next year. Because when you look at it, every team has about just
about every player back.  
So it's all cyclical. But everything is so close, I mean you see West Virginia
beat Duke today, but Belmont almost beat them and they're a two seed. So it's
all very, very close and it's which style wins out. That's the key. Is which
style is going to win.  
In certain instances teams that overplay, go against a back door team, like
West Virginia, advantage West Virginia on that given night if Duke is not
shooting well. So it's all styles on a given night.  
You look at it, it's no different than Wisconsin and Kansas State, the
different styles, styles sometimes in our game against Boise State last night
we thought our press could bother them and from a style standpoint it did.  
  
Q. I guess what I'm really curious about conference reputations which again
I go back you remember how fragile the SEC was in terms of their seeding, they
were overlooked as a conference. Are conference reputations still tournament
to tournament or are they static, are they established better now?  
COACH PITINO: I think those days are over with. Back when I was in the SEC
everybody talked about outside of Kentucky that it was Kentucky and the rest
of the league depending upon what year it was it could be Arkansas or Florida
and it could be, but Kentucky was always the standard bearer for the league.  
That's not the case any more. Everybody is just, as it is with the ACC or the
Big East, with us in the Big East, Georgetown's won it two years in a row,
which is extremely difficult in that conference to do that.  
But Georgetown realizes that West Virginia, Pittsburgh, or any of the teams
that they're going to face could beat them on a given night. So it's, I think
it's just year to year. And I think that the SEC will be strong once again,
but it's just, it will be another year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Tennessee student-athletes. Take
questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler, what would you say, what aspect of your game would you say has
improved the most just over the course of this year?  
TYLER SMITH: I'm just trying to find my teammates. Coach just told me to make
plays. I can't really say what's my strength. I guess get to the basket. I'm
just trying to get my teammates open shots.  
  
Q. This question is for Chris, both Tennessee and Butler, if you look at the
situation are coming in with maybe a chip on your shoulder, I know you guys
felt like you deserved a number one seed and I know Butler thought they should
deserve higher than a 7 seed. That being said, can you touch on just how
competitive it's going to be tomorrow, two teams really trying to prove
something?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Yeah, it's going to be a grind-out game. A physical game. I can
see that. Both teams are playing with a chip on our shoulder and we're out to
prove something. So it should be a great game.  
  
Q. Talk about this, Tyler, you weren't there last year but Chris and JaJuan
were, talk about playing Butler last year and what you got to do this year to
be more successful than what you were last year.  
CHRIS LOFTON: I think last year we overlooked Butler. Being from the Horizon
League and then we found out that it doesn't matter in college basketball,
that all teams are great. Butler's a great team and they showed that last year
and they showed it this year.  
So, we just know that we got our hands full and we have to play a great
basketball game and control the boards and play great defense.  
JAJUAN SMITH: And, as a team, we just felt like we didn't come ready to play
last year against Butler. We were well-prepared from our coaches, we just
didn't perform up to our ability, and now we know what we got to do with them
and we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. For Tyler, how does your role change when J.P.'s at the point versus
Ramar?  
TYLER SMITH: I'm still the four-man. Regardless. J.P. makes plays just like I
do, it's just another playmaker out there on the court looking for an open
man. So I don't think it changes it much. J.P.'s just finds the man like I do.  
  
Q. Coach Pearl talked about how Ramar Smith and Jordan Howell are they very
different at the point guard position? What are some of the differences
between J.P. at the point and Ramar at the point?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Their games are all different from each other. But when they're
at the point they know what they got to do and we can read either one. We know
how to play with our three and we have just been working on that all season
long getting prepared, and I think coach is going to put the better point
guard on the floor for our opponent. They can't matchup with them so he's
going to put the best one out there on the floor.  
  
Q. Chris, you mentioned playing Butler last year, when you hear them
referred to as a Mid Major, having played them and seen what they can do --
does that sort of go off in your head when you hear that?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Yes. These mid majors are really taking over. Mid Majors are the
future, I think. They're great basketball teams and they have players that get
overlooked, but just having the ability, and they play to their best of their
ability. I think that's what Butler is. They got great players, great solid
role players, and just they can do a lot of things.  
  
Q. Chris, do you remember how Butler defended you last year and what player
was on you and if you expect them to be on you tomorrow, as well?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Not really. I remember I got in foul trouble and didn't play
most of the first half. We got beat, so that's the only thing I remember.  
  
Q. Chris, how is your hamstring?  
CHRIS LOFTON: It's fine. What happened to it?  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You said yesterday that it was a little sore before the game.  
CHRIS LOFTON: Oh, yeah, that was nothing. No, that wasn't a big deal. That was
just -- I pulled it during warm-ups a little bit. It wasn't that big a deal.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For any of the players, what has Coach Pearl told you about Butler?
Obviously, you've seen them up close, you played them last season, but I guess
-- what did he emphasize in his preparation speaking to you guys?  
JAJUAN SMITH: He just told us we're going to have our hands full from the
beginning to the end. And we got to come ready to play our best ball game and
it's going to take a special performance from each and everyone of us.  
CHRIS LOFTON: Just to be ready to play for 40 minutes, because they're going
to make runs, we're going to make runs and the game's not going to be a blow-
out. We just know that we have to play for 40 minutes and our best basketball.  
  
Q. Tyler, is your role with the Tennessee team pretty much the same as it
was last year or how different is it?  
TYLER SMITH: Last year, I was kind of like a go-to guy if our main man wasn't
on. So, this year we got so many weapons that I really just let the game come
to me and don't take as many shots as I did last year or have the ball in my
hands as much.  
  
Q. JaJuan, they shot 15 of 33, yesterday, what do you guys going to have to
stop that?  
JAJUAN SMITH: We're going to have to communicate with each other and ball
pressure and try to make them put the ball on the ground. Because that's their
specialty. They like to shoot the three-ball like we do so we got to man-up
and rebound and limit them to one chance.  
  
Q. Chris, did you see any of the Butler's game last yesterday? They had
Streicher really shut down South Alabama's top guard, top scorer, did you see
what he was doing well?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Not really. I saw the highlights of the game. I really didn't
watch it. We didn't have it on in our hotel, but we know that Butler's a great
defensive team and we know that we have to do a lot of things to score.  
  
Q. For Chris and JaJuan, Butler has two great guards and in Graves and
Green, they play off of each other pretty well. Can you guys talk about that,
what you guys have been able to do for Tennessee this year and your
communication on the court that lead to victories?  
CHRIS LOFTON: The guard play's real important during the tournament time. They
have the ball in their hands, and the guards, they try to make plays and on
the defensive end and offensive end, the guards are key to the game.  
JAJUAN SMITH: We've seen them in the past, they're two great players and we
know what they're capable of doing. But we also want to be in that category,
too. So, it's another chance for me and Chris to step up and make a name for
ourselves, also.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll have an opening statement from
Coach Pearl and then take questions.  
COACH PEARL: I have the distinction or pleasure or I've had the opportunity to
play against this system, I think on ten occasions. And it is as challenging a
system of basketball to cover. I think what Butler does on both sides,
offensive and defensive, Lee is as good as there is. The Phoenix Suns get a
lot of credit for the things they do in the NBA as far as their offense is
concerned and their ball screen stuff and it's well deserved.  
I think at the college level, Butler's been doing this for a long time. And
they do it as well, spreading and ball screening and terrific intelligent
plays. And the thing they don't get enough credit for is their defense. They
help one another tremendously, they build a wall, make it very, very difficult
to penetrate and they don't beat themselves up by fouling.  
So, it's a team with great history, tradition, the Hinkle Fieldhouse, one of
the great places to coach and play, and so it's an honor to be playing them at
this time. Not often, I don't know when in the last -- in the history of this
tournament you have a two teams with 30 wins in the second round. So you got
two terrific basketball teams.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for Coach Pearl.  
  
Q. You mentioned the two 30 game winners, actually, it's never happened in
the history of this tournament. Should this be labeled like the Snub Bowl
because I think both teams ended up with seeds that were kind of startled
them.  
COACH PEARL: Yeah, but you got to see, you got to beat great teams on the road
to the Final Four at some point. Butler was ranked 10 in the country. That
would put them in the first three lines, I would think. And for them to fall
all the way to seven was something that I'm sure that they were a little
surprised at or disappointed in.  
For us, I thought we were, based on what we had done and the body of work, I
thought we were a one seed. I can tell you the committee does try and pick the
best four teams to be at the one line and I don't know that we are. If I was
in that room, and you said coach, who are the top four teams in the country, I
would not put Tennessee there.  
For a number of different reasons, if you want to talk about whether Butler or
Tennessee deserve to be as far, as what I think the math is all about and the
body of work and that, we both did everything we possibly could to put
ourselves in better positions to see another 30-win team in the second round.  
  
Q. 15 of 30 from 3-point range yesterday. Butler, how tough of a matchup is
that for you defensively?  
COACH PEARL: They're a nightmare to match up with. Now, Butler's 22-0 when
they hit 8 or more threes. And they made nine in the first half yesterday.
Campbell had 8.  
It's a wonderful offense. When you get -- whatever offense you run, when you
put four guys out there that can shoot it, it just makes the defense so
challenged. And it does spread you out.  
So we're going to obviously have to do everything we can to try to take that
three ball away. We have defended Butler well in the past. They're better this
year than any Butler team I've played. And again, they do a great job
defensively. They're fifth in the nation in scoring defense. And they have
held 14 opponents down below 55 points. And last year they held us to 42 or 46
or something like that. 44. Okay.  
  
Q. Kind of a two part question, one, Butler often is referred to as a Mid
Major, you wonder what goes through your mind when you hear a team that's had
the success they had described that way; and then secondly, given the way
seniors are sort of a dying breed in the game, when a team like that can put
five of them out on the floor at the same time what kind of advantage does
that give them?  
COACH PEARL: They got five seniors, they got guys in grad school, they have
doctors on there. It's just an amazing collection of experience.  
I love the Mid Major tag. I was proud of the Mid Major tag when I was a Mid
Major. Because it separated you a little bit from the if you want to call them
high majors or the BCS conferences and that didn't mean we couldn't play with
them, and certainly I think the way Butler's built their system, it's built to
beat the most talented teams based on what they do, in fact, I would say that
what they do works against more traditional size, than it does even in their
own league sometimes, where they see smaller players that are able to matchup
with what they do better.  
So for me, I think it's great that Butler's carrying the banner for the Mid
Majors or that Western Kentucky or Siena or all those teams that Davidson, you
know, I mean I wouldn't be at Tennessee if I didn't take Milwaukee to the
Sweet 16 as a Mid Major the last, I guess that was the last time a 12 seed has
advanced to the Sweet 16. There's a chance that one could go this year. So I
think we all root for the Mid Majors. And all root for the underdogs at this
time of the year. I always do. Not tomorrow, not tomorrow, but I tend to
always root for the underdog.  
  
Q. A lot of young coaches early 30's, two here at this site, you were a
young coach at one time probably, do they have an advantage in the extra
energy, do they have a disadvantage because of the lack of experience?  
COACH PEARL: The only advantage they have over me is they might be smarter
than I am or they might be better coaches, they maybe were better players.
Those young guys don't have any more energy than I do. I promise you.  
  
Q. Talk about how their style might give a high major with a bit more size
more problems, but what exactly do you mean?  
COACH PEARL: Because of their ball screens and their flare screens and they're
exit action, they take advantage of bigs that aren't as mobile. And it's just
a very, very difficult, it puts a lot of pressure on your big people to have
to get out there and guard that ball screen action. Like American did to us
yesterday, when they ball screened us and we hedged, we weren't in a very good
position to rebound. And then of course American did a great job going to the
boards themselves.  
  
Q. Would the with the game that Chris had yesterday it was definitely off
his normal game and with the guard that you're going up against tomorrow, what
do you say to him, how do you shake him out of that?  
COACH PEARL: The best way for me to shake him out of it is to say nothing to
him. Because he, Chris pays very close attention to what you say and if you
make too much of it, it can distract him or bother him.  
I sent Chris a message today in our walk through by some things that we want
to try to do to get him open. And I don't have to say it, really don't need to
say anything else other than we'll call on him again, because he's delivered
for us all season long.  
The only -- I'll take credit for some of that in the sense that I put Chris on
Carr a great deal. Chris has become an improved defender. And there are times
when I believe that Chris Lofton and JaJuan Smith are our two best on the ball
defenders. And as a result of doing that, I probably wore him out and he was
not able to offensively be able to do what he normally does because of all the
effort he had to exert. And so that's a great question, because you're right,
now I'm challenged tomorrow by Green and Graves who are certainly going to be
as challenging as Carr, you know, what to do about that. So let's just say
it's a good challenge.  
  
Q. Tyler Smith was talking about how he play as different role for you guys
than he did with Iowa. You have so much, he has so much talent around him here
he just let's the game come to him. But sometimes would you prefer that he
takes charge more and tries to trust maybe force isn't the right word, but
take charge and do more?  
COACH PEARL: Yeah, like for example the last possession of the first half
Tyler came off a down screen and he had an open look, but it wasn't a great
look. And even though the clock was running down and it was probably going to
be a last shot, maybe a rebound situation, could have been an offensive
rebound, he turned it down and handed one off to JaJuan who got a bad shot.
And so there was an example of Tyler being unselfish, but at the same time
maybe not aggressive enough for his own stuff.  
When you lead your team in field goal percentage and you lead your team in
assists, it becomes a challenge for you because we rely on him to get guys the
ball. And at the same time we have tried to put the ball in his hands in
certain situations to go win us basketball games. And he has.  
I just think he's a great teammate. He is a great teammate. And he doesn't put
himself in position to fail very often. If he doesn't have a good look, he's
going to get somebody else the ball. Part of the evolution of Tyler Smith this
year was him doing just setting his teammates up completely in the early
portion of the season and then finding ways himself to score. I will tell you
this: That as the tournament goes on and here we are, you know, in a situation
where we're playing against a terrific team, your best players have got to
step up and make plays. Because everybody is challenged. Everybody's
challenged. So Tyler is going to have to probably do even more against Butler
than he did against American.  
  
Q. You tried J.P. Prince at point guard yesterday, how do you feel that
worked out? Do you think he'll play a lot more there tomorrow?  
COACH PEARL: I'm planning on playing J.P. at point. 40 minutes for Ramar and
Jordan, that's just too many minutes. They have not played well enough at the
position to warrant the minutes. And I tried Jordan in the first half with
J.P. and I tried Ramar in the second half with J.P., and it's an interesting
time of the year to be doing it, I did it in the Kentucky game as well, it
didn't get as much notice, but I did play J.P. at point guard in the Kentucky
game. I went back to Jordan at the Florida game and Jordan delivered and made
some big shots. But Jordan's 4-40 in his last 40 threes and they're good look,
Jordan is getting great looks. But you got to make them. Not just take them.
So we're going to -- my job is also to get the best players on the floor. And
while J.P. he only had one assist and three turnovers, he made some plays
defensively, he took some charges, he actually had a couple of other balls
that could have counted as assists, but somebody may have put the ball down on
the floor. So getting my best players on the floor is really why J.P.'s
playing some at the point. And I'm hoping that it was the right decision.  
  
Q. From having studied Butler, what do you anticipate they do, will do
defensively against Chris and who do you think would guard him?  
COACH PEARL: Butler has got a great team defensive philosophy and Graves will
probably take Chris, but he'll have a lot of help. Because they have got great
help principles.  
We have seen them before, Green tends to matchup with point guards and Graves
tends to matchup with shooting guards. And that's how I think they will go.  
They will jump out on Chris and make him put the ball on the floor and then
have a lot of help in there behind the ball pressure. Any kind of ball screen
they will probably switch it or hedge it and recover. But Chris won't come off
a hand off or a ball screen without a hand in his face.  
The difference is Butler just won't extend much beyond the 3-point line.
They're going to build a wall one step beyond the 3-point line and make it
difficult for you to penetrate.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay thank you, coach.  
COACH PEARL: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started and take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Blake, looking back at your season it seems like it's been a series of
ups and downs, you've won five of your last eight. Talk about your season,
some of the challenges, I guess and the fact that you're here in the second
round of the tournament?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's an honor to be here considering what we have been
through kind of as a team. With injuries and players being ineligible.  
It kind of shows you what kind of team we have been, and I think we have done
a good job of staying and fighting and not giving up. Even though we had some
rough patches where we lost three or four games. I just think we have done a
great job of staying together overall, as a team, and bouncing back from big
losses or games that we shouldn't have lost trying to put a run together.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, can you just tell me, talk to me about playing
alongside each other. It seems like you two really work well together. How are
you guys able to do that?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's just kind of been a process over the season and
all summer, kind of getting used to each other and I give a lot of credit to
Longar for kind of taking me in and showing me some things that normally
players wouldn't pick up on as fast. So he has kind of shown me the ropes a
little bit. And, I think, at the same time, we both tried to help each other
out a lot, as much as we can.  
It makes it easy because he's a good passer, so when he gets double teamed he
can normally find me or any of the other guards, so I think that we both kind
of take a little bit of pressure off each other.  
LONGAR LONGAR: Same thing he just said. Just playing along each other, it
makes both our games easier. The double teams, you got two bigs that can pass
out, work with our guards outside whenever we get doubled, we kick it outside
or we pass it to each other down low. Rebounding, just trying to attract
attention, and obviously, if he gets the ball, he gets doubled or if I get the
ball, I get doubled and it frees him up or it frees me up.  
  
Q. Blake starting with you, can you guys give an evaluation thought on
Louisville Cardinals as an opponent?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: They're definitely a tough team, they get after you and play
great defense. They have some big bodies and they also have some talented
guards. So, we're going to have our hands full. But I think if we just do a
good job of staying together and playing as a team and controlling the tempo a
little bit and handling their pressure I think we should be all right.  
LONGAR LONGAR: We just got to handle their pressure. They press the whole
game, they're real big inside, they have some really good post players, and
even their bench, they're deep, they have six guys and they can go real deep
in their bench. So we're going to have to concentrate on staying out of foul
trouble, play our defensive principles and just contain them.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Like they both said, they're a really good team, they bring a
lot of defensive pressure and they're not afraid to push it on offense at any
given moment. So, we got to come out and be aggressive and try to get them to
play at our tempo. They like to play fast and we want to pound them inside so
we're going to just try to execute our game plan as best as possible.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, you talked about handling a double team, do you guys
feel like you've gotten better at that as the season has gone along? Because,
yesterday, I think, Blake you hit Dave on a cut off a double team. Do you
think you've got more comfortable passing out of double teams?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I definitely do. We both, I think, have come a long ways since
the beginning of the year. I know I have. Just because I really wasn't used to
handling a lot bigger guys coming at me at the same time. And our guards have
done a good job of getting into open spaces and making it easy to find people
and Longar's also done a good job of making himself a presence in the back
side for me to be able to find him easily.  
  
Q. Blake and Longar, can you comment specifically on David Padgett what
you've seen from him on film and what kind of problems he presents; their
offense kind of runs through him.  
LONGAR LONGAR: I watched him play. He's a really good player. Really big, he
can pass, he can really pass the ball. I think he's the guy that makes them
go, he runs their offense real well, their guards are real athletic, so
they're always cutting in and going to the glass, too. So, we just got to do a
good job on him, he can score down low, rebound, and he runs the floor. We are
just going to have to do a good job of containing him.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, the way that the Big-12 Conference has performed, I
know the Big East is doing well, too, but getting out of conference, getting
out of where everybody knows what you do, have you been able to draw a little
bit of confidence from seeing the other teams have success and from the
success you had last night?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yes, it's always good when we're not facing another Big-12
team, to see them competing and do well. It kind of shows the Big-12
conference is one of those power conferences and right now they're having a
good showing and just us as the Oklahoma basketball team, we want to just kind
of prove that we're a good team, too. We're from the Big-12 and we want
everybody to kind of look at us as we're a good team in the Big-12 and to try
to get some exposure for us, too.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I've been pleased with how well everybody in our conference has
done. Obviously K State beating a higher seed and I think it just kind of
shows how like David said, how tough our conference is. But at the same time
we're also trying to prove a point like he said that we feel like we belong
here and we feel like we can compete here.  
  
Q. Longar and Blake, it would appear and I think even Doctor Schnebel said
you guys are as healthy as you have been all season and do you agree; and
Longar how much of a difference does that make in your game; and Blake talk
about your health status too?  
LONGAR LONGAR: A big difference. Three weeks ago if you asked me I was still
going through it, but right now I'm getting healthier. Just the healing
process has been great. Just doing treatment, making sure that I'm just taking
care of my body, it requires a lot of just focusing on just getting treatment,
basically just to get better; and my trainer has been doing a great job just
doing that; and I'm getting healthier every day.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Definitely, I say the same thing. Just kind of day by day we're
starting to get healthier and healthier. And that definitely helps out being
able to take a beating down low and then being able to come back the next day
and practice hard or play hard again. So, I definitely think that we're
starting to get closer to a hundred percent. The closer we get to that, the
better off we'll be.  
  
Q. Kind of to follow-up on that, when we heard about those injuries they
sounded very serious, yet you guys came back so fast. How were you able to do
that? Do you have some sort of magic healing potion over there?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I don't know about the potion, but we have a good training
staff, A.B. and -- Alex Brown, our trainer and Doctor Schnebel, our team
doctor both do a really good job of getting us whatever we need and making
sure we're getting treatment and concentrating on getting us back as fast as
possible, but at the same time, making sure we're safe to play.  
So, you kind of have to give credit to them for staying on us so much and for
getting us in the right place at the right time.  
LONGAR LONGAR: They do a great job. As soon as I got hurt they were just
getting me in, three treatments a day, making sure that I'm taking the right
supplements, just to keep my body right. I drank a lot of fluids, making sure
that everything is good. But the most important thing, like I said, is just
being able to get to rehab, more than once, you know, three times a day. And
Alex Brown, he's done a great job with both of us.  
  
Q. David, this is for you, yesterday Phil Martelli admitted that he had to
defend OU to beat them. He would have to concentrate on Blake and the inside
game and maybe another shooter, leaving you pretty much open and you countered
with 25 points. If you were Rick Pitino, looking at that, how would you defend
Oklahoma and do you think you have added to Louisville's defensive woes, so to
speak?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just looking at our team, I know the strength of our team is
always been the big guys inside. So, just as another head coach, I would say
you're still going to have to stop the big guys inside. They're obviously
going to be a presence. Hopefully, they'll still demand a double. And if that
does happen and I do get left open again or any guard, hopefully the guards
are just ready to step up and make shots. I just got lucky the other day just
being wide open and the post men did a great job passing it out. But maybe
we'll see something different where they're playing one on one where they have
a big man.  
  
Q. You would invite that again though, wouldn't you?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, I would invite it, but I know it's not going to happen
again, so I'm not worried about it.  
  
Q. All three, can you explain how, at times, this team was really, really
good and at times it's really, really bad?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just a lack of focus coming out from the jump is when we're
really bad. Not playing as a team, not being mentally and physically tough.
That kind of makes us not play bad but as you can see, in our previous game,
everybody came out aggressive, a lot of energy, everybody stayed together and
no matter how many runs St. Joseph's put together, we stayed together and
nobody went off to the side and thought about themselves.  
So if we just play as a team, and play with a lot of energy, we'll have a good
run, hopefully.  
LONGAR LONGAR: I believe it's just whenever we start getting away from our
game plan and start to do stuff that we're not capable of doing, just trying
to take guys one on one and not play together as a team -- that's when we
really do not perform. We are more effective when we play as a team. And if we
do that, we're tough to beat.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it's definitely like David said, a lack of focus. We
come out and we're all focused on one task, and playing together as a team,
and defending, getting down and really defending hard and not giving up
basically any easy baskets, I think we're a lot better team and that obviously
shows at times in games when we make big runs. It all starts with our defense,
too. So, I think that's something that we definitely need to concentrate on
and that's what makes us a better team.  
  
Q. David, you guys, as a six seed wise, you were a favorite in the last game
and now you're an underdog in this one. Your thoughts about playing the
underdog role, is there an advantage in this tournament we see what happened
in Tampa suddenly underdogs are winning everywhere, is that something which
gives you confidence and the whole seeding issue at this point, your thoughts
on that.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Well, just looking at the last game, from what we seen and what
we heard, we were the underdogs in that game also. So we used that as a
motivation and now we're the 6 going against a 3 and once again we're the
underdog again, so we're going to try to use that to our advantage. But we
know that they're a great team, they're not going to over look anybody, no
matter if they were the six or if we were the three, they're going to come in
aggressive and I know their coach is going to have them ready to play so we
just have to be the same way and we just have to want it more.  
  
Q. Blake, can you just talk a little bit about the success you Beasley,
Love, other freshmen have had to, are you guys as amazed by it as us older
people are or is it just the way you are playing?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think that coming in, I knew that guys like Michael Beasley
and Kevin Love and O.J. and Derrick, I've been around them and I watched them
play, I played against them, I played with them, so I kind of knew what they
could do and I figured they would do pretty well, but I really didn't know how
well overall our freshmen class would do. And it has surprised me a little bit
with how many guys have stepped up and played big roles on their teams and
done so well and had so much success this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll have coach up here to make an
opening statement and then take questions.  
COACH CAPEL: We're excited to still be playing. We get to move on, play
against a very talented Louisville team who was tremendous last night in every
facet of the game, offensively, defensively, making threes, we're excited
about the challenge. Once again, we'll just like we were yesterday, no one
will expect us to win, won't predict us to win, but we'll show up and we'll
play and we'll see what happens. So we're excited to be here, excited to be
one of 32 left, and we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Start right here with questions.  
  
Q. Talk about specifically challenges of stopping this Louisville Cardinal
team. What impresses you most about them?  
COACH CAPEL: They made shots from the 3-point line at a high rate yesterday.
That's something that they haven't done all year long consistently. They are
very capable shooters, but that's something that especially as they headed
into the Big East tournament that they struggled with a little bit. If they're
making shots like that then that makes them even tougher to beat from beyond
the arc, one of the things they do, they do such a good job of harassing you
and pressuring you and creating scoring opportunities from their defense.
We're really going to have to value the basketball, be strong, make good
passes, and we want to look to attack their pressure, we'll attack it in a
smart manner. And we can't take bad shots. We have to understand the tempo of
the game and understand what's going on in the game to figure out what kind of
shots we get, if and when we break their pressure.  
  
Q. Can you talk Louisville's bench play. The last few games they have been
bringing Earl Clark off the bench it seems like, just talk about their bench,
I think they go like nine deep?  
COACH CAPEL: Well it happens when you have pros to come off the bench. Earl
Clark is a pro. Sosa is a kid that started for them a lot. They're extremely
talented all across the board. And they have a good number of big bodies, big
athletic bodies they can throw at you and with the style in which they play,
constant pressure, mixing up their presses, I think that it's probably good
for their team to play as many guys.  
But they're good, they're good all across the board, starters, I think that
some of those guys got some really valuable time with Padgett being out early
and some of those other guys, I think Palacios was out early, so some of those
guys got some valuable minutes, which has helped them.  
  
Q. Do we over simplify things when we say if your guards play well and your
team plays well?  
COACH CAPEL: No. It's usually that's the way it's been for us. When we get
good guard play, we usually play well.  
Yesterday was a really good example of that. I thought our guards played
really well, we were able to make shots which towards the end of the game that
opened up where I think because of the threes that David had made, where they
stopped doubling off of him, they allowed us to get one and one in the post.
And we feel like when we have that, with Blake and Longar, we like those guys
chances to score.  
  
Q. I wonder if your youth is an advantage in any way being a coach and
interacting with the kids?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't know. You have to ask them. I don't know what they will
say. But I am who I am. That's one of the things I learned very quickly when I
was named head coach at VCU at 27. And probably one of the best pieces of
advice I got, it came from my dad, and probably a day later in a conversation
with my college coach, and it was don't try to be anyone else but you. And
that's what I try to do. I'm 33, I like a lot of the same things our guys
like, my players like.  
Does it help? I don't know. I don't think it hurts. Because I do think there
is a line. There's a line where we draw, where I draw with them where they
have to understand that I am their coach. But I do want to be a friend to
them, I do want to be someone that they feel confident and comfortable coming
and talking to me, talking to me about anything, whether it's coming to my
office, I don't have an office hours, they don't have to set appointments,
they can just come in and see me. And we sit down and we talk about whatever,
really. Whatever's going on in their life. And if it's something about
basketball or they just want to talk about anything, so, sure, I think it
helps.  
  
Q. You only had nine turnovers yesterday as a team, and how much better have
Blake, Longar, because they have been doubled a lot this year, have gotten
getting rid of the ball out of doubles and not turning it over to your
shooters?  
COACH CAPEL: I think they have done a very good job, like you mentioned with
how much they have been doubled all year long. Especially Blake. I think
that's helped him get better. He's gained experience really probably from the
first game, especially since we went to New York, and we played Memphis and
Webb, from then on I think Blake's been doubled just about every game we have
played. And in some form. Whether it's post to post, coming from a guard or
whatever. So I think that's helped. But I think that we have done a pretty
good job in and knock on wood, I hope I don't jinx this, but I think we have
done pretty good job of valuing the ball all year long. Hopefully that
continues tomorrow.  
  
Q. Some of us got a chance to drop over to the Civil Rights Institute in
Birmingham this morning and could you address briefly what the Civil Rights
Era might have meant to your discipline of college basketball?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it means a lot. There's a program that ESPN has been
showing, Black Magic, that's phenomenal. I get emotional as I was watching it.
And you just see the things that people had to go through, people of color had
to go through. It's a shame that people had to go through that, but people
look at athletes as heroes. I look at those people as the real heroes. I look
at people like my grandfather, who organized citizens in North Carolina and
did different things like that, just so people could have basic freedom. I
think now people take that for granted. I know some young people probably take
that for granted and don't really understand, because they never had to go
through anything like those people had to go through.  
I didn't have to go through it as much. Because some of the things that my
grandparents and great grandparents and people went through and my parents
even so to speak went through.  
So it means a lot. It means a lot. And like I said, those are the real heroes.
And when I look at the opportunity that I have to be ahead coach, I know when
I was named the head coach at VCU there was a lot made about that, being 27, I
had quote unquote I had not paid my dues. That's what I heard. And I would
constantly say, you know, Ben Joe paid my dues, Coach McGlendon, Big House
Gaines, those guys, because of what they had to go through and endure to allow
myself or Tubby Smith or Paul Hewitt, guys like us to have an opportunity to
be head coaches at major programs. And you look at Coach Chaney, Coach John
Thompson. Those guys like that -- Nolan Richardson, those guys that paved the
way and had success and allowed opportunities for guys like myself to be on
this stage.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the journey this year for your team, it looks like
just looking on paper; it's been a kind of an up-and-down situation with
injuries and other things?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it has been, but our guys have continued to fight and
persevere, I've really enjoyed coaching this basketball team. I think we have
grown so much since the beginning of the year, last year was difficult for all
of us. But last year's team was really like coaching a team full of freshmen
because we really didn't have any experience with a new coach coming in, these
guys are learning so many different things. Our returning guys, I think, got
better over the summer, and I think experience last year helped them out but
then I think we got an influx of energy from our new guys.  
Obviously, we have a special talent, I think, in Blake, but then Cade Davis;
just the energy that he brings, Tony, Omar Leary, one of the things I think
that had helped us with earlier in the year was we were able to have really
good competitive practices as we started going through injuries, I think that
maybe that had something to do with our play being inconsistent because we
were very inconsistent in what we could do in practice. Some days we would
have eight guys, some days we would have ten. Some days we had a manager
practicing with us trying to do some five on five stuff.  
As we have gotten here, especially this week, in preparing for this
tournament, we have been pretty healthy, probably been as healthy as we have
been and so we were able to have good practices, which I think led to us
playing well yesterday. Hopefully that leaves us playing well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about David Padgett and how their offense kind of runs
through him and how you planned on defending him?  
COACH CAPEL: Well he's a really skilled player. I think he's probably a
really, I think he's a very under rated passer. And his feel for the game
allows Coach Pitino and their staff and their team to run stuff through him.
And it's not just on the block. They pull him away from the basket and dribble
hand off or have him screen. He does such a great job of knowing when to cut,
when to slip screens, knowing when to hit guys for back door passes, he just
has a great feel for the game of basketball. And that's something that's
really rare in today's game. Not many kids now have feel any more. And he's
able to do that. We have to do a good job on him. But you saw Louisville last
night, they're a really good team, even if he's not able, he picked up two
quick fouls and their offense still kept running. They have so many talented
guys, you can just go on and on about the talent that they have amassed on
their roster. Those guys play really hard. I think that they're selfless, and
they're good, they're really good.  
  
Q. On the flip side of that question that you got there, can you see how
some might think it's a big challenge for you going against a 55-year-old
coach who has taken three colleges to the Final Four?  
COACH CAPEL: No, I coached against Coach Knight.  
(Laughter.)  
I mean, if it were just like me and Coach Pitino one-on-one, I'd love my
chances there.  
(Laughter.)  
If we were on the court playing; but no, it's not. It's not about that. It's
Louisville against Oklahoma. I coached against some Legends. You look at Coach
Knight, you look at a guy at Virginia University, when I was at VCU, Dave
Robbins, who was probably the best coach I ever coached against, and how many
national titles he's won on the Division II level.  
So, no, I'm not intimidated, I respect the heck out of the man and respect
what he's done, every where he's been, but I'm excited about our team being
able to play Louisville.  
  
Q. You win a first round NCAA tournament game, and in your second year I'm
just curious, from your perspective, where you feel like this program is now?
It's had so much success in the past. You look at 20 years ago when these two
teams played in Birmingham and it was the number one seed then; is this
program what you thought it was coming in or have there been some pitfalls
that you have had to kind of overcome?  
COACH CAPEL: We have had to overcome a lot. But it's nothing that's been
unexpected. Any time you take over any new program, the majority would say
about 90 percent of the time you don't hear many coaches saying, "Oh, that's
easy. This is easy. This is easier than I expected."  
Usually it's some kind of challenge and obviously we faced some with some NCAA
stuff, some restrictions on recruiting, some different things like that. But
the thing that I've always told our guys is that you can't make excuses, you
have to figure out a way to make things happen. I have a poster that my wife
got me for Christmas of Jackie Robinson. And I got it framed under it, you
know, no excuses, make it happen. And it says don't complain, find a way,
that's actually what it says.  
And I was watching the story a special on Jackie Robinson when he first went
to the Brooklyn Dodgers, about how he couldn't complain. It was in his
contract that he couldn't complain. And you look at the pioneer that he was
for all black athletes. There's no reason to ever complain. You have to find a
way. That's life. You are going to go through pitfalls, highs and lows in life
and life is not going to slow down.  
You have to figure out a way and we found a way to win some basketball games
this year through all the adversity we've faced. Whether it's injuries,
whatever came our way, we found a way to get here and to be here and to be one
of 32 teams or I guess 31 left, Duke just lost, so be one of 32 teams left
playing. So we're excited about that and look forward to it.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about Blake. Can you kind of comment on how he's
so big, so athletic, the matchup problems he presents for other teams.  
COACH CAPEL: That's why teams double him. Usually, you don't double a guy that
you don't think can hurt you. And so he is a guy that can hurt you, teams have
to have a game plan for him. Usually that means doubling. We're interested to
see if Louisville will do that tomorrow.  
Like I said, in watching the tape on them, that's not something that I've seen
them do a lot. They play a lot of zone, which kind of negates that a little
bit. But in transition defense they have usually gotten back to man-to-man.
And so he is a guy, because of his strength, his size, his athleticism, he's
gotten more comfortable as the year's gone along with playing with his back to
the basket. That's something that was a challenge for him when he first got to
school when we first started playing because he's getting doubled now in
college, you can imagine how it was in Oklahoma high school basketball. He was
getting quadrupled, I guess. Even in AAU when he played. He really has -- it's
very frustrating for him, but the thing I've tried to tell him is look, man,
hopefully for the rest of your life you may not get single coverage. That
means you're pretty doggone good. And it's something you have to adapt to and
find a way. Now when you run the floor in transition they can't do you believe
you there. They can't do you believe you on the offensive rebound. So you have
to figure out different ways to have an impact and he's done that for us this
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH CAPEL: All right. Thanks.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get a started with questions for the student-athletes at
this time.  
  
Q. For any of the players. The consequences of the way the seeding went ends
up putting two 30-game winners together in the first round for the first time
in tournament history. Do you have any feeling of having the two teams being
so good to meet this early in the tournament or are you indifferent to that or
are all the players way past that by now?  
A.J. GRAVES: I think there's a bunch of other good teams playing as well in
the first and second rounds, so I don't think this is just a coincidence that
two teams have 30 wins. I think that there's a bunch of other teams that have
success that don't have 30 wins. So it's going to be a challenge tomorrow for
both teams to come out and try and get a win.  
MIKE GREEN: I'm over it. I'm over it.  
JULIAN BETKO: I think we left the feelings about the seedings in Indiana. And
all we care about now is which team is going to get to 31 wins.  
  
Q. A.J., I wonder when people call you guys a Mid Major, how do you feel
about that, and then secondly, the difference of having so many seniors on
this team has made for you guys.  
A.J. GRAVES: That's what we are is a Mid Major. That's just the label that
we're stuck with. And it's something that we don't -- I don't think we're --
we're indifferent to it, it's just something that we are. And it's something
that we have got to deal with. I think sometimes we embrace it. It's a part of
the culture that we have decided to play basketball in. And as far as having
five seniors on this team, I think that's what's led to some of our success to
playing tough games on the road. And to be able to have won our conference
scheduling and our tournament, there's a bunch of other guys on this team that
have led to our success as well. We got a good underclassmen group roster and
hopefully we can put it all together like we have and hopefully show up on
Sunday.  
  
Q. Talk about the fact that with the success Butler's had, you still feel
like bigger teams look at you as a Mid Major, do you think even when ya'll put
regular season games and people sort of maybe now respect Butler now maybe
than when y'all first got there?  
A.J. GRAVES: I think that no matter what teams are going to look at Mid Majors
as Mid Majors or look at teams as high majors or just from the conference that
they're in. But that doesn't mean that they're not going to respect you. I
mean, any team that wins 30 games or any team that makes the tournament for
that matter, I think you're going to get the respect that you need and we have
great respect for Tennessee, they're a very good team, and they're going to
come out ready to play on Sunday.  
  
Q. Guys, continuing on this same theme, you go to tournaments and play the
so called BCS conference schools and this year you beat every one of them you
played. And you get in the Horizon League you lose a game or two here or
there. What's the league play like for you guys like after you've been out
playing in the great Alaska Shoot-out or preseason NIT and then you go into
league play, what's that like?  
JULIAN BETKO: I think that Horizon League is one of the most under rated
conferences. There's a lot of teams with a lot of good athletes, great
players, and good coaches. So especially going on the road after the success
we had is very challenging and a lot of teams that we play get their biggest
crowds and players are into it. So in order to win on the road in the Horizon
League we have to be tough and play together as a team for 40 minutes. And I
think that we have been pretty successful with that this year carrying a
target from last year's success and now, yeah, we did slip up twice, but we
learned from it and it made us a better team.  
A.J. GRAVES: I think a lot of people try to draw comparisons like that and we
don't get, we're not fortunate enough to play those teams twice or three
times. We only get one shot. Whereas, when we're in our own conference we get
to play those teams two or three times and so there's a lot more familiarity
with that going along. So that's about the only thing I can draw from that.  
  
Q. Mike, Tennessee likes to apply a lot of pressure on its opponents, double
teaming and try to force turnovers, what do you remember about the way the
Vols attacked you guys last season?  
MIKE GREEN: The same way they played against all their other opponents. I
don't remember much from our game specifically, but I have seen them since
then and they like to pressure you and get after you. And they pride their
self on forcing turnovers. And we got to do a good job of handling the
basketball.  
  
Q. You played for an older coach and now a younger coach, I wonder if there
are any differences, if maybe you respond to him a little differently or a
little better because he's closer to your age, those sorts of things?  
MIKE GREEN: Not at all. I guess when you're looking at a game 9:30 to 10 p.m.
around that time you can send him a text message and he'll be up watching that
same game. So that's probably like the biggest difference, he stays up a
little later and wakes up a little earlier.  
  
Q. Chris and JaJuan were asked this in their part of their press conference,
you guys, you A.J. and Mike and Chris and JaJuan are the two highest scoring
career-wise back courts in the NCAA tournament this year. Talk about going
against them with that in mind.  
MIKE GREEN: It's pretty similar to the last game. They had two good guards
too. And we try not to get caught up in back court versus back court. As you
can see, we got other guys that can play this game and have been playing this
game all year long. But you can take nothing away from them two guy, they're
great players.  
  
Q. Other than being able to text message your coach late at night, what did
Coach Stevens do different or did he do anything different to sort of put his
mark on this team this year?  
MIKE GREEN: I guess you get your mark when you're named head coach. It is your
team from there on. And I mean we pretty much just, most of the same things we
still do, but the thing about this coaching staff is not only Coach Stevens,
you can call up any of these guys around that time and talk to them. And they
let you know when they see something going, not going so well or when it is
going well, the feedback is a lot more than it was last year. Maybe because we
got five seniors and we got our input too, but we get a lot of feedback from
these guys.  
  
Q. How much differently now that you've seen film does Tennessee look with
Dane Bradshaw there at the four last year and now with Tyler Smith at the
four?  
JULIAN BETKO: As long as I remember Bradshaw was a very tough player. He was
the heart and soul of that team and he was the one of the guys that was the
leader on that team. And Tyler Smith provides a lot of attack in the paint and
provides athleticism. So it's a different type of player, but I think that
they're both very important for their team and they both were very good
players and are good leaders.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, guys. We'll now take start with an
opening statement for Coach Stevens and then take questions.  
COACH STEVENS: I think any time that you're in the NCAA tournament and you're
back either practicing or playing on Saturday, that's a good thing. So we're
excited to have another opportunity. We're looking forward to competing
tomorrow and recognize it's a heck of a challenge in front of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stevens?  
  
Q. Talk about the experience the seniors that your team brings into the game
tomorrow against Tennessee and how might that play to your advantage?  
COACH STEVENS: When you talk about experience, I think that term and the word
that comes to mind that's very important tomorrow is poise. You have to play
with a high sense of urgency, you have to play with great toughness and you
have to combine that with poise. And I don't think that's a thing that is easy
to do and I think that's where we'll have to lean on our experience to be
successful. They really, really try to force you to be poised, if that's a
word, and our guys, you know, have done a great job so far this year, so it
will be an interesting challenge for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Everybody survived the first round and we're well into the tournament by
now, but we have never had two 30-game winners have to match up this early in
the tournament. Do you have any feeling now of the way the committee set this
up, that you would have two teams arranged in the top-10 playing in the second
round, it seems like kind of a disconnect.  
COACH STEVENS: It is what it is. And again, we're not getting in to seeding or
the number next to our name and at the end of the tournament there's going to
be one team left standing. And the other 64 will have, they will have regrets
and they won't, they will no longer have a chance. -- if you want to achieve
the ultimate goal, then you have to play teams no matter when you play them
and we're excited to get a chance to play in the tournament.  
We have said that all along and certainly no matter when you play Tennessee,
whether it's in the first round or the last round, you got an unbelievable
challenge in front of you.  
  
Q. Tyler Smith, Tennessee's power forward leads his team in assists and is a
capable scorer as well, can you talk a little about the unusual challenge he
presents for the defense?  
COACH STEVENS: You know what, it's funny, he has an unbelievable challenge for
our defense, first, and foremost. But it's not an unusual thing to us from the
standpoint of we play a lot of fours that are somewhat either undersized or
very, very skilled at our level.  
So, we get a chance to play against -- I don't think we played against anybody
as good as Tyler Smith at that spot, and I think he's a heck of a player and I
think they have really benefited from him this year?  
But as far as guys running through their offense at the four and guys that
make plays at the four, that is a unique aspect of basketball at the non-BCS
level that we're fairly familiar with.  
  
Q. I wondered if you could talk about the continuity of coaches that have
come through Butler and how important do you think that is to maintain what
you have been able to do?  
COACH STEVENS: Well, I think it's been very important to maintaining. I think
that one of the things that I have tried to do is tweak as necessary, be my
own person, but by no means change what's going on.  
One of the reasons we have had success is because we have guys that have
really bought into the system as a whole, that believe in what we do on both
ends of the floor and that play for the name on the front of their jerseys and
by no means would I have been smart to change that. So that's what I tried to
do as much, bring as much continuity as possible and I think that's what Coach
Matta tried to do and he did a great job. Coach Lickliter tried to do, he did
a great job. And I'm just trying to do the best job I can today.  
  
Q. Follow-up on that, was it a relief for you then knowing Butler's
reputation to get to the tournament and do what you've been able to do here?
Did you feel pressure to continue on when you take a job like this?  
COACH STEVENS: I know this is going to for David and people that have been
around me every day, there is some external pressure, but I focused on today
and the task at hand and our players have focused on that and we have talked
about that since October 12, if we were concerned about external things, about
things we can't control, I don't think we would be in the position we are. Our
guys have done a great job of doing their job and making sure that that was
their only intent and their only focus. And I have tried to maintain that same
even keeled approach on a day-to-day basis and in that way I've been able to
enjoy the journey and not worry about what the future and what the big picture
may hold, because as I've been told before, the big picture doesn't reveal
itself until it's all said and done. So we'll let whatever happens, happen.  
  
Q. Thad Matta and Todd Lickliter are obviously good friends besides being
coaching colleagues of yours, have you been in touch with them at all during
the NCAA tournament and has that had offered you any saying advice for how to
take on the Vols since he played them this year?  
COACH STEVENS: We ever been in touch with those guys, those guys have always
been great to us and encouraging and they're both Butler grads so, you know,
certainly they're rooting for Butler and they ever been great.  
Certainly you're always looking for any advice you can get, especially when
you're playing a team that's as talented and as well coached as Tennessee. So
sure, we certainly have had -- we have certainly talked.  
  
Q. Bruce Pearl's kind of shaking up his point guard position a little bit,
I'm just wondering about the different challenges that presents when they have
different types of point guards and also what you've seen from J.P. Prince who
is kind of the newest addition to that position.  
COACH STEVENS: I think that that's a really good question, because they all
bring different strengths to the table. They all play different ways.  
And Tennessee's a great team with all of them on the floor, despite the fact
they're different players. And as far as Prince goes, obviously Prince is a
tremendous athlete a guy that brings a lot of energy, a guy that makes place
in transition, can make plays on a second chances, can make plays off the
drive. And he certainly is a guy that we have a great deal of respect for.  
  
Q. Certainly it's two different teams from last year, but what do you draw
from playing this team last year to take into preparation?  
COACH STEVENS: You're right, it's two different teams. It's a very different
basketball game. We're both six months or five months into our season right
now. Last year we were one month into our season. So that was a pretty unique
situation.  
You look at it and you try to draw what you can, but recognize that this is a
totally different game tomorrow than last November.  
  
Q. We were asking players before and they said the biggest difference with
you as a head coach is they can text message you at 10:30 at night and they
knew you would text back. But they also said they got more feedback this year
from you than maybe before, maybe because they're seniors. Talk about that
relationship with five seniors that kind of know what they're doing and that
have come through this.  
COACH STEVENS: I've always had a really good relationship with those guys,
even throughout the recruiting process. And they have been a great group to be
around and it's interesting going from assistant coach to head coach and I've
had a bunch of people ask, well have you changed the way you interact with
them, and I didn't think that was really the right approach with those guys. I
have known them, they know me, they know that I'm going to do the best I can
to put them in position to have success.  
I know that they care, I know that they're respectful, I know that they're
good people who want to do well for Butler. And so our relationship's stayed
the same. We have had a lot of fun together and that's part of the reason we
focused day-to-day, because I've really enjoyed just being around this group
and they have laid it on the line every night for 33 games and even the three
games we weren't successful they put it all out there and they have been a
special group of guys.  
  
Q. Matt Howard was such an impact guy for you, I wonder, was he a five star,
a bluer chip recruit than y'all are used to or not?  
COACH STEVENS: Matt had offers from many BCS -- had many BCS opportunities.
Whether that makes him -- I don't know. All our guys are five stars in our
eyes. They may not be five stars to other people, but the way that we look at
them and what we're trying to build as far as team and put skill sets together
and those type of things, rankings don't really come into play, but just like
every other one of our guys, Matt was an important person to us in the
recruiting process and he chose Butler for the right reasons. He wanted to get
a great education, he wanted to play basketball at a high level and he wanted
to be around great teammates.  
  
Q. Couple things, I hope nobody got injured doing cart wheels, or is that
cart wheels only after some victories?  
COACH STEVENS: No cart wheels. No cart wheels of the those are for unique
times.  
  
Q. The other question is, any special plans for anything for Easter services
for any of the guys or it's just kind of a unusual situation to be playing on
Easter?  
COACH STEVENS: It is unusual and we have actually got that worked out. So
we'll give them their options and I know my wife's working on an Easter he go
hunt for the little kids, so we'll make sure that those, the little ones who
are with us are taken care of and know that the Easter bunch knee comes to
Birmingham.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.  
COACH STEVENS: Thanks.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and start with an opening statement from Coach
Graham and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH GRAHAM: I thought the big key was the start of the game. We talk about
getting off to a good start and I thought they set the tone at the beginning
of the game versus us setting the tone. And from that point on we scrambled to
catch up. I thought we cut it to 18 to 15 at one point and probably the thing
that hurt us the most obviously the pressure kept us out of some of our
offense, but I thought the thing where they did the best job is they hit the
threes and we didn't.  
Them shooting the threes against the zone and I thought it extended their lead
on us and that was the thing that hasn't been the strong suit for them all
year but tonight it definitely was. And it was, it's been our strong suit and
tonight it wasn't.  
So I thought that was the key to the game this evening.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler, what was, was it an up lifting moment when you saw David Padgett
going to the bench with his second foul early on in the first half?  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: I didn't really look at it that way because they got so many
good players coming off the bench anyways. We know all their players coming
off the bench can score and defend, so it wasn't like, yes, we have a chance
now, it's we just got to go and keep playing our game and you think that's
what we tried to do.  
  
Q. If you guys can talk about just how difficult it was to get into your
offense seems like they extended you because of their pressure.  
MATT NELSON: Going to the game that was a big focus, handling their pressure.
We were working on it all week in practice and I think we did a decent job
handling the pressure or the pressure for the most part. But, yeah, it's tough
when you got big long athletic guys just flying everywhere, playing hard, and
it's tough to get into your sets, but I think we did a decent job for a lot of
the game. It's just they were just feeling it from the 3-point line tonight.
At that I think we had a good game plan tonight really. We executed it well
too. It's just we didn't expect them to shoot 50 percent from the 3-point
line.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: To go along with what Matt said, yeah, we for the most part I
think we did a good job of handling the pressure. We had a few key turnovers,
but the game plan I think the thing that hurt us the most was the 3-point shot
is and the pressure didn't bother us I don't think as much as people think it
did.  
  
Q. You two are two of the four seniors, you just played, I know it's very
fresh, finished playing your final game for Boise State. Can you talk about
going out this way, but still the effort that you continued to give throughout
the contest tonight.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: It's a tough way to go out losing, but hey, we made it this
far. It's been a wild ride and unbelievable experience and can't say enough
about the four seniors on our team and how we just battled this whole year
just to prove people wrong. And it's just been an awesome experience and I
couldn't ask for anything more for a senior year.  
MATT NELSON: He said it pretty much perfectly. These guys, the four seniors
and our whole team, it's, we have been so tight and stuck together through
thick and thin all year. It's been crazy, a crazy season. A lot of ups, a few
down, but overall we did a lot of great things this year and it's tough to go
out on a loss, but we can't look at that we have to think about the good
things and we had a lot of them this year and there's nothing better to go out
with these guys.  
I made like best friends really, these guys are like my best friends pretty
much, so there's been no better way to go out than with them.  
  
Q. Either one of you guy, how tough of a matchup is Earl Clark number five
for Louisville because he's 6'10 " and he can dribble like that?   
TYLER TIEDEMAN: He's a professional prospect. You can tell by just looking at
him. When he moves to the three spot it's a tough matchup, especially for me,
because he's so long, so big and he hit a few big threes today that we weren't
expecting for him to hit. And he gets the rim so easy, he deflects passes,
gets steals, and just moves real well for how big he is. And he's going to be
a great player.  
  
Q. If you guys could just talk about settling in, it was 10-1, then you cut
it to 18-15. At that point how confident were you against these guys?  
MATT NELSON: We're pretty confident team. We don't ever think we're going to
lose or think we can't compete with anyone. I think there was a few jitters at
the start of the game just because we were overly excited and once we settled
in we played pretty tough. I think the score didn't look that way like the
game was that close and, but I mean we battled and I think we played a good
game.  
They just had a great game. They're a tough team to beat when they're shooting
the three like they did. Because they have so many great players, they have a
great inside game, obviously, and that's what we focused on. And they just
stepped out and hit the three and nothing we could really he do about it. But
I thought we had a good game and battled hard all game and that's all you can
really ask for.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they did that kind of took the team out of the
3-point feel that you usually have, especially coming back in the second half
you've been able to hit those and pull yourself back into the game.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: They're, definitely, the pressure they put on you, they extend
your offense and really like get you out of your sets, trying to just pressure
the ball and it's tough to get our main focus is to penetrate and pitch out
and try to find a three. And it's tough to penetrate when you're getting so
much pressure and it was just shots weren't falling tonight and some nights
that happens. You got to live and die by the three.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. You guys are welcome to head back to
your locker room. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Was it any kind of focus to go after David Padgett early on in the
game?  
COACH GRAHAM: No, but we're -- the inside game is a big part of ours. Nellie's
really hard to guard in there because he's quick and strong and he has very
good post moves. And we told him to attack him when you get it. It wasn't,
we're just going to come here and go to you every time, because that's not how
we play. But when we get it we want our big guys to go to the basket like they
have done all year.  
And Nellie is a tough matchup for everybody. And I was obviously glad when he
got two fouls and was out. But I looked at the stats here and one of our keys
was if we could control the paint well. We controlled the paint pretty well
from the scoring standpoint and rebounding standpoint or neutralized the
paint. But the 3-point line just killed us tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about their 3-points, was the key was it the strategy to sit
in the zone and hope they just didn't go or could you not guard them man-to-
man what was that all about?  
COACH GRAHAM: We wanted to pack it in a little bit, take away the paint, and
the 3-point game is not their strong suit. Except tonight.  
You got to kind of pick your poison a little bit. And we were going to try to
control the paint and make them have to shoot it to beat us. And they did.  
Normally I'm hoping those 3-point stats were switched the other way around.
But they weren't. They shot the ball very well and did a good job against our
zone and Palacios stepped outside and hit a couple against the zone. When the
four man is stepping out shooting it, it makes it very hard to guard. And
they're, you know, they're a very good team. They can hurt you a lot of
different ways, with size, with speed, and when they're shooting the ball, if
they shoot the ball that well, the rest of the tournament, they will be able
to make a deep run into this thing.  
  
Q. You just had four seniors walk off that floor for the final time in blue
and orange. Can you talk about the way they finished up?  
COACH GRAHAM: One of the things we said in the locker room was to make sure
that they take a look at the picture of what they accomplished. Winningest
team in the history of the school, most school wins, first team to ever win
WAC titles, won two of them, their all league accomplishments. And that
because you get so, I don't want to say hung up, but the game is right now in
the present and that's what they think about. But those four guys did way more
than anybody ever expected them to do or dream of them to do. Matt Bauscher,
nobody ever expected a young man from Idaho and from Boise ever to play and do
all the things he's done. Tyler was trying to say this, they probably created
their best friends for the rest of their lives. And that part's probably just
as important as a good thing too.  
So they will be four, I guess I should say eight big shoes to fill and I know
they're going to miss it, and I know I'm definitely going to miss them and but
we'll just have to manage.  
  
Q. How do you account for somebody like Earl Clark, a 6'10 " guy who can
move like he can?   
COACH GRAHAM: Usually we handle him by the draft, that and let him get picked
up and get out of here. He's a good player. He's even better in person than he
is on tape. I didn't think he was quite that good a player. But he, because a
lot of scouts have talked about him and so forth, and he just creates so many
problems. I don't think there's one thing he does super outstanding, he just
does everything pretty good. And that's more dangerous. He can handle it at
that size and get to the basket, he can rebound, he gets his hands on a lot of
balls, he's just a very talented young man that's got an awfully bright
future.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH GRAHAM: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
Coach Martelli and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, we offer our congratulations to Oklahoma, wish them well
going forward. And the beauty of the tournament is the young guy getting 25
points, comes in averaging eight, those things kind of happen.  
Technically, it got away from us in the last 8:07 of the first half. We had 13
possessions, six turnovers, one for five from the field and one for four from
the foul line and then you're working your way back uphill.  
We kind of felt sorry for ourselves at half time. I didn't think we came out
with the proper frame of mind in the second half and they made us pay. And
then we spent the rest of the game trying to get a game feel to it. Put a
little game pressure on them.  
Unfortunately, for all the excitement that goes into being in the tournament,
this is the reality. 32 teams go home and we're one of those teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. For either of you guys, of all the Oklahoma guys to kind of go off did
you expect it would be David Godbold?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well, the way we prepared, we prepared for like to guard
everybody. And it was unexpected, but we were also prepared for it. And it
just kind of got out of hand.  
  
Q. For both of you, can you talk about the difference of running into a
front line like Oklahoma has where you don't really run into something like
that in the Atlantic 10, with that size and strength down on the blocks and
they seemed to really kind of take advantage of having that size like you guys
talked about leading up to today.  
AHMAD NIVINS: Oklahoma has a really talented front court. And the fact that
they have been, they have seen every kind of double team and every kind of
trap in the post helped them a lot in this game. But we just wanted to attack
them and try to keep them off balance. But they it seemed as if they were more
relaxed and we just had to fight uphill for the rest of the game and we didn't
come home with a win.  
ROB FERGUSON: Well, we played against many different types of front courts,
but that was obviously the biggest and the strongest that we played against.
And it was a challenge. I think for the most part that we stepped up to it.
But like Ahmad said, we, at the end, we lost the game.  
  
Q. Rob, can you talk about your offensive performance tonight, you came out
hot right from the start and led through the day. Were you just feeling good
or what was that a product of?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well that was just the fact that I just didn't want to go home
today. The way we practiced the past couple of days, I felt like that we
couldn't lose and like my confidence was high and I just felt like my whole
team had my back. And that's it.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, what happened, what were they doing at the end of
the first half to kind of clamp down on you guys defensively?  
ROB FERGUSON: Well I don't feel like it was they were clamping down on us,
towards the end we kind of gave the game away. Like we had unforced turnovers,
dropping passes, throwing the ball away, and like that was kind of -- that was
for the most part that was on us.  
AHMAD NIVINS: I think we kind of dug a hole for ourselves offensively. And
just plays that we normally can execute, we didn't execute. I think that was a
huge momentum swing. Especially at the end of the half. And I think that's why
it got as ugly as it did.  
  
Q. Guys, at points in the second half did they start to seem like the hole
was too deep, the 19 point deficit in the second half, I mean storming back
you got to within four, but did it just get too large there in the second
half?  
ROB FERGUSON: I don't think so, because we have been in holes before and we
fought our way back into it and we won games like that. And we also lost
games. But we never once felt like we were out of it. We just kept fighting
and fighting, because that's what we do.  
  
Q. For both guys, there's a stretch there, especially Ahmad, you had a, you
were doing pretty well on defense without drawing fouls, you got unlucky in a
couple of minutes and had a couple guys foul out at the end. What impact did
that have on your continuity just trying to make this comeback?  
AHMAD NIVINS: Well you're going to have troubles like that. Especially in a
tournament like this. You are going to, you're not going to get some calls,
things aren't going to go your way, shots aren't going to fall. But it's just
a matter of staying together and keeping fighting. And we had it, but we let
it out of our grasp and now we're on the losing end.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you guys, you can head back to your locker room, if
you would like. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. In that last eight minutes of the first half, how much of it was their
defense or do you feel your team may have lost its poise for awhile?  
COACH MARTELLI: I think we played faster than would normally be a positive
situation for us. I just think we started to go just a tad faster. And we're
not a team that should play fast, we should play quick.  
I think there was a little bit of a cushion that we gave them a mental
cushion, in that we had it and were comfortable the way the game was being
played and then when they really turned it up a notch, I don't think that we
turned up our thought process as high as it should have been.  
  
Q. Kind of like I asked the players, of all the guys on the on your scouting
or whatever, where is Godbold on the list and how surprised were you when he
kind of went off like that?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well the guy that we had as the wild card to be honest with
you was Crocker. If you study their numbers, and their wins, their third
scorer has always been Crocker. We studied it enough to know that it was
Crocker, we actually started the game with our post double team being off of
Godbold. We didn't know that Godbold would start until 20 minutes before the
game.  
I wouldn't change it. I would not change it. And in the second half, when he
got going a little bit, I think that to be honest with you, again, we were
feeling sorry for ourselves at the offensive end of the floor, and not really
executing defensively.  
We obviously changed our post defense trap after he made a couple of shots,
even in the first half. But he's not, I'm not saying that he's sixth, but he
might have been fourth, but certainly Crocker was the guy that we had labeled
as the wild card.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you thought they felt sorry for themself at half time
in the locker room?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, no, no. I think that going into half time there was a
point where you feel sorry for yourself because the ball's not going in. Now
we're in there down 12 and the response offensively was okay, but we gave up
15 points in the first five minutes. And got ourselves down 19. And it was the
same thing. It was just that little bit of woe is me because my ball's not
going in, and not really covering everybody defensively, conference each other
defensively the way that we have to to be successful.  
  
Q. Do you think Pat struggled because of Godbold's physical play?  
COACH MARTELLI: Sure. If you look at and I go back to our St. Louis game and I
said to our team, the blueprint was out there now. That, bump us off, take us
out of comfortable rotations of the ball, and you could get us to freeze and
hold the ball. And I certainly thought that that happened. And I think that
with Pat offensively it is a confidence even with all the success that he had,
he was 1-7 on twos. And he's the biggest wing in the game. So it's unfortunate
that he had a wonderful, wonderful year, he just didn't have a great game
today.  
  
Q. Godbold was in here talking about, as a senior he didn't want to go home.
Rob said almost word for word the same thing. He also had a great game
offensively, talk about what Rob has meant to the program and what he's done
this year.  
COACH MARTELLI: Rob Ferguson is a very interesting guy. Because he has those
kind of gifts. And he's somewhat reluctant to put those gifts out there. I
think sometimes when you play this game and you strive to play it at a high
level you have to be willing to fail. And Rob Ferguson for three years
probably wasn't willing to fail. He wanted to be safe. And he didn't want to
let anybody down.  
This year he was asked to come outside of himself to play a different role
defensively, which he did. And by the way, I thought Ahmad and Rob Ferguson
did a fine job on Longar and Blake. They had 26 points, but that's not the
problem. But Rob Ferguson was asked to be more vocal, when he's not vocal. And
it sounds odd, but you kind of fill up with pride when you see him with tears
in his eyes, because it meant that much to him. And you hope that that message
is passed on to the younger players.  
Because it's really hard. You're taking off that uniform for the last time,
but I do think that his performance tonight. And all year long, Rob Ferguson
emptied himself, he came outside of himself, and then he emptied himself and
that's all you can ask a young guy to do, really.  
  
Q. Would you say this was one of your more unpredictable teams?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, I don't think so. I know, like I know what my team is and
I've known all year what my team was. So I didn't really find it to be
unpredictable. The one thing they did is they came every day, no matter what
happened the game before, they always came every day. They wanted to be
coached.  
So I didn't see it as being unpredictable, I think that for a team that had
success we were 15-5 at one point, we had some great wins. There was a self
confidence issue all year long. And I think that by staying calm with them as
much as I could, I didn't want to add, I never added to that uncertainty that
they had.  
But certainly you could see it on their faces and their body language the
second half against Temple, tonight in that run from the end of the first half
to the beginning of the second half. And it was a confidence and a self
confidence, because it was not like the coaches were down or it was a harsh
atmosphere, it was just plain and simple not confident enough about the next
play and always wondering and probably in a lot of ways worrying.  
  
Q. To kind of build on that, you said many times during the year that the
team just wasn't quite getting that level of play that you thought they were
capable of. Is that now going to be something that is going to kind of bother
you that they didn't hit that level and then sustain it and kind of fell
short?  
COACH MARTELLI: More the sustain than anything else. Look, plain and simple,
that team, my team, had a great year. We got one of six non-BCS bids, we were
in, we were out, we were in, we were out. They had to deal with all that
energy, that whether I talked about it or didn't, they were on the Internet,
you know, that was a great year. That was a great year. To be one of the 65
teams selected for this tournament, really is a terrific year.  
What I will study is why was it not sustained. Was it lack of depth, was it
lack of foot speed. You know, do you need to get better guard play, do you
need to be stronger, do you need to play more zone. So all of those kind of
things enter into it. But more sustained than any sleep less nights over why
was it, why did we fluctuate.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH MARTELLI: Thank you very much.

COACH PEARL: Just congratulations to American University. They represented
themselves and the patriot league extremely well.  
They made shots, particularly Carr was just spectacular. They played with
great energy. Particularly on the offensive boards where we knew they really
run to the boards and they bothered us early. With their offensive rebounding.  
But, I thought we were able to turn them over. And I think our press was
particularly effective and without pressure defense, we would have been in
perhaps more of a similar situation to what Duke was in last night. Going up
against a great team, very well-coached, very-well spaced, but it was nine
assists and 22 turnovers, I think, I think that was probably a big difference,
as well as these three guys sitting to my left.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. JaJuan, why did the offense appear to be so out of sync most of the
game?  
JAJUAN SMITH: There was a great defensive team out there. We just weren't
playing our ball, we were a little sloppy with you but we turned it on in the
second half and made plays.  
  
Q. Tyler and Wayne, guys, talk about that sequence there at the end. I
thought it was a big one when Tyler came up with the block and then down at
the other end Wayne the 3-point to put you guys back up about 10. Maybe both
of you could talk about that.  
TYLER SMITH: We were trying to make a play and force our team. Our last outing
we got kind of frustrated because of the bigs and as far as rebounding, but we
were trying to come in and show that we were trying to make a defensive effort
and Wayne came down and made a big shot for us.  
WAYNE CHISM: Well, we wanted to run anyway, but Tyler came in with a good
block so you transitioned off, and it was pretty good, so once Tyler cut to
the basket, they left a trail wide open and I let one go and it went in.  
  
Q. Defense, guys, has not been real good the last few games, much better
today. Is that something that you really concentrated on?  
TYLER SMITH: Of course. They had two great players that we were trying to slow
down as far as Carr and Mercer. And we put one of our best defenders and Carr
and had JaJuan on the other guard.  
  
Q. For Wayne, can you just talk about hitting those threes and just the
difference in your confidence now versus maybe a year ago playing in the
tournament as a freshman?  
WAYNE CHISM: When I came in as a freshman I think I played pretty good as a
freshman. When I entered the tournament -- I mean I did good things in the
tournament as a freshman. But coming into this tournament I had two fouls in
the first half and two points. So I had to come out in the second half and
play better. And coach came out with a quick play for me and I hit that one
and then it came down to another one and I kept going on and Tyler went for a
lay up and missed, so I picked my team up on offense big time because I
changed on defense in the first half.  
  
Q. I'm sure you all were well prepared by your coach for this team, but did
you really believe how good they could be and did you have to make up a little
bit during the game early in the game?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Coach prepared us for a close game. He's been telling us all
week long how close this game was going to be. We were well prepared, been
getting up early in the morning for this early game. So we were real focused
for this.  
TYLER SMITH: Having a player like Carr, as far as you got -- another Chris out
there so we had to watch him shoot and he could get a shot any time and one
player can beat you if he gets that shot. But they were a great team and they
came out with a lot of effort. But coach had us as far as defense, ready to
play them.  
THE MODERATOR: No further questions for the student-athletes we'll let you
guys get back to the locker room and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Could you, as the second-half progressed, could you see American's
confidence building? Could you see them believing more as the game wore on?  
COACH PEARL: I thought they came in confident. I thought they came in knowing
that they could play with us.  
I actually felt like our confidence was building as the second half -- as the
second half wore on.  
I thought American came here to win the game and knew that they, if they
played well, I think watching Belmont last night had to be encouraging for
them. We were in a 2-15 game against Winthrop and Chris Lofton had to make a
shot to win. This is the NCAA tournament. And no matter how we try and prepare
you guys to understand that this is what it is, you get -- you just think that
we're supposed to roll out there and knock these guys off and in a huge way.
And we shot 49 percent from two, we were the more patient team with only 45
shots. As opposed to American's 58 shots. Now part of that was they did a good
job on the offensive boards but we made 1 percent of our free throws, those
are really good offensive statistics that good teams have to do.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Brian and Ramar sitting out the first half and also
rebounding and their advantage on the boards.  
COACH PEARL: We're trying to get better point guard play and so J.P. Prince
played a lot of point guard tonight.  
When Jordan Howell, I thought, struggled some in the first half I just I went
with Ramar. And then Brian had no points and five fouls in his last game. And
just wasn't pleased with his performance, against Arkansas, and so went with
Ryan Childress in the first half. And then at half time some of it worked and
some of it didn't.  
  
Q. It looked like you guarded your team guarded a lot harder in the last 15
minutes than they did the first 25 minutes. That's what it looked like?  
COACH PEARL: Yeah. Well, American shot 31 percent in the first half, they lead
their league in field goal percentage at about 44. And they only made two
3-points in the first half, both by Carr.  
I think maybe in the last ten minutes or so American got a little tired. They
may have fatigued. And so I don't know that we played any more effectively
lately, but they had just, you know, being pressed and guarding the way we
guard, we didn't sit back, there wasn't any zone, Carr plays 40 minutes and
Mercer plays 39. I think that fatigue may have been a bit of a factor and we
played a lot more guys than they did.  
  
Q. They out rebounded you by 39-27. They get 18 offensive rebounds, a lot of
the balls were bouncing their way, but how disturbing is that?  
COACH PEARL: They had great energy on the offensive boards. And they do that
all year long. They have got a pretty good idea -- couple things: They got a
pretty good idea when Carr's going to shoot the ball. And because you have to
have your bigs out there hedging him and doubling him some, when shots are
taking place your inside guys aren't inside their guys.  
So, it's really not a checkout situation, it's a race to the boards. In the
next game, watch Butler. And watch Butler's ball screen, and spread out. And
watch Butler's guys run to the boards and there's no one there to check them
out. Because you're out there doubling Garrison, doubling Mercer, doubling
Graves or Green, and that's what can happen with spread and good ball screen
offense. And that's why they're a very, very effective offensive rebounding
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH PEARL: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started. We'll take an opening statement
from the coach and then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH JONES: Well, we're disappointed with the outcome, but I certainly
couldn't be any more proud of the team, of a group of young men than I am of
our guys.  
As they have all year long, they battled. It wasn't pretty, but we scraped and
I think we pushed Tennessee pretty hard, therefore, the most part of the game.
Tennessee proved why they're such an outstanding team, that was over on the
side there and I heard a couple of Bruce's comments, and I think he's right, I
think ultimately they wore us down. And so certainly they're a great
basketball team, it was a great challenge for our team. I thought our guys
stepped up to the challenge, but unfortunately, we weren't quite up to it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Garrison, take us down about six minutes left and you make another
comeback, you're down by one. You're a 15 seed, you're going against a number
two seed. What's the feeling, what's the mood, what's it like for you guys at
that point?  
GARRISON CARR: Well, at that moment, when we were making our run, I really
felt like the crowd was behind us, because when we made a basket, to cut the
lead, it really exploded in the gym.  
At that moment, we had the opportunity to control the game, but we made a big
play and Tennessee came right back down and knocked a three down, I think it
was, and took the lead. And while we were making our run, just played like the
number two seed and like a number one team in the nation and they made their
runs right back and they didn't let us get a solid lead.  
  
Q. Coach Jones and any players that would like to address this, defending
Chris Lofton today, what was your game plan and how did it execute as the game
played out?  
GARRISON CARR: Well, we were obviously no help off Chris Lofton, because he's
an excellent player and he deserves all the accolades that he gets. And all
week we were simply continuing to use no help off him, we went through all the
play that they have for him to get his shots. And basically, all we were just
practicing getting through screens, anticipating when the screens would come
and my teammates did a great job of helping me when he was off, when he came
open on screens and hedging out, but for the most part it wasn't just an
individual effort, it was a team effort to stop him.  
DERRICK MERCER: Just like Garrison said, we tried to focus more on Lofton and
we were using no help, if he set a back screen we were telling our bigs to get
through the back screen and stay with him and because we know he's dangerous
and he also can take it to the basket. So we put our attention on Lofton and
we worked hard, we did breakdown drills, dribble handoffs, coming off screens
and just trying to defend the best we can.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard Coach Jones just now talking about last night's
game Duke and Belmont. Did you watch the game and did you take anything out of
it? Obviously, you're here to win anyway, though.  
BRIAN GILMORE: Sure, we watched it. We watched, got to see a little bit of the
end of it when we got back from dinner last night. And that just reinforced
our belief that a 15 seed beating a 2 seed is definitely possible. Coach
mentioned it going into our meeting last night, just reinforced the fact that
he believed in us as a team to come out here and play against Tennessee today
and if we did the things that we knew we were capable of doing and controlled
what we could control, that we would give ourselves an opportunity to be right
there with them just as Belmont was.  
GARRISON CARR: We watched the game and basically just reinforced what can
happen when the ball's thrown in the air. Because the seedings are just
numbers next to a name. But when the ball is thrown in the air, those go away
and you still have to play and Belmont put it all on the line, which they were
supposed to do, but Duke was able to pull away with the win. And it was just
another example of many in the past of 15s playing 2s tough.  
  
Q. Did you guys did you lose your legs there in the last five minutes? Was
it a pretty grueling way to go?  
GARRISON CARR: Towards the end of the game I did get a little bit tired. But
when it's crunch time and adrenaline kicks in you forget about that, and
you're just out there playing basketball. Because the atmosphere out there and
how close the game was, I didn't have time to think about being tired and I
was just out there playing.  
  
Q. Did you guys get the sense that you were close to breaking Tennessee's
sort of if you would have gotten through frequently getting the ball back that
they would have panicked. Did you ever feel like you ever got sort of close to
that breaking point with them?  
BRIAN GILMORE: I think we did. We knew that even if we did get up, get a lead
that they were leading in the second half that Tennessee was a great team and
they would be able to sustain any efforts that we made to attempt to continue
to get a lead. But we had our opportunities, we missed a couple layups, missed
some open shots and Tennessee's a great team and they capitalized on the other
end and hit a few threes in transition and broke us down off the dribble a
couple times. But we had our chances and we just didn't capitalize on them.  
  
Q. Garrison, did Tennessee defend you the way most people do? Anything
different or unique that you saw today? Or was it just pretty much the same
way most teams defend you?  
GARRISON CARR: For the most part I would say it was just basically like
everybody else. My teammates and coach did a great job of giving me
opportunities to get open and shoot the ball. So it really wasn't Tennessee
doing anything different, it was the team helping me get shots and the coaches
drawing up great plays and that basically opened everything up for myself and
the team.  
  
Q. Garrison, you talk about making them play the whole 35 seconds of the
clock, you guys made them play defense, and stay with you and then you would
break them down a little bit.  
GARRISON CARR: That's just basically how American plays basketball. If we have
a good shot early in the shot clock we're obviously going to take it, but for
the most part we're going to come down and run the offense we practice every
day and get the best shot we can possible get. And whether that comes with 10
seconds on the shot clock or 35, we're going to seize the opportunity when
it's there.  
  
Q. Brian, can you talk a little bit about the offensive boards. You guys
really controlled the offensive boards a lot and coach definitely mentioned
you guys really were just going at it in the first half and they really
couldn't do anything about it. Could you talk about that?  
BRIAN GILMORE: Sure. I think coach mentioned before that we know when Garrison
is going to get open shots. And especially knowing our offense we know with
when Garrison is going to it get a shot off, so it creates an opportunity for
us to get to the offensive boards and that's something that I know a couple of
the guys on the team have really tried to do all year, Jordan and Cornelio and
Travis and myself is really get us some offensive boards and get us some more
possessions and if we don't have an opportunity to shoot, get it back out and
make the defense work for 35 more seconds. I think it happened a couple times
today where it was a scramble situation and we were able to get the ball to
Garrison and he got a little bit more different looks.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student-athletes and take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Can you just reflect on the last couple weeks and what this has meant to
the program and the university.  
COACH JONES: I think it's been a great time. As I reflect back it's not just
the last couple weeks though. I think that's when maybe folks started noticing
and maybe some of the, we started reaping some of the rewards of the fruits of
the players' labor. But as I told them in the locker room after the game, I'm
disappointed that we lost the game, but I'm more disappointed that the journey
for this particular team is ending.  
They have been a joy to coach. They have worked so hard. And to see them as
well as American University and the entire university community kind of get
the our moment in the sun, is, really it's been a great time and a special
time.  
  
Q. I was asking your guys about your game plan on Lofton going in and you
got to feel pretty good looking at his box score and he's 1-7?  
COACH JONES: The fact that he only got seven shots up is pretty remarkable. I
thought that Garrison did a good job of chasing him, but as he also mentioned,
any of the down screens, we wanted to show very strongly on the screens, guard
him with a man and a half, any ball screen or dribble hand off we wanted to
show very, very, be very aggressive. Similar to the way Tennessee played
Garrison. And try to take the ball out of his hands. We played him differently
in those situations than we played any of their other players.  
You saw the draw back, the down side of that, there were two or three times
where -- and they utilize him very, very well -- but where he set back screens
and Garrison was under instructions, he was supposed to call the screen out,
but under no circumstances was he supposed to help. And their first two
baskets of the game I think Cornelio got back screened by Lofton and they
ended up with layups.  
So we had to tighten that up, do a little bit better job of recognizing those
situations, but that really was a byproduct of the fact that we just did not
want to give Lofton any opening. And in preparing for Lofton, but preparing
for Tennessee, obviously we talked to a lot of people, we watched a ton of
film, and the thing that we kept hearing over and over from people that know
them really, really well, is that they tease you with the three. And as well
as they shoot the three and people remember those and maybe the biggest
baskets of the game were the two threes that Chris hit, but they kill you five
feet and in. And we kind of felt like coming in that we weren't going to be
able to guard both, just from a physical standpoint.  
So we wanted to take Lofton out as best we could and then try to guard the
rest of them and keep them from getting layups and dunks.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
COACH JONES: Thank you.

## March 21, 2008

  

### [Derrick Caracter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18397)

### [Earl Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18396)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and have an opening statement by coach Pitino
and then go to ask questions for our student-athletes.  
COACH PITINO: Well, this is the second-best shooting team in the country. When
you see a team shoot 51 percent and 44 from the three you think automatically
the perimeter. Well, when you see statistics like that, you got to have a
great inside attack, which they do.  
But, I think our guys did a tremendous job tonight of really understanding
what we had to take away on the perimeter. Boise State, or any basketball team
that shoots it like Boise State, you can come away a loser if you don't handle
the basketball well and take care of defending the 3-point line. We talked
about -- we were going to get a lot of threes tonight. We knew that. We knew
they would try to take away our interior. But we did a good job of making the
extra pass, taking good threes, but doing all that and creating the good
motion, and is not of any value unless you stop it, and we did a very good job
of stopping a tremendous 3-point shooting team.  
And these two guys, DC gave us a big lift with David in foul trouble. And
Earl's been playing tremendous basketball of late and I was shocked he didn't
have an offensive rebound. He's going to run home, but outside of that he
played really well. It's a long trip, too.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys coming off the bench, how do you feel about that?  
EARL CLARK: Coming off the bench I just want to be aggressive, just play hard
and just try to focus on the scouting report. That's it.  
DERRICK CARACTER: Coming off the bench, I just wanted to give a lift to my
team and stay positive and help my teammates cheer them on. When I get in, I
want to play as hard as possible, and do whatever I can do for my teammates
and my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. You guys, if you would like you can head back to the
locker room.  
COACH PITINO: Great job, guys.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
COACH PITINO: You are going to be just as kind to me, right? Let me go because
it's late and we got to scout.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take one question for Coach Pitino. No, just kidding.
We'll go ahead and open it up for coach.  
  
Q. Just talk about your 3-point shooting, you were so worried about Boise
State doing that, and then you guys came out and did really what they needed
to do.  
COACH PITINO: We talked -- I told the guys that we're going to make a lot of
threes tonight because they're going to take away our interior. And, I said,
we got to create a lot of movement, which we did do. We need to make the extra
pass, work inside to out. And we did a good job of doing that. So we knew the
three was a going to be there, but stopping the three is very difficult,
especially when you press as much as we press.  
You got to be very alert. Not only are you giving everything you can in the
back court, then you got to turn around and guard their screens, inside to out
action. And we did a tremendous job of concentrating on that.  
  
Q. It looked like early on with the up tempo you guys maybe played a little
out of control at times, seemed like you got in and settled down. Could you
talk about what you told them to maybe settle them down?  
COACH PITINO: Just the only one I think T Will made his first few shots, and
he thought he was King James. He just needed to settle down a little bit and
he did. But they weren't out of control. I think when you shoot the percentage
we shot tonight, I wouldn't use that term, but I know exactly what you mean.
Of course, I think we were rushing things and not running our offense.  
  
Q. A little off topic, but I wonder what your thoughts are on Butler and if
they belong in this conversation with the schools that are here?  
COACH PITINO: Let me say this, I have a different philosophy than people on
TV. See, I don't think St. Joseph's is a Mid Major. I don't think Butler's a
Mid Major. I don't think Gonzaga, obviously, is a Mid Major. I don't Xavier is
a Mid Major. These are all great tradition programs. If you look at Xavier
going back four coaches Matta, Gillen or whoever, Skip Prosser, they always
win at the major level. Gonzaga, major level. St. Joe's goes back to Ramsey.  
So I think it's insulting to call these teams Mid Majors, because there's a
standard of excellence every year by Butler. And whether they play up tempo,
or slow, whether they change coaches, there's a standard of excellence. Butler
is a major powerhouse in the game of college basketball. And I get insulted
myself and I'm not even working at those schools when they call it a Mid
Major. Because, how many coaches do you have to go through? How many systems
do you have to implement before you say they're major.  
Now, a school like San Diego, is starting to develop their standard of
excellence. So, it takes some time to develop that label. So, I think that we
do a great injustice. I don't care what league they're in, to call St. Joe's
with that unbelievable tradition or Xavier or Gonzaga and quite frankly, I
know we played Butler a few years ago and they beat us in the NCAA. I would
never insult them that way. Because they're major, major. Big time college
basketball program.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your depth, I know you go plenty deep,
but they shot 80 percent tonight, your bench did.  
COACH PITINO: Well, the most important thing is how you score. It's off good
ball movement, off good player movement, and that's really, really important.
I was really impressed with the way the guys pressed tonight. I don't think we
gave them an easy possession. I think they had to earn everything. We played
that hard tonight because of our respect level for Boise State.  
When you win on the road in triple overtime, you beat BYU and you shoot 51 and
44, our respect level for that team was off the charts. We were ready to play
from the opening tip tonight, which everybody should be ready to play, it's
the NCAA.  
  
Q. Padgett picked up two pretty quickly, I don't think you played DC that
long of a stretch, I think 17 minutes, and talk about his performance and your
confidence in him to be able to go the stretch in that first half?  
COACH PITINO: DC does a lot of good things out there. And David's -- I could
gamble and try to pick up three, but I don't know the outcome of any game,
obviously. And in order for to us win a close basketball game we have to have
David on the floor down the stretch.  
So, I try not to let him get his third, it was very early on. But David's got
to learn, both of his fouls were bad fouls. His fourth foul was a bad foul.
He's got to learn to let it go. If he doesn't block it in his plane he has to
let it go. DC did a great job and we have a tremendous backup after him and we
don't necessarily start the most talented guys, it really is, we try to really
drill into our players' head, it's not important starting.  
I think that Sosa and Earl, DC, can start, but we don't really pay attention
to it. And it's good for those guys because they have a tough time following
scouting reports, so it's really good for them to focus in and pay attention
when they're on the bench, where Palacios and Padgett and McGee are all very
good at that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about -- just not only stopping the 3-point game -- you
were able to do that without having Reggie Larry and their other big guy do
much damage on the interior. Could you talk about not only stepping out on the
three shooters but rotating inside and cutting that off as well?  
COACH PITINO: We did a good job and they're tough in the interior. They have
got good moves and they have to score against bigger people when you watch
them on film, but I think we had a good thing. We had a lot of time to prepare
for them. And that really helped us. Because our guys -- we got their
attention.  
I just happened to watch that triple overtime game and I was really impressed
with them, still impressed. They had a heck of a year. They can really play.
And all these teams like Boise State who can shoot it and they keep their
players together for four years and they develop it and Greg's done a great
job with that program. A great job.  
There's so many terrific coaches like Greg and I'm just so impressed with
every time I turn the TV I say, boy he can really coach his tail off. And
they're just starting out. So many great coaches in this game, we're very
lucky to have them.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH PITINO: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get an opening statement from Coach Capel,
and then go to questions for our student-athletes.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, I'm really proud of our team. I thought we got off
to good start in the first half and especially the way we closed the half to
have a 12 point lead at half time. We came out and really got after it and we
were able to extend the lead.  
We knew St. Joseph's was going to make a run. They're a very good basketball
team. The program has a lot of pride and they're well-coached and they have
good players. And they made a run, but our guys never panicked, we stepped up
and made plays and all three of these guys stepped up to my left and made huge
plays for us, whether it was David all night, offensively and defensively, the
job he did on Calathes. Blake playing really, really well out of the double
team, making some key baskets down the stretch.  
Austin running our team, I'm just really proud of our guys, and glad we have
another opportunity to work together.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. David, before you talk about your offensive explosion, talk about how you
defended Calathes.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just wanted to come out and get in the shooting pocket as Coach
Cline would say, he's a really good 3-point shooter, and that was kind of the
first key. They told me to limit his threes, and secondly, watch out for the
drives and the post man did a great job showing and trapping, and also the
other guards came and rotated and helped out a lot.  
So, it was just pretty much a team effort. Couldn't do anything by myself.
Just the whole team helped out, and we did a great job on him.  
  
Q. David, you dropped out of the starting lineup I think after February 9th.
And you were, I think, eight-out-of-ten games coming off the bench. Can you
talk about being a senior and getting to start again in this tournament and
what that was like being a reserve?  
DAVID GODBOLD: It's really exciting to just be able to start and in the
NCAA's. Coming out of the bench, I knew coach wanted me to just bring some
leadership, some energy off the bench, and I had no problem doing that. And
that's -- I just took pride in doing that. And today, I just wanted to come
out with a lot of a lot of energy. I knew the other four guys who always bring
energy. So, I wanted to make sure I played up to their level, and I think I
did a good job today.  
  
Q. Austin and Blake, since you haven't been asked, when they made a run,
they were very, very aggressive. You guys had to respond. Would you talk about
the keys to responding and keeping your composure?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think, definitely, just talking and using a lot of help on
defense; they do a good job getting into the lane and finding shooters on the
outside, but I think that definitely, just switching off a man and staying
together and talking a lot. That definitely helped with stopping their run.  
THE MODERATOR: Get closer to the mic.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: You want me to say it again? When they got in the lane and
penetrated; they do a good job of finding the open guys and attacking the rim.
So, I think our biggest thing was just to talk and switch and stay together
and not just run around and try to defend everyone, but go about it in a team
way. But just stay together and talk was our biggest two things, probably.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: We knew they were going to make a run. We just didn't know
when it was going to happen. They made their run, we kept our composure, coach
was in the huddle and told us we're fine, we're okay, just keep your head,
keep fighting, and that's what we kept doing.  
  
Q. I was wondering, Blake or David, if you could address this, it was 20-20
when Austin went out of the game with two fouls, and then you guys went on a
run, and it seemed like your offense wasn't flowing without him in the game.
What was it that picked things up for you in that period after A.J. went to
the bench?  
DAVID GODBOLD: We just kind of got a lift from Omar checking into the game. He
made sure to put us in good spots to kind of execute better on offense. And
that's what we did. We just knocked down shots, got it to the right people,
and they were coming out aggressive at us, and they were feeling good about
the game so we just had to stay aggressive and just keep executing. And that's
what we did on our own.  
  
Q. David, could you talk about your night offensively, you averaged single
digits usually, and then the other two guys if you could talk about his night
after he's done.  
DAVID GODBOLD: I think it just goes back to the how I've been practicing and
the coaches, they stayed on me the last four days of just going hard, and
shooting drills, and making sure that I jumped high, and made sure I kept
following through on my shot. And that's what I did today. Blake and Longar --
they always get double-teamed. They have to get respect down there so I have
to be able to knock down the shot when they kick it out and that's what I did
a good job of doing today.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: The coaches -- when we have been doing shooting, guard
shooting, they have been telling Dave, hold his follow-through up every time
he shoots, and trust that it's going to go in. And I think he's been working
hard on that. When I see Dave open, out there, I have faith in Dave, and I
know that he can knock down the open shot.  
So, I'm going to try to get him a shot as much as I can. Being a senior, Dave
knows that it could have been his last game, and I think that he came out and
played his heart out. He didn't want it to be his last game.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I definitely think, like David said, these last four practices
he's been playing really well. Yesterday, he brought a lot of energy to our
team and really helped us yesterday through practice. And also, him being a
senior, and he's been here before, and he knows what it's like, so he kind of
brought some experience with us. And he just stayed ready and hit big shots
for us today.  
  
Q. Two questions: One, David, the second half looked like Calathes got
really aggressive offensively in trying to drive. It looked like you were able
to ride him a little bit. He was not strong enough to kind of get by you. And
two, you said, this is for any of you, you said you had a really good practice
yesterday, how much -- did that give you confidence going in to today's game,
especially the shooting, you shot 57 percent.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just when we look at Calathes on tape, we see that he likes to
drive, but if guys got in physical with him, he kind of struggled at that. And
so the -- I just kind of tried to stay on him, and the big guys did a great
job stepping over, and letting him come to them instead of stepping up and
letting him get an easy pass to their big man.  
So, I tried to stay physical with him, and I'm glad that I got a chance to
kind of push him out, and I was fortunate that he kind of missed some open
shots. He didn't get a good rhythm going.  
AUSTIN JOHNSON: Practice yesterday -- I think we had a lot of energy. I think
the guys were really excited about being down here.  
The freshmen, their first time being down here, they were excited, ecstatic,
they were ready to play. And then the guys that have already had experience;
me, Taylor, Dave and Longar. We, kind of my freshman year, we kind of had a
bad experience down here. So, we didn't want that to happen again. So, we had
that coming in our heads coming into practice, and we carried that over to the
game.  
  
Q. For David, considering the way you played defensively and offensively,
where does this rank, as far as career performances, and have you thought
about the magnitude of this stage and all that?  
DAVID GODBOLD: I don't know about career, but I say it's a pretty good game. I
think I did one of the best jobs defensively, I think. I really prided myself
today on trying to stop their best player. So, I really look at that first.  
Offense comes and goes. I know there's four other guys that can step up any
other day, so it was just my day today, and I'm fortunate that it happened
today, but I'm always going to try to come out a hundred percent on defense.
That's what I'm looking to do whoever we play next round. I want to try to
stop their best player. And that's what I look to do.  
  
Q. I know you guys have won before, but you're 1 of 32 teams that are going
to be playing after today. Can you just talk about what this win feels like
for you today, but Blake as a young guy and David as a senior?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: It's definitely a great thing. Obviously, no one wants to go
home in this tournament. And to move on, and when a lot of people were saying
that we weren't supposed to win, and St. Joseph's was supposed to upset us. It
just kind of gave us some fire and to win it, you know, it feels kind of even
better. But you got to put it behind us and get ready for our next game.  
DAVID GODBOLD: It feels really good. I experienced one victory my freshman
year, and I know how good it feels. But then also sophomore year I had a very
bad experience. So, I just got to look forward to Sunday, and hopefully come
out with the same fire, because whoever we play Sunday is going to come out
very aggressive. They're going to not want to go home, and hopefully our team
doesn't want to go home either. Because it's real boring when you go home
after you lose. So, you got to come out with the same fire and aggression that
we had today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. We will excuse you guys back to the locker
room. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said earlier this week, this team had to shoot well, score well. Talk
about that shooting performance today.  
COACH CAPEL: We made shots, our offense looks a lot better when we make shots.
I thought we did a good job of sharing the basketball and making shots. I feel
bad for Blake and Longar, but more so Blake because he never gets to play
against single coverage, he gets doubled so much. But I think his experience
of having to deal with that basically all year long has really helped him. And
for him to have four assists, and one turnover, I think that opened up a lot
of things for our guys; same thing with Longar. He's another guy that's been
doubled at times this year.  
Obviously, David stepped up and had a huge game for us. Austin was very steady
for us. I thought Omar came in and really did a good job for us in running our
team and getting us into stuff.  
It's as good as Longar has looked in a while. Just how active he was, and
playing different spots on the floor, and he was guarding Ferguson at times in
the perimeter. So, we feel good about this, we're not satisfied, we have
another good team coming in here on Sunday. Whichever one of these guys wins,
we'll get prepared for them and be ready.  
  
Q. Could you, for those of us who don't follow you regularly, could you talk
a little bit about David's situation, why you started him, why you benched him
earlier?  
COACH CAPEL: I didn't bench him. David is really a sixth starter for us.
Really, what I wanted was, we had no experience coming off the bench for us.
When you bench a guy it's because a guy's not playing well or a guy's done
something to get in trouble. We just switched our lineup to get experience to
come off the bench.  
Really when David has come in the game; even when he was coming off the bench
for us; he played as many minutes or more minutes than anyone. Usually, when
he came in he never really came back out.  
So, for us, we just wanted some experience. We just had only freshmen. We're
have new guys coming off the bench for us and so that's why we did that.  
As we got ready for the NCAA tournament, one of the things I looked at with
our team; we really have no one that has any experience in this tournament
besides David, Austin Johnson, Taylor. Griffin and Longar were on teams that
were in this tournament, but they didn't really play. Longar didn't really
play his first two years, and so I don't know if he logged any minutes in the
NCAA tournament. Maybe that freshman year against Niagara. But I think that
Taylor and Austin; when they were freshmen, when they played in the NCAA
tournament, I think it was five minutes, two minutes, I think each of those
guys got that. And so we really didn't have any experience. David's the only
guy that's played extensive minutes, and he had a good game his sophomore year
Oklahoma's last time in the NCAA tournament.  
He was probably the only guy, just looking at the box score. So, we wanted to
switch it up and have some experience in our starting lineup for the NCAA
tournaments. The NCAA tournament experience, and he played a tremendous game.
This game and our game against West Virginia this year are the two best games
I've seen him play since I've been here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the specifics of the shooting that David was talking
about and if it was you that worked with him and if somebody had told you that
you were going to have a player with the numbers that he had after the ball
game, and you didn't know who it was, would you have thought it would have
been, who would have come to mind first?  
COACH CAPEL: As far as him shooting, we always talk to David about shooting
the basketball, about holding your follow-through, about going harder, going
game speed, that's really the term that we use with him.  
And we have been really emphasizing it more with all of our guys this week.
Obviously we didn't shoot the ball well in Kansas City last weekend. So I
don't really think we had to tell our guys a lot, to be completely honest with
you. These guys understand the magnitude of this tournament and obviously the
excitement our freshmen and sophomore are never played in this tournament. And
so they were excited about that. Our older guys have. So David just came out
and made shots. That's the bottom line. He made shots. I don't know if it's
anything specific. Maybe he's giving us too much credit. He stepped up and
made shots today.  
Obviously a first guy, if you talk about a game, like the second part of your
question, the first guy always is Blake. To have a game like that. The second
guy would probably be Crocker, because that's the kind of game he's had for us
several times this year. Especially making threes like that.  
But David stepped up and did a good job for us and we're glad someone did and
I thought a lot of guys did, played really well for us, and that's the reason
why we were able to get this victory. Won by like a touchdown too, right?  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You made a statement yesterday about being unsure about your leadership,
is your opinion changed after watching what David did tonight?  
COACH CAPEL: Well it's changed for today. But one day doesn't make a leader.
David was terrific today. Longar was great today. And I think what those guys
have done and at least it looks like to me just being around our team for the
past few days, is that those guys have shared their experience. Especially
David. That's one of the things I talked to him about and talked to our older
guys is sharing your experience, both good and bad experiences that you have
had playing in this tournament. Our younger guys need that. And he stepped up
and played a great game.  
  
Q. You look at what the Big-12's done, five of six wins, do you think the
conference is better than some people have given credit for?  
COACH CAPEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. It's a really, really good league. And
it's been a very good league all year long.  
I don't think it gets enough respect nationally. We have other teams that are
very capable. You look at Nebraska, they're as good as some of these teams in
this tournament.  
Obviously we're really happy to be 5 of 6 in the league and we want to keep
going and we're rooting for all of the guys in our league right now and
hopefully we can keep advancing, all of us can.  
  
Q. With your defensive performance or the performance as a whole did you see
anything in yesterday or today that would lead you to believe that you're
going to have this kind of performance?  
COACH CAPEL: I would tell you what, I think our defense can be better. They
shot 49 percent from the field. I don't know how good, I mean it was good, but
I still think it can be better. And I don't want to discredit our guys, but I
don't want our guys to be satisfied and I'm not satisfied. I thought we did a
good job of contesting shots. We lost Ferguson too much and he made us pay
just about every time.  
And I thought they hit some tough shots that Govens banked in a couple of
shots and I know he didn't call bank on either one of them.  
But when you're in the midst of a run like that, those are the things that
happen. But I think we can be better defensively, I think we will be better
defensively on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach Steve and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STEVENS: We're tied or it's really close, 22-22, I believe. Midway
through the first half. And we were getting out rebounded, 6-3 on the
offensive glass and we ended up getting nine of the next ten on our glass.  
And we made a few shots in succession and that kind of opened the game and
then I thought that our guys had tremendous poise after they scored the first
two baskets of the second half where we turned it over and they laid it in and
it's not an ideal situation, you don't want guys that are that talented to get
going, but our guys really showed the poise and grit that they have showed all
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Again we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A.J., Mike missed the last ten minutes of the half because of foul
trouble and it looked like you were just totally comfortable running the point
from then on. Can you kind of describe what that second half the first half
was like?  
A.J. GRAVES: Yeah, it was kind of a unique situation when Mike went out. That
changes some of the things we do. But I had to step up and run the point and
we brought in some other people. Pete came in off the bench and made some
great shots and that's just how things went.  
  
Q. Pete, it looked like South Alabama really never did anything special
against you defensively and just played you straight up. Kept getting open
shots and knocking them down. How do teams in your league normally play you?
Do they do special defenses against your shooting?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Well, it's harder when you play a team twice in a season to run
some of the sets and actions that you run throughout the whole year. And coach
said going into post season play for me to be ready to run a few things that
we haven't run for awhile, because that's the beauty of scouting. You can take
away so some of the stuff that a team's trying to do. So, it's not necessarily
anything that special that we tried to come into this game and do, it was just
be ready, run the offense, if you have your opportunities, look for them, if
not, keep moving it around and just get the best shot we can. But that's the
best way I can answer that one.  
  
Q. For Pete, looks like when you were getting hot in that first half, no
matter where you were on the floor, how far behind the arc you were, you
looked like you were in such rhythm that it looked like you were going to make
everything. How often is that kind of a feeling happen to you in college
basketball?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Also, again, I think we were doing an excellent job in the
first half of running our offense and A.J. a few times just was like, you
know, you think I said, "Good pass" one time and he was just like, I'm going
to keep looking for you, because you've been open a few times.  
So, then I think we got a few more and I kept saying the same thing, he just
kept telling me to get open. So, we were just trying to run our offense and
look for the best shot, and fortunately, some of them went down.  
  
Q. Maybe for either one of you guys, you guys are very sensitive to all
kinds of things about arenas. Are the rims extra friendly here in Birmingham
or what is that about?  
A.J. GRAVES: I don't think Pete's shots hit the rim actually so I don't know
about the rim on his part. But this is just -- we schedule stuff like this. We
went up to Alaska and played on neutral courts, we played in Conseco,
Indianapolis on neutral courts. So I think this is just some experience that's
came along with us. But you still got to go out there and play. There's going
to be tough teams that come out and want to challenge you and you just got to
try and do your best.  
THE MODERATOR: Pete, did you have any shots hit the rim? Were they extra
friendly to you?  
PETE CAMPBELL: Maybe a few. I don't know.  
(Laughter.)  
Q. A.J., from your experience this last year against Tennessee, having beaten
them, does that give you some confidence and some familiarity going into the
second round game?  
A.J. GRAVES: It may give you some familiarity just because of some of the
overlying things they do, but they're a different team and we're a different
team as well, too. So, I think this is going to be a different game than it
was last time. I'm not sure you can draw too much comparisons from them.
They're going to have to scout us well and then we're going to have to scout
them well. So, I think it's going to be a tough matchup on Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll get you guys back to the locker room. Thank
you. We will now take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about specifically why you put Streicher on Demetric
Bennett? Because of the size advantage or what?  
COACH STEVENS: Drew has either guarded the opposing team's best statistical
player or guarded somebody that we thought could really give us problems in
every game we played.  
In the conference tournament he held a first team all-league guard in the
first game well below his average and then he held a -- and then he made a
first team all-league forward work for everything he could get in the second
game against Cleveland State.  
Drew could easily be sitting up here. I thought what he did today was
unbelievable how he kept Bennett off balance and Bennett's one heck of a
player, and I think it shows you how much respect that we have for him that we
would put our four on him and give up the chance to give up some offensive
rebounds early and be mismatched underneath the post, but Drew was fantastic
today like he's been for 33 games in five years.  
  
Q. How meaningful is it to you to be like the third youngest coach ever to
win 30 and there's not too many Mid Majors that have even won 30 games.  
COACH STEVENS: It's more meaningful to me that Butler has won 30 games and we
have been trying to build, and build off of a program that was already
established for the past eight years. And it's fun too, it's been fun to be a
part of it, but it's more fun because of the people you're doing it with. And
it doesn't mean a whole lot to me from a personal standpoint, but it means a
lot to me from a team ego standpoint.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the stretch where A.J. had to play the point?  
COACH STEVENS: I thought he did a great job. I heard a lot of people say that
A.J.'s a catch and shoot guy, A.J. was a heck of a point guard for us for his
first two years at Butler.  
And then when Mike came, I think they compliment each other so well that Mike
ends up handling the ball a little bit more. But A.J.'s very capable and then
I thought Shawn came in and was fantastic the entire game. And when our
rebounding efforts turned around, it was Shawn up there flying around the rim
keeping balls a live and really played with great energy and I thought that
really set a tone for the rest of the half.  
He played well off of A.J. and what I thought was so good about the way A.J.
played was, Pete said it, in our offense he was looking for him, he was also
looking for him in transition he really got the ball up the floor and made a
couple of plays where you could tell he was going to lay it in or look for
Pete and he did a great job.  
  
Q. How much do you know about Tennessee at this point and what's your
general impression of them?  
COACH STEVENS: I know it more as a fan than a coach. And I'll work hard in the
next 24 hours to learn more about them. Obviously, I've got a feel for their
system, because Coach Pearl was in our league at the University of Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, and we played Tennessee last year.  
I have the utmost respect for him, I think the team is fabulous. If they're a
2 seed, there are four pretty good teams out there that are 1 seeds and we'll
have to be at our very best on Sunday to compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, coach.  
COACH STEVENS: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
BIRMINGHAM](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+BIRMINGHAM)

  

## March 21, 2008

  

### [Ron Arrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18307)

### [Demetric Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18306)

### [Daon Merritt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18304)

  
_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll start with an opening statement from coach and
then take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH ARROW: We knew that they were a very experienced team that worked very
hard to get the next guy an open shot. And tonight was no exception.  
It's not that I didn't think -- I got to go back, but a lot of those shots,
3-point shots that they made we were right on them. But 18 assists speaks for
itself.  
They do a very good job of finding the open man and when you have five seniors
that have worked together and got to the tournament, and as many victories and
as many tough teams that they have been able to play in getting to where they
are today, after playing them, that they can shoot the ball like that, they're
going to go a long way in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, talk about Butler's defense and how that made it so
difficult for you getting into your offense.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: Well, I think they played good defense and they played hard
the whole game. Even when they got up they never let up. They played good.
They're just a good team.  
DAON MERRITT: Like he said, they're a good ball club. They play well together.
They have -- I'm sure they have a set of rules and things they go by, and it
works and it really, really does. Early, I think, we came out -- we played
good, we got what we wanted and they made adjustments. And we didn't.  
  
Q. Talk about the guy that was guarding you, that 6'7 ", Streicher, I guess.
He seemed to be long and you just didn't have any room to get your shots off,
basically.   
DEMETRIC BENNETT: He played good defense. Every time I tried to go around it
there was somebody there helping and he just played good. His size and
everything was -- I don't think it was that effective, I just couldn't make
any shots and they just played good team defense and he played good defense,
too.  
  
Q. Daon, or Demetric, why was it so hard to stop Campbell today?  
DAON MERRITT: I think he got on a roll and when a player gets on a roll like
that, he's just feeling it, I mean that's what anybody -- it's pretty much
hard to stop. He's a talented player, he made shots when it mattered.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think they did a good job of finding him in transition.
The clock went down, the drive and kick, they're a good team, and they always
made the extra pass when somebody made a mistake or when somebody left them
open, he just made it. He got his confidence going early. He made all his
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, you guys can head back to the locker room if you like,
and we'll go ahead and take questions for Coach Arrow at this point.  
  
Q. Talk about the stretch there in the end of the first half that it was
22-22 and then they just, as Coach Stevens was saying, he thinks they got nine
of the next ten rebounds and just stretched it out there. What sort of changed
for them?  
COACH ARROW: We started missing some shots, they started making some shots, we
missed free throws, and I thought that we got down a little bit, and they kept
coming right at us.  
Whenever, and again, I got to go back and look, but I don't think that our
defense on the 3-point line is indicative of what it shows here. I thought
that we were on some of their shooters a lot of the times, and they just
buried them, I mean buried them and buried them and buried them. And when that
happens a lot of times you're not making free throws, the free throw
situation, I mean, I think we shot 14 more free throws than them and made one
more than them.  
Then compound that, we just got down, we didn't fight back, I thought the
second half we came back and made a little run, I think cut it to 12, 13
points and I thought we were going to get going and credit them, they came
back and hit two big threes back-to-back and got on another roll. And we just
didn't answer.  
They are a very -- and I've said this, to be a 7 seed, I think that they're a
little bit better than that. But, when you run up against a team, and there
will be some other ones in this tournament, whenever you run up to somebody
that's going to hit threes like that, they're going to upset some people. And
I'm not saying that this was an upset, I'm just saying, by far, that when they
go against Tennessee, if they can hit like that, they have got a great shot at
beating Tennessee. Just like Tennessee, if they're hitting their threes, they
have got a great shot of winning this whole thing. But the bottom line is
those threes can either break you or make you.  
  
Q. You touched on this a little bit already, but how frustrating is it
defensively when you play good defense and then a guy buries one from 24, 25
feet and a lot of those shots were from that kind of distance?  
COACH ARROW: Yeah, we had four guys at different times on him. We had bigger
guys, smaller guys, and he just got into a groove. In today's game, you get a
couple guys, you get a guy that hits a couple and he gets into that groove. I
don't care if he's two feet from the hole or 30 feet from the hole, he starts
feeling it and you're in trouble.  
And he definitely -- they definitely shoot 50 percent from the three, I'm
going to be anxious to go back and see the game, and see exactly how many of
them were tightly guarded with a hand right in their face.  
You know, it's a shame, because the one elimination game -- and they played
very good, I'm not taking anything away from them, I mean if they shoot like
that, they're going to win a lot more games. And they play pressure defense,
they work very good together. But it's just a shame, because I know what this
team, our team did this year and to end it like this is just, I feel bad for
the two seniors, because we're definitely a better team than this. But they
had something to do with it.  
  
Q. I know you said that this may be the best one of the best passing teams
you've seen in quite a few years, were you surprised at all as well as they
moved the ball when they got on the interior?  
COACH ARROW: No. I made the statement, I've seen them play three different
games and scouting them, I saw a couple times during the year and they might
be the best passing team I've seen in more than a couple years. They really,
really know where each other are. They get in there and they jump up and they
can hit the post, they can hit the wings, they just have a good feel for one
another. And we did the same thing, we just didn't bury the shots. We missed
gosh, we had to miss, we led the Sun Belt in assists and we had, what? Eight
tonight. We averaged almost 16. So it's one of those deals, the tournament is
a one shot and you're out, and we'll go on back and accept and wish them the
best of luck unless they play Western Kentucky.  
  
Q. You said they got one chance to see you, are you concerned that people
watching this game would say hey, the Sun Belt shouldn't have had two teams
anyway?  
COACH ARROW: Let me just say this: There is no doubt in my mind after this
game before the game, during the game, we deserved to be in this tournament.  
I know some things have been said about our team. I don't think that once the
committee gets the 65 teams in it that anything should be said. You shouldn't
knock any teams that make it to this tournament.  
The committee goes by a criteria. If you're going to knock something, knock
the criteria, change the criteria for getting into the tournament. We did --
everything that we did during this game is not going to spoil the year for us.
We were 4-1 against teams in this tournament, we were 3-2 against Top-50
teams, I think we were 5-3 against top 100 teams.  
San Diego won the WCC or whatever conference they're in, we beat them 22 or 24
points earlier in the year. We beat Western Kentucky twice. The criteria that
is set forth right now, we did what that criteria calls for. And I'm glad that
the committee went by the criteria.  
If people don't like the criteria and all they want is the BCS teams in it,
then write that into the criteria. And let other teams go have a tournament,
let the BCS teams have a tournament, and let the two winners play for the
national championship. But the way the criteria is now, there's no doubt in my
mind, we deserved to be in it. I'm just sorry that -- there will be a lot of
them probably say, well, we said so. But that doesn't bother me.  
  
Q. The fact that a lot of people were upset that the none -- that the
conferences like yours and Butler got a lot of times that that was the matchup
as opposed to the BCS conferences getting matched against the so called Mid
Major, do you look at that as a conspiracy out there?  
COACH ARROW: I don't think it's a conspiracy, but I think a lot of those
people that are talking on TV, where did they play ball at? Duke, North
Carolina. They're used to the big boys getting into the tournament. And, but
they did come back and say one thing, I think the biggest thing was Arizona
State not getting into the tournament. Well then they came back the next day
and said, well, they should have been in before Arizona, because they beat
Arizona twice. You know, you can go on and on and on. You put 120 teams into
the tournament, 121, 122 is going to be upset.  
So the bottom line is, whatever they put the criteria to be, then go by the
criteria and then don't say anything about the teams that get in. That's what
the committee is there for and know the criteria and go by it. And we
definitely met the criteria this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.  
COACH ARROW: Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start here with questions for the Louisville student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Fellows, you guys have lost your last two games, but just looking at you
right now, still seem loose, still seem very confident. Just where does this
team stand at right now?  
DAVID PADGETT: I guess I'll take this one. Obviously, we didn't finish the Big
East season like we wanted to, we lost to Georgetown and Pittsburgh in the
first round of the tournament. But it's pretty much a whole new season from
this point on. The NCAA tournament is a whole another level and we can't
really dwell on what happened in the past. So, our focus right now is just our
first round game to tomorrow and just take it one day at a time. Learn from
the mistakes we made and then move on from there.  
  
Q. Does the fact that y'all competed in the Big East, you lost to Pitt, but
they went ahead and won the tournament and are playing well. Does that help
you feel better about coming into this tournament having to face that kind of
competition?  
ANDRE MCGEE: I think we feel real good about ourselves right now. Looking at
our last two losses one was against Georgetown, one of the best defensive
teams in the nation and Pittsburgh one of the hottest teams in the country
right now. So, losing to two great teams, one by two or three points and the
other team in overtime, it says a lot about our team. We really fought hard
but didn't get the job done in the later stages of the game. But we really
have a lot of confidence in ourselves.  
  
Q. How do you go about defending a guy like Reggie Larry who's just been on
fire the last five or six games?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Got to be team defense. You can't just say Earl Clark go
stop him or Palacios go stop him, it got to be team defense. Everybody helping
out each other. We played a lot of great players throughout this year, so I
mean, it might not be nothing different, but of course, you got to stop him.
So the answer is team defense. You can't just put one person on him. Everybody
got to help out.  
  
Q. David, is that a T-shirt, a new thing or is this a message behind it?  
DAVID PADGETT: No, we just -- I think, I don't know, I think our equipment
manager maybe or one of the assistant coaches came up with. They handed them
out yesterday at practice. So, it's was kind of one of those new shirts that
we got so we're just wearing it around.  
  
Q. What concerns you the most about the Broncos?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: The way that they shoot the ball. I think they're first or
second in shooting. They shoot a high percentage from the 3-point, high
percentage field goals so that's always tough to guard when you have -- and I
think their five man is shooting 65 percent or something. You got to always
worry about that because that means that he hardly misses. So what concerns us
most about them is the way they shoot the ball.  
ANDRE MCGEE: I think the way they shoot the ball along with their fast break
attack. They're one of the greatest fast break teams in the country right now.
They really push the ball with less dribbling and more passing, which enables
them to get open threes, which they shoot at a very alarming percentage. So we
really got to be able to get to those shooters before they make the attempt.  
  
Q. Can any of you guys talk about your press and what it's designed to do
and is that a key to slowing Boise State's transition?  
DAVID PADGETT: Yeah, our press is -- no matter who we're playing, if we're
playing a team who plays up tempo or a slow down team we don't really change
our style a whole lot. I think the one thing that is probably constant with
all of our defenses is just the fact that it comes out to taking good shots on
offense which allows us to set up our press. So even though Boise State's one
of the best offensive teams in the country and they shoot the ball extremely
well, we're not going to just completely change our whole game plan. We
approach every game the same and just really try to focus on what we need to
do our five versus their five. So our press is just a factor, no matter who
we're playing.  
  
Q. Terrance, Matt Nelson said he played against you in high school. And your
team beat them. And he said he really would like to give you that one and take
the NCAA tournament win. What do you say about that?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: Probably in high school it was more of an individual thing
with me and my team. And like we won, but now it's more of a team thing. So I
can't really go out and say, well, that's not going to happen we're going to
beat them. I'm very confident in the Louisville Cardinals, this team, and the
way we have been preparing and practicing and I think that we'll be clicking
on all cylinders, hopefully, and whatever happens, happens. I wish him the
best of luck, to him and his team.  
  
Q. I wonder if you guys can talk about the job that Coach Pitino has done
this year when things weren't going so we'll at the beginning of the year and
how he kind of gave you guys the confidence to turn it around.  
DAVID PADGETT: Well that's what you get with somebody who has been coaching as
long as he has and who has experience as he has. He's been to five Final Fours
and he's, on the NBA level and college level, and somebody who coaches for 32,
33 years, they know how to handle every kind of situation. So just a lot of it
just comes with experience and he knew with the injuries that we sustained
early in the year that it was going to be tough but he knew that myself and
Taj were going to be back so we just kept trying to play hard every game and
just kept trying to battle it out and just play as well as we could.  
  
Q. You guys lost two close games to two good teams at the end of the year,
did coach -- how did he deal with that with you, guy? Did he dwell on it? Did
he tell you to forget about it, how did he handle it?  
TERRENCE WILLIAMS: He didn't really dwell on it. Of course he was kind of
upset with the situation. We were upset as players. But it was like it's kind
of like I told them, like you never look down, unless you're helping somebody
up. So what I mean by that is you can't hold your head.  
Do you know if there's still more to play in the season. So everybody took the
words that he said, the message behind the words and kept going. And he just
basically told us that it's not over. We had to watch film on it, you got to
learn from your mistakes, and we're just fortunate enough to be in the
situation where we can hopefully correct it.  
  
Q. The last eight games y'all's free throw percentage has been less than 64
percent every game. Shooting 59.1, which is actually less than Memphis, has
that been a big talking point the last few days?  
ANDRE MCGEE: It hasn't been a huge talking point. But free throw is something
we work on every practice. Coach has really been out talking to us about
slowing down, posture, balance, follow through and things like that. And just
trying to be focused when we're at the free throw line, take deep breaths and
things like that. Because NCAA tournament, a lot of games are decided by the
free throw line. So it is going to play a factor so guys really do have to
focus in.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Coach Pitino, why don't you start with an
opening statement and then we'll go to questions.  
COACH PITINO: I feel like I'm going to be interrogated. Well we're very
excited to be here and certainly representing the Big East. As one of our
teams.  
We're going to play against an outstanding ball club who as far as shooting
the basketball running the break is as good as any team in the country. So we
have got to take good shots ourselves, make sure we don't turn it over, and
keep them out of transition. And we got to guard the 3-point shot as if the
game is on the line almost every possession as they shoot an incredible
percentage from the 3-point line.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Have you played anybody that is anything like Boise State this year?  
COACH PITINO: Yes, very much so. BYU. And BYU, they do a lot of things
offensively that they do in terms of the transition game in terms of the way
they work inside to out. In terms of the way they can have a quick trigger on
the 3-point shot because they're so good at it. So they remind me of BYU. The
unfortunate thing is we lost to BYU.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. I was curious how much you conversed with Marvin this week in trying to
get some inside information in how to attack the Broncos?  
COACH PITINO: No, we didn't talk to Marvin about it. We would not -- that's
their league. And generally we would not, although Marvin's a very close
friend, we would not do that to Marvin, it puts him in a difficult situation.
We have enough tape on it that you don't need to do that. And we think that
Marvin would dead out lie to us.  
(Laughter.).  
  
Q. Louisville's almost here every single year, Boise State's not been here
for 14 years, is there a hunger factor there that you might be concerned about
between these two teams?  
COACH PITINO: I can just say we're very hungry ourselves. We'll play like
starving dogs and so does every team in the NCAA. So it's, if they beat us,
it's because they have the ability to beat us, it's not because they're more
or less hungry. Because we're all very hungry. Every team in this tournament
is hungry. And we'll play that way and so will they.  
  
Q. You've certainly seen your fair share of good players this year, where
does Reggie Larry rank as far as athleticism and among the elite guys?  
COACH PITINO: Well, I would probably be a bad judge of that. Because I see
those guys so much more watching guys on tape is not the same as watching them
in person. But he certainly pound for pound, inch for inch, is a very
effective basketball player. Outside as well as inside.  
  
Q. As one of the early pioneers of the 3-point shot how much do you enjoy
watching Boise State shoot it and how they play? Is that what you envision
when you came on the scene in the '80s when the 3-point got introduced?  
COACH PITINO: Yes, because they shoot such a good percentage. A lot of teams
shoot the 3-point shot, but their percentage is not as good. This is a team
that shoots 51 percent from the field, shoots a high percentage from the
three, and has a good terrific low post game. And I think that's what makes
them so effective, because if you give them single coverage in the low post,
then they're going to hurt you inside. If you trap down or dig hard on their
low post, they throw it back out and they're so proficient at the 3-point shot
that they can hurt you there as well.  
They're also terrific in transition and they take the three in transition,
which a lot of teams do not do. So they're very effective. It's a great weapon
for them. And they bring guys off the bench and shoot it at four positions and
bring guys in off the bench who are great 3-point shooters as well.  
  
Q. I was just going to get your opinion on the parity in college basketball
it could be argued that this year's tournament is top heavy, but with George
Mason and other Mid Majors going deep in recent years, how does that approach
how you approach a game like this against a 14 seed?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's year to year. Sometimes you see a lot of upsets,
sometimes you don't.  
Certainly certain leagues are stronger in other years and then not. I think
it's cyclical, depends on the year. There haven't been too many upsets yet
today. So you don't know how it's going to play out. You certainly are going
to see a lot of upsets, but I think that the ability to shoot the basketball
creates the upsets.  
In a given night in a 40 minute basketball game, this is not a pro series, if
somebody is shooting the ball extremely well, anything can happen. And I know
that happened to us in 1987. You know, we just got on a tremendous run
shooting the basketball. As long as you take good shots, you have the ability
to shoot it, play good defense, you have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about when you first got into the NCAA tournament back 25
years ago, your expectations and what it was like the whole arena and whole
setting as compared to what it's like now for you.  
COACH PITINO: Well, Boston University was the first tournament and for us back
then we were just excited to be part of it. In '87 Providence College, we
Providence had not gone to a tournament since the inception of the Big East,
seven straight years. So we were elated to be part of it.  
We were very upset though, our fans never traveled with us because they were
upset because they felt that we got the shaft because back then they made us
come to Birmingham, Alabama to play UAB on their home court. So our fans
thought it was unfair and were very upset at that.  
And it was a heck of a ball game, it was, as I remember it was one, either up
or down at half time, and we wound up winning I think by 28, 30 points until
the second half because an old pudgy kid just went off on them, from Billy the
Kid Donovan. So it brings back great memories to be back here, but I remember
our fans being so upset at the fact that we had to play on another team's home
court and how unfair it was, that it took us awhile to make the tournament, so
we were elated, we didn't care that it was at their place. Even though it was
going to be on a road game for us. And then it took off from there for us.  
  
Q. Talk about the tempo, I know you said in the past you like to take a few
more chances in a tournament, but with them being an up-and-down team that
shoots a lot of three, do you still hold that philosophy?  
COACH PITINO: No, we're going to hold the ball against Boise tomorrow, we're
going to run it down to about six seconds, run some high pick and rolls, see
if they can defend it well and you're going to have to live to try and beat
the clock at the last second for us. So I hope it works.  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions? Last chance. Okay. Thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the student-athletes. Take questions?
Talk about the preparations coming here, changes and what the outlook of the
team is. What's your approach to this tournament?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Realizing that this is a one and done. You got to play your,
this game tomorrow as if it is your last and that we prepared a lot. Watching
film on American and the walk through and scouting, but just take it like a
regular season game.  
  
Q. Before you knew that you were going to play American, what did you know
about the school? Did you know where it was? Had you seen them play this year?
Did you have any familiarity with the school or the program at all?  
JAJUAN SMITH: No, not really, not me personally. But we know that they're a
great team because they're still playing in March and we can't take no
opponent lightly.  
TYLER SMITH: I've never seen them play on TV, but watching film, they're
pretty good. They run a lot of ball screens and things like that. So, we got
to play hard and make sure that we come out with a victory.  
CHRIS LOFTON: I've heard of them before but I wasn't really familiar with
their program and I didn't realize how good they were until we started
watching them on film.  
  
Q. JaJuan, you're probably going to see a lot of Carr tomorrow, now he's
made even more threes than Chris has made, what do you have to do to stop
him?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Watch film on Chris and Carr together. Chris one of the best
shooters in the country and he prepared me for this matchup for a long time.
We have been together for four years, so I'm ready for the challenge.  
  
Q. JaJuan, Tyler, both talk about this, how much do you guys play with a
chip on your shoulder that you did not get a number one seed and you're having
to be a number two seed as this tournament begins?  
JAJUAN SMITH: This is a great chance for us to make a name for ourselves, not
just individually, but for the team to show that we belong and what we did all
season, that we deserve a one seed and it's just going, we just are going to
use it for motivation throughout the tournament.  
TYLER SMITH: I'm just happy to be playing again. Last year I wasn't playing at
all. This year number two seed, I mean we're kind of upset we didn't get one,
but we still got to keep playing. It's March, we're happy to play.  
  
Q. For JaJuan, what do you remember about the Winthrop game a couple years
ago and how big is that -- that you got that kind of a background on this type
setting?  
JAJUAN SMITH: That's where Chris hit the game winner. It was just a great
memory and the first game is the toughest, just everyone is nervous and
everyone just trying to make plays on both teams. So from that game being here
and we have been here, done that. So we're just looking forward to this game.  
  
Q. For Chris, the lack of history in Tennessee basketball in the post season
positive history, anyway, how much of that is a motivating force for you guys,
both for the town, for the school and for a lumps around the country?  
CHRIS LOFTON: It's real motivating for us. Because we know Tennessee
basketball is not known for post season play. We're not really known as a
basketball school as other big schools. But this team is all about trying to
make mystery and that's what we're out to do.  
  
Q. I don't know how big this is if about you if you guys win tomorrow that's
30 wins. How big of a hurdle is that to have 30 wins in a season?  
CHRIS LOFTON: 30 wins is great of course who wouldn't want to do that. But we
know we got a tough task on our hands tomorrow and we got to be ready to play
coming out from the start.  
  
Q. Chris, what did you learn from the SEC tournament? In terms of taking
care of business, winning, getting the job done as you go into this tournament
now?  
CHRIS LOFTON: We realize that no matter how good we have been in the regular
season, all that that's out the window now. It's post season play, it's
starting over. Everybody is 0-0. And everybody is playing for their lives
right now because they realize that their season could be over at any time.  
  
Q. For any of the guys, I know American really hasn't made a secret about it
they're going to try to slow it down to. You guys got pretty use to that and
how do you battle that? Do you just try to speed them up?  
TYLER SMITH: Of course we want them to play our game, but at the same time we
have been working a lot on our half court offense and to prepare for this type
of game and this type of setting that's what you need to do.  
  
Q. For Chris, when you saw the draw come out and you saw a 11: 15 starting
time did you think that was pretty early?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Yeah, it was different for us. We have been preparing that way
all week though. Getting up early and eating breakfast and doing stuff early
in the morning this week to prepare for tomorrow. So I think that we got used
to the time and we'll be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Chris, any thoughts of a possible matchup with Butler after what
happened last year against them?  
CHRIS LOFTON: Not really. We take one game at a time. We're worried about
American right now.  
  
Q. Have you guys gotten pretty used to teams trying to do that to you
throughout the course of the year. I know Kentucky and a lot of others have
been really determined to slow you guys down. Is that something that you're
used to seeing?  
JAJUAN SMITH: Yes, we know coming into this tournament a lot of teams going to
try to make us play their ball, but we got to be stronger and make teams play
our ball and try to overcome them and make them speed up and do things they
don't want to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thank you. Coach Pearl, we'll go ahead and start
with an opening statement and then go right to questions.  
BRUCE PEARL: We're excited about being here in Birmingham. In SEC country,
representing the SEC in the NCAA tournament.  
It was a good year in the league. With six teams advancing. Georgia going
through the SEC tournament like they did, having to win those games, four in a
row, two in the same day, playing the same year is very tough right now, very
proud of the league. Florida carried the banner very well last couple of
years, and now it's up to one of us to see if we can try to maintain that
level of championship basketball play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. You've been David before, now you're Goliath, which role do you like
more?  
HEAD COACH BRUCE PEARL: I like Goliath because Goliath has better player
years, bigger rocks, more guns.  
I don't care. I'm just glad to be in it. I don't care under what circumstance,
but if you gave me a choice, I'd rather be at Tennessee than Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, nothing against them, but I would rather be a two seed than a 12
seed. But we just are very blessed to be in the tournament. And we'll play
whatever role needs to be played.  
  
Q. Talk about the point guard play and how that needs to probably pick up in
this tournament. How critical is that?  
HEAD COACH BRUCE PEARL: Well, we have won with good point guard play. We have
not had great point guard play. And we will be playing against some great
point guards. So, but we played against great point guards all year long. We
managed to win.  
So we have got some things that we plan on doing to try to improve our play at
the position and we know this weekend we'll be challenged.  
  
Q. I know you said in the past this team wasn't maybe as good a pressing
team as some of your others, but now that you're going into your playing teams
that aren't familiar with your system, you think you might be a little more
apt to press in these, in this tournament?  
HEAD COACH BRUCE PEARL: Yes, pressure defense is something that when you see
it for the first or second time it can be more effective. Because not
everybody does press.  
Particularly, if you feel that there's a need to speed an opponent up, in
looking at the three teams that we're playing, this weekend, with American's
quick guards, Butler's got great senior guards, they might be difficult to
speed up, and South Alabama, they play great going fast, so they may not be a
team you want to speed up, so I still think you got -- we have to pick our
spots.  
But, the thing I like about having pressure defense is there will be a time in
the game, or in the tournament, when we need to get either the tempo picked up
or create turnovers. The fact that it's there, the fact that we have that
weapon and the fact that you got to prepare for it, in and of itself makes
pressing effective.  
  
Q. Will you take a couple minutes for those that don't know the story about
how you kept that bridge open to get Tyler Smith back into the state of
Tennessee from Iowa?  
COACH PEARL: The only thing that I can think of as far as keeping bridges open
is there are times when in losing a recruiting situation that you just got to
try to turn the page sometimes. And I made sure that when Tyler went to prep
school at Hargrave, that he understood that I wished him well. And I was sorry
that I had to do what I did. Representing the University of Tennessee. Because
some things that were done, that were done wrong, by both, but let's try to
move on. Now, you go have a great career son. I think a lot of you." And I
made sure that he got that message. It wasn't to try to rerecruit him, because
we never rerecruited him at Hargrave. And I suppose we could have. And then he
happened to choose Iowa. And I was there for six years. And I had a lot of
friends at Iowa who played ball there and same thing. I just reached out to
them saying, hey, not that it makes anything, makes that big a difference, but
tell him I hope he has a great career. And I thought he made a great choice.
And Iowa is a great place.  
I don't know that it had much to do with him coming back. I think Tennessee
was where he always wanted to be. But sometimes in losing in recruiting I try
to, try and lose with dignity.  
  
Q. Before the SEC tournament Dave Odom was talking about the SEC being a
great shooter's league. He thinks it has more great shooters than any other
league and a lot of that is at the guard position. You mentioned guard play.
Do you think having gone through the SEC that it prepares you for the caliber
of guards you're going to play in this tournament?  
COACH PEARL: Absolutely. And, also too, with playing same year and Memphis,
Western Kentucky, we have seen great guards all the way through, but boy, it
did seem like just about every team in the east and a few teams out west had
great guard play. Great shooters. Great point guard play. So there's no
question that we're prepared for whatever we'll see.  
It's interesting, and this is something that I have shot across Chris and
JaJuan's bow. I said last time I looked at the program you guys were listed as
guards. I think you're pretty good, but you're obviously going to have to
continue to play your way through this tournament so that somebody else might
say Tennessee's got good guard play.  
  
Q. It seemed early in the season when I saw Tyler Smith he had to, he was
setting people up a lot. Did you have to prod him to start looking for shots a
little more early in the game and quit doing that?  
COACH PEARL: Yeah, he's just an unselfish player, he's a great teammate. And
the first month or two of practice in the season he was learning the system.
And learning where to go and who to look for and how to get open and just to
try to understand and so he -- once he got a feel for what we do, then he was
able to find his own ways to create and take advantage of some opportunities.
He's a high basketball IQ guy.  
He's a very unselfish player. Who does make his teammates better. Who now
understands within the framework of our fast break and our offense, where his
opportunities come from. And his opportunities to score are very productive
opportunities. Because he shoots such a great percentage, he's got a high
assist turnover ratio, and he makes good decisions. And Tyler Smith actually,
his decision making sort of contributes to our guard play. It's like Dane
Bradshaw was a point forward last year, well so is Tyler. Tyler's playing the
same position as Dane. Tyler leads us in assists. He's just doing it from the
power forward position instead of the point guard position. My job is to take
my players and put them in positions to be successful to go to their
strengths. Jordan Howell is not a playmaker. Not a criticism, he's just not a
playmaker, Tyler is. We lead the nation and we're second in the nation in
assists. Somebody's out there making plays.  
  
Q. Is this where the coaches that have double-digit seeds make their bones,
and where would you be if you hadn't had your success as a double-digit
seed?  
COACH PEARL: I would still be on that bus someplace, traveling to a Division
II tournament. Your comment was about coaches making it, it's about players.
It's about Stan Gerard in Division II or Chris Bowles or great players that I
had at Southern Indiana. It's about the players I had at Wisconsin Milwaukee,
Clay Tucker, Ronnie Jones, Dylan Page, Adrian Tiger, those players advanced in
the NCAA tournament now I was their coach and I did my job and I helped them
be successful, I suppose as a coach how you perform at this time of the year
gets a little bit more attention. It gets a little bit more notice. But this
coach doesn't get here without those players.  
  
Q. Tennessee has not made a lot of positive history in the post season,
specifically in the NCAA tournament, is that something that affects you
matters to you, motivates you as well as the players in terms of the fabric of
the program and where it's going?  
COACH PEARL: Our team has embraced the history of Tennessee basketball. We're
very, very aware of the fact that it was 41 years since last time we had won a
regular season championship out right. We embraced it heading into the SEC
tournament, but we were unable to win.  
We understand that we have never been to the Elite 8 before. It's a place we
would like to go. But there are 65, 64 other teams now that would like to go
to the same place. Everybody here's a champion. There aren't many teams that
aren't champions left in this field. We would definitely feel a great
responsibility and a great opportunity, this is the best team I've taken into
the tournament so far. This is the deepest team, the most talented team. And
it's traveled the most difficult road to get here.  
So now it's just a matter of whether or not we can play well here at the end
and take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about American, what they do well and what you're going to
have to do to combat that to have success tomorrow?  
COACH PEARL: Well Carr is in the top 15 in three categories in the NCAA. 3
point percentage, 3 point makes, and free throw percentage. In fact, he makes
45 out of 50 free throws in the last few minutes of each game. So he's a great
shooter.  
You got to cover him before the catch. Mercer, was from St. Anthony's High
School and a point guard, he will fear nothing. There's no matchup out there
that he's concerned about. He's played against the best.  
He's slippery, he's a tough, physical guy that can break you down. And he
breaks everybody down to get those guys shots on that team.  
Lay, he's an example of their, he's like their Dane Bradshaw, the guy that
just plays so hard, gets every 50/50 ball, plays real productive, always
trying to get closer to the basket. Nichols, the center, he may be 6'-5" but
he's got a 7'-3" wing span and plays so much bigger. And then I think Jeff
Jones having watched his team this year now on a lot of film, there's just
not, there's nothing he's not seen before as a coach. So he's a great game
coach. Their system, with staggers and ball screens and handoffs and spread
and tempo, it puts Carr and Mercer in position to be successful. They don't
have a lot of post game, because that's not their strength. So they will, they
will run the shot clock down, they will keep, try to keep the score down in
the 40s or 50s. We'll try to speed them up without hurting ourselves too much.
And we'll take advantage of our size and try to go inside. Where we have the
ability. And the advantage.  
  
Q. A lot was made when Chris Lofton came out of high school I know you
weren't there, but Kentucky and Louisville neither one of them offered him a
scholarship. He was at Tennessee when you got there, what has he meant to the
process of building this program to this point?  
COACH PEARL: Chris Lofton will go down as one of the all time greatest players
to ever wear the uniform. He'll join the likes of Ernie, Bernard King, Dale
Ellis, Alan Houston. He's not, he's not done writing the book though. We have
got more work to do. There's another chapter left in this book. And how far
Chris Lofton is able to lead us will have something to say about just how
magical a ride it's been. Because it's been spectacular to this point. Now
we're talking about magic. And going some is place that a Tennessee basketball
team has never been. He's our hardest worker, he's one of the best student-
athletes you're ever going to find, everybody can root for Chris Lofton
because he's such a great kid and does everything the right way. I cannot
imagine what coaching a basketball team is going to be like without him. He
has spoiled me. I can draw a play and we can get spacing and create a ball
screen and but he's going to make the shot. He's got a great hunger for
knowledge. And as far as the recruiting is concerned, way too much criticism
was put upon Louisville and Kentucky when they did not take Chris Lofton.
There were dozens, there were better players than Chris out there that they
took that they should have taken. And the fact that Chris went and became a
great player Kentucky or Louisville should not be blamed for that. Recruiting
is not an exact science. Give Chris credit for what he's done. But there's
some great players, Joe Crawford and Bradley are pretty good players at
Kentucky. And they were better than Chris coming out of high school and
they're and they were great players at Kentucky.  
  
Q. Speaking of Chris Lofton, just if you reflected back with this team about
the 2-15 matchup two years ago with Winthrop that took a Chris Lofton falling
out of bounds do you think that's something that stuck with your seniors as
they're leading these younger guys in as far as not overlooking American?  
COACH PEARL: I don't think we'll overlook American because of American. The
fact that they beat Maryland at Maryland. A Maryland team that beat North
Carolina at North Carolina, the number one seed in this tournament. I would
rather focus on the now. The only thing I'll shift gears to in the past is
I'll say that two of the last four times this league has been a 13 seed,
excuse me a 15 seed, Bucknell, you know, was able to beat Arkansas, they were
able to beat Kansas. And the Patriot League has not dropped a first round
contest by more than 11 years since 2000. This league has gone in and in the
first round they have competed. American represents this league.  
The because they keep the score down, and because they have got great guard
play, and because they come from a league that has stayed close and a league
that has done this, Winthrop wasn't in their league, I'm going to focus on
that. This is most likely going to be a tighter ball game than what people
expect because of those factors. I think I'll focus on that. We're a different
team than we were a couple years ago. When we were playing Winthrop. And
Winthrop is a much different team than American.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Pearl.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us this morning Derrick Mercer, Garrison Carr and
Brian Gilmore. If you do have a question for any of the three, if you'll raise
your hand, we do have a couple floor mics. We would like to get one to you
before you ask your question. We'll try to keep this to 10 to 15 minutes and
then we'll have Coach Jones come in. But at this time we'll go ahead and take
questions.  
  
Q. Derrick, I'm starting with you, coming into your first tournament I know
you're excited to be here, it's a 15 seed, how do you beat a, I mean it's a 15
seed, how do you beat a 2 seed? How do you turn the tables and get out of here
with an upset?  
DERRICK MERCER: Basically just go out there and play playing your heart out.
Going out there playing as hard as you can. Doing the little things, take care
of the ball, rebounding, stopping, making them play the way we play. That's
basically what we can do, just go out there and try to out hustle them, try to
out work them. We know Tennessee is a great team. They love to rebound, try to
stop their transition, a little bit, slow them down a little bit, keep them at
our pace.  
If we go out there, we make them some plays and take care of the ball we
should be fine.  
BRIAN GILMORE: I think that that's the keys to the important things to do.
Transition defense, rebound, and just really slow the pace of the game down
and take care of the ball.  
It's going to take a big effort. We need a lot of contributions from a lot of
different guys. It's going to be tough, but I think if we play hard and we
play smart and do the things that we have been working on this week that we'll
give ourselves the best opportunity.  
GARRISON CARR: Just feeding off what they said, we basically have to make sure
that we just play our style of basketball. We can't get caught up in
Tennessee's fast pace, quick shooting type of play. We have to just continue
doing what we have been doing all year.  
  
Q. Have you guys seen a team this year that kind of duplicates the pressure
that they put on the ball. Anybody that plays that tempo, that pace?  
GARRISON CARR: No, I don't think we have seen any other teams this year like
them. I know from watching them on TV the announcers always talk about how
they're one of the hardest playing teams in the nation. So obviously we're
going to have to match their intensity on the court and I don't think --
they're like -- they're unlike any other team we've played this year in terms
of their intensity and how they're going to press the whole game. So that's
something that we have been preparing for all week.  
DERRICK MERCER: I would say Maryland, who also presses and they give you one
good hard trap and that's common. They are compared to them a little bit.
Maryland will pressure, pressure defense, one hard trap and then if you get
past that one hard trap then you're fine and they will press you in the half
court so I would compare them to Maryland a little bit.  
But to a certain extent that's who I would compare them to.  
  
Q. Your conference has done pretty well in the tournament the last few
years, do you derive some confidence from that?  
BRIAN GILMORE: Yeah, I think we do a little bit. We take pride in the
conference we play in. We think it's a pretty strong conference. With some
well-coached teams and some teams that really did some good things
fundamentally. So, I think that we definitely look back on that and think that
that gives us more incentive to do well.  
Bucknell beating Kansas and Holy Cross having some success, at the same rate
we're still looking to make a name for ourselves and I think that tomorrow it
gives us a great opportunity to do that.  
  
Q. Garrison, how much during the season did you get a chance to see
Tennessee on television?  
GARRISON CARR: I definitely watched them on TV at least three times. I know I
watched them versus Memphis, I watched them versus Kentucky and I also watched
them versus Vanderbilt when they lost. So I have seen them on TV quite a bit
and obviously we watched a lot of film on them the past couple of days. So I'm
definitely more familiar with them than I was in the past.  
  
Q. For Derrick and Brian, could you both talk about just how you came to be
at American, how you ended up there and Garrison, I read in the paper about
how you ended up there in the Washington Post. So Brian and did Derrick if you
could just talk about that how you were recruited and how you ended up at
American?  
BRIAN GILMORE: Sure. I had a little bit of a crazy story with recruiting. I
went to three different high schools. A lot of different changes for injuries.
But basically American recruited me throughout those injuries, their interest
in me didn't waiver, as a lot of other colleges I guess pulled back
scholarships because I had chronic foot problems all throughout high school
and they're a school close to home and had some success basketball wise,
hadn't made the leap into the tournament, but had been in three conference
tournaments in the past seven years.  
So that just, that spoke a lot for me. So that ended up being my big decision.  
DERRICK MERCER: Yeah, I was I would say the same thing, the school's very
close to home, from my parents to come see me about four hours away. Again a
good relationship with Coach Jones and the rest of the staff and I was looking
at it as Coach Jones, who is a great coach and also was a great player. And
who plays my position. And I could get something out of my college career from
him, by playing for him. So I think that it would have been a good situation
for me because at the time American really didn't have a point guard, so I had
the opportunity to come in and work hard and come in and player Lee as a
freshman. So I just took the opportunity and here I am at American.  
  
Q. Given what George Mason did not too long ago, how much hope does that
give you guys that Cinderellas do exist and this year American can be that
role?  
GARRISON CARR: Well Coach Jones -- people have been asking us about that a
lot, like you guys can be just like George Mason, but what.  
Coach Jones has emphasize school district we don't want to be like George
Mason we want to be like American and we can use schools like George Mason is
and Bucknell in the past as examples of what can happen if you go into the
tournament and play your style of basketball, with confidence and believe you
can win. So George Mason is an example of what could happen, but we really
want to be American and play our style of basketball and make a name for
ourselves like Gilmore already mentioned.  
  
Q. Do you guys expect to be difficult to kind of avoid taking the beat and
playing fast with Tennessee? I know they try to force the tempo, but you guys
have said you don't want to play like that. Do you expect it to be difficult
to calm down? I know that instinct as a basketball player is probably just to
go fast?  
DERRICK MERCER: Yeah, it's definitely going to be difficult to try to calm
down because they're going to be pressuring you, and as basketball player, you
know that when somebody pressures you the first idea is to go by with them,
you don't want to play with the ball and keep them pressuring you because that
can lead to turnovers. But it makes you want to go fast and go by them and get
away from the pressure. So we're just going to have to be focused and stay
calm and be composed and learn how to just handle the pressure and let them
play at our pace.  
GARRISON CARR: We know that there's going to be a lot of quick shot
opportunities out there and we have to make sure and decide whether those are
good shots or not. Because with quick shots early in the shot clock, they're
awful tempting to take but we have to be disciplined and make the decision
during the game if that's a good shot to take and whether we should pass it up
and go into our offense or shoot the open first shot.  
  
Q. You guys did go into Maryland and win. Could somebody talk about how
y'all managed to, whether it was dictating tempo or what it was that you all
went in a Maryland and won with?  
BRIAN GILMORE: I think you hit the nail right on the head. We really did
dictate the tempo there. We were able to handle the pressure, Maryland
pressured us full court and did lot of pressure in the half court, but we were
able to take care of the ball, take good shots when we had good shots, make
them guard us for 35 seconds at a time and really limit them on the offensive
boards. We limited them to one shot. Got defensive rebounds and didn't give
them multiple opportunities to score in each possession and knocked down shots
when we were able to and that led to us a victory.  
  
Q. Garrison, you talk about playing American style of basketball, do you
think the opportunity tomorrow will be a chance to help put American on the
national landscape? Do you think many college basketball fans may not know
where American is?  
GARRISON CARR: Yeah, absolutely this is a great opportunity for to us put
American on the map and people still ask me like, "American University? Where
is that?" And I have to he will it them it's in Washington, D.C. so hopefully
tomorrow, being on the national scene, people from all over the nation will
watch us play and if we have a good showing they will remember where American
is and that's hopefully -- and that's what we want to do for the program, let
people know that American is in Washington, D.C., put it out there, and help
the program build from here.  
  
Q. A lot of basketball fans in Tennessee love Bruce Pearl, they love his
enthusiasm they love the fact that he paints himself orange for games, I
imagine you guys have seen some clips of some of his antics, what do you guys
think of Coach Pearl and his coaching style and his enthusiasm?  
GARRISON CARR: Well, he definitely encourages his players and his players play
just like how he coaches from my standpoint. You see him on the sidelines
standing up the whole game time jumping up and down it looks like he's
actually on the court a lot of time playing defense. So obviously his team
feeds off his energy and in terms of being a player does under his style, I
guess it's just exciting, because he's out there telling you to go faster,
telling you to take open shots, telling you to pressure the ball. And that's
just a lot of fun to do as a basketball player.  
THE MODERATOR: No more questions? All right. Thank you. At this time we'll go
ahead and get started with American Head Coach Jeff Jones. Coach, we'll have
you start us off with a few thoughts coming into Birmingham, your preparations
and then open it for questions.  
COACH JONES: Well, I think it goes without saying that we're real excited to
be here. Real excited to be a part of the tournament.  
First time for our institution, and it's been a great trip getting to this
point. I'm real proud of our guys, how hard they worked all year long. Not
much was expected of this group when we started, but they really banded
together and certainly became truly a team.  
So we definitely know we have got our work cut out for us tomorrow, but the
guys have been really practicing and trying to prepare and we're just excited
to have the chance to get out there tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Jones.  
  
Q. Coach, in the SEC tournament Tennessee's defense wasn't up to par, Coach
Pearl was kind of upset about it, they took a lot of criticism for it, what do
you see in preparing for Tennessee when you look at their defense? What did
you see there?  
COACH JONES: Well, I think they play a unique style. They put an awful lot of
pressure on you with their offense and their defense. They almost force a
faster tempo upon the game.  
Obviously they're an extremely athletic team. Probably one of the two most
athletic teams in the tournament. In my estimation.  
But the thing that really in watching as much film as we have that they really
it sets them apart is how hard they play. Individually, but collectively as
well.  
I think that really shows through defensively and they just attack the ball.
They swarm the ball. They have always got players around. So it's very
effective, it's not a style that many people play, it's a difficult style to
play, but if you have players willing to put forth that much effort with that
much athleticism, obviously it can be very, very effective.  
  
Q. I know you talked about this a lot but for you just to be back in the
tournament with the fast start to your career, talk about what for you the
journey to get back here was like?  
COACH JONES: It's been awhile. Maybe I was spoiled early on. The wait in
between '97 and now and obviously the close calls, the three years in a row
where we lost in the Patriot League Championship, made this opportunity that
much sweeter. And I'm very pleased, I guess, that I get to get back along with
this group of young men. I know there's going to be a whole lot of press
conferences for the rest of the month throughout the tournament, there's going
to be a whole lot of coaches telling you about how they have got great kids.  
I'm sure they all believe it. I also know that I have great affection for
these guys on the team. They are a great group of young men, not just because
we have gotten this far, not just because we have won some basketball games,
but because of who they are off the floor, what they represent for our
university. So to have a chance to come back as part of a team with as special
a group as this is to me, makes it even better.  
  
Q. As a player and coach, obviously, you, at Virginia, big time program,
what's it been like getting the recognition for American now? Being I guess a
small fish in a big pond there in Washington, D.C. and you know how, what it's
like at the big schools, what's it mean to you to get this recognition for
American now?  
COACH JONES: It's great. There's so many deserving people at American that
have been plugging away for so many years, have been keeping their fingers
crossed, been coming to games and supporting the team, supporting the program,
but being disappointed, being teased even when we made it to the three
straight conference championship games.  
So it really is special to be again part of the team that has allowed all of
those folks to realize the dream that they have had.  
The media coverage has been pretty remarkable. It's not something that we're
used to. I'm sure it won't -- it won't always be there in the way, but to, for
American University to kind of get its moment in the sun, in the Washington,
D.C. media, but also in the national media, is great for our school. It's a
great place to work, some wonderful people there, and we're kind of maybe a
little bit of an unknown quantity in the sense that it is such a great school.
But I'm not sure maybe outside the boundaries there on the east coast how many
people are really familiar with AU, but hopefully we have done a little bit of
something with that.  
  
Q. In the NCAA tournament how much of it is preparing your team and how much
of it is preparing for the other team and does that equation change depending
upon where you are in the seedings and matchups and whatever?  
COACH JONES: Yeah, I think that equation changes quite a bit depending upon
where you fall in that spectrum.  
For us, we have got to be very aware of what Tennessee likes to do and the
type of game that they would like to play. Obviously if they're able to get
the game at the tempo that they want, that's not good news for us. So we have
got to resist the temptation because there will be opportunities, but we have
got to understand the difference between great opportunities and fool's gold.
We have got to be aggressive, but at the same time we have got to keep in mind
that a slower pace game is more to our suiting. And that's much easier said
than done.  
But that's basically the thinking that we have been trying to instill in our
players. There's still a lot of things that we have done all year long that we
want to try to stick to, but because Tennessee is so athletic, they do
pressure you with the ball and without the ball, so much, it's going to take a
great effort mentally and physically on our part to just give ourselves a
chance.  
  
Q. I'm working on a story about how NCAA tournaments seed the hotels and
you've been high seed before in the past, you're a low seed right now, I'm
wondering what differences, if any, there are between being a high seed and a
low seed in a hotel and are there any competitive advantages or disadvantages
for the hotel stay?  
COACH JONES: I guess my, as you were asking the question my initial response
is anybody that is a part of this tournament that is worried about is their
hotel as nice as somebody else's, I think has got it way wrong. To me it's
great. Our hotel we're staying at the Embassy Suites and it's outstanding, the
people, the hospitality has been wonderful. They could have stuck us someplace
else and we would still be excited to be here. I don't know really what quite
honestly that has to do with what we're attempting to do. Now maybe for the
fans and all that, but and maybe we have a little bit of a different
perspective, I'm not sure. That's -- it's just not something that I ever
really paid a whole lot of attention to.  
  
Q. Getting back to what you said earlier about Tennessee plays a unique
style. Teams in the SEC have been competing against that for three full
seasons. Other teams in this tournament have not. Does that give Tennessee
somewhat of an advantage going into this tournament do you think because teams
aren't accustomed to it?  
COACH JONES: I do think that any time you play a team with a rather unique or
certainly a very rare style of play if they're in your conference, you
gradually over the years you become accustomed to how you want to attack
certain things. With a short time frame for preparation, you don't know the
nuances. You can say, okay, we don't want to throw the ball here, we don't
want to be caught up in this or that, but knowing how to do it is something
that quite honestly takes time. So I do think that it is, or it certainly can
be an advantage for Tennessee, because you can't just come out, certainly we
can't just come out and play our normal game and hope to experience success.
We have got to adjust things based upon the way Tennessee likes to play. I.  
  
Q. I want to go back to you personally. Have you heard from people who were
sort of like, "Oh, that's where Jeff Jones is."   
COACH JONES: I don't know if they knew where I was or not, but I've heard from
people that I haven't heard from for 20 years. And it's been great.  
Former high school classmates, former high school teammates, so it's been nice
being able to reconnect in that way.  
  
Q. Are there any particular challenges to having your team up and ready to
play at such an early starting time at 11:15?  
COACH JONES: Not really. This group has tended to be good, I don't know if I
would say early risers, but we have had a number of 1 o'clock games, I know
we're going a little bit earlier than that, but some of our better efforts I
thought were afternoon type games. So that's not something I'm real concerned
about. These guys I've been told that by some of the media in the DC area that
these guys are kind of maybe a little bit boring, so that they're, I'm sure
they're, we'll have our meeting tonight, do our film work, and they will get a
good night sleep and be up ready to go.  
Quite honestly, I could see like a Garrison Carr or some of those guys waking
up before the wake up call. I would have to check, I think it's 7:30 pregame
meal is about 7:45. Does that sound about right?  
  
Q. In the time frame between when you won your tournament and the selection
bracket, were you putting a lot of thought or are we going to be a 16, a 15, a
14, seeding wise, and what advantages, disadvantages that might hold?  
COACH JONES: No. Just as a rough guess, I would have guessed a 15 as we
received. And that simply was derived from a quick glance at the RPI's on line
and kind of just counting them up and saying, okay, I figure we'll probably
fit in here somewhere. But it really wasn't something that we spent a lot of
time worrying about. Again, and I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but
we're thrilled to be a part of it. And all the peripheral stuff doesn't really
affect that, the fact that we're in the tournament, we have a chance to play
against a great team, that was going to be the case regardless of what our
seed was. We were going to be an underdog regardless of 16, 15, 14, whatever.
But so we didn't have to spend a whole lot of time thinking about that.  
  
Q. Talking to Travis Lay in the locker room, telling me about his family
ties to Tennessee, are you concerned at all that Travis may bleed orange?  
COACH JONES: No. No. No. Anybody that has been around Travis for the last four
years knows how much he's put of himself into our program. He joined the
program as a walk-on. Through his hard work and determination very quickly
earned a scholarship. Has established himself as one of our hardest playing
guys and doesn't just do the job on the court, I mean he's our best student,
we tease him quite a bit, but I think he got an a minus and I asked him why
was he slacking off. So he's just done such a great job. So I know he's very,
very excited as a senior to finally be part of something like this.  
I know his family was real excited about getting a chance to come down to this
part of the country. But, yeah, I don't think there's any chance that he'll be
bleeding orange.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Tennessee's guards, particularly Lofton and JaJuan
Smith and how they stack up with guard tandems that you've played or coached
against.  
COACH JONES: Well, they're extremely explosive. They're very different from
one another. Lofton obviously is the guy that can shoot it from miles away,
has great range. And then if you play that too hard, he has the ability to get
the ball to the basket.  
I think that JaJuan Smith is a little bit of the reverse. He's such a slasher,
so athletic, so quick off the dribble that if you don't respect that, he's
just going to go by you and he's going to create all kind of chaos.  
But if you concentrate so much, if you back off of him, he's got the
complimentary three point range to make you pay there. So they're a real nice
compliment and the fact that Howell and Ramar Smith kind of you can throw
those guys in there too and it really creates some matchup problems. Not many
teams are blessed with two guards that good, but then when you throw in those
other guys, that do a real solid job, you got to make a decision somewhere
what the matchup is going to be.  
Who is your three man? Who is your three man going to matchup with?  
So it's, it creates quite a bit of problems and is a big part of why they have
been as successful this year as they have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I would like to start with all you guys, have you noticed in practice
this past week completely different mindset, more excitement, more enthusiasm
for appearing in your first NCAA tournament?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, there's been a lot of excitement in practice. Guys are
more focused. Everybody's coming out with a lot of energy. So it's good to see
and hopefully he we come out with the same energy level that we had at
practice the last couple days.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Definitely, say we have more energy, because it's our first
time and it's a big stage, everybody's excited. Some guys haven't been before.
It's definitely exciting and it's definitely good because when you have better
practices you tend to have better games. So, this week is really important to
have some good solid practices with a lot of energy to come out and play hard
tomorrow.  
LONGAR LONGAR: Just like they said, a lot of focus, intensity in practice,
just a lot of excitement. We're very fortunate to be here. We know it's going
to be a really good game. St. Joseph's team, we watched them some, we just
been preparing for them. So we're excited to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How do you guard against just being happy to be here? This time last year
your season was done for you David and Longar. But how do you guard against
just being happy to be in the tournament and forget you got to play a game?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Well, we just try to use that energy that we have from being
excited to be here and we try to use it in the game.  
We know that if we're going to have a chance to win the game tomorrow we're
going to have to play with a lot of energy, get a lot of stops and defense.
Make sure we get rebounds. So we're going to try to use that energy that we
have from the excitement and hopefully it turns out well for us.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: We definitely just need to use our own energy and remember how
we or remember how it was last year to be done. Some of us weren't here, but
at the same time, that feeling is it's so close and watching games on TV you
can see teams losing and you see their last game being played and some of the
seniors last time they will be playing on the college level. So, just kind of
for me, it just kind of helps put things in perspective and kind of gives you
more excitement to play.  
LONGAR LONGAR: It's important, I mean, last year like you said, at this time
of the year we were done already. But we got to understand that you lose, you
go home. It's not going to make any difference, so we got to come out with a
lot of focus, a lot of energy of the you got to elevate your game to a whole
different level. Every team in this tournament is good. We just got to take
care of business tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Guys, most of us and most of your fans back home haven't seen this team
play very much. When you look at their style of play and maybe some of their
personnel, is there a team in the Big-12 conference that you could sort of
compare them to for us?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just looking at them I think that they're best compared to
maybe a Texas A & M. They have great inside players and they have a 3-point
shooter and good guards who are quick and can drive. So we just kind of
compare them to them and they're looking to pound the ball inside and they
also take open shots when they're available. So we kind of compare them to
Texas A & M.  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: Definitely. I was going to say, "Texas A & M" too.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, really, what does Coach Rich do for you guys? Kind
of -- how does he work and why is he effective as far as strength training and
all that?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think just because he's not a lot of teams have a more of a
football strength and conditioning coach doing their workouts and stuff and I
think that Coach Rich is more prepared for basketball. And he kind of designs
our workouts like that. And he builds our conditioning program to match kind
of a basketball aspect and more than just running for distance or running for
speed on all that. So, I think just kind of the way he puts things together
and the way he incorporates basketball into everything we do is important.  
  
Q. Blake, this question for you, you went through the injuries and before
that everybody was talking about you and Michael Beasley as two of the top
freshmen in the country. But when you went through the injuries, your name
kind of fell off the list a little bit. Is there a certain amount of
excitement for you coming to a NCAA tournament being able to be back in the
spotlight and get some of that recognition back that you lost in the
injuries?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: There definitely is a certain level of excitement, not just
because of being back in the spotlight, but just to be here in the NCAA
tournament. And being able to play is something I've been watching since I was
-- as long as I can remember. So, it's more of just being able to be here and
have the experience and get to play in these games, not so much really trying
to put my name back in the spotlight or whatever. Just trying to come out and
have fun and play and win games. That's what's important.  
  
Q. David, do you remember when Tasheed Carr played at Iowa State; and, if
so, what do you remember about him?  
DAVID GODBOLD: I know he's really quick, he can get to the basket and if you
leave him open, he's not afraid to take an open three. Just watching tape on
him, from what I've seen so far, he does a good job of penetrating and dishing
out for the 3-point shots for this team. So, we just have to be aware of that
and make sure we contain him because he's a really good point guard.  
  
Q. How tough do you guys think you are as a team I assume you think you're
tough and why?  
DAVID GODBOLD: In games we're tough. Some games we're tougher. We're not tough
all the time. If we play together, that makes us a better team, and if we come
out tomorrow and we show what we have been showing for the last couple days in
practice and previous game before our last loss we showed a lot of toughness,
we showed a lot of heart and that's what we have to bring out and that's why I
think we're tough.  
  
Q. David and Longar, you guys seem during your poor stretches this year you
really had a hard time scoring the basketball, especially making shots from
the outside. So what can you do to improve that in this tournament where if
you miss shots you're going home? David first.  
DAVID GODBOLD: Just make sure we get the ball to the right people at the right
time. The strength of our team right now is our post men and once they start
getting doubled, which hopefully will happen, because you have to be able to
respect those guys, you know, and once they kick it out the guards just got to
be ready to step up and make shots. So just be confident when we're shooting,
be confident when it's down low, make sure you make a strong move and
hopefully that will help out for us. We struggled a lot early just thinking
about shots, missing shots, so now we're trying to make our self more relaxed
and just be confident.  
LONGAR LONGAR: We are limiting, we got to limit ourselves, execute down the
stretch, make sure that we don't get away from the game plan, run our plays
and just follow the game plan, basically. I think if we continue to do that,
throughout the game, most likely we'll win. Just follow the coach's game plan.  
  
Q. When you guys have had some tough shooting nights you've been able to
come back other games and shoot well. What is it about that? That you're able
to do that. Is it just some games the shots are on. You don't worry about
confidence or things like that?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Sometimes it's attributed to how we practice maybe the night
before. Some of the games we didn't perform as well in I think our practice
level wasn't as high as coach wanted it to be. So, if we just take how we did
today, I think we would be shooting pretty well tomorrow. So we'll just have
to just keep confident in yourself. Know that you can make a shot, and know
just, just don't have any worries about it.  
  
Q. For any of the players who want to take this up, to have a coach whose
got so much NCAA tournament experience as a player and some as a coach, do
y'all feed off that? Is there any advice that he's given y'all that kind of
helps y'all settle down for this game and get confidence?  
LONGAR LONGAR: He tells us stories. A lot of stories about his former teams
and the teams that he's been in. And what it takes to win games at this level
and to be -- and what it means to be in the NCAA tournament and how you have
to play.  
He helps us in so many different ways. To just focus and understand that every
game is a win-or-go-home from this point on. So, it's just a story, it's just
stories that he told us about his former teams and the teams that he played
on. And what it took for guys to come together and play, I mean to continue to
win and move on.  
  
Q. Blake, I wonder if you could talk about this matchup specifically from
the low post aspect of it. They're a team that likes to get out and shoot
threes and they don't really seem to have that strong inside presence. Is
that, in your minds, one of the biggest keys of this game? Is Blake, you and
Longar establishing the down low game?  
BLAKE GRIFFIN: I think it is. But, at the same time, we need to do a good job
of distributing the ball and not just going to one player at one time. Because
if you look at some of the games where we played really well we have four or
five six guys playing really well and hitting shots. And that's what's going
to make it tough to beat us is if we're, if a lot of guys are clicking and a
lot of guys are shooting and scoring because you can't really focus in on one
guy and stop him, you have to stop five guys. I think that's one of the most
important things in this game.  
LONGAR LONGAR: They're a team that can shoot the ball, all five guys on the
floor can shoot. We got to be able to guard them outside all the way to the
3-point line. They have a really good six-ten, three man. We're going to have
to do a good job on him. He runs through screens and stuff like that so we
just got to make sure that we contain him. It's going to be a team effort to
beat this team tomorrow. It's not going to be really an individual.  
  
Q. Do you guys, coming into this game, is it kind of refreshing in a way,
and anybody can answer, to step out of your league and play somebody away from
the Big-12 since you had 16 tough conference games plus the tournament?  
DAVID GODBOLD: Yeah, it's exciting for that, just to get a chance to play
against somebody else. Playing in the Big-12 is a tough league, of course, and
it's good to see how we matchup against those other teams. Being in the NCAA
tournament is a great opportunity everybody here that's playing in the NCAA
has to be a good team or they wouldn't be here. So, we just get an opportunity
to play against another top tier team and hopefully we just perform well and
just come out with a lot of energy and focus.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you guys. Coach, why don't you start with an
opening statement and then we'll go to questions.  
COACH CAPEL: We're excited to be here obviously to be a part of the greatest
sporting event which is the NCAA tournament. Really happy for our guys to get
the experience. Some of them for the first time.  
We're happy to be here in Birmingham. There's a lot of basketball tradition
here in the city and in this state. And hopefully we can come out and play
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. How do you approach a post season play? Some coaches say hey, it's a new
season. Do you approach it that way or is it just another game extension of
the season?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, it is a new season. There's new hope for everyone that made
this tournament. And it's no different for us. One of the things I told our
guys just with my past experience of playing in this tournament and having an
opportunity to coach in this tournament, before, is number one; let's have a
lot of fun with it. Let's really have fun when you play.  
But that's not anything different than I tell our guys all the time. I think
you should have fun when you play. It's not -- if it's not fun, then you're
not going to be as good as you can be. And when it gets to be when it's not
fun, you shouldn't play any more. That's just my opinion.  
But approach it with a sense of urgency. All year long you try to get your
guys to believe that, but now when you get to this point, every game really
could be your last. For this group, this could be the last time this group
could be together. Today could be the last practice that we have. So, you
really want to try to savor each moment, but really lay everything out on the
line to try to keep extending your season.  
So, that's something that we have talked about with our guys. A sense of
urgency, playing with incredible passion and being consistent with it all game
long.  
  
Q. He was wondering if you could just talk about this team and its second
year, the makeup of the team, who do you credit for on your team as becoming
really good leaders for you and guys that kind of carry on your message on the
floor?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't know. That's something you probably have to ask them.
It's an area I still think that we have room for improvement. Because
leadership has to be consistent. Leadership can't be just when you're playing
well or things are going good for you.  
I think all of our guys have a lot of room to grow as far as leadership.
Obviously, our seniors have more experience, David and Longar being four year
guys and being guys that have played in three NCAA tournaments, David actually
playing in the three tournaments, he'll play tomorrow, obviously, but in the
two previous ones that he's been here.  
So, hopefully our guys can lean on them for some experience and hopefully they
can share some of their experiences in the NCAA tournament. I think they won a
game their freshman year and their sophomore year in the NCAA tournament it
wasn't quite as good for them. But that's an area in our program where we
still have to continue to grow.  
  
Q. When you guys have defended well pretty much all season, including your
last stretch of games, but you've had a hard time scoring the basketball and
you said that at the start of the season including the Big-12 tournament. So
how will you overcome that? How will you make shots in your first NCAA game?  
COACH CAPEL: Hopefully we just, we do just that, we make shots. There's -- I
don't think there's any coach that has a secret formula for making shots.
Sometimes you don't.  
We want to get good shots and hopefully if we're getting good shots, we're
making a good amount of them. Those that have seen us play this year when we
make shots, especially from the perimeter, that really makes us a difficult, a
more difficult team to beat because it opens things up inside for our post
guys.  
So hopefully tomorrow's a day that we can make shots. And if we do that, then
and we do a lot of other things, then hopefully that means we have a chance to
win the game.  
  
Q. If I'm home watching, I'm a Sooner fan watching the game what do I need
to look for to say that Oklahoma is playing well today?  
COACH CAPEL: If we're making shots. That's really what it is with us. We, I
think our guys for the most part with the exception of a few games here, I
think we play hard all the time, I think our guys get after it. But when we're
not making shots, it's not pretty. So that's really what it is for us is
making shots. Obviously we have to execute. We really have to execute on both
ends of the floor. Offensively, defensively we have to communicate at a high
level. St. Joseph's is good. They're well coached, they have very skilled
players, they have a toughness about them, they defend you well, and they can
obviously score the basketball, averaging 75 a game this year and get it from
different areas. Obviously Calathes is the guy that can really score and he
has a confidence and a swagger about him that on tape I love it, I don't know
if I will love it tomorrow, but in watching him and getting prepared, I really
like that swagger that he has. Ahmad Nivins is a post player that can really
score the basketball and shoots an amazing 65 percent from the floor. And so
there are a lot of things we have to do defensively to put ourself in a
position. But if you're at home sitting and we're making shots, then usually
that makes us look a lot better.  
  
Q. You just mentioned St. Joseph's being tough. Taylor just told me in there
that he thought that was one of the things that was missing from your team at
Kansas City, how do you get that back?  
COACH CAPEL: Well hopefully our guys will play tough. That's interesting that
he would say that. Hopefully our guys play tough. Hopefully they have more of
a passion and a pride and a sense of urgency than we did in Kansas City. If we
don't, then we won't be here long.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk, talking to your players this week they
talk so much about your talk with them after the Colorado game, what was the
biggest change in your team that happened after that game?  
COACH CAPEL: Our guards started playing better. I thought we played with more
of a sense of urgency. I thought we got tougher for a stretch there. But the
thing with us is that it's been sort of inconsistent. Usually when we're bad,
we're very bad. But then somehow we can come back and we can go through a
stretch of two or three games where we look really good. And we beat teams. We
had a very bad performance, I felt like at Kansas City in both games. And
that's no disrespect to anyone and especially Colorado. But hopefully that
means that we can come back today, sorry, tomorrow, and we can have a really
good performance tomorrow. It's going to take that to beat it this St.
Joseph's team.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Rob Ferguson and what he means to St. Joseph's and how
you plan to maybe handle him?  
COACH CAPEL: He's a difficult matchup and the thing about that, they get most
of their scoring, if you look at their season stats, their top three scorers
are their front court players. Calathes is six-ten and playing mainly on the
wing, but because he's six-ten you can kind of play him all over the floor.
Nivins, at six-nine, the post guy, second leading scorer. And then Ferguson.
And the challenge that he presents is, he's really a face up skilled four man.
Pick and pop guy. Shoots threes, puts it on the floor a little bit. Can post.
And that's just sort of a different matchup, especially when we have Blake and
Longar in, because one of those guys is going to have to defend away from the
basket a lot. And for us we have to really make sure that we have the right
guy. Because one of the things we don't want Blake away from the basket too
much because he's our best rebounder.  
And so it does provide some intriguing matchups for us and some challenging
matchups for us. Ferguson is good, I mean he shoots it, gets it off quick,
confident player, strong, pretty good athlete. And they're older. That's the
thing about these kids from St. Joseph's, they're older. They're seniors,
couple of them fifth year seniors, couple of them are transfers, sophomores
and juniors, so they're a little bit older and they ever been a lot and they
know how to win. They have won.  
They're well coached as well. And there's a tradition there at that program.
And so like I said, it's going to be a tough matchup for us. But we'll be
ready to go.  
  
Q. Do you have a relationship at all with Phil Martelli and if so what do
you think of him as a coach?  
COACH CAPEL: I think he's a really good coach. I'm from the east so I've known
about him for awhile. When I was an assistant with my dad at Old Dominion we
played them. He's a good guy. A good guy and a very good coach and has done an
incredible job at St. Joseph's.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard, Stoopes wanted to put Blake at tight end if
you leave him at home. Did you talk to him about that?  
COACH CAPEL: No, not really. Not really. Surprised he knew who Blake Griffin
was, with his comments about football the other day. He knew who our starting
tail back was. No, I'm just kidding.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes St. Joseph's and we'll start with
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For all three of you, the Oklahoma guys basically asked to compare you
guys to a Big-12 team. They came up with Texas A & M as a team they thought
you were like. Looking at that, do you see them similar to any of the teams
you have played this year?   
PAT CALATHES: Well the coach kind of compared to -- I don't know if you
remember, last year's U Mass team they had a team that pounded the ball inside
and really went more inside outside rather than outside inside. So we kind of
look at them, compare them to them. They got two really strong post players
and stuff and I think that's going to be one of our main focuses tomorrow.
We're going to have to eliminate that.  
  
Q. I guess if y'all could kind of talk about what you've seen, you talked
about Oklahoma pounds it inside just what you've seen from them and if you
like, kind of underdog role after the last time St. Joseph went to the
tournament as a top seed.  
ROB FERGUSON: Throughout the whole season we have been pretty much seen as the
underdog. So we're kind of used to that. And that kind of gives us extra chip
on our shoulder. So we'll go out there and we'll play and we'll give our
hearts tomorrow to everything that we do out there on the court.  
PAT CALATHES: I've been saying all year, if we play the way we can play in a
lot of games this year -- we have played that way against, you know, Nova and
Xavier both times and a couple other games, we're a very, very competitive
team. And I think we can compete with pretty much anybody if we play at that
level and we set our pace early and play the defense I think, that I think we
can play, but if we don't, then as you can see all year we have struggled if
we haven't played the way we can play. So pretty much we're really looking
forward to tomorrow's game, we're really prepared, and we're going to come out
and it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. Pat, Blake Griffin said he met you through your brother. Did you play
against him or what are your impressions of him in general?  
PAT CALATHES: He's a very good player. I've seen him play at the McDonald's
game. Nick, my little brother, played in the game this last year and I met him
through there. And very, very strong. He's really a strong player. He's a very
good player. So he's definitely done well this year, and in my opinion, he is
the guy we're going to have to try to contain tomorrow night.  
  
Q. A couple of you guys talked mark about what Tasheed Carr has brought to
your team this year?  
ROB FERGUSON: He has brought, last year we didn't have like a vocal leader,
Tasheed came here and he says everything that needs to be said when no one
wants to talk and he's just always leak in practice he'll be there. He's the
one that will get on you if you're doing something wrong. But he's also the
one that helps you if you have any trouble. And basically he's the vocal lead
are right now.  
  
Q. Is he kind of like what we hear a Philly ball player is?  
ROB FERGUSON: Yeah, he's a Philly guard, because all the guards in Philly,
they're all tough, they, like he just has a mentality like that.  
  
Q. For Pat, if you and your brother, would you have bet him before the year
which of y'all were going to make if one of y'all was going to make the NCAA
tournament that it would be y'all. That is just the way it turned out?  
PAT CALATHES: I thought we had a real good shot at the beginning of the year
in making the tournament. We started out 4-4. But just, I really thought we
are a very good team. I said that through the whole year, we just didn't
really start out, we didn't use our skills and our advantages to the best we
could at the beginning of the year. When we really started doing that we
became really tough. So I didn't think at all that Florida wasn't going to you
can ma the tournament. I really thought that they had a real good shot,
especially how they started out. They were arranged halfway through the year,
I think they were ranked maybe 18th. So they just didn't really finish the way
they wanted to.  
  
Q. Ahmad, I assume you've seen Griffin on tape now, your impressions of him
and how do you deal with him?  
AHMAD NIVINS: I think he's a really strong player. He has really good foot
work, he has great hands. And I think just like Pat said, he's going to be one
of the vocal guys that we're going to have to focus on and that we're really
going to have to tune in on both ends of the floor if we want to be
successful. But I think our defense is going to be really crucial in this game
and hopefully we'll come home with a win.  
  
Q. Even for guys that aren't Philly guys, once they get there do you kind of
adopt that mentality that we all hear about?  
PAT CALATHES: I think so. Just seeing, I don't know from other Philly schools
or anything, but just seeing from the way our school is and how and our team
carries itself and how we practice and play, every game, I think. So I think
everybody becomes really tough minded just coming up here. I think a lot of
guys, I've seen it in myself and I've also seen it in a lot of my teammates
when guys come in soft mentally and then they really just I don't know if it's
just playing college basketball, but definitely playing for St. Joseph's I
think you become a lot mentally tougher and physically tougher. I don't know
if that's just college basketball in general but that's definitely what's
happened at St. Joseph's since I've been here.  
  
Q. Rob have you seen any of that?  
ROB FERGUSON: Like Pat said when you first get to college, like probably like
mentally soft, but just like the whole Philly area just like especially the
big five, like you have to have that mentality or like you'll be over powered
and it really helps for you to have the mentality like that. Because then you
can go forward and you'll be able to see everything that you can do with your
teammates and your coaches, especially like Coach Martelli, he kind of makes
you adapt to that mentality like he wants you to have that mentality. No one
can beat you and he just makes you stronger.  
  
Q. Guys, apologize I've been outside, if I repeat a question slap me down.
Is it refreshing in a way to step out of the A 10 and play somebody else like
a Big-12 team this time of year. Pat, you start and head on.  
PAT CALATHES: Definitely this is what we have been planning on doing all year,
make it to the tournament. So definitely if feels great to be in this
position, just making it here is a great thing but also we want to obviously
move on and past Game One. So definitely it feels good to be in this position.  
ROB FERGUSON: It always feels good because you can see where you stack up with
all the best teams in the nation. And see where you stand.  
AHMAD NIVINS: It's just a great, wonderful feeling all around. You watch these
big schools throughout the year and you wonder all season how you will matchup
against a team like than we finally get that chance and I'm glad my teammates
are here with me we just got to move forward and hopefully we'll get a win.  
Q. Pat, what in the world was it like growing up in that house with the
three of you guys as competitive as I guess you all were?  
PAT CALATHES: It was -- in one word I don't think I could really explain it.
Definitely, it was definitely different. Just growing up having the three of
us. Really, my dad pretty much drove us to be competitive against each other.
We would go over to his house probably five o'clock at night and stuff and
probably stay there out on the court for probably 7:00 to 11:00 almost every
night and that was just weekdays and stuff and that was when we were little
kids and everything just growing up try to be in the position we're at now. So
I guess all the hard work and everything really has paid off in the long run.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll go ahead and get an opening
statement from Coach Martelli and then go right to questions.  
COACH MARTELLI: I think that having the opportunity to get an extra day and
play the Friday night segment probably helped us because the anxiousness that
we felt going into selection Sunday. Monday we were able to get just a
shooting and lifting session in. Tuesday, a session at home and then traveled
here and got a chance to have a full practice early last evening and then we
practiced already today.  
So I think that for the three guys that you had up here to have the
opportunity, creates a lifetime of memories and that's really what every coach
in here would tell you that that's what they're trying to do, to give these
kids a college basketball experience that they would never forget and being
selected has allowed us to give that, this group that special opportunity. And
feeling.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How does it feel for you to have your team back I guess the last time was
2004 when you played an Oklahoma team in a regional final. Just how do you
feel about being back this year?  
COACH MARTELLI: Would you remind me, how did that game end up that? Well -- I
have a twitch every time I hear Oklahoma, to be honest with you and see
orange, but that's just me.  
(Laughter.)  
I think that for our program it's very significant. Because what could happen
when you're in a non-BCS conference is where have you gone and what have you
done?  
We have had terrific years since that 2004 team played in the regional final.
We played in the NIT Championship Game, we played in the Atlantic 10
Championship Game, the next year we played in the A 10 Championship Game. We
played in the NIT again and we won a couple of home games in the NIT. And last
year was the kind of the blip, we won 18 times but weren't good enough for
post season play. So I think that any time out of sight out of mind and this
team and these players to accomplish an at-large bid is very significant for
our program. And we haven't gone away and we're not as good as we were,
obviously, in 2004, but this is a group that has a unique talents also.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Tasheed Carr has brought to this team; and
being a Philly guy, is he typical of the Philly guard?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, Tasheed, number one, has a vocal presence that this team
doesn't have. Basically if you were down in the locker room right now
Tasheed's doing all the talking, and his teammates are doing all the of the
listening.  
And that's the way it is on the court also. If Tasheed was not talking, then
we would have a group that only wanted their coach to do the talking. We tried
that last year and to be honest with you it was exhausting. And it was
exhausting for the players to hear me beating on their ears and it was hard
for me to physically do that day in and day out.  
Tasheed is, he was voted captain by his teammates before he ever played a game
this year, so that's the significance of what he brings intangibly.  
I think that on the basketball floor, there's a lot of improvement that could
happen with Tasheed. And he's really like a sponge with Doug Overton. Doug was
a 12 year NBA player, he never had anything longer than a one year contract.
And Doug was a Philly guy and played at Lasalle and Tasheed has really soaked
up that atmosphere from Doug.  
I still think there's aways to go, I think he can become a more consistent
shooter, he could become a better long-range shooter, and he at some point in
time he has to eliminate the emotion from his game. I think that emotion is
good, but when you get over emotional at that position, it could be
detrimental both to you and to your team.  
So I would say typical Philadelphia guard? Probably not yet, but I think by
the end of his career next year he will be.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Coach. Thank you.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the South Alabama players.  
  
Q. For all three. First trip for you Daon and Brandon to the NCAA's.
Demetric, it is your second trip. What are your thoughts coming to the NCAA?  
DAON MERRITT: Like I said, it is my first trip with the University of South
Alabama, of course, and I think when you're invited to the NCAA's, it's a
special privilege. It just speaks volumes of the things that you've done all
year. From preseason to your non-conference to your conference schedule and
now to be playing in the post season is a special honor.  
BRANDON DAVIS: Being this is my first opportunity to play in the tournament, I
think it's a blessing for me to be able to come home and play in front of my
home crowd. It will be big and we have an opportunity to win, too.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: For me being my second time coming with the University of
South Alabama, it is my senior year so it's going to be special. This year we
didn't win the Sun Belt so it just goes to show that we had a special year
this year. The committee invited us here and we're excited to be here and we
just got to come in here and play hard.  
  
Q. Do you guys want what Butler has, that mid major credibility, is that
something you guys are working towards?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think that's something that every Mid Major would want
would be top 10, top 15 in the country, they work hard, they earned their
credibility, and that's something we're trying to do now with the University
of South Alabama. South Alabama  
  
Q. What have been your impressions of Butler's two guards, Mike Green and
A.J. Graves?  
DAON MERRITT: We're familiar with them and we know that their guards are two
terrific guards, they're two seniors like we have two great guards and they're
both seniors. They have accolades and we have accolades. We're not really
concerned with the things on paper, we know we both have to go, our back court
has to go out and compete against their back court and which everyone is
victorious, I mean I think that speaks for itself.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: They got two good guards and we think we do too. So we just
go out there and compete. All of us have to go out there and put our shoes on.
So we just have to go out there and play.  
  
Q. Kind of change the subject a little bit, doing something on Ron Arrow, on
your coach, just did you know anything about him when he started and what do
you think has been the key to his success this year?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: For me, personally, I really didn't know too much of Coach
Arrow until he got here. He came in, he was a very demanding coach, and he
knows what he wants. And he's not going to settle for anything less.  
  
Q. Does it seem odd to you to have a coach come back to a school where he
was fired ten years earlier, did you know about that? How quickly did you
learn about that and does that seem odd to you or?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: To me, once I heard his name in the interview process that's
when everything came out as far as him getting fired and coming back. And it
didn't really seem odd to me because he went to Corpus Christi and he was
successful there. Every program wants a successful coach. And he came here and
we have been successful this year, too.  
  
Q. How close to you feel like you are to attaining that every year Mid Major
success?  
DAON MERRITT: I think we're establishing our own identity. We're not trying to
be like none of the other Mid Majors and we really don't consider ourselves a
Mid Major. We have been in the post season for the last three years and I
think with the group of guys we have coming back next year that's something
that we will continue to have that same kind of success. We have a great
coach, great student-athletes and we're playing for a great university. And to
bring notoriety to your university is something that we want to continue
doing. So that we can compete against the best schools.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: Basically the same thing, we want our school to continue
success. And in order to do that you got to have a good coaching staff and
good players. And our roster only has two seniors and we have a lot of talent
on that team and some of it is not getting to play as much right now, but next
year I think they're going to fulfill the role and comeback next year and
continue this success.  
BRANDON DAVIS: They summed it up.  
  
Q. Can you touch on the fact that you guys -- it looks like you're probably
going to have the crowd behind you, the fact you're playing here in
Birmingham, you're only about four hours away. Can you talk about that, and
just, I guess the kind of edge it may give y'all the confidence it may give
y'all coming into the game tomorrow and just like how excited you are about
that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think it gives us a lot of confidence. Once we heard our
name called out on the committee inviting us in to the tournament that gave us
a lot of confidence right there that people believed in us. And coming into
the state of Alabama and we're the only team in the state of Alabama that's
basically in the NCAA tournament. So, I think that is going to be a lot of
confidence for us in the fans to come out and support us.  
DAON MERRITT: Just elaborate, we're 17-1 at home. Our crowd has been great for
us. We considered them our sixth man. So we always felt we had their support
and we're very confident when they come and support us. And that's what you
want from a university. And we think we deserve it.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate a little bit, have you had a chance to think about the
strange trip that you've had from Jacksonville to Birmingham Southern and to
this great season you had at South Alabama?  
BRANDON DAVIS: I feel like it's been a journey really for me it's been a
learning experience also. Being able to play at different schools on different
styles, it really helps me. So I feel like this is a good fit for me and here
I am. This is where I am, here, in Birmingham. Playing for the NCAA.  
  
Q. When you left St. Rays years ago, this isn't where you expected to end
up. Can you talk about that journey and what it's like to end up here playing
for this school and in the NCAA tournament?  
DAON MERRITT: I think it's great. I think the things I've done at the South
Alabama have been special. I'm happy to be here, I developed some great
relationships, of course, I got engaged a few weeks ago so my journey and in
Mobile has been great. It's been great. I have great teammates, I play for a
great coach, I have a great athletic director and just the things that I have
done doing have been really special. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm on
pace to graduate on May 1. So my journey to South Alabama has been special.
It's been special, and I'm really enjoying it.  
  
Q. What about going through some of the lower points in your college career?
Transferring and stuff like that, what did that add or what did that do for
you getting to this point?  
DAON MERRITT: Like Brandon said, it's just a learning experience. I experience
some bumps in the road, but through Christ and just being in the church, the
church going person that I am, I know He can get me through all that and He
has. That's why I'm here today.  
  
Q. When you're back in Queens do you have to explain where you were going,
what you were doing, did they know of this school?  
DAON MERRITT: People that were close to me, I think it was more of the fact
that I came to a university and I'm getting a degree. I think that was the
main thing. The basketball was great, but the overall thing was that I'm
getting a degree. And the people in my inner circle, as I call it, that are
really special and know about Demetric Bennett as a person, they understand
that and they're happy for me and the added success I have through basketball
has, they're extra happy for me.  
  
Q. For anybody who wants it, what are your expectations for the game? Butler
has a reputation being a top team I think this might be one of the best games
in the first round. Would you agree with that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I would agree. Butler, they're a top 10 team. But we figure
that we can compete with anybody. We go out there and like I said earlier, we
string up our shoes just like they string up theirs and I don't think that we
get intimidated by anybody. We played top teams this year, Vanderbilt, Ole
Miss, and no team intimidated us. And so we're going to go out there, we're
going to give it our all and the best team wins.  
DAON MERRITT: I agree, as we, as everybody says, I'm sure we all recall George
Mason going to the Final Four so this time of year anything can happen. We
have great chemistry, we have a great group of kids and we he have a great
coaching staff who instill in us the values so we understand the magnitude of
this game, we think it's a great matchup, but we are here to win. We didn't
come here just to say that we made it to the NCAA tournament. We were very
appreciative of the opportunity the committee gave us but we came here to win
and that's what we have been preparing for all year long.  
  
Q. Talk about the next 24 hours. What's going to go through your minds how
are you going to plan everything out up until tomorrow's game time tomorrow?  
DAON MERRITT: We have an agenda of things we go by. I'm sure our coaching
staff will continue to keep us prepared and keep us focused. We have a team
meeting scheduled for tonight just to make sure we're all on the same page.
And we're very excited about the opportunity, we're looking forward to the
challenge tomorrow and we just really are eager to get out there and play
ourselves.  
  
Q. You've been, you and Daon have both played in a NCAA tournament game what
has been the message to the rest of the team about how to get ready for
tomorrow's game?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: My message is you got to come out ready to play. It's win or
go home. It's playoffs. You can't start the game off slacking, you got to come
out from the start and stay focused. Is everybody every team it's their last
game if they don't win. So you just got to come out and be focused and if you
play hard, good things happen.  
DAON MERRITT: We have been, guys know how important this game is. But I
basically told my teammates since this is my second time here, enjoy the
moment. Because it's not easy, it's not easy to get here. But I just told
them, don't be a deer in the headlights. Grasp the moment and enjoy it, but
you stick around for awhile. It gets better. Try to stick around for awhile.
And I think that's something we want to do. We know Coach Arrow has had
success in the first round previously and we want to do that again. I know I
especially want to do it again because I want to see him jump up and down like
he did the first time around. So I really want to get a win for him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fact that you guys have become like a media
darling nationally, a lot of TV shows and radio shows have made a special
point of saying that they like the fact that you guys not only got in but you
got in with a high seed. Can y'all talk about the national attention you
received?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: It's great. It is always good to see your school name on
television. You can turn on the TV, your friends call you, "Oh, I just seen
you on TV." But right now that doesn't mean nothing if we don't come out and
play tomorrow. All we can focus on is what we got to do in the NCAA tournament
and we did not want to just get here and say we made it to the tournament. We
wanted to get here and support Sun Belt and just let them know that there's
great basketball in the Sun Belt.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the week that when you found out that this was in
Birmingham, you were a little nervous because of the pressure, has that
subsided or are you still looking at this as a pressure game because you got
the home crowd here?  
BRANDON DAVIS: It's not really a pressure game, it's just a lot of nerves
building up towards the game. A lot of people calling you, telling you what
you should do, what you shouldn't do, asking for tickets. People you probably
never heard from in awhile. But like I said we just want to come out and win
and make sure that we advance so we can keep having fun.  
  
Q. Just wondering if any of you have seen the '89 win over Alabama or any
thoughts of what you could take from that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: When we come out before they call the starting lineup they
show the last clip where he hit the three and Arrow ran across the boards. So
we see it every home time. So that's 18 times this year. And you could tell by
the excitement he had on the clip that it was something special. And we just
wanted to experience it ourselves.  
DAON MERRITT: I think it was great. I'm not -- I met Jeff and them guys and
just the things they did here, at this university, we hope that -- we cannot
fill their shoes but just be a pimple as Coach Arrow would say as compared to
them guys. But I think we're special, just the experience with what them guys
experienced and like to see Coach Arrow jump around I think it was great. And
hopefully we don't have, it doesn't come down to a last second shot with us,
but hopefully we can receive that same victory and same emotion as it is.  
BRANDON DAVIS: I feel the same way as my teammates but also coach told thaws
that team came from 19 down at half time to come back and win. And then
eventually losing to Michigan, that gives us hope and let us know that we
should fight every time we step on the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. We'll have Coach Arrow make an opening
statement and then we'll take questions.  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Besides not playing at the Mitchell Center at University of
South Alabama, I can't think of a better place to be playing in the state
three and a half hours away from Mobile. And we're looking forward to not -- I
think this will be the first time that we'll have Alabama and Auburn people
yelling for the Jaguars.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. I asked the players just a second ago, have you been surprised by the
national attention that this team seems to have gotten from all the different
TV shows and talk shows and radio shows and what do you attribute to that?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Well there's only 64 teams, 65 teams left, and you're going
to get more exposure as it goes. When those teams, some of them are eliminated
it's going to be more and more. We thought there was a whole lot of exposure
in '89 when we beat, before we beat Alabama and then afterwards there's even
more. So every win adds more and more to the table.  
We're looking forward to this first game. We're playing against a very good
Butler team, very experienced.  
  
Q. If having the kind of success Butler has, is that a goal for you and if
this game is a good way to sort of steal that recognition from them?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Every time you go out on the court it doesn't matter who
you're playing, you have an opportunity to make a name for yourself.  
No matter who you're playing, but when you get to this level, for years
wherever I've been I've told the people around the program that we want to get
to the Gonzaga situation where they have won and won and won. And now there's
a whole lot of schools out there that we want to be a part of. We want South
Alabama's name to be out there, we want the Sun Belt's recognition. We tried
to instill in our players when we got here exactly who we are representing.
Our program, our university, our community, the Sun Belt, their families,
that's not to put pressure on them, it's just to let them know that we need to
go out there and do our very best.  
  
Q. You had talked about just moments ago about but remember's experience,
can you touch a little bit more about that? Obviously they have five seniors
who have been to the Sweet 16 last year, what concerns you about them?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Last year when I was at Texas A and M Corpus Christi we had
six seniors and we got to the NCAA tournament and I thought we gave Wisconsin
everything that they wanted. Having six seniors with experience you cannot
coach experience. It's there.  
They have five seniors that I think that this might be the best passing team
that I've seen in a number of years. I think that they just know where each
other are. They were a Sweet 16 last year, all of that experience, I mean, you
just can't coach that.  
When you go to practice early in the year you don't have to do as many drills,
you don't have to do them as long. It's great.  
We have two seniors, two seniors against five seniors and supporting casts.
And I think that it's going to be a heck of a game in today's game, it's a
guard's game. You have to have good inside people, but it's a guard's game.
You don't have good guards, you're going to be the most frustrated coach in
the country.  
Today you're going to get to see or tomorrow you're going to get to see two
teams with two very good back courts. And I think that when Daon and Demetric
first, when I first got the job they said, "Y'all had peanut butter and jelly,
we want to be bread and butter." So I said I don't care what you call
yourselves as long as the outcome is the same. At the end of the year we had
beaten Alabama, they were ranked as a top, in the top five best back courts in
the country, and I think that they have a legitimate shot right now as being
classified as one of the best back courts in the country. How far it goes from
there, we'll see.  
  
Q. When you saw your name come up, playing against Butler and you saw the
location, can you talk about that and just the fact that here's a great tune
opportunity for your name program not only to be in the tournament, but also
to be able to play here in your home state.  
HEAD COACH ARROW: When you don't invite yourself by winning your tournament,
and sitting there and watching that your name has to pop up there, there's
always anxiety.  
It's always better to invite yourself. When our name popped up there,
truthfully, I didn't remember anything else, any other teams, didn't really
care about any other teams. South Alabama was up there, we knew who we were
going to play and the next thing that was going through my mind was getting
film on them.  
With the computer today we had film before the night was over with and it was
great. So I think that that's the next thing. As a coach, and then finding out
that you're going to be in your own home state, you can't ask for anything
better than that. Not only I hope that we'll have our good fans that we called
the sixth man, but we'll have the State of Alabama fans.  
  
Q. You said you didn't invite yourself, but if you take away the A 10 and
the Mountain West, only three Mid Majors made this as an at large in the whole
tournament. Would you say that it's probably more difficult for a Mid Major to
make it as an at large since you have to be good for four months instead of
for four days?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: I think what you just said is true. You know, a Mid Major, I
don't know what that, all the BCS schools that aren't BCS or you know whatever
it's classified as a Mid Major school, but the bottom line is, is that the
criteria for what the committee looks for, don't knock any schools that get
into the NCAA tournament. If you're going to knock anything, knock the
criteria. The committee goes by the criteria that is assigned to them.  
There is no doubt in my mind what we did this year over the extended period of
time we deserved to be in the NCAA tournament. I think we're 4-1 against teams
that are in the tournament. We're 3-2 against Top-50 teams. I think we're 5-3
against top 100 teams. We did everything that at the beginning of the year
that our commissioner, and our athletic director, asked us to do as far as
scheduling.  
Now when you schedule, now you got to go win games. And I think that earlier
in the year San Diego, we beat them by 22 points. We beat Western Kentucky,
who was in it, twice this year. So there's no doubt. We beat Mississippi
State, so there's no doubt in my mind that the University of South Alabama
deserves to be in the big dance.  
  
Q. When you prior to the season you told me when you took this job you told
Joe Gottfried that you wanted to get him another leap, that signature leap
that you had after that '89 win, if you pull up the upset tomorrow can we
expect a leap?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Well, I just want to be given the opportunity. It may not be
quite as high. That was a couple years ago, but I just want to be given the
opportunity to. That jump has gone a long way.  
(Laughter.).  
  
Q. How much preparation for a game like this is getting your team ready and
how much of it is matchups with the other team? What's the balance there?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: You don't change anything. This is going to be a tempo game.
They want to keep it in the 60, we would like to keep it in the 70's. They're
a very experienced team. It's going to be, you go to war against a team the
next game, the most important game every year is the next game.  
Butler just happens to be the next game and it just happens to be in the NCAA
tournament.  
So we will prepare for them just like we did everything else. We'll refine
what we have done all year, and we'll go to work and in guarding their stuff
that we have to stop. Which they execute very well.  
  
Q. Two part question. One is just the fact that you're at a school your
second stint at a school does that make the success the first year a little
bit sweeter. The second part is, the way that your tenure, the first tenure
ended did you have any reservations about coming back to South Alabama?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: It doesn't matter where you are and I think I'm speaking for
myself here, wherever I am, I want to win.  
It doesn't matter what the situation has been, going to be, whatever, the
bottom line, this is a very easy occupation, all you have to do is win and win
and win and win. And wherever you are, that's your job. Is to win. When I left
the University of South Alabama I will say this, I resigned. It might have
been under duress, but I resigned. And I, we kept in touch with all the
friends, Joe Gottfried who was athletic director then, I think that I might
have been, I think I can go on record and say there's been a lot of coaches
leave universities and go on to maybe bigger and better jobs and then come
back. I might be the first one that was ever asked to leave and the athletic
director was there and then asked to come back by the same athletic director.  
After he called me it happened very quickly. I thought he was kidding. After I
got off, over that, you know, he said are you interested? I said well, yeah.
He flew to Corpus Christi, and we talked, I accepted, my wife and I got on a
plane. Got back to Mobile at 12 o'clock at night and the next day at 1 o'clock
there was a press conference and I had the job. So there was never a doubt.
Whatever happened, happened. I think things that happened in life make you a
better person. In this case if coaches could take a sabbatical, for a year or
two, which I had two years, I think that they, they find out if they really
want to coach, number one, which I wanted to do, and they find out number two
the rest was good, and you get back, get back on the saddle and go to work.  
I think that there was no doubt I was given the opportunity to start a program
at Texas A & M Corpus Christi, it was sort of like giving birth. I'll always
remember and always appreciate the opportunity of starting that program. And
we went there, and we did good. And was able to go back to what I consider
home away from home. We're from Texas, and Mobile's just home away from home
for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Tyler and Matt can you talk about the 3-point shot and sort of how it
changes things out there on the court for everybody and coming to play in a
system that values the 3-point shot as much as Coach Graham does.  
MATT BAUSCHER: I think the 3-point shot kind of opens up our game because
these two guys are obviously our main offensive attraction so when we hit our
shot, our defender can't leave us which opens it up for them and vice-versa,
them opening it up for us.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: To go along with what Matt says it's a big part of our offense
and I think that it helps everything out. It helps when we make it through
3-pointers, the guys got to shade towards us and then it opens up our drive
and opens up their inside game and it's kind of like a double-end sword, you
got to pick one to defend and it has been a great asset for us this whole
year.  
  
Q. Will this be the most physical team you've played this year? They're
pretty big up front?  
MATT NELSON: I would say probably so, the Big East is known for really as a
physical conference and we played a few physical teams this year, but these
guys, we got to say this is probably going to be the most physical team
because they're the biggest team and it's the style of play in the conference.  
  
Q. Reggie, you guys were picked to finish fifth in the conference, underdogs
in the conference, you won the conference, now you're underdogs again. Is that
the kind of role you many embrace?  
REGGIE LARRY: I won't say I embrace it but, it does make us play stronger. We
were picked to finish fifth and we were underdogs now it seems like when you
get to the tournament like this when on a you're an underdog a lot of people
root for you and that makes you feel a lot better. Besides, when, like in the
season wise we were picked there because that's where we basically would be,
no one's going to go for that so we just had to prove ourselves. But I think
now we got a little bit more people that's after us and wants us to succeed
and things like this. So I think the underdog might be a better thing being
something like this.  
  
Q. For whoever wants to answer, the football program obviously became a
national household name with Oklahoma game there and everything that happened
in that, could you guys talk about just your opportunity to maybe put the
basketball program on the map in the tournament this year.  
MATT BAUSCHER: The football team obviously year in and year out they're a
national powerhouse, not to say we're jealous of them, but when the whole town
talks about football 24/7 and it's spring ball, you hold a little bit of a
grudge. But the whole town is behind us after this win all we hear is three
overtimes on the billboards at the sports bars and all that. Everybody is
behind us now and the town of Boise bleeds blue and orange. They have been
behind us so hopefully we'll let this ride out.  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: Yeah, when I first got here, it was known as a football
school, and last three years have been tough just because we have been
overshadowed by them and it's been nice to get some press and finally prove
ourselves and show that the basketball team has the ability to make a big game
win and get to a national stage like this.  
  
Q. Could you guys explain, you guys were so great on the road all year, you
really distinguished yourselves at the beginning of the season and then there
was that last game. What makes you guys such a good team on the road?  
MATT NELSON: I think a big part is that we're a senior-led team and we have
been through a lot so we're used to playing on the road and the travel and all
that. And it really doesn't phase us as much as most teams. So I think that it
goes back to the fact that we're playing as a team and the rest of the guys
kind of follow our lead as seniors, and that's a big part of it.  
  
Q. If you guys can talk about playing the late game tomorrow. How tough is
it going to be watching all day and would you rather be playing early? Does it
matter what time you play?  
MATT BAUSCHER: No, it matters what time we play. When we were in Albany we
were in the East Coast Time Zone now we're in the -- I don't know even know
what it's called. We played in the Mountain, played on the west coast, played
Hawaii time. I mean --  
REGGIE LARRY: Central time.  
MATT BAUSCHER: Central time, there you go. But it doesn't matter. We'll be up
for the NCAA tournament, you can count on that.  
(Laughter.)  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: I think it helps a little bit especially today and Friday --
with the family back home, they get off work and get to watch it since none of
them really get to travel out here and I think that's a big part. It will be
nice to have a support group back home at Boise, Idaho and back for me on the
west coast that the 8:40 game helps out a lot.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Louisville, what do you have to stop to be
able to beat them and get a win tomorrow night?  
MATT NELSON: For us to compete with them tomorrow we're going to have to
handle the pressure, they get out and press you from baseline to baseline all
game. And they get a lot of easy buckets that way just from our turnovers, so
we need to take care of the basketball and I think we need to match their
physical play which is they're a big tough physical team and we're going to
have to scrap a little bit because we're undersized.  
But we faced a lot of physical teams and big teams this year and we have done
all right. So we need to go out there and do what we have been doing all year.  
  
Q. Tyler, I watched a couple of practices out here from teams, some teams
really loose, some teams business like. Running layup lines and things like
that. How are you guys approaching the NCAA tournament?  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: I think that we definitely are a loose team. We approach it
with a business attitude, but a loose atmosphere. And everyone knows what we
have to do, we're a senior-led team so I think that helps a lot when you're
loose and just ready to play. We have really nothing to lose as a team. We're
expected to lose in this game and we'll go out there ready to play but with a
loose attitude.  
  
Q. Reggie, do you feel that since you had such a big WAC Conference
Tournament that there's a target on your back coming into the NCAA? Do you
think that you're not surprising anybody any more?  
REGGIE LARRY: I mean, I don't know what they're strategy is, but like I said
all year, yeah, I had a great little tournament last week, but I'm not the
focus, I'm not the focus on this team. It's, everyone does their job from our
five starters to even our bench players. If you, as we have been told this
year, stopping one player, it wasn't just us to lose games, so if we did lose
games it wasn't because they stopped one main player, there's so many people
on this team that can go off any given night. So if you stop one person the
other person is just going to do something, so.  
  
Q. For Tyler, how much has Coach Graham talked about getting off to a quick
start tomorrow and have you guys put any game plan in to do that?  
TYLER TIEDEMAN: I think that's a key to every game. Getting off to a quick
start. But especially here. Because I'm sure they're going to thrive off
getting off early and trying to knock us down and try to keep us out of the
game. But I think it will be a huge part of it for us just to get out and get
the probably the nerves out too, getting off a quick start we'll make a few
buckets and that will relax us. I think it will be a big part of our start or
the start of the game.  
  
Q. Guys, since the school hasn't been here for 14 years would you say that
you're more hungry than some of the schools who are here routinely year after
year?  
MATT BAUSCHER: Growing up playing college basketball you always, your ultimate
goal is always to get to the NCAA tournament. And year after year when you
don't make it you kind of get bitter when you look at that bracket and are not
in it. So I think we're definitely not complacent, we are here and we want to
make the most out of it.  
MATT NELSON: I wouldn't say we were more hungry than any other team, I think
everyone is going to be hungry because making the NCAA tournament is what it's
all about. I think that maybe some of the bigger schools that's been here year
in year out might overlook their first round game, occasionally. And we're
obviously not going to overlook our first round game. But that's maybe a
little difference there. But everyone is hungry, everyone is going to go out
there and play as hard as they can because this is the biggest stage on the
world for college basketball. So I doubt anyone's going to go easy on anybody.  
REGGIE LARRY: I was just going to say that we're all college basketball
players and this is a dream for everyone to go through. This is a once in a
lifetime opportunity. And I think it's everyone's goal in the beginning of the
season when you prepare, and go through all the training to get ready for your
season, and hopefully you have a goal to making it into this tournament.  
We're all here and we're seniors and that's what we all worked hard for to get
done, and we are here now so there's no reason to just let-up now just because
we are here and all the athletes are on us. We're going to come out here ready
to play basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, guys. We'll have an opening statement from
Coach Graham and then take questions.  
COACH GRAHAM: Well it wasn't as far to get here as everybody said it was going
to be. It was kind of a short trip to us, compared to how we're used to
traveling. But we're honored to be here, glad to be in the tournament and
we're looking forward to it. Our guys did a heck of a job last weekend, won
three big ones in a row to earn the right to be here. And I know they're
excited and looking forward to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Your players said that they're anxious for their moment in the sun, they
have kind of seen the football program with the game over Oklahoma and that
put that program on the map. And talk about the opportunity that you have
tomorrow night and this whole tournament to make a statement with regards to
Boise State basketball.  
COACH GRAHAM: Well, I think we made a good statement last weekend to start
with. It was the first time we won the WAC championship and we did it the hard
way. We were the fourth seed so we had to play five, and had to play the
favorites and, then had to play the home team. And it was a great weekend for
us.  
Now, I know they're looking forward to taking the next step, which is the
tournament. And, as you said, our football team has kind of set apart for the
rest of our programs. And Boise State's done very well. We just won two back-
to-back women's titles our track team, and tennis teams have won titles, and
it's good for us to step into that with the rest of them. And I know our guys
are looking forward to playing. And being on the stage and Nellie's kind of
talked to them a little bit because he's the only one that's been to the
tournament before and what it was going to be like, and we talked about it
earlier in the year, and now we are here. I always felt like I should have
shown the Hoosier tape a little bit. But they're all excited and looking
forward to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. This kind of situation for you guys being a sort of a long shot, so to
speak, how do you talk to your players about this opportunity? Most of the
favorites won today this afternoon, and if I'm not mistaken only a couple of
14 seeds have won since 1999 in the tournament. So what do you tell your kids
about the so-called David and Goliath kind of thing?  
COACH GRAHAM: We breath too much. We just stay away from it kind of. And just
talk about what we need to do to win like we have all year and our game plan
and what we're going to do to stop them, and things that coach is going to try
to do to us, and handle it more from that point versus David and Goliath and
all those other things. We have had a good season and there's no reason to
sell ourselves short. So we just try to stay with our normal routine as far as
travel, practice, scouting reports, the whole thing. And going to attack it
just as a normal game, because I think there's enough outside stuff to get
them ready for all the other things.  
  
Q. What does Louisville present matchup wise with their physicality in the
post?  
COACH GRAHAM: A lot of big headaches. Very good team. When they go big they're
six-nine, six-nine, six-eleven across the front, which in our conference we
have had some teams that could put two six-eleven guys in there but to get
that third guy in there makes a big difference. That's one of the things that
we talked about that we have to try to neutralize and at least try and
neutralize the paint area, so we don't get beat up on the boards too bad or on
second shots. And we had the same matchup on Saturday with New Mexico State
who is very big in our conference and we ended up tied 52 a piece on the glass
and we need to have the same type of effort tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When you were setting out goals for your team this year, goals obviously
things like want to win the conference, win the conference tournament, make it
to the NCAA, did it open end there or was your goal to win some games in the
NCAA?  
COACH GRAHAM: Our original goal, if you want to say, is I think every year it
stays pretty much the same, you want to win the conference and you want to
play in the post season. And just kind of leave it at that.  
We didn't say we want to win two games, three games, how deep you want to go.
Our goal was to get here, we haven't been here in 14 years, had never won a
WAC title before. So take a little bit at a time and now we are here and we
have accomplished that, now anything else we'll just keep going and it will be
icing on the cake.  
  
Q. A lot of Louisville's offense goes through David Padgett as the center,
people tried to double him, how do you defend a guy like that who passes so
well?  
COACH GRAHAM: I don't know if I have a great answer for that one. Because he's
awfully good and he really makes them go. I was watching the Notre Dame game
again last night and he played 13 minutes in the first half and they had 40
points and he sat out seven and they had two. And he creates a lot of
problems.  
He's, him and Kevin Love I think does the same thing for UCLA, they're two big
guys that pass the ball so well that create a lot of problems and we're going
to have to try to do some different things with them as far as guarding him
and what he tries to do, because he's one of those guys that he may have some
deficiencies or whatever for the next level, but he's a guy that makes his
teammates better. And those are the kind of guys that you look for.  
  
Q. I know a lot of people talk about the size as a disadvantage for you
guys, can you address that as a way that you can make that into an advantage
for you?  
COACH GRAHAM: Well, the one thing, you seen us play, we like to get up-and-
down the floor. And so we're going to run the floor and they're going to try
to slow us and hopefully our big guys can get up and out run some of them and
get some he easy baskets for us which has helped us in the past.  
And they're going to have to chase our little big guys. And so we'll have to
see how that shakes out.  
  
Q. Reggie Larry, talk about him and not just this year but also what he's
meant to the program in terms of building this thing from where it was.  
COACH GRAHAM: Reggie's been -- he's MVP of the tournament last weekend. He's,
he became the all time leading scorer in the season for us and he was only
there two years and this year he set the record. He was I think two rebounds
short of averaging a double double in the conference. And he is just very,
very explosive. He's not, you wouldn't think of him as a great jumper or
runner, until all of a sudden he turns it on. And he's one of those big strong
kids that is very explosive, can go get things done. And he's very
competitive, he turned it on in the championship game went for 31 and 16
against a much bigger team where he knew we had to battle them. And then the
surprising thing this year where his game probably picked up the most he ended
up shooting about 44 percent from the 3-point line so he added that to his
game this summer with a lot of work.  
So it really opens things up for us and so we can spread the floor a little
bit more. If there's something needs to be done he can pretty much do it if he
puts his mind to it. But he's been a good one as you said not just for us but
for our program and to get us here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your offensive philosophy and sort of how that
developed as far as shooting the three and finding guys who maybe are more
skilled than they are athletic.  
COACH GRAHAM: I don't want to say by accident, but I was an assistant with
Coach Kent from Oregon down at St. Mary's and we were playing and we kept
playing 58-56 and 64-62. And I got to give him the credit, we sat down and
talked and I said, I would like to change, but it's easy for assistants to
make suggestions. And I don't know if I could change my whole philosophy as a
head coach right now, if you come up and said, we want to do this, and, okay,
we're going to throw out what we do.  
And he said, okay, fine, let's do it. He said, let's figure this out and go.
We were fortunate at the time, the Warriors worked out at our place. Coach
Nelson was there and Coach Popovich was his assistant and they had Hardaway
and Mullen and Spree, and they would come over and work with our guys, play
with them. And we talked to Nellie and them. And so it kind of, we just kind
of got bored of playing the other way. And we changed. And like said, I give
Ernie a ton of credit, because I don't know if I could just change my
philosophy in midstream. And he did and we developed what we call the speed
game. And how we play and if you watch Oregon play you see some similarities
with the, between the two of us and I brought it over here to our place kind
of. And that's how we both play. And he's made some adjustments and we adjust
ours to our personnel, but basically it's the same setup.  
And so I, it really wasn't by accident but, again I said I don't know if I
could just say, okay, we're going to change everything we do and have at it.
But we did and it would, we won the tournament that year and, at St. Mary's,
and played Wake Forest. And then we went to Oregon and did well. And I've been
able to come over here and so it's served us well.  
  
Q. Is there any advantage to be gained from the fact that you played New
Mexico State three times? Did they do things similar to what Louisville does,
coach having been there for two years as an assistant?  
COACH GRAHAM: I think they do some things similar. You know, not a lot. He was
there two years, I -- I felt Reggie did a lot more things than they did
before. And, but they, they press and they play the 2-3 zone and some of those
type of things and have some big athletes. Seven-one, six-eleven in the middle
and six-nine on the power forward spot. So some similarities there.  
And so the preparation, we had already covered some of the things before, so
it was more of a review. But I think Louisville's a little different level and
so now we need to do a little bit better doing some things. And they played
them earlier in the year, didn't play them too badly, New Mexico State did,
and I think the two guys were out from Louisville though, Padgett and Palacios
weren't there, so that makes a big difference coming back this time.  
  
Q. Rick has been coming to the tournament now for 25 years, I wonder --  
COACH GRAHAM: I have been coming for 25 years, just haven't been in it all the
time, but I've been coming to it.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. I wonder if there's anything significance to the matchup coaching against
him, that sort of thing.  
COACH GRAHAM: Well, you know, probably the thing I admire about coach is, as
much as his record and how well he's done, I really look at people who, I
don't know if I want to say -- I'm trying to think of the right word. I had it
earlier. Invent? Not necessarily invent things, but bring new things to the
game. And I think he's done that. He brought the three to the game early when
he was at Providence and then at Kentucky he started with all the pressing and
different things. And guys who -- innovators, that was the word I was looking
for, he's an innovator. And I really admire guys that do that, because I sit
and probably think of basketball as much as anybody and I am probably a thief
more than I'm an innovator, borrowing ideas from everybody else and trying to
put them together what works for us. But guys that are innovative, that come
up with things, good or bad, I really looked up to, because it's tough to
invent things or change things. And guys who can do that, like I said good or
bad you got to look at it and see where it's at and take what you like from it
and leave the rest there.  
But coach has been like that forever. And for me to play against him, we
played one time before, I was an assistant at Oregon and we got a chance to
play them out in Portland in the Portland Jam. And so that was my first
experience with them, but it's an honor to play against him. And like I said,
even though he's got a great track record and lots of wins and championships,
probably the thing I admire most about him is he's an innovator and he has
helped the game of basketball progress.  
  
Q. Can you just tell me about the popularity of Boise State basketball, has
it risen over this last week or are people coming out of the woodwork now
wearing Broncos gear and things like that back home?  
COACH GRAHAM: Well the big question is are we going to get a blue or orange
court to match our football field. But no, it's hit the town big. And
unfortunately, our tournament was so far away and this is so far away that a
lot of people couldn't come on such short notice. But our school's done very
well in our conference, we won a lot of titles here the last few years, and
now we moved into the picture, and we're probably not any different than it is
in Louisville with the blue and orange being there. And it's nice to finally
throw the basketball hat into the ring, where we have had so much football,
some other sports, that we're in there now -- and I had a great comment the
other day by one of our local media guys, is it nice to have them still
talking about basketball and not spring football at this point. So that was
kind of a nice thing to hear.  
  
Q. Coach Pitino said you all compare favorably to BYU, almost exactly. How
would you compare your team to BYU and what do you do differently?  
COACH GRAHAM: We are very similar, we played them earlier, they're a little
bigger in the post than we are. But, no, we play similar. Coach runs a wide-
open system and they push it up-and-down the floor and shoot lots of
3-pointers and have a big guy to throw it to inside. And we play similar. We
may play a little more zone than they do, but basically the systems, the
style's the same, now what we run is different. We both push it, but at the
end of his break he runs one thing, we run something else. But for the most
part the two programs are probably very similar and that's a real good
comparison.  
  
Q. For you to put your team in a position to win tomorrow what are some of
the things and the keys to the game that you guys are going to have to do
successfully?  
COACH GRAHAM: I think that tomorrow there's three keys to the game. One is we
need to handle the pressure; two, we need to neutralize them in the paint with
their size; and the third thing, the way we play, we need to hit shots. And
that's big for us the way we play. And those would be our things we talk about
with our players that we need to handle and take care of. And that will be the
key tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the South Alabama players.  
  
Q. For all three. First trip for you Daon and Brandon to the NCAA's.
Demetric, it is your second trip. What are your thoughts coming to the NCAA?  
DAON MERRITT: Like I said, it is my first trip with the University of South
Alabama, of course, and I think when you're invited to the NCAA's, it's a
special privilege. It just speaks volumes of the things that you've done all
year. From preseason to your non-conference to your conference schedule and
now to be playing in the post season is a special honor.  
BRANDON DAVIS: Being this is my first opportunity to play in the tournament, I
think it's a blessing for me to be able to come home and play in front of my
home crowd. It will be big and we have an opportunity to win, too.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: For me being my second time coming with the University of
South Alabama, it is my senior year so it's going to be special. This year we
didn't win the Sun Belt so it just goes to show that we had a special year
this year. The committee invited us here and we're excited to be here and we
just got to come in here and play hard.  
  
Q. Do you guys want what Butler has, that mid major credibility, is that
something you guys are working towards?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think that's something that every Mid Major would want
would be top 10, top 15 in the country, they work hard, they earned their
credibility, and that's something we're trying to do now with the University
of South Alabama. South Alabama  
  
Q. What have been your impressions of Butler's two guards, Mike Green and
A.J. Graves?  
DAON MERRITT: We're familiar with them and we know that their guards are two
terrific guards, they're two seniors like we have two great guards and they're
both seniors. They have accolades and we have accolades. We're not really
concerned with the things on paper, we know we both have to go, our back court
has to go out and compete against their back court and which everyone is
victorious, I mean I think that speaks for itself.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: They got two good guards and we think we do too. So we just
go out there and compete. All of us have to go out there and put our shoes on.
So we just have to go out there and play.  
  
Q. Kind of change the subject a little bit, doing something on Ron Arrow, on
your coach, just did you know anything about him when he started and what do
you think has been the key to his success this year?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: For me, personally, I really didn't know too much of Coach
Arrow until he got here. He came in, he was a very demanding coach, and he
knows what he wants. And he's not going to settle for anything less.  
  
Q. Does it seem odd to you to have a coach come back to a school where he
was fired ten years earlier, did you know about that? How quickly did you
learn about that and does that seem odd to you or?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: To me, once I heard his name in the interview process that's
when everything came out as far as him getting fired and coming back. And it
didn't really seem odd to me because he went to Corpus Christi and he was
successful there. Every program wants a successful coach. And he came here and
we have been successful this year, too.  
  
Q. How close to you feel like you are to attaining that every year Mid Major
success?  
DAON MERRITT: I think we're establishing our own identity. We're not trying to
be like none of the other Mid Majors and we really don't consider ourselves a
Mid Major. We have been in the post season for the last three years and I
think with the group of guys we have coming back next year that's something
that we will continue to have that same kind of success. We have a great
coach, great student-athletes and we're playing for a great university. And to
bring notoriety to your university is something that we want to continue
doing. So that we can compete against the best schools.  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: Basically the same thing, we want our school to continue
success. And in order to do that you got to have a good coaching staff and
good players. And our roster only has two seniors and we have a lot of talent
on that team and some of it is not getting to play as much right now, but next
year I think they're going to fulfill the role and comeback next year and
continue this success.  
BRANDON DAVIS: They summed it up.  
  
Q. Can you touch on the fact that you guys -- it looks like you're probably
going to have the crowd behind you, the fact you're playing here in
Birmingham, you're only about four hours away. Can you talk about that, and
just, I guess the kind of edge it may give y'all the confidence it may give
y'all coming into the game tomorrow and just like how excited you are about
that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I think it gives us a lot of confidence. Once we heard our
name called out on the committee inviting us in to the tournament that gave us
a lot of confidence right there that people believed in us. And coming into
the state of Alabama and we're the only team in the state of Alabama that's
basically in the NCAA tournament. So, I think that is going to be a lot of
confidence for us in the fans to come out and support us.  
DAON MERRITT: Just elaborate, we're 17-1 at home. Our crowd has been great for
us. We considered them our sixth man. So we always felt we had their support
and we're very confident when they come and support us. And that's what you
want from a university. And we think we deserve it.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate a little bit, have you had a chance to think about the
strange trip that you've had from Jacksonville to Birmingham Southern and to
this great season you had at South Alabama?  
BRANDON DAVIS: I feel like it's been a journey really for me it's been a
learning experience also. Being able to play at different schools on different
styles, it really helps me. So I feel like this is a good fit for me and here
I am. This is where I am, here, in Birmingham. Playing for the NCAA.  
  
Q. When you left St. Rays years ago, this isn't where you expected to end
up. Can you talk about that journey and what it's like to end up here playing
for this school and in the NCAA tournament?  
DAON MERRITT: I think it's great. I think the things I've done at the South
Alabama have been special. I'm happy to be here, I developed some great
relationships, of course, I got engaged a few weeks ago so my journey and in
Mobile has been great. It's been great. I have great teammates, I play for a
great coach, I have a great athletic director and just the things that I have
done doing have been really special. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm on
pace to graduate on May 1. So my journey to South Alabama has been special.
It's been special, and I'm really enjoying it.  
  
Q. What about going through some of the lower points in your college career?
Transferring and stuff like that, what did that add or what did that do for
you getting to this point?  
DAON MERRITT: Like Brandon said, it's just a learning experience. I experience
some bumps in the road, but through Christ and just being in the church, the
church going person that I am, I know He can get me through all that and He
has. That's why I'm here today.  
  
Q. When you're back in Queens do you have to explain where you were going,
what you were doing, did they know of this school?  
DAON MERRITT: People that were close to me, I think it was more of the fact
that I came to a university and I'm getting a degree. I think that was the
main thing. The basketball was great, but the overall thing was that I'm
getting a degree. And the people in my inner circle, as I call it, that are
really special and know about Demetric Bennett as a person, they understand
that and they're happy for me and the added success I have through basketball
has, they're extra happy for me.  
  
Q. For anybody who wants it, what are your expectations for the game? Butler
has a reputation being a top team I think this might be one of the best games
in the first round. Would you agree with that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: I would agree. Butler, they're a top 10 team. But we figure
that we can compete with anybody. We go out there and like I said earlier, we
string up our shoes just like they string up theirs and I don't think that we
get intimidated by anybody. We played top teams this year, Vanderbilt, Ole
Miss, and no team intimidated us. And so we're going to go out there, we're
going to give it our all and the best team wins.  
DAON MERRITT: I agree, as we, as everybody says, I'm sure we all recall George
Mason going to the Final Four so this time of year anything can happen. We
have great chemistry, we have a great group of kids and we he have a great
coaching staff who instill in us the values so we understand the magnitude of
this game, we think it's a great matchup, but we are here to win. We didn't
come here just to say that we made it to the NCAA tournament. We were very
appreciative of the opportunity the committee gave us but we came here to win
and that's what we have been preparing for all year long.  
  
Q. Talk about the next 24 hours. What's going to go through your minds how
are you going to plan everything out up until tomorrow's game time tomorrow?  
DAON MERRITT: We have an agenda of things we go by. I'm sure our coaching
staff will continue to keep us prepared and keep us focused. We have a team
meeting scheduled for tonight just to make sure we're all on the same page.
And we're very excited about the opportunity, we're looking forward to the
challenge tomorrow and we just really are eager to get out there and play
ourselves.  
  
Q. You've been, you and Daon have both played in a NCAA tournament game what
has been the message to the rest of the team about how to get ready for
tomorrow's game?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: My message is you got to come out ready to play. It's win or
go home. It's playoffs. You can't start the game off slacking, you got to come
out from the start and stay focused. Is everybody every team it's their last
game if they don't win. So you just got to come out and be focused and if you
play hard, good things happen.  
DAON MERRITT: We have been, guys know how important this game is. But I
basically told my teammates since this is my second time here, enjoy the
moment. Because it's not easy, it's not easy to get here. But I just told
them, don't be a deer in the headlights. Grasp the moment and enjoy it, but
you stick around for awhile. It gets better. Try to stick around for awhile.
And I think that's something we want to do. We know Coach Arrow has had
success in the first round previously and we want to do that again. I know I
especially want to do it again because I want to see him jump up and down like
he did the first time around. So I really want to get a win for him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fact that you guys have become like a media
darling nationally, a lot of TV shows and radio shows have made a special
point of saying that they like the fact that you guys not only got in but you
got in with a high seed. Can y'all talk about the national attention you
received?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: It's great. It is always good to see your school name on
television. You can turn on the TV, your friends call you, "Oh, I just seen
you on TV." But right now that doesn't mean nothing if we don't come out and
play tomorrow. All we can focus on is what we got to do in the NCAA tournament
and we did not want to just get here and say we made it to the tournament. We
wanted to get here and support Sun Belt and just let them know that there's
great basketball in the Sun Belt.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the week that when you found out that this was in
Birmingham, you were a little nervous because of the pressure, has that
subsided or are you still looking at this as a pressure game because you got
the home crowd here?  
BRANDON DAVIS: It's not really a pressure game, it's just a lot of nerves
building up towards the game. A lot of people calling you, telling you what
you should do, what you shouldn't do, asking for tickets. People you probably
never heard from in awhile. But like I said we just want to come out and win
and make sure that we advance so we can keep having fun.  
  
Q. Just wondering if any of you have seen the '89 win over Alabama or any
thoughts of what you could take from that?  
DEMETRIC BENNETT: When we come out before they call the starting lineup they
show the last clip where he hit the three and Arrow ran across the boards. So
we see it every home time. So that's 18 times this year. And you could tell by
the excitement he had on the clip that it was something special. And we just
wanted to experience it ourselves.  
DAON MERRITT: I think it was great. I'm not -- I met Jeff and them guys and
just the things they did here, at this university, we hope that -- we cannot
fill their shoes but just be a pimple as Coach Arrow would say as compared to
them guys. But I think we're special, just the experience with what them guys
experienced and like to see Coach Arrow jump around I think it was great. And
hopefully we don't have, it doesn't come down to a last second shot with us,
but hopefully we can receive that same victory and same emotion as it is.  
BRANDON DAVIS: I feel the same way as my teammates but also coach told thaws
that team came from 19 down at half time to come back and win. And then
eventually losing to Michigan, that gives us hope and let us know that we
should fight every time we step on the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. We'll have Coach Arrow make an opening
statement and then we'll take questions.  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Besides not playing at the Mitchell Center at University of
South Alabama, I can't think of a better place to be playing in the state
three and a half hours away from Mobile. And we're looking forward to not -- I
think this will be the first time that we'll have Alabama and Auburn people
yelling for the Jaguars.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. I asked the players just a second ago, have you been surprised by the
national attention that this team seems to have gotten from all the different
TV shows and talk shows and radio shows and what do you attribute to that?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Well there's only 64 teams, 65 teams left, and you're going
to get more exposure as it goes. When those teams, some of them are eliminated
it's going to be more and more. We thought there was a whole lot of exposure
in '89 when we beat, before we beat Alabama and then afterwards there's even
more. So every win adds more and more to the table.  
We're looking forward to this first game. We're playing against a very good
Butler team, very experienced.  
  
Q. If having the kind of success Butler has, is that a goal for you and if
this game is a good way to sort of steal that recognition from them?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Every time you go out on the court it doesn't matter who
you're playing, you have an opportunity to make a name for yourself.  
No matter who you're playing, but when you get to this level, for years
wherever I've been I've told the people around the program that we want to get
to the Gonzaga situation where they have won and won and won. And now there's
a whole lot of schools out there that we want to be a part of. We want South
Alabama's name to be out there, we want the Sun Belt's recognition. We tried
to instill in our players when we got here exactly who we are representing.
Our program, our university, our community, the Sun Belt, their families,
that's not to put pressure on them, it's just to let them know that we need to
go out there and do our very best.  
  
Q. You had talked about just moments ago about but remember's experience,
can you touch a little bit more about that? Obviously they have five seniors
who have been to the Sweet 16 last year, what concerns you about them?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Last year when I was at Texas A and M Corpus Christi we had
six seniors and we got to the NCAA tournament and I thought we gave Wisconsin
everything that they wanted. Having six seniors with experience you cannot
coach experience. It's there.  
They have five seniors that I think that this might be the best passing team
that I've seen in a number of years. I think that they just know where each
other are. They were a Sweet 16 last year, all of that experience, I mean, you
just can't coach that.  
When you go to practice early in the year you don't have to do as many drills,
you don't have to do them as long. It's great.  
We have two seniors, two seniors against five seniors and supporting casts.
And I think that it's going to be a heck of a game in today's game, it's a
guard's game. You have to have good inside people, but it's a guard's game.
You don't have good guards, you're going to be the most frustrated coach in
the country.  
Today you're going to get to see or tomorrow you're going to get to see two
teams with two very good back courts. And I think that when Daon and Demetric
first, when I first got the job they said, "Y'all had peanut butter and jelly,
we want to be bread and butter." So I said I don't care what you call
yourselves as long as the outcome is the same. At the end of the year we had
beaten Alabama, they were ranked as a top, in the top five best back courts in
the country, and I think that they have a legitimate shot right now as being
classified as one of the best back courts in the country. How far it goes from
there, we'll see.  
  
Q. When you saw your name come up, playing against Butler and you saw the
location, can you talk about that and just the fact that here's a great tune
opportunity for your name program not only to be in the tournament, but also
to be able to play here in your home state.  
HEAD COACH ARROW: When you don't invite yourself by winning your tournament,
and sitting there and watching that your name has to pop up there, there's
always anxiety.  
It's always better to invite yourself. When our name popped up there,
truthfully, I didn't remember anything else, any other teams, didn't really
care about any other teams. South Alabama was up there, we knew who we were
going to play and the next thing that was going through my mind was getting
film on them.  
With the computer today we had film before the night was over with and it was
great. So I think that that's the next thing. As a coach, and then finding out
that you're going to be in your own home state, you can't ask for anything
better than that. Not only I hope that we'll have our good fans that we called
the sixth man, but we'll have the State of Alabama fans.  
  
Q. You said you didn't invite yourself, but if you take away the A 10 and
the Mountain West, only three Mid Majors made this as an at large in the whole
tournament. Would you say that it's probably more difficult for a Mid Major to
make it as an at large since you have to be good for four months instead of
for four days?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: I think what you just said is true. You know, a Mid Major, I
don't know what that, all the BCS schools that aren't BCS or you know whatever
it's classified as a Mid Major school, but the bottom line is, is that the
criteria for what the committee looks for, don't knock any schools that get
into the NCAA tournament. If you're going to knock anything, knock the
criteria. The committee goes by the criteria that is assigned to them.  
There is no doubt in my mind what we did this year over the extended period of
time we deserved to be in the NCAA tournament. I think we're 4-1 against teams
that are in the tournament. We're 3-2 against Top-50 teams. I think we're 5-3
against top 100 teams. We did everything that at the beginning of the year
that our commissioner, and our athletic director, asked us to do as far as
scheduling.  
Now when you schedule, now you got to go win games. And I think that earlier
in the year San Diego, we beat them by 22 points. We beat Western Kentucky,
who was in it, twice this year. So there's no doubt. We beat Mississippi
State, so there's no doubt in my mind that the University of South Alabama
deserves to be in the big dance.  
  
Q. When you prior to the season you told me when you took this job you told
Joe Gottfried that you wanted to get him another leap, that signature leap
that you had after that '89 win, if you pull up the upset tomorrow can we
expect a leap?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: Well, I just want to be given the opportunity. It may not be
quite as high. That was a couple years ago, but I just want to be given the
opportunity to. That jump has gone a long way.  
(Laughter.).  
  
Q. How much preparation for a game like this is getting your team ready and
how much of it is matchups with the other team? What's the balance there?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: You don't change anything. This is going to be a tempo game.
They want to keep it in the 60, we would like to keep it in the 70's. They're
a very experienced team. It's going to be, you go to war against a team the
next game, the most important game every year is the next game.  
Butler just happens to be the next game and it just happens to be in the NCAA
tournament.  
So we will prepare for them just like we did everything else. We'll refine
what we have done all year, and we'll go to work and in guarding their stuff
that we have to stop. Which they execute very well.  
  
Q. Two part question. One is just the fact that you're at a school your
second stint at a school does that make the success the first year a little
bit sweeter. The second part is, the way that your tenure, the first tenure
ended did you have any reservations about coming back to South Alabama?  
HEAD COACH ARROW: It doesn't matter where you are and I think I'm speaking for
myself here, wherever I am, I want to win.  
It doesn't matter what the situation has been, going to be, whatever, the
bottom line, this is a very easy occupation, all you have to do is win and win
and win and win. And wherever you are, that's your job. Is to win. When I left
the University of South Alabama I will say this, I resigned. It might have
been under duress, but I resigned. And I, we kept in touch with all the
friends, Joe Gottfried who was athletic director then, I think that I might
have been, I think I can go on record and say there's been a lot of coaches
leave universities and go on to maybe bigger and better jobs and then come
back. I might be the first one that was ever asked to leave and the athletic
director was there and then asked to come back by the same athletic director.  
After he called me it happened very quickly. I thought he was kidding. After I
got off, over that, you know, he said are you interested? I said well, yeah.
He flew to Corpus Christi, and we talked, I accepted, my wife and I got on a
plane. Got back to Mobile at 12 o'clock at night and the next day at 1 o'clock
there was a press conference and I had the job. So there was never a doubt.
Whatever happened, happened. I think things that happened in life make you a
better person. In this case if coaches could take a sabbatical, for a year or
two, which I had two years, I think that they, they find out if they really
want to coach, number one, which I wanted to do, and they find out number two
the rest was good, and you get back, get back on the saddle and go to work.  
I think that there was no doubt I was given the opportunity to start a program
at Texas A & M Corpus Christi, it was sort of like giving birth. I'll always
remember and always appreciate the opportunity of starting that program. And
we went there, and we did good. And was able to go back to what I consider
home away from home. We're from Texas, and Mobile's just home away from home
for us.  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Michigan State. Coach, if you just want to
begin with some general thoughts on the game.  
COACH IZZO: Well, it was a tough game. I mean, a tough game. It's a very good
Pittsburgh team. I thought we got in a little foul trouble with Raymar. I
thought our bigs battled. These guys just did an unbelievable job of
preparation. Travis with his defense, and Drew shooting the ball, Kalin
directing, and G had a little in there, too.  
The preparation these guys did in two days was as good as any team I've been
with. I'm really proud of them. Yet we beat a very, very good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Drew, could you talk about the difficulty of getting your shot off with
the way Pittsburgh was playing tonight.  
DREW NEITZEL: They're a great defensive team. We knew that coming in. Two
great defensive teams out there battling. I just wanted to stay patient. I got
some open looks in the first half and knocked them down. Coming out the second
half, they really tightened up on me, really contested my shots. Didn't get a
lot of good looks until, you know, the end there where I hit a few in a row.  
But you got to give them credit. They were trailing me hard. They did a great
job.  
  
Q. You held Pittsburgh without a field goal for 9 minutes and 39 seconds.
Talk about what kind of went on with that.  
TRAVIS WALTON: Our coaches do a great job of preparing us for every team. We
had a great scouting report, two-day preparation we had and our team did a
great job, you know, sacking in on the gas. They couldn't drive on us. Our
bigs did an unbelievable drive of changing our pick-and-roll defense, as far
as feathering instead of stepping up how we usually do. Just an unbelievable
job from the coaches and from the team, our team effort.  
  
Q. Goran, in the second half when you got that 10-point lead, looked like
you stepped it up a bit. Talk about what your mindset was there. Yesterday
your coach wondered about his own team's toughness. Talk about whether you had
any question about it.  
GORAN SUTON: We knew that Pittsburgh was a great offensive rebounding team. At
the same time they had a mismatch on me with Sam Young. On the other side, I
had a mismatch on the offensive end, too. I took advantage of it. I think the
guys did a great job of finding me down low, feeding me. I just did a good job
of executing.  
  
Q. Drew, I guess earlier this year you've had the rap of being a little
tentative with your jumper. Talk about letting it fly late in the game.  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, I just wanted to be aggressive. That's what this team
needs from me. Coach has been preaching that. My teammates have been telling
me that. They've been giving me the confidence to keep shooting whether
they're falling or not falling, just to stay aggressive.  
This is it. This is my last run. So I don't want to have any regrets. I just
want to go out there and be aggressive and play the game the way I have my
whole life. And that's aggressive, take shots. When shots aren't falling, my
teammates, they have my back and continue to encourage me to keep shooting.  
  
Q. Kalin, how important was it for you to get your shot going? Talk about
the play at the end rushing the length of the court to get that last layup.  
KALIN LUCAS: Yeah, I think in the first half, you know, I think they was
denying Drew a little bit. My teammates were finding me for open shots, I was
curling where I was trying to come off screens. My teammates were finding me.  
As far as the second half, when I went coast-to-coast, my coach just tell me
when I get the ball to push it, so that's what I did. I just pushed the ball
up the floor. I seen an open lane to the basket.  
  
Q. When Drew made those three shots back to back to back at the end of the
game, even though he was slumping, do you still look to him as your leader?  
TRAVIS WALTON: Yeah, you know, Drew is a big-time shot guy. He came through
for us last year. He came through for us this year. No matter if he misses his
shots, he gonna find a way to step up for us, if it's giving the pass to a big
or a guard. Today he stepped up and knocked down shots for us that was big
time.  
A big-time player gonna step up in big-time moments. He's showing that he's a
big-time player and stepped up in a big-time moment for us.  
  
Q. How satisfying is this victory a week after the disappointment of
Wisconsin?  
TRAVIS WALTON: You know, this is a great victory for - Pittsburgh as far as up
talking about how tough they are and how tough we are. We kind of similar. The
question is, could we be as physical as them or who's gonna win that type of
game.  
We did a great job. We won the rebounding game plus 11, that's a credit to our
bigs and guards getting rebounds. Our coaches did a great job of preparing us.
It's satisfying to our team, you know, to get to the Sweet-16. But playing a
game like Pittsburgh in doing a great job that we did in the one-day prep.  
DREW NEITZEL: Like Travis said, there have been questions this year about the
toughness of this team, you know, how physical we can be. I think Pittsburgh
is, you know, one of the most physical teams in the country with their big
guys inside, Fields is a very physical point guard, uses his body very well.
We did a great job of matching their physical play. We stayed aggressive. We
didn't back down. I think that's what we needed.  
Everybody bought into what the coaching staff was telling us in the
preparation. We went out there and executed.  
  
Q. Drew, talk about what was going through your head when you got the ball
by your bench? You had missed about seven out of ten. That's when you kind of
took over.  
DREW NEITZEL: To be honest, I just stepped in and knocked it down. You know,
throughout the year, I've gone through some ups and downs as fas as my
shooting and things like that. You know, I just changed my mindset and have,
you know, just been more aggressive. You know, no matter if I miss five, ten
shots in a row, that's what I got to do is keep shooting.  
My teammates have done a great job of finding me. Naymick made a great pass
right in my shot pocket. It was a step-in shot. That's a pretty consistent
shot for me.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congratulations. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. There was a stretch where Suton hit a jumper, making moves in the pivot.
It works out. Are you comfortable with all that going on?  
COACH IZZO: I really am. You know, I'm very comfortable. I told you, he's got
great offensive skills. We just got to keep him playing at a consistent level.
Because he's got post moves, he can shoot a 15, 16-foot shot. He's a great
passer.  
You know, I'm not going to lie to you. I just need a little more energy, you
know. I'm going to keep searching for it until I get it or he's gone. He's
making progress. Did some good things tonight. I mean, real good things. I was
proud of him tonight because that was the most physical inside team we've
played, no question about it. Very well-coached, too.  
He had to do a helluva job and he did a helluva job.  
  
Q. Yesterday a couple things you said sort of made us wonder if you had
questions about your team's toughness. Did you and how were they answered
tonight?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, yeah, you know, I have. I've been pretty honest with the
media about that. You know, I just -- remember, you're talking to a guy who
coached some guys that were maybe as tough a team as there's been in the last
20 years, if you ask me, as far as physically and mentally tough.  
And, so, I think it's one of the reasons, you know, that we had some upsets
and things like that. We really talked about it a lot last night and yesterday
afternoon and showed film. We showed rebounding films of them. My staff did an
incredible job, you know. I can't tell you how good my staff was. They were
just unbelievable. We got a lot of things done in these 20-minute sessions we
have. I'd have to say that, as they said, we showed you, Coach. I'm going to
love that for tonight and then I'm going to tell them to show me again next
weekend.  
  
Q. You said one of the areas of improvement you needed was from your bigs.
Did you think you got that tonight?  
COACH IZZO: I did. I thought D even did a good job. Naymeck did a great job.
He's had two good games in a row. I said before the game, I said yesterday to
the media, you know, the dribble penetration, of all things, I mean, that's a
60 some percent free-throw shooting team. Give them credit. They went in there
and knocked down free throw after free throw after free throw. We started
feathering on ball screens, we felt we couldn't give up that penetration,
Fields is so good. We did a decent job of that.  
Our bigs helped and got back, yet Blair is a load in there, still made some
big plays. But I thought all in all we did a pretty good job on him.  
  
Q. Tom, what was the game plan against Sam Young? Was it just a night where
he didn't shoot well or were you doing something defensively to frustrate
him?  
COACH IZZO: To be honest, we had a little bigger guy on him that was a little
slower. He started driving us in the second half.  
I don't think so. I think he missed some shots, to be honest with you. He's
really a good player. He's one of the best forwards we've played against. We
try to -- we couldn't put six eyes on him, but we put about four and a half.
We tried every time he got the ball to just kind of sag some guys in there
because we knew we couldn't cover him one-on-one. What really hurt us is
Morgan getting in foul trouble. He played five minutes the first half and, I
don't know, if he even played 20 for the game. 'Cause that was the matchup we
thought we could use a little bit. At least they're similar in athleticism.  
We couldn't do that. So I think it was a combination of Suton, of our guards
helping. But I don't think he had a great night. I think he's a great player
that maybe missed some shots that I've seen on film he's really made.  
  
Q. You talked after Thursday's game about how happy you were to have the
rest of team step up when Neitzel was perhaps a little off. How happy are you
to have him do what he did tonight?  
COACH IZZO: I'm happy for our team 'cause I've said all along, even back in
December, you know, when he had a couple games, don't kid yourself, we need
him. He's our guy. He's the guy that we have to have making shots.  
But I was really happy for him because it's been a little bit of a tougher
year, you know, with everybody on him, with everybody defending him well. For
him to respond like he has the last two and a half weeks, three weeks, is
awesome.  
So I'm happy for our team, but I'm really happy for Drew. It's an example of
guys that work hard, good things will happen. He's the all-American boy that
good things are happening, at least so far.  
  
Q. Drew seemed to say that he struggled with his confidence, aggressiveness.
Did you still have confidence in him? Did you like the fact he took those
three shots at the end?  
COACH IZZO: I love the fact he took those three shots. Everybody condemns me
for being hard on my players. I've been hard on Drew, I can promise you that,
but for the opposite reasons most people think. He's passed up shots in my
mind all year long. The last couple weeks he hasn't passed up any shots. He's
got to shoot it. Those guys are starting to learn to get him the ball in the
right spot. I'm telling you, if he's open, he can knock 'em down.  
We're still going to go as far as he takes us. It's great to have Kalin
getting better, growing every day. We still have to get Raymar in the thick of
things, keep him out of foul trouble. But Drew Neitzel made some big-time
plays tonight.  
  
Q. Can you comment on ID?  
COACH IZZO: I think he did a great job. For a kid who hasn't played maybe two
minutes in a month, we've used him, we've gotten a chance to play against some
bigger guys. ID, you know, he's starting to use his size. He got some
rebounds. Still misses a shot here and there. But I thought his size, his
length maybe bothered them a little bit. And he's physical. So he's not afraid
of getting banged. Strong kid. Another kid you got to be happy for 'cause he's
just an incredible guy.  
  
Q. Looked like you were emotional again after that win. How emotional has
this week been for you when you think about a week ago how tough that loss
was? What does this mean for your program to have a seventh Sweet-16 in 11
years?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I'm jacked. I'm jacked for the guys. As I said, when you
push guys so hard, sometimes you kind of feel sorry for them. Thank God I
didn't let that get to me too much because this is what it takes, you know. I
mean, the sessions we had, again, and I told my guys today before we left the
hotel, I was proud of them for hanging in there with me because it was drive,
drive, drive, drive, drive. In fact, the last second, we even went over the
missed free throw again in our film room. Sure enough, they just didn't miss
any. You got to give Pittsburgh a lot of credit. They didn't miss any free
throws. We thought that was going to be an important part of the game.  
I just thought they trusted what we said. We told them to be back at 9:00,
they're back. Be back at 10:00, they're back. Be there early in the morning.
They're there. They're a little driven, and that's exciting to see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Sam Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18114)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Pittsburgh. Coach, if you want to begin with thoughts
on the game.  
COACH DIXON: Well, I'm very proud of our team, have been all year. They've
been through a lot. Even today they were down, they battled back. Down 10,
took the lead in the second half. Made a great comeback. Put ourselves in a
position. I think we were up two with the ball. Had a couple good looks.
Didn't knock 'em down.  
But I'm very proud of these two guys, especially how much they battled,
played, got through a lot of different things. I'm very proud of us. I don't
think we played our best game. We obviously didn't shoot it well. 2 of 17 from
three. I thought we took some good ones early. We took some good ones at the
end.  
We got out-rebounded. That was a problem. But I thought we took good shots
throughout. But, again, had the lead, some things never seemed to go our way
at the end. Seemed like everything went their way. Took care of the ball. Had
nine turnovers, four or five of those were moving screen calls. We really did
a good job of taking care of the ball.  
But they seemed to have got the breaks at the end, went from a two-point lead
for us, just some things went their way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions directed to either of the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Levance, their coach said the game plan was to keep you from penetrating,
getting to the basket. Did they do a good job of that? Was your shooting
difficulty for the team more about what they were doing or you guys missing?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: You have to credit what they did. Obviously with they scheme
for me, they did a pretty good job.  
But like coach said, we felt we had some good looks in the first half, and
even in the second half, but they just didn't go down. They still had some
late-contests. Got to credit them for continuing to play hard, not just giving
us easy shots. Shots we normally knock down just didn't go today.  
  
Q. You came in here with so much confidence. Can you talk about the
suddenness of it being over, how you maybe didn't see this coming.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: It's tough, you know. Obviously we was on a roll. But all
along we knew it didn't mean nothing because any time in this tournament if
you didn't do the right things, you would be eliminated.  
Michigan State is a tough team. I don't think this is your normal second-round
game in a tournament. But obviously this was the game. We battled. They
battled. But, like coach said, they out-rebounded us. That was something we
couldn't afford to happen. That helped them to prevail to a victory.  
SAM YOUNG: I don't know. Felt like a lot of shots that we normally make, we
missed tonight. Felt like they played a good defense. I guess I credit their
coach. I think they had a great scheme. As far as their defense was concerned,
I thought they played great defense. But the shots that we were able to get
good looks at, we didn't knock them down.  
I just think when you in a situation when you playing in a tournament, sudden-
death, you couldn't afford for that to happen.  
  
Q. Levance, could you tell us, from your perspective, what happened? You got
called for a charge. At the end you were laying down grabbing your leg. What
happened on that sequence?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Well, I just twisted my ankle a little bit. But that was it.
At first it didn't feel good, but as I got up, I could put weight on it. So
that was a good thing. As of right now, I'm fine. I just twisted it a little
bit.  
  
Q. What about the play that led up to that?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: The charge?  
  
Q. What happened there?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: I was trying to go to the basket. Lucas did a great job of
positioning himself. I thought it could have went either way. But they got the
call. Like I said, he did a great job of positioning himself so it was a
charge.  
  
Q. Levance, talk about the future of this team with three starters
potentially coming back for next year. Your thoughts on next season.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Well, it's tough to think about that right now. But, like you
say, three potential starters coming back. Pretty much our nucleus, the three
guys you're talking about. As long as we work hard this summer, learn from
this, get better, like we did this summer, hopefully stay injury-free next
year, we should be fine.  
  
Q. Sam, can you reflect a little bit on what you accomplished this year. I
know it's tough right now, but...  
SAM YOUNG: Yeah, it is kind of tough right now. But at the same time when you
look back on the season, we'll be able to come to things that we were able to
accomplish, I'm very proud of the team and I'm very proud of myself as an
individual. I mean, the coaching staff and everybody.  
I feel like after a certain point in the season, a lot of people counted us
out. For us to continue on strong, win the Big East championship, get to this
point in the tournament, I think we showed a lot for ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much. We'll continue with questions for
Coach Dixon.  
  
Q. Looked overall like you guys played pretty good defense. Neitzel just hit
tough shots. Is that the way you read it?  
COACH DIXON: I thought in the first half, that's what we went into halftime
thinking. I thought we were in pretty good shape considering we didn't make
some open shots and they hit some tough ones. Neitzel hit a couple at the end.
The shot clock kind of shot them at the end and knocked them down. All in all
I thought in the first half I felt pretty good, considering what we had shot,
the shots that they had made.  
Second half, you know, they got some layups in transition. Seemed like every
missed three turned into a long rebound and a breakout for them, especially
the one play where we were up two, had an open three, turned out to be a run-
out for them. Quite a difference there.  
So I felt like defense was good, not great in the first half. Put ourselves in
position to step it up. Again, can't say enough about how we battled back.
Things going bad, we're down 10, turn that thing around right away after a
timeout and get back and put ourselves up two, put ourselves in a good
position.  
You know, we just -- just seemed like nothing seemed to go right at that
point. We just obviously -- some things went the wrong way. You know, we took
care of the ball. We got nine turnovers good against a very good defensive
team. Like I said, I think pretty much all of them were a moving screen or a
charge call or, you know, a carrying call. So, I mean, we took very good care
of the ball against a very good defensive team. Could have shot it better. But
made our free throws. They made their free throws. They were nine of nine. I
think the difference really came down to them making some threes and we
didn't.  
  
Q. This wasn't the way obviously you wanted to see Benjamin and Ramon go
out. Ronald didn't shoot well. Keith didn't score. Talk about your
disappointment for those two guys in particular.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I mean, I'm not a guy that's going to look at this game.
I'm going to look at their careers, what they did for us, the leadership they
gave for our team, really everything they went through, from being a young
team you recall in the year, to even younger when we they lost their two most
experienced in Levance and Mike Cook. Then two other guys go down. I think
Keith came so far this year and did so many great things for us.  
You know, I mean, those things far outweigh what happened tonight in my mind.
Every time I think about them, I mean, you know, I think they had some good
looks, some shots. But they battled. They brought us back. Keith made some big
plays to put us back and put us up two. Just seemed like the momentum was
going our way. For whatever reason, seemed like everything seemed to go their
way from that point on.  
But they were strong all year long in different ways. Levance -- I mean,
Ronald is quieter, but just doing everything right. Keith really brought a lot
as far as commitment and confidence. I can't say enough about how much those
guys did, how many games these guys won over their careers. A lot of games. I
don't even know what it is. They go home with a Big East championship. But a
lot of disappointment because I thought we could have played a lot better
tonight. I thought we could have. They played good, to their credit. But,
again, we just -- I thought we could have done a few things a little better.
I'm sure they feel the same way, though, too.  
  
Q. It seems like you're always going to be judged on your last game. That's
what people remember the most. Is that fair with this team?  
COACH DIXON: I don't know. It depends who the person is and what. You know, I
know these guys and every day what they gave. And our concentration, our
commitment the last couple weeks, things we did. I mean, today our preparation
for their stuff. I didn't feel like they hurt us really in their plays or
execution and plays. We knew everything they were going to do. We were
prepared.  
You know, just everything, we were so ready to play, like we have been these
last couple weeks. I mean, things just seemed to be coming together. Again,
this is a good team. We're up two. We got the ball late in the second half. We
hadn't even been shooting it well. So, you know, yes, I mean, you can think
about the last, you know, eight minutes or so when nothing seemed to go our
way. But these guys had a great year and, you know, we had so many great wins
that people will remember.  
This is a loss that will hurt because I think we could have played better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.  
COACH DIXON: Thank you very much.

DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 22, 2008

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Luke Harangody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16984)

### [Kyle McAlarney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18163)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Notre Dame. Coach, if you want to begin with
thoughts on the game.  
COACH BREY: I think you certainly take your hat off to Washington State. They
imposed their will on us. You know, the first four minutes we had that thing
going up and down a little bit, but after that we couldn't really get it
moving.  
I thought they played older, and they are older. Very good defensively. Smart
offensively. So they certainly deserve to move on.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Luke, talk about what's going through your mind now. This was obviously
the biggest game of the year for you. To come up this short, how do you
explain it and how does it feel?  
LUKE HARANGODY: You know, well, coming into this game, we were very confident.
We were ready to play. I don't think there was any doubt about that. But we
faced a great Washington State team tonight. Like coach said, hats off to
them. Very senior-leading team.  
Not much we can say about that. The feeling right now is disappointment,
obviously, with myself, with my performance, you know. I kind of feel like I
let the guys down. You know, just wasn't my night.  
  
Q. What happened? What did they do defensively out there to cause you, to
slow you up?  
KYLE MCALARNEY: Well, we didn't shoot the ball very well in. In the first half
we had some pretty good looks and they just didn't fall for us.  
Like Coach Brey said, they're a very good team, a veteran team. We can use
this game and learn a lot from it. In the off-season, we'll probably use this
as motivation and off-season workouts.  
Today they just got us. Defensively they were better than us. Like I said, you
know, that's going to be used as motivation in the off-season.  
  
Q. Kyle, it seemed like you could never get in transition tonight. What were
they doing? Were they getting up into you right away or... ?  
KYLE MCALARNEY: Well, a couple times, you know, they just got back and they
played very good defense. We went on a little run in the second half there due
to our rebounding and transition game. But we can't get out in transition if
we can't get stops. They were really flowing offensively and they were really
in a good rhythm.  
So it was very hard for us to get out in transition.  
  
Q. Kyle, when you look back on this game in July, what will you remember
about it?  
KYLE MCALARNEY: Well, I mean, it was disappointing, you know. For me, you
know, it wasn't my best performance. I know the other guys feel the same way.
Like Luke said, you kind of feel like you let the other guys down. It's very
hard to deal with. Very hard to end the season like that.  
Like I said before, we'll use this as motivation. Me personally, I'll do the
same thing. Coach Brey said to me before, they're a veteran group. We can
learn a lot from them. For me personally, their guards are very good. Tory and
me can learn a lot from their patience and their demeanor out there.  
  
Q. If and when they do get beat in this tournament, how hard of a game that
is going to be just because of their style, the way they grind?  
KYLE MCALARNEY: They're a very good team. They could go all the way. The way
they played us tonight, you know, just shows. We were one of the best
offensive teams in the country coming into this tournament. We believe that. I
think they knew that. So the way they played us tonight, it just shows the
rest of the country how good they really are. We feel like they're a very good
team and they deserve all the credit they get.  
I feel like they can go all the way. I know we'll be rooting for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach Brey.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about running after misses and made baskets. You
never even got close to that. Did you see on tape people actually being able
to do that?  
COACH BREY: Well, I think we pushed it a little bit more than you would think,
if you would watch the tape. Especially in the first half, we weren't getting
easy stuff. But we got down, especially the first four minutes.  
We were not going to be able to -- part of me saying that was psychologically.
I'm certainly not going to say we're playing halfcourt, even though I knew we
were going to have to play halfcourt against these guys. It is easier to slow
a team down, and they did.  
I look at 17 three-point shots. I think 12 of those were good looks. In the
first half, I thought we had some pretty good looks for good shooters.  
We're going to have to make a couple more of those to feel good about
ourselves at halftime. And when you don't, you go back down and have to guard
for 25 seconds, one of the reasons they're a great defensive team is how they
play offense. They wear you down, running you through screens and stuff.  
What they did is really established their will and their style. That's gonna
be their strength and probably not ours.  
I loved the fact that we fought back, I think we had it at seven with the
ball. But, boy, you know, it was a hard -- it was a big hole to get out of
because of the style.  
  
Q. As well as you played the other day, did you see any scenario where it
could just come out this lopsided?  
COACH BREY: I think you see every scenario when you're a coach. There's no
question about it. I'm disappointed it wasn't a better basketball game, we
didn't have a chance. The knock-out punch came early.  
But, you know, again, I tried to get their heads up a little bit. I love the
group that I have. I love what's coming back. I'm excited. We start practice
August 1st because we're going to Ireland. Certainly there's some thing you
can learn and work on, but those guys need some rest right now 'cause this
group, boy, they gave us everything they had.  
  
Q. How much did their traps trouble you today?  
COACH BREY: Early, I thought we maybe forced a couple. But then after a while,
you know, we got looks out of it. There is where the threes came up, when they
doubled and we kicked it out safely, probably the last 10 minutes of the first
half. We swung it to a shooter who had a look. That's how you got to make the
trap pay.  
Ryan had looks that he stroked the other night. Zeller, we got to hit a couple
of those. Rob, we got to hit a couple of those. That's who we are. We shoot
the ball well.  
Why didn't we shoot the ball well? Number one they play defense, number two
you're a little tired because you play defense against them for 25 seconds. I
would have loved to play more zone tonight. But when you're in a hole, you're
not playing zone against them. You would have had to have more control of the
game and maybe the lead to rotate D. I think we played one possession of zone
and then we were digging out of a hole the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Could you comment on the experience of coaching Rob Kurz for the last
four years. That was the last time.  
COACH BREY: I'm glad you asked that. I got a little emotional in the locker
room just congratulating him. I know it probably wasn't the best of nights for
him.  
I told him yesterday at practice, here is a young man who scored a thousand
points at Notre Dame. You look at the company he's in on that list, it's
staggering. He's a guy who came to us 200 pounds, mono, a broken jaw. He's a
great story. I wish we could have extended his season. I will always be
indebted to his leadership, how he set the tone as an example of a worker in
our program, a guy who made himself better.  
He's got a really bright future making money playing this game somewhere. We
need to start working on that for him next week. He will go to Portsmouth, by
the way, so that will be a good follow-up.  
  
Q. We talked about it being a two-year experience with this group. People
say you'll be better next year. Losing Rob Kurz makes that very difficult.  
COACH BREY: I don't think you can ever count on that. One of the things is
everybody's head going to be the same? This group has been fabulous. I think
maybe we had two bad practices all year. I just told them that in the locker
room. They've been unbelievable. It's a great class to teach every day.  
But, you know, guys change. Are we gonna still chase it as a group? You're
right, that's a big loss right there. The little things. The screening. The
dirty work. The defense. You just don't plug in and move on.  
So I am concerned about that. I need to squelch that. Let's take a deep breath
and figure that out. We'll know in Ireland. We'll know by August 20th. But
that's a big loss.  
He's a Notre Dame man. I'm very proud of him. I'm excited to see the
opportunities he gets professionally because he's an interesting guy.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Washington State University. Coach, if you want
to give us your thoughts on the game.  
COACH BENNETT: Well, obviously we did what we needed to do. We made it our
kind of game. It started with our transition defense. No question.  
These guys bought in at a new level tonight playing against a very talented
offensive team. And each one of them stepped up in their own right and were
significant. But we got the game the way we needed to get the game. We didn't
yield. We didn't let them get easy shots. We made them earn all night. If we
can do that, we're always in good shape. The guys showed some composure. Feels
great. Big step for our program. I challenged them before the game. I said,
You were in this spot last year against Vanderbilt. I said, now have we
learned from it? Are we going to go out there and what cost us against
Vanderbilt? Are we going to learn from that? They certainly did. It's a good
moment for Washington State basketball certainly.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You gave up 17 of 78 to your opponents in the last three halves. What is
going so well for you guys defensively right now?  
ROBBIE COWGILL: I think for us in this tournament we have to play solid
defense to be competitive and to be in games and advance.  
Coach has been telling us all year, that's got to be our ticket. We have to be
a very solid defensive team to be in games. I feel like we were in a league
where a lot of good offensive talent, a lot of good offensive players, that
obviously helps your team D.  
But I think the main thing is we know that has to be our bread and butter if
we're going to do well in this tournament.  
  
Q. You talked about the year about having unfinished business. Tonight was
that part of what you thought about before the game, moving on to the next
round?  
KYLE WEAVER: Well, coach showed us a picture of the score and the time of the
second-round game last year, showed it to everybody. You know, it was quiet.
Everybody just looked at it, you know. Kind of soaked that moment in.  
I think from that moment I think the team realized that we had a chance to
come out and do something special by winning this game and to advance, show a
little progress from last year.  
I wouldn't say it's finished yet. We got a long way to go. We got a few days
to get ready for our next opponent. We'll see what happens at Charlotte.  
  
Q. Now that you are at the Sweet-16 level, is the pressure off? Is this the
rest of this gravy or is it a different approach now?  
DERRICK LOW: There's still gonna be pressure, I mean. But we can't worry about
any of that. We got to worry about our own team and ourselves. We just got to
go out and play our game. It's new territory for us to go to the Sweet-16. But
I think that's what we all, you know, were preparing for ever since we came to
Washington State, for this moment.  
I think we're ready for it. We're just gonna, you know, take this as a
challenge, play our game and see what happens.  
  
Q. Kyle, do you have bragging rights in the Weaver household yet in terms of
basketball accomplishments or is it going to take an NCAA title for that?  
KYLE WEAVER: The title will be the ultimate. But I think I'm getting pretty
close (smiling). Even just making it here back to back, I don't know if my dad
can really beat that. I'm getting close.  
  
Q. Kyle, I know you envisioned games going this way in your dreams, but did
it surprise you to hold them to 25% shooting and have them out of the game as
early as you did? How much of a surprise?  
KYLE WEAVER: Man, it feels like a dream right now. I'm still, you know, trying
to take all this in as we speak.  
But to go out and perform like that, you know, and to beat a good team like
Notre Dame by 20 points in a second-round matchup, it was pretty neat. I think
we were all ready tonight. I think we just wanted to come out and play as good
as we can. I think we're starting to find our niche and starting to do it at a
good time.  
  
Q. Was there any point you really felt Notre Dame got frustrated? You talked
that's when you guys are able to put teams away.  
DERRICK LOW: Did we ever since they were getting frustrated?  
  
Q. Yes. At what point?  
DERRICK LOW: I can't remember at what point, but you could -- we could
definitely sense it a little bit. You know, the way we were guarding their
perimeter, you know, and the way we were guarding their post. Seemed like they
were just kind of just trying to rush into the post and just kind of throw up
some shots. You know, I thought that's a sign of frustration on their part.  
But it was just, you know, our job to just try and make them take those kind
of shots, and I thought we did a good job at that, then we tried to secure the
rebounds.  
  
Q. After watching the two No. 4 seeds lose yesterday, does this put any
special meaning advancing as the No. 4 seed?  
ROBBIE COWGILL: Yeah, I guess. I don't think we were thinking about that at
all going in. You know, I think after the selection show, we pretty much put
the seed behind us. You know, I think we were probably the underdog going into
this one. Most people probably had us losing this game, even watching some of
the coverage last night.  
So, no, I don't think that was in our heads. We knew this was going to be a
tough, physical, grind-out game, and that's what our focus was.  
  
Q. What's the like to be here going to the Sweet-16 just two years after you
were last place in the PAC-10? Can you describe what that turnaround has been
like?  
KYLE WEAVER: Being last in the PAC-10 to where we are now, it's pretty hard to
put into words. I think it just shows how much we've grown as players and as a
team every year. This is what we dream about, this is what we've been working
for. We put in the time, the blood, the sweat and tears, and it's starting to
pay off.  
  
Q. We all just witnessed it, but I'm wondering if you can put into words how
you were able to hold Notre Dame to half of its scoring average.  
ROBBIE COWGILL: I think first and foremost, just getting back. They love to
run. They want to score in the 80s. They want to push the ball and take quick
shots, open threes early. So we knew if we had a chance at this game, we were
going to have to get back and make them play halfcourt offense against our set
halfcourt D. I think for almost the whole game we did that. That probably
frustrated them. They like to get into a flow, get running, kind of get on
runs and spurts like that where they're going and shooting quick.  
That was kind of our key in this game, was getting back and making them play
against our set halfcourt D.  
  
Q. Robbie, Aron did a lot of the work, but can you talk about the effort on
Luke. He was held to 3 of 17, talk about some of the frustration he was
feeling.  
ROBBIE COWGILL: Aaron is a big guy. You know when you face him every day in
practice, he's just a big human being. When he can get between Luke and the
basket, make him take tough shots over him, I think it was hard for him. I
think Aron did a good job of staying down, staying in front of him. Really any
time we play pretty solid defense against a post guy, it's everyone. We had
the trap on. I think that maybe frustrated them a little bit, helped. The
guards did a great job of rotating. I think also the refs let us play. They
let us be physical in there. Sometimes he tries to create contact and get some
of those. That didn't happen tonight.  
It was really a good team effort on Luke the whole way around.  
  
Q. You just held two tournament teams to 40 and 41 points. Without getting
too technical, what is it that you do, what is it that seems to completely
unsettle these teams that haven't seen you before?  
KYLE WEAVER: Oh, man, what is it that we do? I don't think we have any
trickery or any magic that we come out with, secret power (clapping hands
twice).  
There's no secret. We play our pack defense, try to keep the ball out of the
paint, make the opposing team shoot tough shots. I think as team we did a
pretty good job of that, sometimes trapping the post, making Harangody to do
different things with it and forcing other guys to make shots on their team.
With a mix of some other small things, I think us just playing hard, too, the
effort we put in on the defensive end tonight I think was pretty big time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.  
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about what you and your dad talked about when you met with
him.  
COACH BENNETT: He was real happy. He said, Great job, son. He's proud of these
guys. I told the CBS people he deserves so much credit. He started this thing,
installed the system. He just wanted it so much. He told all the guys when we
walked into the arena today, he said, No fears, no regrets. He just kind of
told them that. I caught his eye late in the game. I think he was praying when
I met him. I couldn't make contact about three or four minutes left. Pretty
excited.  
I need to embrace my wife, mom and dad, my two kids. That's what you want to
do in that moment, is share it. I got to go along on the ride with him in 2000
when they went to the Final Four. I remember how special each step of that
was. He's obviously been a huge part of my life and it was pretty cool to do
that.  
  
Q. Your overall defensive alertness seemed right on the mark. Things that
stood out in your mind?  
COACH BENNETT: What I said in the opening statement, just getting back, just
get back and make them play against a set defense. That was our first rule.
That was huge. They tried to dribble penetrate, we were in our gaps, made them
shoot contested shots. I thought the trap was good at times, we were pretty
good at on the glass. They had 12 offensive rebounds.  
Guys were just really locked in. It was a possession-by-possession battle, we
told them. They wouldn't break down. I think they had one transition basket
where we followed them in transition. But that was the only breakdown in
transition defense. That's a great place to start.  
  
Q. Thursday night Derrick got off to a slow start, 0-5 in the first half.
Tonight scores six points in the first five minutes. Did that make you breathe
earlier?  
COACH BENNETT: When Derrick is aggressive, that helps us. I tell you what, I
was so impressed with Derrick, that's the best I've seen him defensively,
active with his hands, digging out loose balls. He had a tough job because
that kid is a great offensive rebounder, Tory Jackson. He ended up with three.
We challenged him to keep him off the glass. I thought Derrick defensively was
as impressive as I've seen him in the gaps. Then offensively he hit that
dagger with a three. He moves. He's a complete guard.  
I was so pleased with his performance tonight. He was aggressive. His 6 for
15, but he hunted the shot and he stayed focused all game. I thought that was
significant for us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Taylor, his defense.  
COACH BENNETT: Taylor, boy, he really didn't allow -- we said Kyle is like --
yeah, Kyle is like Appleby from the Huskies. Know how quick he is. He has such
a quick release, he'll shoot it from deep. You have to hound him like you're
guarding Appleby. Beat screens, don't give him clean looks, like he did to
Jenkins the night before, mind you, because he was pretty good against him. He
really worked. I think he was a little fatigued offensively, didn't have a
typical game. He did have sevens assists, two turnovers. He took care of the
ball. That's another thing I didn't mention.  
But Taylor was very good both nights. Kyle did not get too many clean looks on
the offensive end. I thought he and Derrick are one and two, out front. Kyle
was rebounding. He was good tonight. We had the trap working. Every guy was
good individually. I said, You got to have accountability to yourself,
handling your own guy. But they were very good as a team and it came together
at the right time.  
  
Q. Aron played most of the second half with three fouls. What were you and
the other coaches thinking?  
COACH BENNETT: We felt we needed him on the glass. There came a point we
couldn't withstand it. He ended up with 11 boards. His first foul concerned
me. But he played smart without getting another one. When he picked up his
third, there's a point in the game where we said we have to be able to control
the boards. You saw Aron go up. He can do that better than most of our guys,
rebounding in traffic. I thought that, again, was another big part of his game
that helped us.  
  
Q. Kyle mentioned the picture. When did you come up with that idea?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, my wife, she had a picture. It was actually a picture of
the scoreboard before we played Vanderbilt. It said 20 minutes on the clock,
0-0, Washington State versus Vanderbilt. Picture that big picture. She said, I
had this. I said, I love that, I think I can use that. She said you might want
to use this because she showed it to me. I said, That's perfect.  
I showed them that. I said before the game, fellas, here we are. I want
everybody to take a look at this picture. I said, You were in this spot last
year before the game. Remember the thoughts going through your head? I said,
What can you do better to get us one step further? What have you learned from
this experience? Against Vanderbilt, we played well for the most part, but I
didn't think defensively we were as tough as we needed to be. We gave up some
transition baskets. Turned over late down the stretch of the game. Things
happened. Derrick wasn't as assertive. I said, Show me that you have learned
from this experience. That's what I want to see. That was the picture. They
saw it. After the game, I ripped it up in front of them and said, You did it.  
  
Q. Does Weaver surprise even you when he seemingly comes out of nowhere for
a rebound or slips through for a layup?  
COACH BENNETT: I've seen him do that now. But I feel like the last few games,
he's taken it to another level rebounding the basketball. That's been huge for
us. What he did against Stanford, even though we lost in the PAC-10
tournament, he rebounded at a high level.  
Kyle is so versatile, his ability to slash, drop passes, make plays
offensively. But that ability to rebound is really I think the thing that has
jumped up in the last few weeks of the season. You know, he's made a
difference. He's really playing sound basketball. It's real good to see.  
I didn't mention this. I think our league really prepared us for this game.
The PAC-10, you know, every night you go out, you got to battle. You play
against different kinds of styles. It's hard-fought. That was my hope this
year, if we could get in the tournament, the league was going to beat each
other up, but it would prepare you to play in games like this. I really
believe that the PAC-10 did.  
  
Q. Could you speak to Caleb's contributions?  
COACH BENNETT: Caleb gave us a great lift early. People who haven't seen him
for a while look at him. Like I said, he doesn't move the smoothest, but he
was aggressive, loosening up, knocking down shots at very timely times,
opportune times for us. There were some stretches where we weren't scoring.
Him to loosen the defense up with that shot was good.  
He gives you all effort. You know, he had five rebounds, too, in 15 minutes.
They were important minutes with Aron picking up a foul, the fatigue factor of
trying to run the floor with Luke. I thought his minutes were very valuable.
That shot, he saw that on Thursday, he can knock down that shot when he
screens or loosens. We found them. We attacked them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the plan was on Harangody and how you were so
effective?  
COACH BENNETT: Certainly to run the floor and get our defense set. Wanted to
kind of throw it on and off. A guy like John Brockman in our league is a
tremendous player. There's some similarities between the two of them. When we
thought when we got it, trap him hard, get it out of his hands. I watched a
lot of tape. I don't know if many Big East teams have done that. We had some
success with it. We thought that would be important, try and keep our big guys
out of foul trouble. It makes us more assertive and aggressive. We got a
couple key turnovers off of that. There were times when we didn't trap, just
to throw a different look at him. Our guys really pinched the gaps, stayed
down, make him make shots over the top.  
  
Q. What has it been like from a coaching standpoint, the turnaround this
team has taken?  
COACH BENNETT: It's remarkable. It's a great story. Because it's with the
right kind of kids, character. There's no shortcut to doing it the right way.
We got the right kind of kids. You can see that when you talk to them. They
bought into a vision. They haven't wavered.  
You know, you can lose with them. That's what my dad said. You got to recruit
kids you can lose with before we win. I can't tell you the character in our
locker room. They're a joy to coach. Sometimes we drive each other nuts. But
you can always look at each other and know that it's about the right stuff.  
That's what Washington State's about, Pullman. It's a fighter, underdog,
fighter mentality. The people embrace that there. There's nothing better than
going to a place where people don't think it can be done. But the
administration and the community believes you, they embrace it when you're
competitive to start. That's what drew my dad out of retirement. I want to go
to a place where they don't think it can be done. He's never experienced
something like that, people were so thankful they fought hard. Even though we
finished in last place, they believed, were encouraged. For those people who
suffered a long time, this is a great reward for them.  
It's a special place to be, a special group of kids to do something like that.
Now I get to go back to Charlotte, where I met my wife, she's not from there,
got to play with the Hornets for three years. That will be very special for
our family to go back. But I'm just very thankful right now for what I've had
the opportunity to be a part of.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State student-athletes. We'll go ahead
and begin with questions.  
  
Q. It seems like your team and the Pittsburgh team is very similar in the
way you play defense, overall depth, toughness. Can you speak to that, what
kind of a game you expect tomorrow in terms of physicality, toughness?  
DREW NEITZEL: You know, I think it will be a very aggressive, you know, a
physical game, like you said. Both teams like to run. Both are great
rebounding teams with a lot of talent.  
So should be a great matchup and a very intense game.  
TRAVIS WALTON: Pretty much agree with Drew. It's good going to be a tough,
physical game. They got some big men, tough guards, so do we. It's going to be
a tough game. It's going to come down to the last possessions of the game.  
  
Q. Raymar, when you get to this time of the year, do you start rooting for
your Big-10 brothers as well? Are you keeping an eye on Purdue and the other
guys?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: Definitely. I think we look out for 'em. I don't know about so
much rooting for 'em.  
But there's always support there. We're happy for them in they're winning. But
we're worried about ourselves.  
  
Q. Raymar, have you been able to see a lot of film on Sam Young and do you
expect to be matching up with him tomorrow?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: Definitely. I'll be playing the four a little bit tomorrow.
It's definitely going to be a matchup between me and Sam Young. He's a great
player, can do pretty much everything. Very overall good player. Inside and
out. It should be a pretty good matchup.  
  
Q. You said you don't necessarily root for Purdue. Is it a pride thing with
the Big-10 when it comes to this tournament?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: I would think so. Like I said, there's always support, there's
love there. Like I said, I'm just not gonna be happy if they win or lose. Like
I said, I'm just worried about myself, worried about my team.  
  
Q. Kalin, Pitt won four straight in the tournament, opened with an
impressive win. Looks like they're peaking at the right time. Does that get
your attention more when a team is dismantling people?  
KALIN LUCAS: Yeah, it does. Like I said, Pittsburgh, they're a great team. We
got to come out, play very physical and play for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. How do you become a physical team? You always have the reputation of a
being a great rebounding team, tough physically. Is that coach's mindset, the
kind of guys he recruits?  
DREW NEITZEL: I think it's a combination of a lot of things. Like you said,
the guys that coach recruits, the type of program he's built, just every day
in practice is a war, whether it's rebounding drills, going against each
other. It's a grind every day in practice. We beat up on each other. You know,
that carries over to the game as far as being physical and outworking teams.  
TRAVIS WALTON: You can't be afraid to get hit, you know. Being physical, you
got to be able to hit somebody else and take a hit at the same time. You know,
that's Michigan State basketball and that's pretty much Pittsburgh basketball,
too. Ain't nobody on they team or ain't nobody on our team afraid to get hit,
you know, with an elbow or a bump or anything goes. That's physical
basketball, and that's what we play, and that's what they play.  
  
Q. Travis, you're a film junky, as Izzo has said. In tournament situations
like this, how much film do you get a chance to watch on teams like Pitt or
Temple the other day?  
TRAVIS WALTON: You know, we try to watch a lot of film, but at the same time
you never know what team gonna win. You know, so after we won our game, we
kind of wait and see the results of the Pittsburgh and Oral Roberts game. As
soon as we heard the results, I got two films, other players got a whole bunch
of films. We took it to our room. Some got computers we watch on our computers
or we get DVD players. Then we have film sessions with the coaches. We try to
beat ourself up with film, walking through, because at this time that's what
you got to do. You know, you don't know too much about a team, so you got too
try to, you know, force yourself to watch as much as you can, stay up all
night, 'cause it's going to be worth it at the end.  
  
Q. Raymar, would you rather play a team that's gonna be softer, so to speak,
that wants to go up and down and shoot, rather than a team that's similar to
you guys, physical?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: At this point in time, it really doesn't matter. It's a
challenge to play a team similar to us, though. I think everybody's accepting
that challenge with open arms and we're just ready to play.  
  
Q. Raymar, yesterday you talked about how the six eyes defense was effective
against Christmas. Are you going to bring that out tomorrow against Young? Is
that something you do every game for an opponent?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: Definitely. We use the six eyes terms in every game. We'll
bring it out tomorrow versus Young, Levance Fields, different guys that do
different things.  
  
Q. Travis and Drew, they talk about your program as being very physical all
the time. Does it ever, in the back of your mind, bother you that they don't
talk about you being really good basketball players with great skills, they
more talk about your program as the one that hammers on people all day?  
DREW NEITZEL: Uhm, we take pride in, you know, what Coach Izzo has built over
the years. It's been very successful with the Final Fours and national
championships and things like that.  
So we accept it. But, uhm, you know, we use that as motivation, too. We have a
lot of great basketball players, you know, with a lot of talent. When you put
that with aggressiveness and being physical, that's a great combination. It's
a winning combination. So that's what Coach Izzo has built this program on,
and it's been successful. So, you know, we embrace that attitude.  
TRAVIS WALTON: When I first came here and I talked to Matean Cleaves, he said
when you win, it takes care of everything. You know, some programs get
individual awards for they players. Michigan State is about family. That's how
it's been built, from Matean, to the 'Ton Smiths, everybody else.  
We hope for the individual awards, but as our team does a great job, the
individual award's gonna come. When your team don't do as well, individual
awards don't really mean nothing because at the end you come to college to win
championships, regular-season championships, and with that comes individual
awards.  
  
Q. Drew, Travis, Coach Izzo's tournament record is superb. We talk about
players raising their game for the tournament, elevating their game. Do you
see something like that in a coaching equivalent with Coach Izzo? Talk about
his preparation tournament time.  
DREW NEITZEL: Coach Izzo definitely turns it up a few notches. Like you said,
he has a great record, especially in the second round or second game of a
tournament weekend. They do a great job of preparation with all the film
sessions, walk-throughs, things like that. Just the experience that he's had,
the success he's had in this tournament, you know, makes us all believe in him
and fully trust in what he's doing, gives us that confidence that we are going
to be successful.  
TRAVIS WALTON: Yeah, uhm, I think, you know, coach does a great job, you know,
he always stays up a lot during the season, but this is kind of his time where
he can stay up till two, three, four, go home, watch film all day, prepare.
This is like a challenge to him. You know, every game, every team I think is a
personal challenge to him and for our team to come out and, you know, prove
something for this program, like we just said.  
So he does a great job of getting us ready, letting us know that it's one-and-
done. All of the former players, Matean Cleaves called me, texted everybody
else on the team, letting us know about this time, go get it done.  
  
Q. Kalin, were you very nervous on your first tournament game? If so, are
you more relaxed in the second one?  
KALIN LUCAS: I wouldn't say nervous. It's more me being anxious, ready to
play. Going out there, first tournament game, it is very anxious, very
exciting.  
  
Q. Travis, you mentioned watching film. When you were watching, you see
Pitt, are they as similar to you guys as any team you've seen? Also did you
see one guy that keys them that you really need to shut down?  
TRAVIS WALTON: Yeah, I do feel they are similar to us. You know, they play
aggressive. They run a lot of sets. They got a knock-down shooter, they got a
good point guard, some good post players. You know, I feel that, you know, Sam
Young is probably the best all-around player. But I personally feel that
Levance Fields is they engine, you know, that keeps them going, that keeps
them solid, that takes big shots like he did against Duke. When he got back
into the lineup for them, got going, they team started playing a lot better.  
I feel he is the engine of the team. You know, he does a great job of running,
taking big shots, not turning the ball over. Got a great assist-to-turnover
ratio. He does a great job for that team.  
  
Q. Tom is kind of legendary for some of the stuff he puts you through in
practice. The stories go on. What is the most grueling things you do on a
regular basis in practice?  
DREW NEITZEL: I don't know, I'd probably say, you know, just our war drill,
just our different defensive drills. It gets very physical. Especially when
we're going against our scout team on the defensive end, you know, they're
trying to beat us every day in practice. We're trying to stop 'em. You know,
we get in a lot of confrontations. It gets very physical.  
Sometimes they give us a better look than what the other team is gonna give
us. So they've done a great job for us. That's probably the toughest they are,
war drill, going against our scout team, who beats up on us.  
  
Q. What exactly is the "war drill"? What does it entail?   
DREW NEITZEL: Basically coach throws the ball up and, you know, you got two
teams, and you just go after it, whoever can get the ball. You know, guys are
hitting each other, throwing each other around. It gets pretty physical. The
coaches are there, you know, pushing us, trying to motivate each guy to get
the ball.  
Everybody's going 110% trying to get it. A lot of guys come out of there with
bloody lips, bloody noses, whatever it is. It's pretty intense.  
  
Q. Drew, are you looking to do anything differently this game to bounce back
from the offensive scoring performance that you had against Temple?  
DREW NEITZEL: No, I guess just makes shots (smiling). That game's in the past.
I shot the ball great today in practice. I'm gonna let 'em fly. You know,
whether I'm hitting, whether they aren't going in, I'm making them, I'm still
gonna shoot 'em. The key is just to stay aggressive, you know, make plays.  
  
Q. Travis, how late did you stay up watching film? When did Matean call
you?  
TRAVIS WALTON: How late did I stay up? If I say that, I might get in trouble
by coach. I stayed up pretty late. I watched when they plate West Virginia,
when they played Cincinnati, watched them play in they sets. Matean called me.
He's out in California. He watched the Marquette game. Sometime after that
game. I don't have the time frame. He texted me first. I texted him back. He
was excited. You watching film of Pittsburgh? We're going to go down and watch
film right now. You better get some film, you better tell the team we ready to
go get it. That's Matean right there. Antonio Smith, the rest of the players,
texting us, giving us words of encouragement to go out there, play hard,
represent the program well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
Joined now by Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo. We'll begin with questions.  
  
Q. Coach, Drew has been peppered pretty good about this week, what does he
think about the end of his career. Have you thought about it or would you
rather not think about his career coming to an end?  
COACH IZZO: I never like to think about seniors ending their career,
especially guys that have done it for you in the classroom, you know, off the
court and on the court.  
But, I mean, I'm hoping that keeps driving him to what he wants to accomplish
this year. There's nothing like seniors being able to tell the underclassmen,
you know, how fast it's gone. You don't get many second chances, all those
things.  
I don't think I ever think about it till it finally happens. There's been one
or two senior day games when I've told my staff, I hope we win by enough so I
can sit down and enjoy the last minute or two with my stars. Other than that,
I don't think about it till it's over.  
  
Q. Is he a different person as far as heading out?  
COACH IZZO: Boy, believe it or not, as hard as I am on some of those guys,
they're all special. I think they've all made it through, you know. They've
all been pretty successful making it through, too. There hasn't been one of
them that made it through that hasn't gone to a Final Four. In that respect --
you know, I mean, he's a kid I've known a little longer than most, since his
sophomore year of high school. Spent a little more time with in that respect.  
But he and his family have been great. I'm gonna miss him a lot.  
  
Q. Jamie Dixon called you right around the time he was hired. Could you
recount that conversation, if you remember it, and also talk about how your
programs kind of mirror each other in terms of their mentality.  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, it started with Ben Howland. When Ben got the job,
head coach at Central Michigan now is a Michigan native, I helped him get in
there. Ben and I used to talk a little bit. I think we had similar
philosophies, you know, the defense had to be important, toughness. He was
more of a play-oriented guy. And then when Jamie got the job, he wanted to
know what it was like taking over for someone who had been very successful.  
I really appreciated Jamie right off the bat. He was great. We talked a little
bit about program stuff. Then we just talked about our philosophies. If you
looked at UCLA and Pittsburgh and Michigan State, in a lot of respects there
are a lot of similarities. Neither one of us have quite the horse that Ben has
out there in Love. But other than that, you look at the defense. You look at
the fast-breaking. You look at the plays. You look at the strength factor,
which we've been lacking in a little bit. But still the philosophy's the same.
And I think he's done as good a job -- if I voted for national coach of the
year, he'd have to be right up there, for surviving what he went through this
year in a tough conference, with the injuries he's had, to both Cook and of
course Fields. He's battled that. He's had 25-point losses and turned it right
around. I think that's the mark of a great coach, is getting knocked down a
few times, yet getting his team back.  
I don't get to talk to Jamie every day, but I have great respect. I think
there's great respect for both programs.  
  
Q. Dayton and Marquette have both played Pitt this season, both proteges of
yours. Did Pitt get an advantage out of that?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I don't know. Like I said, I feel like in my own way I
know Pitt's program. I haven't seen them a lot this year. I know Jamie's
philosophy as he knows mine.  
So, you know, I don't know if there's any advantage, disadvantage. I mean, we
run -- we don't run the same things at Pitt. We don't run the same things as
Marquette or Dayton, yet we all run what I would call play-oriented systems.
Defensively we're just about all man-to-man systems.  
So I don't know if there's any great advantage in there. But I do know some
guys that have played 'em. I have a lot of friends that have played them.
Everybody tells me the same thing. Exactly what Bobby Knight said. They're a
tough team, a strong team. I thought he hit the nail right on the head as far
as what they've gone through this year. They've got a great point guard. He
reminds me a lot of Matean Cleaves. He's a muscle dribbler, enjoys contact, he
seeks it. He can penetrate in. When he penetrates, they become such a better
offensive rebounding team because people have to help out on them. He just
kind of runs their team. When you got a guy running a team like that, when you
have a player of Young's caliber who can go inside, outside, it's a tough
matchup.  
  
Q. I asked some of the players if they saw a change in you come tournament
time. Can you talk about raising the level of your game, the feeling that
strikes you when tournament time rolls around?  
COACH IZZO: I think conventional wisdom would tell you every game is a big
game and you're supposed to be up for a big game. But everybody understands
the difference, importance of different parts of the season. What I'm striving
for as a coach is to make sure my players understand a little bit more -- I
don't want to be known as a tournament team, I want to be known as a regular-
season team, a Big-10 tournament team, an NCAA tournament team. What we've
done a little better in the past is I think we've been very good on one-day
preps.  
We play tournaments early in the year for that reason. We used to play our own
tournament. It gives you a one-night prep. I have very good assistants, very
good video guys. I think that's where the intensity comes. That's different.
If anything, I think I'm calmer to them. But I think they know that we're
gonna work for them. They know they're gonna be prepared to play. But that's
only half the battle. Remember, you still got to play the game.  
I just think they feel be comfortable and confident that we're going to have
them in a position where we know what the other team is gonna do. Now, whether
you can stop that only time will tell.  
  
Q. Do you feel that adrenaline rush the way a player does?  
COACH IZZO: I do. That's what I said. I'm not even sure you should admit to it
because you're supposed to be up for every game. Look, we don't have this kind
of setup for every game. It's just a different level. And each week that you
go by, it just doubles and triples, and that's what makes this tournament
maybe one of the greatest sports spectacles in our country.  
  
Q. You said the other day you don't have any superstitions but you have a
working routine you follow. Can you take us through a little bit what your
working routine is on these short preps and how much of that contributes to
your success on the second day of these tournaments?  
COACH IZZO: Well, either that has been part of it or better players has been a
part of it. If you have great players, I think that would beat the heck out of
any prep you could do.  
But, you know, what we normally do is we try to break it down into 20-
25-minute segments, 25 minute meeting, show them a little tape and then before
the dinner, like last night, we had a 15-minute tape session and a 10-minute
walk-through. We ate. We had a 10 or 12-minute tape session, 10 or 12-minute
walk through. We let them go. Brought them back, had another tape session on
the personnel, another walk through. What it does is attention span, you know,
I got a seven-year-old, when you get this time of the tournament, poor
players, they're kind of worn out, so they don't have as long an attention
span. I think these 10, 15, 20-minute deals, especially when it's sandwiched
around a snack or meal, if you can get lucky enough to have a hotel that has
an area where you can walk through, that's what we kind of do our most damage.
That's the way we've approached it. It's been successful for us. I'm sure
everybody's got their own way.  
  
Q. People obviously have been talking a lot about how your team is tough,
and they're a tough team, too. How do you define toughness in a basketball
sense and how do you try to make your team to be tough?  
COACH IZZO: What I really like about their team, it's what I really, really
liked about my championship team. Matean Cleaves is probably the toughest
player I ever coached. And yet everybody loved him. I mean, the opponents
liked him because he didn't talk it, he just played it. I don't know, I
haven't played against Pittsburgh, but watching them yesterday, you know, I
see an air of confidence, an air of cockiness, but not an air of talking it,
they just do it. That's what I respect about Ben Howland, that's what I
respect about Jamie, his teams just do it.  
Some people talk it and don't walk it. Some people walk it and don't talk it.
They're more the walk and don't talk, as far as I can see. I think those are
the real tough teams. The teams that have to talk it, there's probably an air
of softness in there that they feel they have to try to intimidate somebody
because they can't take care of it themselves.  
Mental toughness is damn near as important as physical toughness because they
should go hand-in-hand. But if you're just physically tough and mentally weak,
it's not going to do any good either. They got to go hand-in-hand.  
  
Q. How big of a concern Sam Young is to you? How are you going to deal with,
assuming Naymick is on Blair, how are you going to deal with Young, Benjamin,
Morgan Suton?  
COACH IZZO: Doesn't sound like anything good to think about me personally
(smiling).  
But, you know, Young is a problem. I mean, we had the kid Alan Anderson a few
years ago, wasn't quite as big. But any time you got a 6'6", 6'7" guy that can
put it on the floor, that can shoot threes, that can post you up, it's a
mismatch problem. Some of the times, some of the reasons they're successful is
it's a mismatch problem.  
Do you put a smaller guy on him, let him post you up, special play that they
get it into the post on? Do you put a bigger guy on him and then hope they got
enough help on the perimeter that he doesn't just drive around you?  
So we've got both game plans in. I'm sure we're gonna have to alternate it,
maybe even throw in a little bit of zone. I don't think you're going to see a
lot of zone by either team out there tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you tell me the genesis of the war drill and your philosophy behind
it? When is the last time you put the football helmets and the shoulder pads
on?  
COACH IZZO: I did it a year ago (laughter). I should have done it this year. I
was afraid my guys would chicken out this year.  
The genesis of it is we were such a bad shooting team that my first year I
thought the only way we had a chance is to send four guys to the boards, start
rebounding and make the missed shot our best offense. We beat a good team,
Arkansas. We beat Arkansas real early in the year, had 26 offensive rebounds.
Everybody started buying into it. Then we became a better skill team, a better
defensive team. But I was fortunate to have a Charlie Bell or Jason
Richardson. What I really did then is started to go to four guys to the
basket. We became a better rebounding team.  
Then one year when we had the championship year, in fact, we got beat by Ohio
State, I think the only team that out rebounded us, one of only two that year.
Figured we were getting a little stale. We won a lot of games. I told my
equipment man. Call Saban, ask him if I can borrow 10 sets of gear. I was all
mad about it when he got them. Matean Cleaves was on that team. Four Division
I football players on that team. They were having fun. I was mad they were
having fun. I wanted them to be angry about it. It was fun watching some of
our football guys 6'9" guys to wear shoulder pads, buckle a chin strap. A
couple didn't even know how to put a helmet on.  
It was kind of cool, kind of fun. If nothing else, when we have our mini
reunions, it always becomes the topic of conversation.  
  
Q. How do you think your team's toughness at this point does match up with
Pittsburgh's toughness?  
COACH IZZO: That's interesting. I was just talking to a couple coaches that
have been very good coaches out here. They think we're a lot tougher than I
do. I think sometimes I lose perspective of what we are because I'm used to
those teams with Richardson and Randolph and Cleaves and Hudson. I mean, those
were just -- although Pittsburgh had a couple of those teams as couple years
ago with those big guys that were, I mean, unbelievable.  
I don't think either teams, where they were. When I look at Pitt, I think
physically they look bigger and stronger than we are. We have a little height
advantage and maybe a little depth advantage. We're probably tougher than I
give us credit for. When I look at the matchup, I think if I was -- if it was
a boxing match and I was going by the tale of the tape, I don't think we win
that one right now. But that is the strength of their team. When you got a guy
like Blair in there or Biggs, height-wise not enormous, but girth-wise, they
are enormous.  
It will be interesting to see. I'll tell you more tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about how hard it is for a freshman,
especially a freshman big man, to succeed on this level? When you look at
Blair, what impresses you about what he's done?  
COACH IZZO: Looking at him impresses me (laughter). I look at him, I say, My
God, where do they grow those kind of guys? I want to get one.  
But he's big. He's strong. He's got great hands. He's got good feet. And I
think the big thing about him is he's not as physically bruising, meaning just
knock you on your tail. He does what I call wedging guys. He just moves his
body, and he does it very, very well. He's very good at using his body, not
his arms. To me that's another sign of a tough guy. A lot of guys that aren't
real tough always want to protect their body with their arms. He just moves
his body in there and it doesn't bother him.  
It is impressive what he's done in that league. He's gonna be a special
player, there's no question about it.  
  
Q. There's been so much talk about toughness. In the last however long
you've been there, have you ever lost a recruit, almost lost a player who
maybe envisioned himself as more skilled than tough and didn't want to come in
and put on football pads?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, you know, just make sure none of you are recruiting against
us. We do that two, three times every decade. It's not every week (laughter).  
But it's interesting you'd ask that because I think I've had one of the
greatest athletes that's ever played the game, one of, Jason Richardson, who
was not real big and strong and learned to become tougher and enjoyed that
drill. I always say if you want to play at the next level, you better learn
how to be tough because you're playing hurt at that level every day. I mean,
you got so many injuries.  
So, you know, smash-mouth toughness is not going to happen any more. The game
was more physical 10 years ago than it is now. But being tough doesn't just
mean you have to be 280 pounds. So I think, you know, this probably is getting
a little blown out of proportion. I think most teams are used to seeing us
five or six years ago, and even now, I think they're tough. You got a point
guard that's a bulldog tough kid. I think everybody looks at it that way. But
they're skilled, too. They're very skilled. And I think -- I don't think it
will be quite the shrug fest everybody thinks. It won't be Woody Hayes against
Bo Schembechler, three yards and a cloud of dust.  
You don't want to go underneath the boards not braced. I told my guy, low man
is going to win. You better be ready to be banged around. I don't think a
slugfest. I just think they do a good job of using their bodies, and hopefully
we do. It should be an entertaining game.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks very much, coach. Appreciate your time.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame student-athletes. We'll start with
questions, please.  
  
Q. Kyle, I'd like to ask you about Luke. We've seen him as a player, but go
a bit more in depth as kind of a goofball, if you would. Tell us the last time
you pulled a prank with the masks.  
KYLE McALARNEY: Uhm, yeah, he's a little bit of a prankster, a little bit of a
goofball. Just a fun guy to hang around with. Always looking to have a good
time.  
He's always the instigator of just trying to pull off, you know, a joke on
someone. Like I said, just trying to have a good time with a bunch of guys.
You know, with the mask thing, I think the last time we used it was a while
ago, probably around Halloween. We scared one of the freshmen, Tim Abromaitis.
Knocked on his window, stood outside his window with the masks on (laughter).  
What did he do?  
LUKE HARANGODY: Got a little scared. That was about it (smiling).  
  
Q. Are the masks on the trip? Did you bring them with you?  
LUKE HARANGODY: They did not make the trip.  
  
Q. Have there been any further pranks outside of the masks beyond that or
was that the end of it?  
KYLE McALARNEY: No, no. That's definitely not the end of it.  
  
Q. Is there something else you could tell us for publication in a family
newspaper?  
KYLE McALARNEY: At one team meal, we crushed up laxatives and put it in our
walk-on, Tim Andree's drink.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of the Washington State point guard?  
KYLE McALARNEY: I've watched them a couple times this season. They're a very
good team. He makes them go. He's very solid, under control, a very good
shooter. We're going to have our hands full.  
TORY JACKSON: I agree with Kyle. He's a great floor general. He know how to
lead his team. He's very tough. He know how to score.  
So, you know, we got to go out there and be ready to stop him. If we can stop
him, we've got a good chance.  
  
Q. If you happen to collide with Aron Baynes sometime tomorrow, would you
expect that impact to open a crack on the basketball court?  
LUKE HARANGODY: Yeah, no, from what I've seen of him, he's a big dude. 6'11",
270, it should be a good battle inside between him and me tomorrow. I think
he's such a strong fundamental player. It's going to be a challenge for me to
go up against him.  
  
Q. Rob, there's a story when Luke was a freshman, he was surprised he might
be put into the starting lineup. He said he felt out of his element battling
you the summer before. What did you see out of him when you first starting
playing against him? What have you seen in his growth?  
ROB KURZ: I think, first of all, any time a high school kid comes into a
college, is playing in the summertime, it's an adjustment period.  
We saw right from the beginning that he had a ton of potential, he was very
skilled, had great touch in the low post. It was just a matter of time before
he put it all together.  
A month into his freshman season, he was playing great. He was starting for
us. The rest is kind of history.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you describe what it was like for you to have to watch last
year's tournament. With the result, describe what that was like at the time,
what that did for you in the off-season and going through this season.  
KYLE McALARNEY: It was very hard. It was very tough to watch this team, you
know, get bounced out in the first round knowing that, you know, if I was
there, I could have helped them out a lot. It was tough. It was a tough time
for me, my family.  
But, you know, that's all in the past. You know, it's amazing how far you can
come in a year. Looking back now, you know, I'm so much more of a better
person and a better teammate. And I hope my teammates realize that. You know,
I think, you know, the fact that we got bounced out in the first round last
year really -- we really used that as motivation to stay more focused this
year and to focus on the goal and not be so wide-eyed being in the NCAA
tournament, but focusing on the goal, surviving and advancing.  
  
Q. Rob, you guys average 80 points a game. Washington State has given up 80
points one time this year. How patient do you have to be? Is that a concern
that you lose your patience against a team that is used to slowing the pace
down?  
ROB KURZ: You know, I don't think it's a concern at all. I think for us, we
have to make sure we get great shots on every possession because they like to
slow the game down. Every possession becomes that much more important.  
You know, we know they're a very good defensive team. But we've proven all
year long that we're one of the best offensive teams in the country. We just
have to make sure we do a good job of executing and getting great shots every
possession.  
  
Q. Kyle, where did you watch the game last year? Was there ever a thought
that you weren't going to come back to this team?  
KYLE McALARNEY: I watched it at my house, just on my couch.  
Yeah, I mean, when I first got suspended, I thought that, you know, I was
almost 99% sure that I wasn't going to come back here just off my emotions
alone.  
When Coach Brey visited me at my house, it really opened things up for me. If
he can come and set his emotions aside and stick his neck out for one of his
players, I just felt like, you know, if I set my emotions aside, what's the
best decision I can make for my future. You know, I really missed being with
the guys and enjoying the camaraderie in the locker room, everything like
that. You know, I just wanted to come back to this group of guys. It's a great
group. We're very close. We have a lot of fun together. On top of that, we're
a very good basketball team.  
Then I get to play for Coach Brey. All those factors put together is really
why I chose to come back.  
  
Q. Tory, can you talk about, certainly with Kyle out last season you matured
a lot in your game, can you talk about the benefits you got from that, then
the transition of having him out there with you.  
TORY JACKSON: Even though he was gone, it was still like he was a part of us.
We kept contact. We communicated a lot, you know, during the season. During
the post-season, we saw him actually during the Big East tournament when we
was in New York.  
We kept in contact with him a lot. And I felt like he was always there. The
advice he gave me, you know, helped me out a lot. He just told me to go out
there and play. You know, he took a lot of pressure off of me, just talking to
me, you know, kind of guiding me. Coach Brey did a good job of just bringing
me in the office every day, just telling me the pressure wasn't on me. He
helped me out. You know, he kind of put everything on him. If I made a
mistake, he kind of put it on him. It made it easier for me.  
That adjustment when Kyle left, it was a smooth ride. Now that he's back, I
mean, it's even easier for me, you know, to see him in the back court with me,
that takes a lot of pressure off of me. He can help bring up the ball, stuff
like that. So, you know, what happened last year, it made him better and it
made me better also.  
KYLE McALARNEY: I played against Tory when he first came in as a freshman.
More than anyone else, I knew how good he was and how ready he was to play the
game. It was just a matter of -- any time you're a high school guard, point
guard, coming into a college game, it's hard to adjust. It's only a matter of
time before you adjust to the speed of the game and make good decisions with
the ball and stuff like that. So I knew how good he was just playing against
him all summer. I was very confident when I left that, you know, he was going
to lead the team to have a lot of wins and hopefully to the tournament, which
he did.  
He did a great job. What he did last year was pretty amazing being a freshman
thrown into the fire like that. He deserves all the credit in the world for
that.  
But coming this year, I was so excited to get to play alongside him because,
you know, our games really complement each other really well. We have a
special bond off the court that really helps us on the court. He said I make
things easier for him. But in reality, he makes things, you know, a lot easier
for me. Sometimes I just feel like he knows where I am on the court and we
have that kind of connection. I think, you know, we're one of the strongest
backcourts in the country.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Good luck tomorrow.  
Joined by Notre Dame coach Mike Brey. Who wants to begin questions?  
  
Q. Almost all the games yesterday, yours included, one team went on a huge
run to take control and kept control from there. You had the huge run. Do you
have to kind of brace yourselves, with a five versus four matchup, I imagine
both games you're going to have to prepare for a slugfest, battle it out the
whole way.  
COACH BREY: I agree. We prepare and think about game situations, as we call
them, something we practice every day, you know, low clock, getting the ball
inbounds against pressure, when you're up, defending a three-point shot at the
end of the game. That's where my mind goes to now.  
It also goes that way because of the way our opponent plays, too. You know, as
far as really wanting to play halfcourt basketball.  
  
Q. You average 80 a game. They've given up 80 one time this season. Is that
a concern that your team will lose its patience? You say you don't ever want
to slow it down. Against a team like this, is it even more important that you
run?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I think it's important for us to run on makes and misses as
much as we can and not necessarily, you know -- doesn't mean we're necessarily
going to force the transition, but to make them change ends. I think one of
the advantages we had last night was our opponent was fatigued. I feel our
conditioning, we've been running all year, and certainly we're plugged into
this altitude thing now. I thought we really looked fresh running last night.
I think that could be an advantage for us.  
You know, we can play both ways. We've had to play slow and fast in our
league. We've had to adjust. I think that's what tomorrow is for us: playing
slow, playing fast, recognizing when it's becoming more halfcourt, and being
smart about it.  
  
Q. How important is tempo? Are you comfortable going halfcourt or full
court? How important is the team that dictates tempo?  
COACH BREY: I think we'll be comfortable either way. That's what we're
prepared for. We've talked about that. We want to be -- we want to try to get
some transition stuff because that's how we play. We've been in games in our
league, probably most recently St. John's, where we've had to grind at home 40
minutes, halfcourt defense, halfcourt offense. I thought we've concentrated
and not gotten frustrated and been focused. You know, you have to be patient
defensively, too, because they're methodical in what they do in their
halfcourt stuff.  
  
Q. What is it like coaching basketball at a school associated with the most
famous football team in the world?  
COACH BREY: Well, I mean, the one thing, I'm the biggest football fan on
campus. Notre Dame football is great for us in the fall. There's nothing like
those weekends to entertain recruits.  
I think the energy and the passion of basketball and football go hand-in-hand.
There's no question that the football season usually jump-starts our fan base.
But, you know, I think we both can be good. We've got a great all sports
program. You look at our Olympic sports, as well. But certainly I'm our
biggest football fan. There's no question about it when the Fall rolls around.  
  
Q. You were preaching rebounding and defense going into the George Mason
game. What is the message you're trying to get across to the guys now for
Saturday?  
COACH BREY: I don't want to get away from rebounding too much because it's
going to be even more of a challenge against this front line that Washington
State -- but rebounding I think's going to be a key for us. Their front line
is really physical. We have to be even better than we were last night. One of
the things rebounding did for us last night, it reminded our guys of how we
get to run if we rebound.  
I think we lost that a little bit in the last couple games in the Big East
tournament game.  
  
Q. From a matchup standpoint, is Weaver Washington State's Campbell?  
COACH BREY: Great comparison. That's what I talked about this morning. We went
over scouting. Very similar games. And a key to their team, like Campbell was
with Mason, Weaver for Washington State. Does many of the same things. He does
'em better. You know, he's bigger, he's longer. So he's even a tougher matchup
than Campbell, but very similar to their team and how he plays.  
  
Q. I'm wondering the Baynes versus Harangody matchup, how physical might
that be?  
COACH BREY: I think, again, we're going to have a lot of different bodies on
him, like we had on Thomas last night. You have to rotate guys. I thought we
did a good job between Kurz, Harangody, Zeller and Hillesland, rotating fresh,
big guys on Thomas. Baynes has got that Aaron Gray physical presence. That's
the comparison I made so our guys to relate to the body type. And you're not
going to have a lot of help down there because we can't really come down and
help you 'cause they're so good from the three-point line.  
  
Q. Did you notice any difference from the guys today leading into the George
Mason game?  
COACH BREY: Not really. I think we've been loose but focused and businesslike
about things. You know, certainly not satisfied, knowing we have a chance to
move on and play next weekend is something they're dreaming about earning.  
  
Q. Washington State's leading scorer, Derrick Low, 0-5 in the first half,
then 11 points in the first 10 minutes of the second half. Did the same thing
at UCLA. Is he a guy that you're concerned about as far as getting on a run
like that?  
COACH BREY: I think it starts with Derrick Low, your concerns about Washington
State, because of that right there. The explosiveness at any time. I think one
of the things that sets Washington State aside from a lot of other teams is
how old they are. They've got men that have been together for a while. He
certainly is one of them. And they never really panic. If they haven't made a
shot for 10 minutes or 12 minutes or 20 minutes, they keep doing what they do
every possession, every play. It's predictable, it's consistent. He's probably
the greatest example of being poised and waiting for his time.  
  
Q. You talked a lot last night with the game Zach and Tory had. How critical
will they be tomorrow? How much do you need them down the road in the
tournament?  
COACH BREY: They're very critical tomorrow. There's no question about it. Zach
Hillesland I thought was fabulous, not only defending Campbell but getting out
in transition and rebounding the basketball for us and even defending in the
post.  
Tory Jackson gives us a toughness, you know, every minute that he's out there.
He had a couple big rebounds. He had a key drive. Those guys are really key
guys.  
We're gonna need all eight of our guys in the rotation. It may only be a
couple minutes from a guy off the bench, but they've got to be really good
minutes to beat a team like Washington State.  
  
Q. Your impressions of the Washington State point guard and his defense?  
COACH BREY: Again, their maturity is what impresses me. These guys are old.
When you look down a roster and you see a senior, junior, senior, senior,
junior. You don't see any freshman. You see one sophomore in the rotation. You
know, they're excellent defensively as a team. I don't know if you would just
say they're great individual defenders and this guy's a lock-down guy.
Everything the Washington State program does, they do it as a unit really
well, offensively, defensively, help each other, count on each other. I think
that's why they've been so consistent.  
  
Q. Do you know any player that's given up a scholarship?  
COACH BREY: I haven't known anything like that. I'm going to ask two of my
guys to do that when I get back (laughter).  
Talk about taking one for the team. I mean, that's pretty powerful. But, you
know, it kind of tells you the makeup of this young man. I looked at his
travels. I believe he's from Tulane, correct? He came from Tulane. Now he's
found a spot. He is one of the better guards, not only in the PAC-10 but in
the country.  
When I looked at him, watching him a lot since last night, crafty. He's really
crafty.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington State student-athletes. We'll take
questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Daven, can you comment on what the last few days have been like for you.
Has it been pretty exciting? Do you have a lot of family around? Your thoughts
on being here?  
DAVEN HARMELING: It's been a lot of fun. Once I saw Denver come up on the
bracket, four seed, I was really excited to be back. My brother and my parents
are here. My uncle flew in. Got a lot of other family coming in and friends
that live around the Denver area. So it's just been an amazing experience. A
blessing to be back home. I think this is the first time I played back in the
state of Colorado since high school. So it's been awesome.  
  
Q. Can you all draw anything from defending John Brockman and Kevin Love
with defending Luke Harangody?  
TAYLOR ROCHESTIE: I got a lot of experience guarding those big guys, so I'll
answer it (smiling).  
I think that we just learned that some players like that are just relentless.
It's not about just trying to stop their first shot. You know, they're players
that are going to put it up and get their own rebound, put it back. It could
take five, six times. It's going to take a good team effort to stop such
tremendous big men like that that have such a great presence inside.  
DAVEN HARMELING: I echo what Taylor said. Playing in the PAC-10, we have
played against some great post-men, Brook Lopez, John Brockman, Kevin Love,
Taj Gibson, all those guys. Looking at Harangody on film, he's another animal.
He's a brut, like Taylor said, just relentless. Tremendous size and skill.
It's going to be a tough matchup. We've had other skill guys to go against all
year.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you walk me through your decision to give up your scholarship
for next year, what your thought process was in all that.  
TAYLOR ROCHESTIE: Yeah, sure. I answered this a couple times. But I think I've
been blessed my whole life, just given so many opportunities that maybe I'm
undeserving of. Just to be part of this program, be part of this team, be
given a chance from Tony Bennett, you know, when I was down, hurt, looking for
a school, you know, I feel like he gave me something that maybe I was
undeserving of, like I said. To be able to give something back to the program,
to my team, to the coaching staff, to all the Cougars out there, the alumni. I
feel so blessed to be in the position that I'm in.  
My parents have been looking for a way to give back to the program, support
the program. This just seemed like a perfect opportunity. I'm just happy and
fortunate that my parents are in a situation where paying for my fifth-year of
college is more of a blessing than a burden. I'm just happy to do it.  
  
Q. Can both of you give me a little bit of word association here with Notre
Dame, some thoughts that come to your mind when you hear the word "Notre
Dame"?   
DAVEN HARMELING: Wow, just a prestigious school. Just looking at them on film,
tremendous size, incredible ability by all of them to shoot the ball. They're
impressive. I'll be honest. They look really good. It's going to be a really
tough matchup.  
TAYLOR ROCHESTIE: I was sitting up with my parents watching the first half. I
asked them, Do we look that big when you guys are up here? I was watching
them. At every position they looked big. They're talented. Big men that can
move. They have a center, 6'11", coming off, shooting jump shots, squaring up
faster than I can. They're going to pose a lot of problems for us. We pride
ourself on defense, team defense. It's going to take five players to rally to
the ball and try to stop their talent.  
  
Q. Daven, who else recruited you? Did Division I schools in Colorado recruit
you? What sold you on Washington State?  
DAVEN HARMELING: Nobody really recruited me, to be honest (laughter). Denver
was the only -- DU was the only in-state school that offered me a scholarship.
Colorado State wanted me to walk-on after that and they told me I'd have a
scholarship after that. Indiana State, Long Beach State, Eastern Washington. A
handful of schools. I remember the first time Tony called me, he explained to
me what he was trying to do in Pullman with his dad. I was kind of speechless
when I got off the phone. The first thing he talked about was humility,
passion, (indiscernible), and thankfulness, those being the pillars of the
program. That really stuck with me. I was just impressed by his character, by
both Dick Bennett Sr. and coach Tony. I was thinking, man, if I could play for
guys like that, tremendous character, especially the other guys coming in
valued those same things, playing in the PAC-10, it's an opportunity I
couldn't pass up. I think it was those things that led me to Washington State.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, guys. Thanks very much for your time.  
We're joined by Washington State head coach Tony Bennett. We'll take
questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about sort of the philosophical basis for being methodical,
for being sort of patient and precise where other teams might get up and down
the floor more?  
COACH BENNETT: I think you always look at your team and you say, What gives
you the best chance to play against the best and be successful or initially at
least be competitive?  
You know, you look at the NBA playoffs, you look at a lot of the NCAA
tournament, a halfcourt game is required. You have to take advantages, take
the opportunities that are there to get out in the floor and go.  
But we haven't been able to out-recruit Arizona, UCLA with talent and just
play a wide-open game where we can kind of showcase that. We try to get kids
that fit our system. The bottom line is we feel that system gives us the best
chance to play, hopefully get to NCAA tournaments, advance, play against the
elite teams in our league and make runs.  
I think it's a very sound system. There's so many different ways to do it.
But, you know, the league, it's been interesting to see the change in the
PAC-10 over the years with Coach Howland coming in, my father, Tim Floyd,
Trent Johnson, Coach Montgomery, who I just did an interview with. You're
seeing a lot of that. I think some teams have advanced further because of that
in the PAC-10.  
  
Q. Can you speak to a couple things that Notre Dame does that worries you
the most?  
COACH BENNETT: They're such a potent offensive team. The way they run the
floor could have one of four or five guys that will grab the rebound and break
out. They really run the floor hard. Probably one of the more skilled teams
that I've seen with their size, their ability to shoot, catch and pass. Their
assist-to-turnover ratio is so impressive. We take pride in ours. They're
impressive. I don't know if they lead the NCAA in assists, but they've got to
be up there.  
They have a real versatile team and they can stretch the defense. I was trying
to think of a team in our league they're similar to. But there isn't one.
Oregon can do some things the way they play. When you see those kids spread
out around the three-point line, make plays off the dribble, share the ball,
fun to watch actually. I don't know about tomorrow, but very impressive. I do
think they run the floor as well as anybody and are very interchangeable,
which causes some matchup problems.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you saw in Taylor's game that made you want to
bring him to Pullman? Not a lot of guys give up scholarships. Can you tell me
what that says about the guy, what that means to the program?  
COACH BENNETT: First of all, he's a lefty. We know he's got a good start on
things (smiling). He's real competitive. He's a winner. We didn't have a
scholarship available after his senior year in high school. He played in some
AAU events in the spring. Our coaches saw him and said, I really like him. One
of my assistants said, He kind of reminds me, my teammate, Ben Johnson, he
reminds me of you Tony when you played. We're both lefties, had kind of
similar games. We didn't have a scholarship. Tulane jumped in. He had a really
good freshman here. He was first team all freshman when the Conference USA was
so strong with all those teams. Hit a number of game winners, a couple of game
winners that year, averaged like 10 points. Was just real solid.  
He showed at a high level he could do that. Then when Hurricane Katrina
struck, he had a really bad knee injury, dislocated his knee, had some
troubles, he decided he wanted to come to the West Coast. When he put that
word out, we just thought this kid could really fit our system.  
He's a winner. That's what his high school coaches have said about him, his
AAU coach. We were fortunate enough to get him. I think the addition of him,
there's no coincidence how our team, it's been everybody, but allowing a guy
like Derrick Low and Kyle Weaver to not play as much point guard, and Taylor
to take on those responsibilities, just his clutch plays have really given us
momentum and been part of our turnaround. Then the fact that he offered to
give up his scholarship, you know, he was excited about it. He said, You took
a chance on me when I was hurt and you didn't know about me. He says, This is
a chance for me to give back to the program. We have five principles in our
program we talk about. One of them is servanthood (sic). And said it's a
chance for me to be a true servant. He was genuinely excited about it. He said
I can let the guys know it's not about me, it's about the team. I want to try
to set up the future of this team. I really like the young man that's going to
get the scholarship. He hosted him on the visit. I can just see him being a
nice player in the future.  
He said I've been blessed with my family to be able to take care of this last
year. He speaks about him and his family, the kind of leader he is, the kind
of character he has. What a neat thing for our program.  
  
Q. Does Luke Harangody remind you at all of Kevin Love or John Brockman?
What kind of unique challenges does he present?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, we were trying to compare. Someone said he's kind of like
John, like Brockman, maybe even steps outside and plays a little more off the
dribble. But as far as their physique and how continuous they are, relentless,
that's some similarities there. The way he fights for position, like Love. But
probably more perimeter oriented than those guys. There are some similarities.
He's a tough matchup. I mean, obviously the Big East found that out. You can't
just key on him. They have other guys.  
I was so impressed with how he makes a play. He'll shoot a shot, miss it,
bang, he's back at the glass tapping it in. He'll start the fast break off a
rebound. He's so continuous. That's the thing you like. He never stops
playing. Very physical. Great footwork.  
Maybe more like Brockman than Love. I don't know, if you were going to pin me
down, I'd say that.  
  
Q. Any concern at all, you had such a huge second half yesterday, about
turning it around, making sure the guys keep that focus?  
COACH BENNETT: Certainly, you know, we tried to work hard in practice. A goal
of ours was to get to this spot again, where we were last year, to have a
chance to hopefully advance. Last year we were sitting there, getting ready to
play Vanderbilt. I think our kids learned a valuable lesson. We played well
but didn't come through. We told them to really think about that a lot.  
I think they know what's at stake. I think they're going to lay it on the
line. Whether we get it done or not, I wish I could answer that in a positive
way. I don't know. But I think they want this so bad, and that's been a
significant goal. Last year a lot of people thought it was going to be a one-
time thing, it would be too hard, we wouldn't be able to deal with the
expectations. They fought through that, we had a solid year and now we have a
chance to do something special.  
My hope is that their mental approach, our mental approach, will give them a
chance for preparation, and not dwell on a great second half against Winthrop.
It's a different ballclub. Obviously we're going to go against an elite team
and they'll have to play at their best.  
It's like the PAC-10. When you play a good team in the PAC-10, if you don't
play well, you lose. That's just how it was this year. So it's gonna be one of
those situations again.  
  
Q. You grew up in the Midwest. What comes to mind when hear the word "Notre
Dame," the whole mystique?   
COACH BENNETT: We were sitting there scouting the game. They played their
song. My assistant, who is from Iowa, we both kind of looked at each other and
smiled, said, Boy, that sounds familiar. I think Lou Holtz, you know, it's
obviously a very prestigious university. I think Washington State, they almost
had them beat in that football game four or five years ago, right, when we had
a chance. That comes to mind. A very storied program. A lot of great
basketball. Bill Hanzlik was my assistant coach when I played for the
Charlotte Hornets, a prominent Denver guy. I got to play for him. He always
talked a lot about Notre Dame. That's all I heard about.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you benefit from teams getting impatient and losing
poise? Does that happen a lot?  
COACH BENNETT: You know, when it's not us, yeah, we benefit from it. At times
it's happened to us.  
But you try to be as sound as possible. If you can have, you know, on the
defensive end, if we can be set and see people, you know, maybe take quick
shots or get impatient, that definitely plays into our hands. The same thing
offensively. If we can be sound.  
But we talked about it before. It's a balance. You still have to be
aggressive. You got to be patient, sound, but aggressive. So that's what we
talk about. A hard thing to master. But that's what we want. If we can see
teams doing that, that certainly helps us. That's always the goal. We just
talk about it, Make them earn on every possession. We didn't do that in the
first half against Winthrop. That's why there was some frustration there.  
  
Q. How long did it take you to get over the Vandy loss? Do you ever think
about it now?  
COACH BENNETT: That was a -- it was such a good year, a hard way to go out
because we felt we had that game. It was a double overtime game. My hope was
that it would give us the momentum going into this year, that we would learn
from it.  
I was so thankful for what transpired last year. I said, Can we learn from
this? Certainly, I still think about it. You got to have perspective. I mean,
I don't sit there and say, If only we could have matched up with Georgetown,
maybe it would have gone better. I don't get into that. It was hard right
after it.  
Once we took our Australia trip in the summer, that ended everything from last
year. It was all about this year. That was kind of -- I'm glad we did it in
June. We said, that's over. One of our kids wrote the score on his shoe just
to motivate himself, work out, that's about it. It hasn't lingered too much,
but hopefully we've learned from it.  
  
Q. It's two distinct systems. How important is tempo tomorrow in terms of
big picture?  
COACH BENNETT: I think it's important. If we let them get out, easy baskets in
transition, get running, it will be very difficult. I think that battle, who
can kind of settle into their game, I think will have an advantage. The way
they go, like I said, I don't know if we have anybody in our league quite like
them. We've talked about that as a staff, to try and have a set defense for
them to play against and make 'em earn it. I sound like a broken record.
That's all you can do against a team with that much skill.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the recruitment of Derrick Low. Not a lot
of players from Honolulu playing.  
COACH BENNETT: Derrick was obviously the best player to come out of the state.
One of my assistants, Mike Burns, who is our assistant, he had a friend who
told him about a real great player. I think we started recruiting Derrick when
he was a junior. He had some big schools looking at him. But once we saw some
tape on him, watched him at the my Nike Camp, saw him, I thought this kid
could really fit our program. He fit the program in terms of character. He
verbally committed without visiting our campus. That's a story that's been
told a few times.  
He was the first guy we got that, we beat some people on in a significant get
for us. We had a football player named Jason Gesser from Hawaii who was part
of the turnaround for Washington State football, led them to the Rose Bowl. We
said, Derrick, this is a chance for you to come in here. You're going to have
the opportunity to play as a freshman and turn this thing around. And he
really bought into that. He didn't care about the surroundings. He just wanted
to be around people he was comfortable with, had a chance to play in an elite
league. He said, I'll commit. We said, Hey, if you come here, hate it on your
visit, we'll let you out of your commitment.  
We took him to the finest beaches in Pullman, so everything was okay
(smiling).  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
COACH BENNETT: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+DENVER)

### [Keith Benjamin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18112)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Ronald Ramon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18113)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Pittsburgh student-athletes. We'll take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You have four or five days to prepare for the first game. What is the
biggest challenge today, last night, tomorrow morning getting ready for that
second game?  
RONALD RAMON: Just making sure we stay focused. Making sure that we don't have
as many days to come out and be prepared for them, as we did for the last
game.  
But, you know, just making sure we know the plays that they running, the
things we want to do defensively, just being patient on offense.  
KEITH BENJAMIN: Same things Ronald said. Just refocusing, uhm, going over your
scouting reports real hard, paying attention to every little detail you could
pick up. Just trying your hardest to get ready for the next night, being ready
to play basketball again.  
  
Q. We just spent about 45 minutes talking to Michigan State about how tough
and physical they are, how tough and physical you are. When people label you
and your program like that for years and years, does that ever almost come as
a slight because they're tough and physical because they can't do X, Y and Z,
other kind of skills? Or are you good with that?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: I mean, we fairly good with it. Uhm, the label is just a label
to us. We feel like we're tough and physical. But, uhm, we feel like this is a
year that we've added a lot to just being tough and physical. We have a skill
set. We have a lot of, uhm, things that we can do outside of just being tough
and physical. But that's just our bread and butter. That's how we play. That's
how we approach every game. We try and do the little things to help us win.
The tougher physical things are the things to help us win.  
RONALD RAMON: Just like he said, it started when Brandon Knight was here,
Jaron, Julius Page, they went out and competed every single time. Played
tough, physical basketball. We've been carrying it on since we got here.
That's one of the things that coach emphasizes, going out there and playing
tough.  
  
Q. Do you think his first game that he was feeling a little bit of the
nerves, and he'll have a better performance tomorrow?  
RONALD RAMON: I don't think we worry about DeJuan. He's a good player,
especially a team player. He's competitive. He wants to compete every single
night. He know he didn't have a good game yesterday.  
But, you know, he lets the game come to him. He just waits and be patient. He
knows when the team needs him, he gonna show up. He's going to do the little
things we need him to do, not just scoring-wise, rebounding, screening,
getting guys open.  
KEITH BENJAMIN: For DeJuan, it wasn't nerves. He just has to realize we're
outside of the Big East Conference now. A couple of the plays that you could
bang on inside our conference, you can't do that in these tournaments. You get
different refs from all over the country. He got called early for a couple
fouls. I think he'll bounce back from it. He's always there when we need him
the most. When we play big, tough, aggressive, physical big men that we're
going to play tomorrow, DeJuan always seems to show up. We're not too much
worried about his first game. That game is past him and past us. He'll be
ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Give your impressions of the Michigan State team and also talk about the
player you're likely to be matched up with tomorrow.  
KEITH BENJAMIN: My impression on them is, uhm, they're very quick, aggressive,
physical team. Their guards are very quick. Their big men are tough on the
inside. They do a lot of things well. They screen very well for their guards.
They do a lot of things well. They have a lot of sets. That's going to be the
hardest thing to get down. They run a play every time out there on the court
that's not just a freestyle of basketball, they're always ready to run their
sets. The guy I'll probably be matched up with tomorrow will probably be
Raymar Morgan. We know he's very physical, very aggressive, leading scorer,
great rebounder. I'll have to keep him off the glass, do a lot of things that
a 6'2", 6'7" guy shouldn't be able to but I'm going to have to get it done. My
team is looking for me to step up to the challenge and I'm ready to step up to
the challenge.  
RONALD RAMON: I think Michigan State is a tough, smart, patient team. They run
a key set, they run a lot of plays, a lot of offense. Their offense is mostly,
you know, they rely on their guards. They always push the ball down, even on
make or misses. They try to push it.  
I'll be mostly guarding Drew Neitzel tomorrow. He's a player that comes off
the screen, creating for guys, a lot of screens. There will be a lot of
trailing the screens and just make sure our team defense is there being in the
gaps.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you.  
Joined now by Pittsburgh head coach Jamie Dixon. We'll take questions for
Coach Dixon.  
  
Q. Coach, Tom Izzo has a great track record of advancing past the second
round once he gets his team there. What do you find being the biggest
challenge of that second game on a weekend?  
COACH DIXON: We've gone through that before. We've been in situations like
that before. Again, we just played in the Big East tournament. We had 24 hours
to get ready and sometimes less.  
I think obviously I have more familiarity with Big East teams and what they
do. I think we've gotten a lot done and actually playing an early game and
then a late game, I think we have probably a little bit more preparation and
rest than what normally might be the case.  
Feel good. I mean, it's a team we're familiar with because we've seen them on
TV. I think that's also something that -- you know, that makes you know what
they're doing and are more familiar with them. Again, a lot of the kids
recruited as well.  
Very familiar with their team. Once you get to this point, most teams are
pretty familiar with one another because they're on national TV so much.  
  
Q. In terms of the approach to winning, how much of your program do you see
in Michigan State? Is it easier or more difficult to face a team that's like
you?  
COACH DIXON: Well, I mean, I think everybody knows, Coach Izzo, how much
respect we have for their program, and Michigan State, friendship that I have
with Coach Izzo. We've copied a lot of things that they've done over the
years, plays, sets, different philosophies. You know, I don't mind saying
that.  
But I guess that's a sign of respect. You know, they're one of the few teams I
think with us that have been to the NCAA tournament the last seven years. So
we're familiar with all the things they've done.  
I think we're, again, familiar with them because of that.  
What was the other part?  
  
Q. Is it easy to get your team ready to play a team that's like you or more
difficult?  
COACH DIXON: You know, I think they're like us in a lot of ways. Every team's
different. I think their basic philosophies are the same with the rebounding
and the defense. But they're different. Having a Neitzel compared to other
years when they don't have a Neitzel, a guy that can shoot it for him. So they
run it a lot for him, maybe not their inside guys. That's probably a little
bit different.  
You know, I think there's differences. But, again, once you get to this time
in the NCAAs, all the teams are going to be able to rebound, they're going to
be able to defend, and they're going to be good programs. I think it's
exciting. I think for our guys, you know, they want to obviously keep playing
like everybody else does. I think they're more familiar with the bigger names.
They like playing the bigger names, the bigger conference teams, and other
teams we haven't played. Obviously we've played a lot of big teams, non-
conference games as well. We haven't played Michigan State. Our guys always
want to play the top teams.  
  
Q. On Wednesday I think you were kind of jokingly saying that everybody
calls you physical. You said, That gets overplayed. Sometimes there's a little
contact, but... The question is whether you were kidding or not, does this
thing of you being physical, which seems to come up every time you get into
any kind of national scene, does it get to a point where it almost takes away
from the other things that your program is? Does that ever hurt you out on the
recruiting trail or with players that have you in the program?  
COACH DIXON: It's interesting. I do joke about it a little bit. But, I mean,
it's also true. I think any team that comes from Pittsburgh and has success,
coming from the Steelers, people think of them, they're always going to be
known as physical, defense. So I think it's something we've had all along.  
But at the same time we have been good on the defensive end. But if you look
at our stats over the years, we always shoot a high field goal percentage,
we're always amongst the league leaders in assists. We're amongst the league
leaders in our country I think. Last year we led the country in assists to
turnover ratio. So we do a lot of good things on the offensive end. Again, I
think it becomes a story that kind of builds upon itself.  
I would say consistently over the years that has been a strength of ours, our
physicality, our defense. Again, I think all teams have to do that to be
successful. I think really you have to be good and you have -- you have to be
good on the defensive end to be good. I think if they're not saying it, then
you're probably not winning games.  
So if that's part of it, that's fine. It's more about our positioning, you
know, awareness and anticipation. I think that's what makes us a good
defensive team and what has made us better as the year has progressed.  
  
Q. Tom was talking about the famous war drill. When you actually have enough
players to practice, do you have anything that resembles that?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, we have. I don't know exactly their drill.  
  
Q. Throw a ball up.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, it's kind of similar to what we have. We have called it war
drill. I didn't -- I was trying to get away from that physicality, that
reputation. So I just called it the two-on-two blockout drill. We used to call
it the war drill. So I guess names can change everything.  
But it's the same deal. It's a free-for-all. And, like I said, we got away
from that drill this year with the injuries. But we brought it back once we
got enough guys out there to do it.  
  
Q. How do you define toughness in a basketball sense?  
COACH DIXON: I think it comes down more to mental than physical. You hear
about different things. But I look at it as a number of things. It's
physicality and banging with people, not being afraid of contact.  
But also just getting through adversity. I think in a lot of ways, that's
where we've shown our mental toughness more so than anything this year with
the things that have happened to our guys, and things that guys are playing
through. We have guys playing through numerous injuries that are in addition
to the three guys that are out for the season, Levance being out for eight
weeks. So that's what I define as toughness. Toughness is doing everything you
can defensively and doing everything right, then they hit a shot, they still
score on you, they make a tough shot, and toughness to me is coming back and
believing and doing it the next time with the same intensity, the same
awareness, and the same commitment, coming out after you've had a setback,
after they beat you, coming back and responding the next time. That's to me
what toughness is.  
  
Q. Talk just a little bit about the influence of Ben Howland on you.  
COACH DIXON: You know, I mean, I always talk, first, we're really friends.
Probably more so than anything, that's what we are is friends first. It goes
back to, you know, we never -- I think a lot of people, when an assistant has
been a coach under someone, that's all they know him as. He recruited me out
of high school, when he was a struggling assistant, let's say a -- not a
program that was doing very well. So I know him from that point. I know I was
an assistant with him. Our families are best friends. I think of him first as
that, we're friends first. That's really what I look at him as.  
We went through the struggles together. We built programs together. He became
the head coach, I was the assistant coach. So we kind of learned and changed
completely what we did when we first got there. What we brought from Santa
Barbara from Northern Arizona didn't work. We struggled. We won six games, we
won eight games. We had to adjust, learn and listen, try to find what would be
better. And then when we got to Pittsburgh, we had to do the same thing,
because we struggled there as well initially.  
That's kind of how I look at it. Again, I think the most important thing is as
a friend first, a family friend. To me that's the most important thing.  
  
Q. Tom was saying he doesn't think the game will be quite the "slugfest"
we're making it out to be. Do you think it will be?   
COACH DIXON: If the referees -- listen, we won't do any slugging. We'll play
clean and we won't foul at all.  
I think, to me, when you get down to this level, there's big bodies out there,
there's bigger people out there. There's going to be stronger people. It's
just going to become more of a halfcourt game in these tournament games. So it
just becomes more contact in a smaller area. It's not up and down because just
the caliber of play. They're not going to give up transition baskets. We're
not going to give up transition baskets. And that's just the challenge that we
face.  
We've got to be able to play in the halfcourt once you get to this time in the
NCAA tournament. You've got to be able to execute.  
But I doubt they're going to back down and I know we're not going to back
down. So I think that's probably been indicative of both of our programs over
the years.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Ronald has gone through this year?  
COACH DIXON: He's still playing point guard. I think he's played point all his
life. You know, I think it's been talked about a lot. It's not like he's
unprepared for it or hasn't done it before. His assist-to-turnover ratio for
his career has been outstanding. That hasn't changed at all. I was looking
forward, we've always pretty much played with two point guards on the floor at
the same time, when Carl was here, Levance, Ronald, we had three point guards.
They're interchangeable. We came into this year talking about our guards being
interchangeable with Keith, with Bradley, Levance and Ronald could play the
one, two, and sometimes the three. I think it really helped us because of the
injuries and things that occurred. I think that was something that actually
helped us. We had practiced for these situations for two months prior. Then
when the injuries occurred, of course, we didn't want to, were unfortunate, we
had guys that actually had to play the positions they played and played with
each other, and the adjustment was looked I think -- I think looked to be like
a monumental task to the outside, but, again, I talked about it, we had done
-- we had prepared for something not quite like this, but for one guy to go
down maybe for a short period of time, not four guys. Those are things you
hope to prepare for.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

### [Travis Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16992)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Michigan State University. Coach, if you want to
just begin with some general comments on the game.  
COACH IZZO: Well, if you would have told me that Drew and Kalin would have
gone four for, whatever, 17, 18, I thought we'd be in trouble. But I think the
credit goes to maybe Drew's defense, Kalin's defense, Travis's defense,
Raymar's all around play. I think he did some things, got us going early, made
some plays, got some big rebounds.  
The defensive job we did on Christmas, you know, I think Christmas had some
shots, just like Drew did, they just didn't fall today. I think he's a heck of
a player, boy. But we did a heck of a job on him. We couldn't quite contain
Tyndale down the stretch. But I thought defensively for the most part we were
as good as we've been in a long time.  
Offensively our execution was very good. We just missed some shots. I was very
pleased with both ends of the court.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Raymar, you seemed really aggressive early on. Was that partly because
you felt in the Big-10 tournament you were a little passive?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: Definitely. I think my teammates did a great job in getting me
the ball, places where I could create and make plays.  
I just tried to stay aggressive throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. Raymar, it looked like you were on Christmas for a good portion of the
game. Talk about your mindset about how you played him.  
RAYMAR MORGAN: I just tried to press up on him a little bit. Keep a hand in
his face. He's a great shooter. He can shoot from deep. I also have to thank
my teammates. We used six eyes, which about three players contain one player.
We did a great job overall team-wise for defense.  
  
Q. Drew, talk about what was going through your mind when you weren't
getting shots or not scoring in the first half. Any disappointment at not
lighting it up the way you did the last couple?  
DREW NEITZEL: Well, as a shooter, you always want to make shots.  
But coming out of the game, I had some open shots early, first five minutes of
the game. They just didn't fall. Then they started tightening up on me, taking
me away a little bit. That's when we made some adjustments and those slips to
the basket were wide open. Our big guys got some open dunks in there. The
coaching staff did a great job of making some adjustments.  
As a shooter, you just got to keep shooting, keep your confidence. I'm glad we
won so I get another chance to redeem myself on Saturday.  
  
Q. Drew, can you talk along those lines about you having a more balanced
scoring attack this year?  
DREW NEITZEL: I think it showed today, whether it was Raymar, everybody
stepped up. Our big guys inside, everybody made plays, made some baskets. Our
freshmen played extremely well for their first NCAA tournament game.  
It's just been a great team effort. If I'm having a bad game, somebody a lot
of times is picking up the slack. I think that's a bonus and something that
can help us make a deep run in this tournament.  
  
Q. Drew, your coach has had a lot of great runs going through the NCAA
tournament. What does he do to get you prepared for this thing special?  
DREW NEITZEL: I don't know. I just think he has that experience. And you can't
take that away or anything. He just does a great job. You know, he's had a
plan, and it's worked throughout the years, so he doesn't change it.  
You know, the players that have been in the program get that experience and
they help the younger guys out. It's just a process that goes down the line
year after year. You know, he does a great job, the coaching staff does a
great job of scouting, preparation for the games. That's where I think we pick
up a lot of ground.  
  
Q. There have been times this year where Drew has had off nights and no one
else has picked up the slack. How crucial was this game for you knowing he had
an off night and everybody else stepped it up?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: Well, it was really crucial. If nobody else picks it up, we
gonna lose. I think it was very important for other people to just step up,
keep encouraging Drew, keep shooting, things of that nature.  
But it was just an overall team effort.  
TRAVIS WALTON: Yeah, you know, when Drew ain't shooting as well, you know, he
do different things for us, you know, as far as making the pass, you know, for
the slips, or playing great defense like he did today.  
And, you know, Raymar step up, our freshmen step up and make big plays for us.
Some of our bigs come down and make free throws for us, make shots. That's why
we a team.  
  
Q. Christmas came in averaging 20 a game, Tyndale about 16, 36 points a
game. You held them to two in the first half. Talk about how that set the tone
for the game and the emphasis on it coming into this one?  
TRAVIS WALTON: First off, our coaches do a great job of scouting other team.
We know all they plays, tendency of what they like to do. Our teammates do a
great job of helping. We have six eyes on him. Raymar started up on him and
did a great job and then Kalin and Drew, you know, so every player we had did
a great job on him. Our bigs did a great job, when they did attack us,
protecting the rim, making the shots tough for them. They're two great
players. Today was an off night for Christmas at the end, Tyndale kind of got
it going.  
  
Q. Even though you have gone through a full season conference tournament and
all that, you are a pretty young team. It was their first NCAA tournament
game. Did you talk to them about what to expect? What was that process like
getting ready for it?  
DREW NEITZEL: Yeah, I definitely shared my experiences with everybody on the
team. You know, I've been in every situation in this tournament, starting in a
Final Four to going out in the first round.  
I just talked about, you know, focusing on the details. Every little thing is
magnified in this tournament. It comes down to the little things. Every
possession matters. The free throw, turning the ball over. Just try to talk to
them, get through the sense of urgency you have to have and the focus coming
into this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. We'll let you go.  
Questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. How important were the freshmen today? Did Allen and Summers earn more
time or did you go into this game expecting to give them more time?  
COACH IZZO: A little bit of both. Didn't want to talk about the altitude,
didn't want to talk about the 10:30 in the morning. But we did want to talk
about their two players, Tyndale and Christmas, playing 37, 38 minutes a game.
We thought if we could keep some pressure on them, wear them down a little
bit, keep playing some guys, that would work to our advantage.  
They did play very well. You know, Kalin, all those guys did a better job,
like Travis said. Even though Kalin and Drew weren't shooting as well, they
did some things, and that's how we got some of those open buckets.  
Thought Neitzel was the best he's been defensively. Lucas did a pretty good
job defensively, too. You know, for Allen and Summers, those guys haven't been
stalwart defenders. I thought they did a better job. Maybe they got the
message we gave them and they gave them, it's one-and-done time, and things
have to change.  
  
Q. Drew put you guys on the shoulders in the Big-10 tournament. How
important was this that everybody else stepped up?  
COACH IZZO: I'm feeling bad for him because he's been shooting it so good. His
confidence at such a high level. I thought we had some good shots early. I did
think their defense got better as it went, too. He's been making all those
shots.  
So, you know, a little concerning. It was nice to get Raymar off. We tried to
post him up early, tried to do some different things. When you play teams that
know every piece of gum you chew, it's a little bit better, a little easier. I
just thought it was so important that we got some other guys playing. Walton
did his job, you know, milking free throws. Some show up in the stats, some
don't. But there were nine or 10 guys that were responsible for this win.  
  
Q. Talk about the ball movement offensively and also the poise against the
press late in the game.  
COACH IZZO: Well, I did think we did a great job of moving the ball early. We
were getting an extra pass. We started off the second half with a back door. I
thought Drew was going to get it. He dumps it to Naymick. We looked like a
basketball team, 19 assists, 26 baskets. That says a lot about your team. You
know, after that debacle at Ohio State when we turned the ball over 20 some
times against their press, I think we've done a much, much better job. The
players have done, but maybe some of the blame has to go to me there. We have
spent more time on it and we're doing a better job against it.  
  
Q. Back to that very first possession, you went down to Raymar in the post.
Trying to build some confidence and get him going early after the rough games
he had?  
COACH IZZO: We thought two things. Number one, we get the ball in there to
him. We thought one of those two guys, Tyndale or Christmas, would be on him,
and maybe we could get them in foul trouble. We did want to go in there. It
was a great play, great feed by G, a very good shot by Raymar.  
  
Q. Raymar mentioned the six eyes defense. Can you explain that a little bit.
Was Raymar the main guy on Christmas for most of the game?  
COACH IZZO: He was. Travis did some work on him, too. Even Drew did, too, a
little bit.  
The six eye, a takeoff of the Jordan rules. He gets the ball, the Pistons did
such a good job of kind of putting a guy on him. They had their own rules. It
was just something we stole from somebody. We did steal that from the Pistons.
We've used it for three or four years on prolific scorers that also are good
penetrators. They get to the line and we felt like keeping them off the line
was really important. And that's why a couple of plays we made that were fouls
off the ball were really upsetting because we knew they're a 75, 76% free-
throw shooting team. Actually missed a few more today than they normally do.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the play of your big men. Naymick played a big role,
Suton. How important were they today to your win?  
COACH IZZO: I have to watch what I say. Those two guys were pretty good at
times. A different planet a couple times. You know, they did a pretty good
job.  
But we have to have improvement there. G early was really struggling. He did
rebound. But, you know, another missed layup or two, just some turnovers. I
didn't think that was the strength of our game. But Naymick did a lot better
job the second half, rebounded better. G did rebound pretty well. Naymick got
a lot of his on those slip plays.  
Made some progress. Got some work to do.  
  
Q. For those people out here who haven't seen you play before, were
impressed with your defense, can you talk a little bit about where you base
your defensive philosophy from, where did you get it at?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, I just listen to everybody. I've been around guys
that won championships, like Larry Brown, of course Chuck Daly. You know, I'm
a big football fan. You watch all those teams that win championships. They're
always the best defensive teams.  
The philosophy I probably got from Judd Heathcoat. We're going to play solid.
We don't press a lot and trap a lot. We're just a very solid defensive team
usually. We've done a pretty good job all year, the last two years, in fact,
if not for turnovers, I think we'd be maybe one of the best around. Sometimes
turnovers lead to those layups.  
I mean, Judd definitely one. Then the guys that won championships, you know,
had so much success in our state, like Chuck and Larry Brown. You just kind of
see what they do.  
The Pistons, when I was first there with Joe Dumars and those guys, they were
an unbelievable defensive team. They were very physical. I just loved the way
they played, got the six eyes from Daly. He probably doesn't even know it.
Again, like all coaches do, we steal from anybody that we can.  
  
Q. Did something happen to Marquis in that first couple minutes?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah (smiling). To be honest with you, we didn't even know if
Marquis could play today. He has a bad sprained toe. He didn't practice
yesterday. He's had something.  
But we told him if he can't get to the offensive boards, we just can't play
him, because that's his strength. First couple times he didn't get there. Not
all his fault, to be honest with you. He has been injured in the last three
days. I don't think it's broke, but it's badly sprained. So hopefully we can
get him some rest and get him back. We are going to need another body when you
see these guys play.  
  
Q. You've touched on it a little bit. Could you just address a little more
how much of a positive it is to have a win like this when Neitzel is not on?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think it's really important. It's important for our
present and our future.  
But don't kid yourself, Drew Neitzel is still very valuable in different ways,
how they played him, what they did. We are going to need him if we're going to
get anywhere in this tournament past the first game.  
But at the same time I think it's really good because he was still a
cheerleader in the huddle. Down that he's missing some shots. He thought some
of them were open shots. But at the same time you got to give them credit.
They did a pretty good job second half.  
So, you know, getting our young freshmen some more, Raymar more involved,
Naymick, some of our big guys a little bit more involved, that's going to do
nothing but benefit us.  
  
Q. You mentioned this being the one-and-done situation, but also said some
things have to change. What are you referring to that you wanted your team to
be doing better?  
COACH IZZO: Our bigs early were not very good. They've got to be better. G, I
don't know, he was just kind of out of it early. We got him in and out, in and
out. We've got to do a better job there. I think we got to do a better job of
finishing games still. I mean, we finished it. I think you got to give them a
lot of credit. Fran is just a hell of a coach. Those kids, I really enjoyed
talking with a few of them. But watching them play. We knew they'd come back.
Anybody can shoot the threes. I didn't think we handled some situations. We
got it a across in the press, about you a couple of them were real close
calls, maybe took some shots when we shouldn't have. But we had three freshmen
in there at one time. Can't blame them.  
So, you know, there were some things I think we can learn, and it's always
good if you can learn after a win compared to learning after a loss.  
  
Q. You mentioned as good a defense as you have played in a while. Where did
it come from? Is it time of the year? Emphasis, necessity?  
COACH IZZO: It was Christmas. We knew if we didn't guard Christmas, we were
going home is what it was.  
I was so impressed. I wouldn't have called them beating us a big upset because
I don't think there are major upsets right now, 1 through 12, they are a 1 but
3 through 12, that's a very good Temple team.  
We knew one way they can beat you for sure is with the three. We had to do a
better job up top. That's where we gave up some early. I thought their kid
inside did a pretty good job early, Olmos. We just knew we had to defend.
We've gotten to the point where we aren't as consistent offensively. We're
still shooting the ball pretty well, but not as consistent. I think the
players realize in one-and-done time, you got to make sure you cover all
bases.  
Like I said, in closing, I really think we played well, but I really think we
beat a very good team that didn't play as well. They didn't make some shots
that I think I've seen them make on film.  
I know that happens to us. But that's gonna be a great team in the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.  
COACH IZZO: Thank you.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you want to begin with some general thoughts on the
game.  
COACH PEELE: We first of all want to congratulate Washington State. I thought
certainly in the first half we were -- really I thought we were in control of
the game. The end of the first half it was 29-All. In terms of execution, you
know, we did some things where, you know, we laid the ball in. I mean, they
struggled guarding some of our actions. Some of those actions, we see that
when we go outside the league.  
The biggest thing in that first half was, you know, we got hurt some by
guarding the dribble. We got beat on the dribble. But quite honestly, then
when we got to the second half, to start the second half, either the first
four shots that we got were threes. They were good looks. They just didn't --
they just quite honestly didn't go down for us.  
We got frustrated. What happened is, you know, sometimes when you have teams,
and we've got a lot of new guys, when you struggle to score, it shows up on
your ability to defend. And it showed up for us tonight, especially in the
second half.  
But with that being said, you know, I just want to tell everybody here, and I
told, you know, our seniors in the locker room, there's a lot of ways I can
go. Quite honestly, the way that I'm gonna go is, is that I've got two seniors
right here, Chris Gaynor and Taj McCullough. I've got Mike Jenkins in the
locker room who is a senior. I've got Antwon Harris who is a senior, who has
been with us for two years. And for Chris and Taj and Mike, we've won four Big
South Conference regular-season championships and four Big South Conference
tournament championships. We've made four straight trips to the NCAA
tournament.  
For that, you know, I thanked them in the locker room. I'm so proud of 'em.
Didn't go out the way we wanted. But I think one of the things, one of my
obligations is to take care of them. And I am very proud of them. I'm proud of
what they've done at Winthrop University. It's been a pleasure to have coached
them.  
You know what, these young men right here to me embody what the NCAA student-
athlete is all about.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach. Questions for the next few minutes for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Is Washington State different on the floor than they might have looked on
film?  
CHRIS GAYNOR: Well, for me on film, everybody looked huge. You know, I'm only
5'10" with heels on really (smiling). But when you get out there, I was really
looking, you know, most of their guards eye level. I was able to get off some
good looks because of that. On film, they look huge.  
The pace of game, you know, is what I saw on film. I mean, other than their
size, Weaver looked huge on film, and Cowgill, he looked shorter than what he
was. I got next to him, he was a giant. So the size was the only thing
different that I saw.  
TAJ McCULLOUGH: Well, on film, they looked big. Actually, the biggest one was
Baynes to me. He looked big on film. Actually playing against him, he was a
lot bigger than I thought. He was a wide body down low trying to help out on
Charles. Other than that, everybody was pretty much the size I expected them
to be.  
  
Q. What did Cowgill change defensively on you in the second half? You got
some easy stuff in the first half. Second half, not so easy.  
TAJ McCULLOUGH: He kind of backed off in the gaps more so the drive
opportunity wasn't as easy as it was early on. I think we kind of got out of
what we were doing in the first half, like spacing out and getting some back
screens and ball screens to put him in situations that we did in the first
half. We just got away from it in the second half.  
  
Q. How frustrating was that second half? Nothing was going down.  
CHRIS GAYNOR: It was very frustrating. I can't remember who I told this
yesterday. But it felt like the Davidson game. You know, we played good
defense, in my eyes, except for the second half, they hit everything they put
up. We come down on our end, we get great looks. It's rimming in and out. That
starts to wear on you. Throughout the half, when it got down close to it, we
needed points. So I was just looking to shoot.  
  
Q. One of the Washington State guys said they took it as a challenge to see
where you were stuck on 29 and 34. Did you look at the scoreboard, too, and
think how long it could go on?  
TAJ McCULLOUGH: Yeah, I kind of glanced up there. I was like, Man, we're stuck
on 29. I was like, we need to get something inside. Coach got us on that. We
took a couple shots outside, got out of doing what we were doing in the first
half, which was getting inside, getting some easy layups off our sets. The
sides we were taking were good looks, but it was like there was a lid on the
basket and they was bouncing out. We just stopped executing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. We'll continue with questions for Coach Peele.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about Derrick Low, your concern about his ability as
a shot-maker. In the first half today, you held him scoreless. Did you feel
pretty good about that or did you have a feeling in the second half he might
get on track like he did?  
COACH PEELE: We told our team at halftime that Derrick Low scores two-thirds
of his points in the second half. That's been his pattern. And so what we did
was, I mean, really there wasn't an adjustment to be made because he hadn't
scored.  
The thing that he does is, from my standpoint, we try to guard him with a
bigger guy. I think he's about 6'1". Personally I think the way to defend him
is with size and length. One of the things he does really, really well, you
really see it once you're on the floor, he has an ability to make you come out
of your stance. When he does that, you're in trouble.  
I told our guys the first half, you know, he'll have the ball in his hand,
he'll raise up. When he raises up, if you raise up with him, you're going to
get beat. But he's a very good player. I have great respect for him. In terms
of the guys that concerned me the most, I mean, in terms of the ultimate
compliment, the best defender in our league, in my opinion, is Mantoris
Robinson. I put Mantoris Robinson on him. That tells you, he's got great pace
with the ball. He cuts hard. I think he's an outstanding player.  
  
Q. Did their putting Rochestie on Jenkins surprise you? Was that a matchup
you weren't expecting?  
COACH PEELE: No. You know, this game, I mean, you've seen us. You know, our MO
is when Mike -- if Michael is not making shots, you know, our team has a
tendency to struggle.  
I felt like in the first half, you know, we played without him for 12 minutes,
I thought we were in great shape. But the flipside of it is, is internally I
think he was very frustrated. I think it showed. I think it just showed. He
played the entire second half through frustration. I mean, the first play of
the second half, we ran a set, and it was wide open. It was actually a set we
stole from Washington State. Every time we ran it , was wide open. I even
called it Cougar. I mean, how crazy is that?  
But you know what? I feel bad for Mike, the way he went out tonight. It's just
-- I really feel sad for him.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the altitude affected your team at all? Did you prepare
for it at all?  
COACH PEELE: I mean, I don't know how you prepare for it. I mean, I made light
of it and said, Don't worry about it, because we're going to play inside. It
was a joke. I don't want you to think...  
I mean, in the second half, quite honestly, we looked gassed. You know,
there's a couple things that I would say to you. One, I mean, my staff and I
worked very hard. I mean, we watched tape into the midnight hours last night,
about 1 in the morning. Our bodies are on 3:00 eastern time. One of the things
I said to my staff is, In order to beat Washington State, the one thing I'm
going to tell you you have to do, is you have to shoot the ball well to beat
'em. And the reason is, for the media that are with Washington State, one of
the things that I think is tremendous that they do is they have 331 turnovers
in 32 games. They turn the ball over 10 times. They turn the ball over 10
times today. They just don't ever beat themselves. If you don't step up and
really make shots from the perimeter, then I think you're going to have a hard
time beating 'em.  
You know, they had 29 baskets today on 20 assists, which is quite a number. I
guess I'm rambling. In answer to your question, I haven't had enough
experience playing in Colorado to answer it. I mean, maybe. Maybe. I just know
that we didn't defend. You know, they shot 59% for the game. We're ranked 13th
in the country in defensive field goal percentage.  
  
Q. What would you think the odds would have been for somebody to shoot 59%
on you?  
COACH PEELE: Man, I don't know. You know, we worked on it very hard. They're
very good offensively. One of the things that they do is, you know, they have
their sets, but they cut so hard. One of the things that they do an
unbelievable job of is, like when you play them, they're constantly setting
staggered screens. If you think back to Low and Weaver wrapping those screens
tight, the first play of the second half, we got beat on a tight curl to the
basket. The speed that they cut off that screen, you know, if you're trailing
it, you're going to give up a basket. But then at the same time they do some
other actions that put you in recovery.  
I thought they hurt us with that. They hurt us because we gave up dribble
penetration. Baynes had 19 points in the first half. He had 10. He had eight
on dunks or lay-ups because of dribble penetration. Cowgill hurt us in the
second half because he set ball screens. I watched them before the game
started. They're very well-coached. I knew what they were going to try to do.
The one thing they do is they shoot the ball very well. For our team, I can't
speak for other teams, but one of the hardest things in the world for a team
to do on a consistent basis is when you're not making shots, to really defend.
Tonight, we got real frustrated because we couldn't knock down open shots.
Conversely, it hurt us on the defensive end. That's why. I mean, that's what
happened. That's why it happened. The way you correct it is, is through
maturity and guys growing up.  
  
Q. You said last week that some people might ask whether or not this team
underachieved or overachieved. Can you expand on that. I think you said you
thought it overachieved.  
COACH PEELE: You know, in my heart, I don't think there's any question that
this team overachieved. The sad part about today is, what really hurts me is
that you got four seniors, in terms of the way they're going out, I mean, it
just breaks your heart. But, you know, we all learn lessons in life. One of
the things that I try to do with them afterwards is, in terms of being grown
men, is how we handle this.  
But I will tell you that, you know, in answer to your question, I think we did
-- I mean, this team's been hit. I feel like a boxer who's been in a
heavyweight fight for 34 games. And for 34 games, we've stepped up and we've
taken the best shot from our opponent for 34 straight games. And we've done it
in a situation where we lost three seniors, two of which are NBA-caliber
players. We had a young man that died. We had two kids that transferred. Then
we had one young man on the first day of classes decided he didn't want to
play any more.  
And for this team to handle all that, to be the regular-season champion of the
Big South Conference, to be the tournament champion of the Big South
Conference, earn a fourth straight bid to the NCAA tournament, absolutely I'm
proud of them. They got it done.  
To me, you know, one of the things that I live by is, you know, in life, we
know when we're issued a challenge, and you know whether or not you got it
done or not. You know, today we didn't get it done. But in terms of if you
look back on this season and what this team has done in terms of the
championships that they won, I don't think there's any question that not only
have they gotten it done, but they've gotten it done under the most adverse of
conditions. Proud of 'em.  
I mean, you know, I'll end with this. When you have four seniors and three of
them have four NCAA tournament appearances, four regular-season titles, four
tournament titles, I mean, that to me is - I don't want to use the word
"great" out of context - but if they look back on their career, I don't see --
I mean, I think they have something that's really special in terms of being
proud of.  
And I told them today, as much as I hurt for them, that I'm just very proud
and I'm honored to be able to coach 'em. I'm not going to lose sight of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+DENVER)

### [Moses Ehambe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18230)

### [Andre Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18319)

### [Scott Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18228)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, begin with some general thoughts on the game.  
COACH SUTTON: Well, I'll congratulate Pitt. That's a great, great team we
played. I knew they were a very good team. I knew they were playing as well as
anybody. They impressed me today. They were better than I expected.  
We've played some great teams the last two years in the tournament, Memphis
being the No. 1 seed two years ago, then Washington State, a 3 seed. I think
this is the best team we played. So I give them a lot of credit.  
If Fields shoots the ball like he did today, they're going to be hard to beat.  
The game was lost there. I thought we got out to a good start. I thought we
made shots. That was important for us to get some confidence early. You know,
had a three-point lead. We doubled down on Young. We switched a ball screen.
Jarvis had Young. He kicks it back out to Fields. I think he hits his first
three. After that point, we just didn't compete the rest of the half. I don't
know, I'm disappointed in our guys. We had certain guys that didn't show up
today. That's always tough. But I give a lot of credit to Pitt because they
made us play poorly.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what Pitt did defensively to make it difficult for
you offensively.  
MOSES EHAMBE: I think they just pressured us out, man. They denied the ball
pretty well. When the ball went inside, they made a wall, made it hard for us
to score. Majority of our scoring was around the perimeter. Not enough inside.
That's what we take our pride in, is going inside. We played inside out. We
really couldn't get it inside, so...  
ANDRE HARDY: I think what they did was with our guards, especially Robert
Jarvis, they hedged the ball out real far. He's usually really good coming off
screens and shooting. And he wasn't able to do that today.  
He's our spark off the bench. When they hedge him, you know, that took some of
our scoring right out of the game.  
  
Q. During that run, coach said he didn't think you guys competed. What
happened during that 18-0 run to you?  
MOSES EHAMBE: We just lost our toughness, man, lost our focus. When we were
going on our run, we were taking time setting the offense up, taking good
shots, making good decisions, running back on transition.  
I mean, it was just that point in time where all that left the door, and it
hurt us.  
  
Q. There was so much made of Pitt's physical toughness. How much of a factor
was that in the game? Were they physically as tough as you thought they might
be?  
MOSES EHAMBE: Yeah, they were, as you could tell. I got this ice thing on my
shoulder.  
They were really tough, man. They were going to the glass tough. They're just
a really aggressive team. They played really, really good tonight.  
ANDRE HARDY: To be honest, I don't think -- I think they're tough, but sort of
when the game gets to that point where Pittsburgh, they sort of hit you in
your mouth, and you got to sort of, you know, wipe the blood out your mouth,
hit them back, and we didn't punch them back at all.  
  
Q. Andre, as you look at this moving forward in your career, what do you
take from today's game that helps your next season?  
ANDRE HARDY: Well, starting with when we get back, just making sure all my
guys next year, you know, are working hard to get back to this point again and
to be ready for this situation again, to build and move forward from this.  
  
Q. Moses, as a senior, some of your final thoughts as you look back on your
career at Oral Roberts University?  
MOSES EHAMBE: It's meant everything to me. It's been a great journey. I thank
God for blessing me with the opportunity to be able to play with a great
coach, Coach Sutton. He's a great man. He's like a father. And these guys,
they're just wonderful, man. They helped me, as well. You know, great hard
workers like Andre Hardy, always in the gym, wanting to move forward.  
It's helped me a lot. Oral Roberts University has just taught me a lot in
life. You know, so, I'm thankful for all that.  
  
Q. Moses, could you talk about the way you started the game, coming out and
hitting those two threes?  
MOSES EHAMBE: It felt really good, man. We were taking our time, letting the
game come to us. Just all of a sudden the tables turned. Y'all saw the outcome
of it.  
We felt extremely confident out there. We hit two big three-pointers in a row.
We were taking time setting up the offense, D'ing up, which we take pride in.
It just turned around.  
THE MODERATOR: Andre, Moses, thank you. You guys can take off.  
Questions for Coach Sutton.  
  
Q. You have seen Texas and Arkansas, Kansas, whole bunch of people the last
couple years. No one's kind of manhandled you like Pitt did. Did that really
surprise you, how they were able to do that to you?  
COACH SUTTON: I thought we would compete better than we did. I knew they were
physical. I knew they were tough. I knew Blair and Young were tough, tough
matchups for us. You know, again, I thought we got off to a good start. We
were up 13-10. We held them to I think 10 points through the first eight
minutes of the game. Then we just, for whatever reason, they got on a run, got
up four on their 12-minute timeout and from there it just snowballed. You're
right, they manhandled us. Seemed like they got every offensive rebound if
they missed. We didn't sprint back in transition, which was a huge key,
getting back in defensive transition. They got some easy baskets. You know,
next thing you know, you're down 15.  
So I would say physically that's the toughest team we've played. And I think
it's one of the best. Memphis two years ago was awfully talented. But that
Pitt team, if they play like they did tonight and Fields shoots the ball as
well as he did tonight, someone's going to have to play awfully well to beat
'em.  
  
Q. Reflect now on this season. How did this team come together and play for
you?  
COACH SUTTON: I'll always be proud of this team. This will always be a special
team because of that. Losing Caleb and Tutt, this team can't get back to where
we were the previous two years. How they came together, you know, winning 24
games, going 16-2 in our conference, getting the highest seed we've gotten the
last three years, this will always be a special year to me.  
You know, it's always difficult to lose. There will only be one happy team on
April 7th. Everybody else will have to go through this. In a few days, we'll
all look back and say, Hey, this was a fun ride. I appreciate those guys, how
they played this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Andre's game? Twice now in the post-season, he's risen
to the level of the competition.  
COACH SUTTON: I tell you, he's improved so much. He's worked his tail off the
last three to four weeks. I'm telling you, every time I go down too the gym,
he's down there shooting. I knew he was one of the few guys that could match
their toughness. I was hoping some of the other guys would raise the level of
their toughness a little bit. But I knew Andre could compete in this game. He
showed it tonight.  
I'm not sure if anybody was as tough as he was. That's saying a lot, because
those guys are very, very tough. But for him to get 15 points, nine rebounds,
five offensive rebounds, for a 6'5" forward in his first NCAA tournament game
was pretty impressive.  
  
Q. You lose four starters for next year's squad. How key was having Hardy
come in and be a part of this experience this year?  
COACH SUTTON: I think it's huge because it gives us another guy that we can
really count on. And I think it will give him a ton of confidence going into
the spring and summer, next fall, to really continue to try to elevate his
game.  
Everybody knows what Robert can do. We got to get Marcus back playing like he
was maybe a few weeks ago. We got some guys sitting out redshirting. Sango is
going to play a bigger role next year.  
But I think it was huge for Andre's confidence and for our confidence in him
that he played like he did. The one game in Tulsa, then this afternoon.  
  
Q. We talked a lot going into this about taking the next step. Obviously you
didn't get a win today. Can you still feel confident about the way this team
played and the efforts moving forward?  
COACH SUTTON: No, this team did more than anybody expected. To get to this
point, to get a 13 seed, you know. It's tough to lose like we did today. We
certainly didn't play our best game. But you have to give Pitt credit for
that.  
We just have to go back and recruit and get the guys, like Andre said, back in
the gym, individual workouts, try to get better, try to get back to this point
next year. Maybe we won't have to play a team like Pitt. Maybe we can improve
our seed by one or two more.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, appreciate it.  
COACH SUTTON: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 20, 2008

  

### [Dionte Christmas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18224)

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Mark Tyndale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18222)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Start with some thoughts on the game, coach.  
COACH DUNPHY: I thought Michigan State's defense was terrific. We couldn't
really run a lot of our sets. At some point we just let Mark make plays. I
think that's a tribute to how they play the game, how difficult they are to
score against.  
I thought we did a pretty good job in the first half of getting the ball
inside to both Sergio and Lavoy. When we had our chances a couple times in
transition, a couple times in a halfcourt set, we didn't necessarily come
through in the first half. That hurt us.  
But, again, I think that that's a real good defensive basketball team. I heard
a couple of comments of somebody asking how Drew Neitzel felt he didn't have a
great shooting night. But just in the first half, we had helped so much on
Neitzel, there were a couple of slips for easy baskets that he probably didn't
get credit for those assists. But that's how important I think he is to their
basketball team.  
While he only scored five points, I think he changed offensive possessions a
number of times to help them score. And they got very good efforts from their
big guys. Their front court, obviously Morgan played great. Suton made a big
jumper in the second half. Naymick had a couple of follows that really hurt
us.  
I thought that was a big key to the game. Chris Allen made big shots. The kid
Summers hurt us, too. I thought it was a really good team effort by Michigan
State. We didn't play our best. We had to play our best in order to win the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes for the next few
minutes.  
  
Q. Did the altitude affect you at all? Did you prepare for it in any way?  
MARK TYNDALE: Not at all. I don't think it affected us at all. The first night
we got out here, we practiced in Denver. It was pretty good. We was a little
fatigued at first, but we overcame it. I don't think that affected us at all.  
DIONTE CHRISTMAS: It didn't affect me personally at all. I don't think it
affected my teammates. Like you said, we came out the first night, it was
rough the first night, but then we got used to it. We practiced numerous
times. You know, it was okay.  
  
Q. Even though it hurts today, could you reflect a little bit upon what the
last month or so has been and what you've done for this program to take this
step this year.  
MARK TYNDALE: I think it was great for the program. I think Coach Dunphy did a
great job of getting us back to this point where we deserved to be. I think we
worked very hard in the summertime leading up to this. We wasn't surprised at
all about the outcome of our season. We would have liked to play a little bit
longer, but unfortunately our season ends right here.  
Michigan State did a great job. I really appreciate my teammates and the
coaching staff. They've really grown me and made me become a better man and a
better human being and I really appreciate that.  
DIONTE CHRISTMAS: The last couple months have been special, not only to me,
but I'm sure to my teammates as well. The job that Coach Dunphy and the
coaching staff did was great.  
I think it's very great for the program, you know, for us. I think we came a
long way from the beginning of the season till now. It ended tonight. But,
like I said, man, we just came a long way. I'm just proud to be a part of this
right here, just be a part of this program. Can't ask for nothing else better
than this, man.  
  
Q. Dionte, when you have a shooting game like you had today, what can you
do? Was it the Michigan State defense or did you just have an off day?  
DIONTE CHRISTMAS: I think Michigan State did a good job of just playing me
tonight. They took away the three, taking away the drive. Like coach said, we
couldn't get into no sets. We had to depend on Mark coming down, making a lot
plays for us.  
Tom Izzo, the job he do with that program, is great. That's a great defensive
team. That's probably the toughest defensive team I played all year, all my
career. That's a tough defensive team.  
But, you know, I just tried to do other things, set screens to get my
teammates open. But, you know, that started to work in the second half. Those
guys did a real good job on me personally, you know, as a team.  
  
Q. Were they doing anything unique on defense or just playing very well? Was
there scheme different or they just did it very well?  
DIONTE CHRISTMAS: No, just regular. But it was just, you know, good help
defense. Those guys helped each other a lot. They was very physical. That was
one of the most physical teams I played against before ever. Yeah, I don't
think they did nothing special. I heard Coach Izzo, he don't do nothing
special, he just tell them guys to play straight up man and just be physical.
That's what those guys did tonight.  
  
Q. Mark, can you talk about the size that they have down low and dealing
especially with Raymar, how imposing he is physically?  
MARK TYNDALE: He's a very strong player. I think he's very talented. He's a
lot better in person than he is on film. He's pretty good. I like that kid a
lot. He work hard. He was complimenting me and Dionte after the game. I just
think he's a good person.  
Sky's the limit for him. He's going to have a great future ahead of him.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate a little more about Raymar, what kind of player he
is, trying to guard him.  
MARK TYNDALE: He's a tough player. Great size. Very physical. Can shoot the
ball from the outside, drive it also, make good decisions with the ball. He's
a pretty good player.  
  
Q. Can you reflect again on what your first NCAA appearance was like and how
it all went down?  
DIONTE CHRISTMAS: It was great, man. Couldn't ask for nothing better than
this, you know. They treat you like royalty, you know, making the tournament.  
We came out here to do a job, man. Tonight we didn't get it done. I
definitely, definitely want to get back here next year again. I don't want to
be sitting in this position; I want to be advancing to the next round.  
This ride has been one of the best rides ever, man, with Mark Tyndale, Coach
Dunphy, Chris Clark, my seniors. I couldn't ask for nothing else. This year,
like I said, was a special year for us. I think we did a good job of just
coming together mid-season and doing what we did. Like I said, man, it was
special. Couldn't ask for nothing else.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll let you guys go. Thank you.  
We'll take questions for Coach Dunphy.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the step that this program made this year and what
these kids did to get you back in the tournament?  
COACH DUNPHY: The latter part of the season was absolutely terrific. I was
very, very proud of everybody on the team. I thought we came together as a
group. I thought we had terrific chemistry. I thought everybody knew their
role. It got even better knowing your role toward the end of the year. I think
that's what made us a pretty good basketball team toward the latter part.  
For us to win three games in the Atlantic-10 tournament, represent the
Atlantic-10 as a champion, was a terrific accomplishment by these guys.  
  
Q. When the guys were leaving the floor after the game, you didn't see the
tears, guys having to be pulled up off the floor. Do you think there's a
specific reason for that? Is it that they maybe think they were lucky just to
get there with how the season started off?  
COACH DUNPHY: No, I don't think that at all. I just think the lead that
Michigan State had late gave us a pretty good indication that we weren't going
to be able to combat that. But I think when you get into the locker room, and
once they sit down and think about it, reflect a little bit, then they may
think a little bit more emotionally about it.  
But I don't think that's the particular way these guys are. The guy I felt
most sorry for, in all honesty, was Chris Clark, because he's meant so much to
our program and he didn't get a chance to play later in the game. I would have
loved to have gotten him in the game. For me, that was the most difficult hug
to make 'cause he's such a tremendous kid, tremendous guy. He's done great
things for our program and will continue as an alum of this program.  
  
Q. On their perimeter defense, Naymick and Suton would flash out for an
instant. Is that something you anticipated? How much did that affect what was
going on beyond the arc for you guys?  
COACH DUNPHY: It was not a surprise to us. They've done a great job of we call
it blasting those high screens. We had to react very quickly to that. We
needed players on each side. We needed to get the middle covered, as well.
Then the next pass would have been open. They did a good job of taking that
next pass away.  
I don't think we're a great passing team. That's certainly something we'll try
to get better at. But there were opportunities to post feed out of that,
because of the blast, and we didn't take advantage of it.  
But, again, I think it's a terrific, terrific man-to-man defensive basketball
team. I thought they switched out on Dionte great. He was always contested.
With the exception of maybe the last one in the game, I thought most of his
shots were absolutely contested.  
  
Q. Did you feel because of that defensive job you just mentioned, maybe Mark
or Dionte got a little frustrated at times?  
COACH DUNPHY: I would absolutely suggest that they did. There were a couple of
plays in the first half that we had Lavoy running the floor in transition. We
threw the ball away once. There was another play that I thought Mark made a
great penetration. All you got to do is lay it on the ground, Lavoy would have
gotten it and laid it in. I think those two plays might get Mark a little bit
more frustrated.  
Dionte was being guarded like he's never been guarded before. He didn't get
any good looks. Certainly he's going to get frustrated.  
But, again, I give all that credit to Michigan State. They did a terrific job.
And sometimes you're gonna get frustrated. You have to fight through that.
That's a great life lesson for both of those guys. And they're not the only
ones who were frustrated. We were all frustrated because of that terrific
defense that they were playing.  
  
Q. You mentioned the locker room. Obviously you've been there before, having
to console kids after that. Talk about today's circumstances.  
COACH DUNPHY: I don't think there was much consoling. We had a terrific
basketball season. We're gonna celebrate that. We were disappointed today. We
didn't play our best basketball game. Again, the most difficult person that I
have to face at this point is Chris because of what he's meant to our program.  
There wasn't a lot of tears of sadness shown in there. I hope that that means
they're ready to continue to play basketball right away and work on their
game. Our season's over, but getting better is never over. That's what we hope
that we are going to accomplish in the coming weeks before we send them home
for the summer. Hopefully we'll get together again in the fall and be ready to
go to try to see if we can't get back to the NCAA tournament, which will not
be an easy task. It's going to be a lot of hard work.  
  
Q. What did Michigan State do to defend Christmas? Did they do anything that
surprised you defensively?  
COACH DUNPHY: You know, I'll watch the film and see what the that they did. To
me there was a lot of hedging on those screens that if he was coming off one,
they got good help. I think they just work really hard at the defensive end of
the floor. They're really good at keeping you in front of them. There wasn't a
lot of drive and kick opportunities for us today. Certainly in the first half
there weren't many. When we did get an open look, we didn't necessarily knock
it down, with the exception of Ryan Brooks, he thought he played terrifically
today. But Dionte, he was guarded.  
He was certainly a focal point of their defense. Those are going to happen
sometimes. You got to figure out other ways to score it. His only basket was
off of a post-up. While it's not a staple of our offense, he certainly has
that option. Some of those opportunities presented themselves, but we didn't
take advantage of it.  
But I just think because he's such a good scorer, they're going to put their
efforts in trying to stop him, much like we did the same thing with Neitzel.
So really the effect of that has to be some of the other guys stepping up.
With the exception of Ryan Brooks in the first half, we didn't do a good job
of stepping up.  
  
Q. Your team didn't step up when your two big guys have an off night. Drew
had appear off night, the rest of the Spartans stepped up. Did that surprise
you at all?  
COACH DUNPHY: No because, again, I think when you are a very good player, like
Drew Neitzel is, you create opportunities just from having that focal point of
the defense be on you. And I thought they took advantage of that.  
I thought there were some really good plays by their big guys early. Raymar
Morgan, that's a pretty nice stat line, seven for nine. He made a big three in
that first half that hurt us greatly.  
But they all played well. I think they did their job better than we did our
job. And the end result is what you see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much, coach.  
COACH DUNPHY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS REGIONALS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2008&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS+REGIONALS%3A+DENVER)

### [Folarin Campbell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16462)

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Will Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16461)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by George Mason. Coach, if you want to just begin
with some thoughts on the game.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I want to congratulate Notre Dame. Mike Brey, his staff
and team, I thought they did a terrific job tonight. They were very, very
sharp defensively early. We had a hard time getting started offensively. And
then what really hurt us is they went on that little run where they hit three
threes in a row and got a lot of separation. I think in any game like this,
the team that is constantly having to make the adjustments, they're the ones
at the disadvantage.  
I don't think Notre Dame had to change anything they planned to do. Their
whole game plan was pretty much executed. And then in our situation, we found
ourselves we weren't handling the ball quite well enough. We weren't defending
them quite well enough. We weren't getting back in defense and contesting the
threes well enough. We were constantly searching for both an offensive theme
and a defensive theme that would work.  
We utilized our bench a good bit. Never were really able to cut the lead below
double figures and make ourselves a threat to make a great comeback. But I am
extremely proud of my team for making it to the NCAA tournament, for my
seniors, especially Will and Folarin, who have been absolutely unbelievable
leaders, gentlemen, student-athletes. Every accolade you could describe what a
coach is looking for in a player, these guys demonstrate, and they have
throughout their careers. I just feel very, very bad for them to go out on a
game like tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Will, 25 points, hard earned against multiple defenders. Talk about what
it was like down there, having them change up the defense, defensive players
on you seems like every possession?  
WILL THOMAS: I guess it isn't anything new. Different teams been doing that
the entire season, putting different defenders on me to try to wear me down.
Even them running out, because we had different matchups than they did, so it
was kind of hard.  
But, still...  
  
Q. Now that you have gone to the tournament and not advanced, does that put
any different perspective what you did two years ago or that make you
appreciate how hard it is a little more?  
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: It makes me appreciate it. I guess I didn't really
appreciate it, you know, until today. You know, every team in the NCAA
tournament is going to be a great team. We played against a great team today.
I mean, Notre Dame. Just to know what we did two years ago, playing Michigan
State, North Carolina, Wichita State and Connecticut. I mean, I look back at
that and I just see how remarkable that run was.  
WILL THOMAS: I do appreciate coming to the NCAA tournament. I think that's
what every college basketball player, coach, team, school wants to be at the
end of the season, so...  
  
Q. Folarin, what kind of went into the defense they were playing on you and
how frustrating was it for you?  
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: They played great defense. You know, they put a bigger guy
on me, made it hard for me to get the ball. Every time I shot, it was
contested. The majority of my shots were contested. The lanes were packed.
They just played tremendous defense.  
I tip my hat off to Notre Dame and their defense.  
  
Q. Folarin, you mentioned they contested shots. They got guys 6'8 ", 6'10".
You don't see that in the CAA. How difficult is it to play against those guys
that size?   
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: I mean, it's not that. It's the fact that I feel their big
guys, I mean, they were quick enough and they were able to move, you know. If
I would get past or have one on my hip, there was another big guy right beside
him.  
I mean, Notre Dame just played great defense, you know. Like I said, all my
shots were contested. I mean, I tip my hat off to their defense.  
  
Q. Even with the loss, how would you define this class with all that you
accomplished, with you two, Jordan, and even JV who sat out a year?  
WILL THOMAS: I would consider us one of the best. We accomplished a lot in
four years. That's where I put us: one of the best classes ever to come
through George Mason.  
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: I see it as I think coach L went to the NCAA, I think this
is his third time with George Mason, is that true?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Fourth.  
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: Fourth time, I'm sorry.  
To have it done in three years with us, I mean, twice in three years, I mean.  
WILL THOMAS: Four years.  
FOLARIN CAMPBELL: Twice in four years (laughter). I mean, it's great to go to
the Final Four, to go to the CAA championship twice, come up short one and win
the other one, our last one, I mean, it's great. You know, we've done a lot
here. We know that. I mean, I don't know, it's just bad to go out this way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Is this one of the tougher classes that you have ever had to say good-bye
to in your coaching career?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Oh, yeah. I think what happens to me is, it's just that I
think the passion I have for the game and have always had that, first as a
player, then as a coach. I really fall in love with my guys because they give
so much on the court, off the court. We put a lot of demands on them. Our
standards are very high. For them to try to reach those standards are not
easy.  
We compete in a very, very strong conference, the Colonial Athletic
Association is very underrated. And in the recruiting process, we're always
trying to find the very best student-athletes we can get - not just basketball
players, but people who will represent our university in a very positive
fashion. And if you look at the three seniors who are going to be graduating,
very much like two years ago when we graduated Tony Skin, Lamar Butler and Jai
Lewis, and I don't mean graduated from the team, I mean graduated from the
university with their degrees in hand. These three seniors, Jordan, Folarin
and Will, they're all going to graduate very soon, in May or June. To know how
much they've given to me, to our program, to our university, is immeasurable.  
George Mason three years ago, at threes press conferences, nobody ever heard
of us. Two years ago at the start of the tournament, nobody ever heard of us.
Most people thought George Mason was a small private school. Nobody understood
that we're the largest state university in the state of Virginia, that we have
an incredible law school. We take great pride in having two - what's the -
Nobel prize winners. That's something now that people ask the cliche has
become: Who's the next George Mason? I think Will Thomas, Folarin Campbell,
Jordan Carter, this class is very responsible for that.  
  
Q. Do you appreciate what happened two years ago now? I know you had been to
the tournament before and lost.  
COACH LARRANAGA: You know, I knew two years ago we were doing something very,
very special. In fact, I tell the players all the time, this is the greatest
time in your life, I think. If you're in college basketball, this is fun.
Being part of March Madness, there's nothing like this. I'm watching on TV
today, the games are close, there's a blowout. I'm thinking to myself, Boy,
only 32 teams will be around tomorrow. I'm sorry, day after. What time is it?
Come Saturday.  
I just want to be a part of this. I don't want to leave this thing. I want our
players to experience every moment they can possibly experience 'cause it's
great fun and it's great entertainment for everybody that follows college
sports, and basketball in particular.  
So I know what we did was very special two years ago. Cutting down the nets
two weeks ago was very special, too, because we hadn't done that in a long
time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: Thank you, everybody.

### [Keith Benjamin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18112)

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Levance Fields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13769)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Pittsburgh. Coach, if you want to begin with
general thoughts on the game.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I thought it was, again, we knew how good a team like Oral
Roberts was. A very experienced team. Very experienced in the NCAA tournament
as well. So this was a team that was going to come out and play. Was looking
forward to the opportunity, as we know.  
I was very proud of how we played, how we played early especially. I thought
our offense was about as efficient as could be execution-wise, decision
making. Levance, Keith, Ronald did a great job executing and finding the guys
for open shots. Gilbert gave us great minutes off the bench. Our perimeter was
very good. We really played against a very good defensive team. We really
executed. We shot the ball well. We took good shots all the way through. I
thought we did a great job on that part. Defended them well on the perimeter,
which is what we really talked about doing, guarding their three-point
shooters.  
I thought it was a great game for us. Thought we played very well against a
very experienced team who has been here before. There's not a lot of teams
like that. That's a very good team that we played well against.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Levance, it seems like you struggled a little bit with your shot since
you returned from your injury. What was the difference today and are you still
getting stronger?  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Like coach said, we took good shots. You know, for most of my
shots, I think open was good, open looks. I shot over my legs, was able to get
some lift. We went down for me.  
When you see the ball go through the basket, it helps your confidence. I'm a
very confident guy either way. But I've been missing since I came back, like
you stated. I was able to knock down open shots today.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked a little bit about injuries, how that affected
practice. How have things changed in the last few weeks? How much has that
helped you get on the run you're on right now?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: It helps a lot. We've been doing a lot of things that we
normally don't do at practices. Now to be back in full strength, we get to do
our block-out drills and shell defense, which helps us with our rotation.
Being in the right spots on the defensive end.  
And it's helping us gel together as an offense because the offense is getting
better also. Just having the full team out there ready to practice and guys
knowing what they have to do now just makes everything better and much easier
on the court.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: Like Keith said, you know, due to injuries, we just couldn't
do what we normally do at practice. A lot of times we was just coming in, it
was film and shooting, not able to do a lot of contact stuff.  
So that's probably the reason why we weren't able to do the job on the
rebounding in a lot of games. You know, now since we got everybody back, we've
been out-rebounding teams, getting back to how we used to play on defense.
Like Keith said, just more help on our rotation. Because of practice, we're
getting to do it. Now we're more used to it in a game.  
  
Q. There was an 18-0 run in the first half. They came out with a lot of
energy and momentum. How big was that, to have that run, give them a dagger
early?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: The run was real big. We came out, we tried to match their
energy. We was feeling it a little bit, feeling the air, getting used to it
and stuff like that. The game was moving at a real slow pace. As the game kept
going on, they had a lot of energy still. We started getting the ball up court
faster. Started noticing their transition defense was starting to break down.
We started making great the right passes like we normally do, just getting
great shots. That's really what it was. Eventually we started to break they
back. We just kept grinding them and taking the best shot possible.  
LEVANCE FIELDS: For the most part, the coach did a great job on the film,
scouting report with them. They said they're a high-energy team. But as the
game goes on, they wear down. Like you said, they came out fired up and ready
to go. We took they first blow and kept punching back, they fell down and
couldn't keep fighting. As we got the lead, we didn't settle. As Keith said,
we kept getting great shots. The more we made them, the more you could see
them deflating.  
  
Q. I know you caught a few minutes of that first game. Can you talk about
the matchup tomorrow, what you've seen from Michigan State so far?  
KEITH BENJAMIN: We just know, just from watching the whole year, that Michigan
State is a great team. Every team has they ups and downs. They're playing
great basketball right now. They have great players, great coach. We just
looking to match up with them, however be the matchups. We just going to go
back to the hotel, get our scouting reports down, see where our advantages
are, see what we can do to stop them, come back and be ready to play
basketball on Saturday.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Dixon.  
  
Q. The early run, the players were asked about it. What did you see in your
team? What adjustments did you see you made from the early moments to really
put the game away in a hurry?  
COACH DIXON: I thought we missed a couple easy shots, good shots. You're not
going to hit them all throughout the game. We missed some open ones to start.
They hit a couple threes. We were really worried about their shooting. Ehambe
and Jarvis, especially. So they got a couple open looks. I think he hit three
threes, two early, Ehambe, those were big.  
Again, we felt good at that point because we were taking good shots, we were
getting good looks. We did that really consistently throughout the game.
Eventually you're going to get on your run when you continue to take good
shots. We were controlling the rebounding I thought from the beginning. And,
again, we just wanted to continue to make 'em take tough shots and eventually
we would get our transition game going. I thought we got a lot of stuff going
in transition. We made some very good passes, made the extra pass, too, once
we got some penetration and dump-offs for layups.  
Again, they may have been up a couple early, but I felt good about what we
were doing. So it's a 40-minute game and you just got to continue to do things
right.  
  
Q. There are some teams that as the season goes on maybe don't need as much
practice, need a little bit of rest. Why has this worked for you guys?  
COACH DIXON: I think it was a combination of things. First of all, the numbers
was our biggest obstacle. But also we have four freshmen in our rotation of
eight. So that was a challenge in getting them better was one of those things.  
I knew throughout the year, even before the injuries, that we were going to
have to do some things to continue these freshmen for them to improve. We were
considered a young team going into this year. So then when you lose your two
most experienced guys, this was going to be an opportunity for our guys to
really continue to improve.  
So it's a combination of things. Healthy, youth that we had, and that are
contributors. And then, uhm, we had to get better. We had to play better than
what we were doing. Yeah, usually you pull off in the summer. We had to get
through. We had to get through. We were playing seven with seven guys, seven
scholarship guys, guys with numerous injuries of those seven. We had to
survive that part of it and really point to really those last four games in
conference play is what we talked about.  
  
Q. Fields was one of those guys that was injured for a while. He had a great
game today. Can you talk about what he means when you have him on the court?  
COACH DIXON: There's a combination of things. First of all, he's our point
guard. He brings a lot of energy. He runs the show. He's a good decision
maker. I mean, all those things. But the thing, really depth having another
perimeter guy. Our guys were playing minutes on the perimeter that we've never
played guys at. Keith was averaging 36, 37. Ronald there was, too, for a
stretch. We just normally don't do that.  
So, again, that was part of it. Plus those guys were both injured at the time
when they were playing all those minutes, fighting through that. So obviously
he's a great player, Levance. He brings a toughness to us, as well. He's
always been our leader, along with Mike. They were our two leaders coming into
this season.  
But I think just having another perimeter guy gets underestimated. Again, it's
allowed us to just have more flexibility in games.  
  
Q. I don't know if you remember this one specifically, but it was in the
first half when you were on a little bit of a roll. Levance looked like he had
an open look and he actually decided to pass, made a turnover. You called a
timeout pretty shortly after that. What was the timeout about?  
COACH DIXON: I think actually it was a combination of things. I thought
fatigue. We just weren't seeming to be moving up and down. I know we had a
pretty big lead at the time but I didn't like what we were doing offensively.
We can live with that. He jumped in the air. His assist-to-turnover ratio is
off the charts. Very few mistakes.  
But again, I can take unselfish mistakes, too, even more so, and that's what
it was. So he jumped in the air. Guy thought he was coming at him and he
recovered back to the other guy.  
I think we got a little stationary. You have a timeout to use or you lose it
in the first half. So it's a combination of things. I think it worked well. I
think the timing was good for us in what we needed to do. We had gone up and
down a couple possessions, as well where we hadn't been as good -- they hadn't
really made a run, but I didn't like what we were quite doing offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Any initial thoughts on Michigan State for Saturday?  
COACH DIXON: I haven't looked at them. One of our coaches has looked at them,
done all the scouting. I really don't know too much about them. I've seen them
play a couple times during the year. Obviously I have great respect for their
program, their coach, Coach Izzo, he's a friend. We know how good they are.
You know, it will be obviously a game I'm sure a lot of people are interested
in watching on Saturday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH DIXON: Thank you very much.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Washington State. Coach, if you want to take a
minute or two and give your thoughts on the game.  
COACH BENNETT: Well, it was a tale of two halves, obviously. In the first
half, I thought Winthrop did an excellent job. They're a very good defensive
team. We had a lot of respect for them. They had the experience of being in
the tournament. They make you work hard to get good quality shots. When they
were banging some threes, getting some second-chance points, easy baskets, it
concerned us.  
I thought the difference in the second half was a few things. I thought we got
great production from Aaron and Robbie. We really challenged Taylor to guard
Jenkins well, their leading scorer. Derrick Low got on track. But our defense,
we're going to try not to give 'em the easy baskets. They're going to have to
earn everything. No second-chance points, no easy breakdowns on cross screens,
no stuff all the ball screens. When we did that, they got a little cold, our
offense caught fire. Like I said, when we get production from our big kids
inside, do the right things, we can be effective.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Taylor, talk about your defense tonight.  
TAYLOR ROCHESTIE: I know that he's a great scorer, so I tried to, uhm, just
stay as mentally ready as I could 'cause they run him off a lot of screens. In
the first half, it was easier for me because he didn't play much. He got a
quick two fouls. In the second half, I spent a lot of time, uhm, with one of
our assistants, Coach Woodley, breaking down the film on Jenkins and I've been
asking to guard him for a couple days. Luckily Tony gave me that assignment. A
lot of it's just the principles that we have, just trying to stay in the gaps.
I got a lot of help from the gaps from the rest of the defense. You know, just
stay at 'em. I just try to be as pesty as I could. I think I frustrated him.
It was good for us.  
  
Q. Robbie, you guarded McCullough in the second half. After he had the big
first half, what was your thought process?  
ROBBIE COWGILL: Yeah, whoever guarded him the first half didn't do a very good
job (laughter).  
I had him in both halves. I was pretty disappointed in myself the way he
really just kind of abused me a bit in that first half, made some good plays.
He got on the glass, had a couple second-chance points. You know, coach
challenged me at halftime. I really wanted to come out and just give a better
defensive effort.  
He wasn't as aggressive. But I tried to get up on him a little bit more
because most of his shots were over the top. He wasn't really getting all the
way to the hole.  
Again, any time we stop someone like that, that's kind of a driver, slasher
type, it's a team deal because we're all about getting in the gaps. I thought
the whole team did a good job on him the second half.  
  
Q. Taylor, it's been a while since Aron kind of let loose on the offensive
end. What did you do to get him involved today?  
TAYLOR ROCHESTIE: Just get him the ball. He was making everything. He was
positioning himself really well. When they're going to play behind, we like to
go to Baynes. He was making great moves. He's a lot to try to block. I don't
think anybody's going to try to take a charge. When he has a full head of
steam coming in for a dunk, he gets some confidence in him. The rest was
history, you know, making great plays.  
  
Q. Robbie, you've had some great second halves this year as a team. They've
been preceded sometimes by a very interesting halftime speech. Was there a
fire and brimstone in the locker room at halftime?  
ROBBIE COWGILL: You know, coach got on us a little bit, but rightfully so. We
didn't really play well at all in the first half. You know, offensively I
thought we were all right. But defensively, it's just kind of a lackluster
effort really. Giving up easy baskets. Kind of what we called all week, we
called their gimmick plays, back screens, cross screens, then giving them
second-chance points. We talk about those are losing plays, talk about
eliminating losing so coach challenged us to play harder, better.  
He definitely challenged us as halftime and I thought the guys responded well.  
  
Q. Aron, what were they doing to you on defense?  
ARON BAYNES: That was just on the guys. They penetrated and they forced the
defense to rotate over. My guy just helped up each time. I just had to step
into the spot. They're going to get me the ball in my hands. I just have to
catch it and go up. That's one for the guards.  
  
Q. At one point in the second half you outscored them 35 to 4. Did you
glance at the scoreboard and realize how one-sided it had become in the second
half?  
ROBBIE COWGILL: There were a couple times when I looked at their score. I saw
they were stuck on 29 for a while. Just kind of I felt that -- took that as a
challenge to keep that D up, let's go as long as we can without letting them
score. It was kind of fun to look up each kind of break and see 29, then 34
for a little while.  
I guess with that, wasn't really looking at the spread, just trying to keep --
limit them from scoring.  
THE MODERATOR: Fellas, thanks. You guys can go.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Bennett.  
  
Q. Right at the beginning of the second half, it looked like you spent a
minute with Derrick, talking to him. Anything you can share with us?  
COACH BENNETT: I just challenged him, don't go out like this. I thought he was
a little lackluster in the first half. They did a real nice job tagging him.
Like I said, they're a good defensive team. He couldn't get stuff. I just
talked to him, okay, if you can't get a rhythm shot, attack off the dribble.
But be assertive. When he gets going, that opens everything else up. We made a
little adjustment offensively that I thought helped them -- helped him and
them. I felt he needed to be challenged. He responded.  
  
Q. Have you had a better second half this year?  
COACH BENNETT: I don't know. We've had some decent second halves. We talked, I
think Taylor alluded to it, maybe it was Robbie, defensively we try to talk
about getting gaps. For us getting gaps is three stops in a row. Whenever we
can do that, that's a gap, then we start another one. We just kept trying to
challenge them, encourage them, get another one. I thought they really
responded. I could feel them getting some confidence. You know, like I said,
they got a little cold, which helped us. But I thought the combination of
offense and defense together, that was one of our better halves. We've had
maybe as good or better one side or the other, but I thought it was a pretty
complete half. We struggled early, again, partly due to the way they played.
I'm just glad that Kyle kept us in it in the first half because, you know,
McCullough was tremendous.  
  
Q. Talking about that second half, how much momentum and confidence can you
take into Saturday knowing you played that well for the last 20 minutes?  
COACH BENNETT: You know, we'll see who we match up with. But hopefully that
helps. They played a good half. But you'll have to come out, whoever will
play, and probably can't have a first half like that. But they established
some good things defensively and offensively. We got to this spot last year,
so obviously the challenge is here before us to step up and hopefully take it
a step further.  
But whoever it is, it will be a high-level opponent. You don't get into this
tournament, every team here is special. I think our guys are poised and
hungry. We have experience. But whoever we play will have that. I hope we --
if we can play like that again, I'll be very happy, in the second half.  
  
Q. Yesterday Aron said he didn't think it was all that important that he
scored a lot of points for you guys. Is that true or not? Seems like you are a
much better team when he's putting the ball in the basket.  
COACH BENNETT: Initially, that's what I said, when we get production from our
four and five, that helps us. Our guards have carried us and are our leading
scorers. But there was a size advantage with Aron and a size advantage inside.
I thought we would get more offensive rebounds in the first half. They did a
good job of keeping us off. I was hoping that Aron, if they were going to play
behind him, could get some baskets. Because he does a pretty good job when he
gets deep post position. That certainly helped us. Then Robbie knocking down
some shots. Robbie got a couple offensive rebounds in the second half. I
thought it was key, both of those. The job that Robbie did in the second half
defensively on McCullough. But Aron, whenever he can score for us, we can
spread it out, that's big.  
  
Q. At the point when they've got it tied at halftime, are you concerned at
all the further this goes your guys might tighten up a little bit?  
COACH BENNETT: Like I said, I didn't feel -- I was disappointed with the easy
things they got. I knew it was going to be a dogfight, I really did. We're not
the kind of team that overwhelms people. We're not gonna throw a knock-out
punch. We thought, All right, if we make them earn everything. That was our
whole goal coming in. That was the disappointment. Certainly at halftime I was
concerned. These guys are shooting the ball well. They're getting easy looks.
They're running good stuff. We're having a hard time scoring. I knew we needed
a Derrick or someone to really cut loose offensively. So that was important.  
But you're always in there going, All right, do we have enough to come out? I
hope our league prepared us. I got a little thing on my desk that says,
There's nothing more important than the score -- less important than the score
at halftime. That was one of those cases. Not to make light of the first 20
minutes. Coach Heideman always says, Gentlemen, it's a 40-minute game. That
was the challenge before them. You know, they're very sound and patient. So we
knew they weren't gonna get loose with the ball or shoot real quick. We knew
we were going to be in longer possessions, which is okay. But that's
challenging when you're in a tight game.  
  
Q. Going back to the first half, we talked yesterday about parity in college
basketball. In retrospect, do you think you had their attention or did it take
the first half to get it through that Winthrop was dangerous?  
COACH BENNETT: I told our guys at halftime, It's one of two things, you're
either scared or you're being overconfident. And I said, You better figure out
which one it is and make a change. I said, Because our whole deal is knowing
who we are. And I didn't feel like we came -- whether they were fatigued, you
can come up with a ton of excuses, but it wasn't good enough. And the way they
played in the second half, you know, take away some of the shots, just the
effort they put forth, the execution defensively, was acceptable. And I
thought in the first half, it was borderline not. Again, a credit to the
execution that Winthrop, the things they did. They carved us up a couple
times.  
I don't know what it was, but it was a little -- it bothered us. It bothered
me. And I let them know about it.  
  
Q. Can you comment briefly on the experience of your two Colorado kids.
They're the only two kids from Colorado of the entire eight here in Denver.
They played some valuable minutes off the bench.  
COACH BENNETT: Yes, they did. I told Daven, if you're going to miss a shot,
that's great. Miss it so we get a jump ball and get the ball back, after he
crotched that one that got stuck in the corner of the board in the rim. When
we were selected to come to Denver, I said there's two guys very happy. Daven
has been a very important part of the program, and so has Caleb. They're two
of the classiest kids you ever want to meet. They're so full of character.
They're about the right stuff. It was neat to see their families today. And
then they both -- what I think identifies them is how hard they play. They're
kids that are two of the most unselfish kids we have on our team that will do
whatever you ask and play with just a tremendous amount of heart. They're a
joy to coach. That's why I was glad to see both of them. You know, Daven's
job, he didn't hit a shot. But I thought the job he did defensively was
important for us in the second half. He guarded well. That was important. And
then I thought Caleb at a crucial time got a nice offensive rebound and put-
back. Caleb, you look at him, he doesn't always look the smoothest, as we say,
poetry in motion. But he's a worker, a continuous player. We'll need those
guys. We'll need them all for whoever we play next.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Notre Dame. Coach, if you want to begin with
some general thoughts on the game.  
COACH BREY: I think any time you get off to a great start, it certainly helps
you. We did do that. I thought our defense really for the game was the story
of it. To hold them to 21 points in the first half and 50 for the game I think
was the story line of the game.  
One of the things we wanted to get back to was rebounding the basketball
better than we did the last four games. And I thought we did that tonight. We
had a lot of one-and-done situations. It let us run. It let us get some things
in transition.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about that five- to six-minute stretch when you went on a 17-0 run
and what you did during that stretch that was so effective?  
KYLE McALARNEY: Like Coach Brey said, we wanted to come into the game and
really get back to rebounding because that really helps us get out in
transition. That's where we're at our best, just playing basketball and
running. Defending and rebounding was our only two keys for this game and we
did a good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. You hit a three with 10 minutes to go. Mason called a timeout. Did you
feel at that point that you had done your job, they weren't coming back at
that point?  
KYLE McALARNEY: Any time they went on a run, we had guys step up and hit a big
shot. Ryan gave me a great pass.  
Like I said, we have different guys that step up at different times. It
demoralizes a team when we come down and hit a big shot.  
  
Q. Ryan, you and Zach Hillesland had the assignment on the Campbell. What
were the keys you worked on in practice going in in order to stop him?  
RYAN AYERS: First and foremost, Campbell is a great player. He's been their
backbone for them, being a good senior.  
But we just wanted to come out, bother him, good etiquette a good position on
him, contest him when we had the opportunity to. At times we felt they were
going to post him up a little bit so we wanted to have him presence there so
we just wanted to shut him down and take good shots.  
  
Q. What is it about the post-season for you that always seems like you seem
to have a good game, whether it's the NIT or NCAA?  
RYAN AYERS: I don't know. I felt in a groove tonight. The last couple
practices I felt pretty good. My teammates have been on me, coach has been on
me about being aggressive, you know, helping this team out.  
You always want to play your best basketball at the end of the season. I hope
to continue that.  
  
Q. Luke, you had talked this week about having learned a lesson from the
opener last year. Talk about getting that done and also the feelings about
moving on here.  
LUKE HARANGODY: You know, just stuff like coming into the game, such a
different atmosphere, especially in the locker room before. Everyone just
relaxed. Know what to expect. I think that's why we came out so strong.  
Now with this win, we're getting into new territory. We're playing a great
Washington State team. Just look what they have tonight and go on from there.  
  
Q. I heard Coach Brey challenged you a little bit at a practice early last
week. Luke, was he trying to get across that you need to play better defense?
How important was that today?  
LUKE HARANGODY: Yeah, it was important, you know, because the last three or
four games he's talked about us especially not playing defense, getting up
into people, being on the backboard. I think that was one of the biggest keys
for the game tonight. He got into us one practice. I think he really got that
through to us because we came out that very next practice high energy just as
we came out here tonight.  
  
Q. Luke, can you talk about the way you continue to attack opponents? Seemed
at times tonight you were frustrated, didn't have your best shooting night,
but at the end of the day you had close to your regular numbers and another
win.  
LUKE HARANGODY: Yeah, you know, going at this tonight, they're a great
defensive team. Like you said, I didn't have one of my best shooting nights. A
lot of things weren't going down for me. I just continued to try to rebound
the ball. I think that was one of my main goals going into this game because I
haven't been rebounding the ball the past three or four games that well. That
was one of the main objectives of the game for me and I thought I did a pretty
good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. This was a slower paced game out of you guys. Are we going to see some
more of that against Washington State?  
RYAN AYERS: Yeah, their style of play is something we've kind of seen all
year. We've been in the Big East. We've been conditioned to play against any
kind of style of play. So we just adjusted to that.  
But we did get out in transition a few times. That's just a product of us
playing great defense and rebounding the ball.  
  
Q. Obviously the quick start, you're up 17. Did you feel like it turned into
almost an endurance test at that point? How does your mindset change trying to
stay poised and maintaining?  
KYLE McALARNEY: Well, we feel like we're in great shape. One of the best
conditioned teams in the country. We have a great strength coach who really
conditions us well. We've been playing in the Big East all season. That kind
of -- it's the most competitive and kind of toughest conference in the
country, we think.  
I think we've been through that kind of season all year. So we're pretty
acclimated to this kind of game. The high altitude really didn't make a
difference for us tonight because we were in such great shape.  
  
Q. Luke, you talked about the high energy in the beginning. Do you feel like
you were more intense and more energized in the beginning than you were last
year? If so, what was the difference?  
LUKE HARANGODY: I think last year when we came into this game against
Winthrop, I think we were playing not to lose, holding back a little bit.
Tonight we just went for it. You could see right away with our perimeter
shooting, getting right into it, getting off to that big lead, not holding
anything back. I think that kind of set the tone for the whole game.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Good job.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Brey.  
  
Q. Getting back to the defensive job on Campbell. Did you feel that was one
of the keys going in tonight?  
COACH BREY: Very much so. Zach Hillesland is not sitting up here, but how
about the night he had? You look at the rebounds, the assists. He was the guy
who started out the first seven minutes of the game on him, on Campbell. Ryan
came in, did a good job, too. But I thought Zach was fabulous.  
With Thomas, as long as they're twos, he goes to work in there, as long as we
were giving up twos, I felt we could score enough. But certainly Zach early in
the game on Campbell helped.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you wanted to manage the pace maybe after that
start.  
COACH BREY: It's a fine line, you know, because you want to keep attacking,
then you don't want to play safe. I think what really helped us, we kept
running, even though we didn't get anything, I think it exhausted them a
little bit, that we continued to run the floor even though we didn't get
something off of early offense. We told our guys, Still run the floor. 'Cause
I thought we could wear them down. I think we did. I thought we did a good job
then changing gears and getting low-post touches in the second half with a 13-
to 15- to 18-point lead. Being smart about taking some time off the clock. We
got rebounds, kicked it back out. We had a new clock. We were intelligent
about that.  
I thought we did a great job chasing down long rebounds. Any time they would
make a run, we were quick to the ball on the defensive end.  
  
Q. You had talked earlier late in the year of the St. John's game, South
Florida game, about playing ugly games like that. Having played those games,
did that help you tonight?  
COACH BREY: The pace of how they play kind of lends itself to that kind of
tempo. It's interesting because on Saturday, the tempo is gonna be similar
because Washington State grinds you the same way.  
So I'm glad that we had a game here and we had some games at the end of the
season, as Kyle said, the Big East prepared us for some of those at the end of
the year.  
  
Q. I know you talked a lot about rebounding and playing better defense. Did
you mention to the guys anything about trying to get the whole kind of George
Mason thing out of it, the mystique, the underdog thing, to get them to block
that part of this whole thing out.  
COACH BREY: You know, we certainly respected the nucleus of guys. I talked to
them. I think my tone with them after the selection show was, We really
respect there's a nucleus of guys that made that run. But that was that run.
This is a whole new basketball team. We're a very different basketball team
that lost in the first round.  
But it was very brief. We didn't spend a whole lot of time on it. Of course,
if they watched any TV, they got to hear about it all week.  
  
Q. The pace of the game, whether that was something you wanted to do?  
COACH BREY: Play slower?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BREY: We never want to play slow. We want to run, go for it. No way. But
we can play slow if we have to. I thought we did a good job understanding the
tempo and then getting low-post touches in a halfcourt offense. We didn't give
up hardly anything in transition, which was really good, too.  
But, you know, we like to get out and go and run the floor. That's the best
thing for us. And we did that early in the game because we got stops and
defensive rebounds, and I think it got us confident to play the rest of the
game.  
  
Q. Obviously Luke and Kyle get a lot of attention on this team. Can you talk
about the work of some of the other guys on the team, especially that first-
half run that blew this open?  
COACH BREY: Well, you know, I think Luke Zeller gave us great minutes. Not
only did he knock down a big shot, he got a couple defensive rebounds, takes a
charge, had a big impact on the game. Zach Hillesland, fabulous. Ryan Ayers
off the bench, we want him to be more aggressive, me and all his teammates. He
was awesome in practice yesterday. He played just how he practices.  
So, you know, we need that out of those guys. Tory Jackson, just -- Tory
Jackson makes every tough play. He got a lot of being defensive rebounds for
us, loose balls at key times. There's a toughness about him out there on the
point that really helps our basketball team.  
  
Q. To what extent, the first round particularly, a neutral floor crowd wants
to pull for the underdog, to what extent does getting out to the big lead you
have remove that?  
COACH BREY: I think it certainly helps, even though -- and maybe it's hard to
tell because we got off to a good start. I felt we kind of had the crowd. I
know we've sold more tickets than any of the schools here. You know, I kind of
felt at home here. When we came out to the practice yesterday, we got here
earlier in the week, being in town two days. So I think our guys are really
confident that they had support and a lot of people would be here.  
But there's no question that getting off to a good start makes the underdog -
everybody, not only the team, but the fans - wonder a little bit. You know,
any time they made a run, as I said, we had a number of guys make big shots to
kind of hold the run off.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.  
COACH BREY: Thank you.
