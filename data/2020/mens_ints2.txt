# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Michael Aresco](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39028)

  
_Fort Worth, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all for being here. There is a lot going on. We're in
a state of fluidity right now, but we appreciate you being here. We have
Commissioner Mike Aresco here to answer any and all of your questions.  
  
MIKE ARESCO: Thank you, Bernie. I really don't have a statement. You all know
what we have done and what our position is, but I'd be happy to take any
questions you might have.  
  
Q. What was the timeline like in terms of your reactivity to how the NBA
and how some of the other conference tournaments were handling this last night
into this morning.  
MIKE ARESCO: We met this morning, and we knew we were up against a time
constraint and we knew that our players -- student-athletes would be taking
the court in a matter of a few hours and we were aware that other conferences
were meeting and considering this, but we felt that whatever decision we made
would have to be the right decision from our standpoint.  
  
We're not concerned with what other conferences were going to do. And when we
made the decision, I guess, from what I understand, no other conference had
actually made a final decision, but somebody said, Did you want to go first?
And I said I wasn't concerned with what other conferences were doing. We
simply wanted to do the right thing and in a timely manner, and we also wanted
to, obviously, talk to our leadership on our board and our EDs. And we were
able to do that and we were able to ultimately decide that to protect our
student-athletes was our highest priority, and we felt there was no way that
we could defend, you know, playing the games. You hate to have them miss an
opportunity like this to play in a tournament like this and in this beautiful
arena. You hate that. But you realize that your first priority is always the
health and safety and well-being of your student-athletes, and that was our
primary concern and we felt that, again, we were up against, you know, a tough
timeline.  
  
And we ultimately made the decision to cancel the tournament, and now we
understand a lot of other conferences have done that and we're not surprised.
We suspected that that might happen. And, again, I was asked earlier what will
the NCAA do next week, and I have no idea and it's not for me to comment.  
  
Q. Was there unanimous approval for all of this? In the discussions you
had this morning, was there anyone else who said that we should continue or
was there unanimous support for this decision?  
MIKE ARESCO: It's our decision. It's my decision along with our board chair,
and ultimately the Commissioner has to make that call along with our board
chair. And we alerted, you know, everyone and we certainly alerted, you know,
we told Matt Holman what we were doing, and he is the general manager of the
arena here and he was in agreement. He was aligned with what we did. But it's
our decision. Sometimes you have to make, you know -- again, last night we
decided to play, to have the tournament without fans and that was a hard
decision. This morning, in view of what happened with the NBA, and in view of
the progressive nature of this virus and the pandemic nature and the fact that
the curve is still unfortunately going up and the fact that you could have a
situation where, you know, evidence showed up afterwards of a student-athlete
having this and a lot of other student-athletes could potentially be exposed,
we felt the risk was not worth it in view of what we were dealing with so we
ultimately made that decision.  
  
Q. Mike, what is your connection with the rest of the member
institutions and the talks with the other athletic directors about other
sports as we see other schools starting to cancel their entire spring sports
season.  
MIKE ARESCO: That is a good question. We have been meeting with our athletic
directors. It runs out we had an athletic directors meeting scheduled for this
morning, and that's why it was fortuitous that we had our AD leadership in the
room. And we also were planning a meeting later this afternoon. We decided to
move that up, and so we've had some meetings. They're still ongoing. That's
the primary discussion right now, is what we are going to do with our spring
competitions, both conference and non-conference and our championships. And
we'll have some word probably by mid-afternoon as to what we're going to do
with those.  
  
I'm not at liberty to say right now, but we will have a position on it and our
schools will make a decision. And it will be a conference decision, it has to
be. You can't have some schools playing conference games and others not. Also,
we wanted to make a decision that either would be conference or all-inclusive,
all competitions, non-conference and championships. And we'll make that
decision and we'll have something for you some time, I think, this afternoon.  
  
Q. For Cincinnati, getting the auto bid, it seems trivial and we don 't
know what is going to happen over the course of the weekend, but was there
any, was that a fairly short discussion about Cincinnati getting the auto bid
if there is an NCAA tournament played?  
MIKE ARESCO: It was not really part of the discussion at this point.
Obviously, as aside you think about these things, but the focus was what
should we do. Again, it comes down to, you know, the student-athletes look
forward to this conference tournament, it was going to be a really terrific
intense tournament, but in the end, we felt that after everything that's
happened and the risks, it was not worth doing it, and the health and safety
of our student-athletes was absolutely paramount; that the other things just
didn't matter and that'll get sorted out. Again, we don't know what the NCAA
situation is, but it will get sorted out.  
  
Q. There 's so much uncertainty, but do you have any discussions with
people about the potential of something like this being made up or, you know,
like, postponed, trying to get into the NCAA tournament. Do you think there is
a way down the road that that could happen at a later date?  
MIKE ARESCO: Doesn't seem like it. If the NCAA were to postpone, then perhaps,
but I really don't think it would probably be feasible, you know. The
logistics would be awfully difficult to do something like that. That's why we
felt that postponements even of our spring sports would really not be likely
because, you know, you are up against NCAA timelines.  
  
So I really don't see that happening. Is there some remote possibility that
the NCAA decides to postpone the tournament? I have no idea what they want to
do, or I'm not going to suggest what they might do. Could we come back and do
it? I really doubt that that is feasible.  
  
Q. Any concern amongst people, or any of the teams, that were here about
any necessary testing? Do you guys leave that up to them individually? Is
there any type of conference mandate?  
MIKE ARESCO: We would leave that up to the individual institutions. The staff
here have been terrific. The concern wasn't just our student-athletes, our
players, and coaches, it was also the staff here, you know, the credentialed
media, you, others who would be here, everyone involved with our tournament
was the concern today.  
  
And in terms of that kind of thing, that would be up to the schools and we
just -- we hope obviously everybody does -- I don't want to sound trite that
we don't have a case because obviously then people would potentially have been
exposed. Thanks, everyone. Thanks again for your support of the tournament and
again safe travels and stay safe and stay healthy. Really stay healthy. Thank
you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
JOHN SWOFFORD: We're all dealing with a very fluid and unknown end worldwide
with the coronavirus. We don't know entirely what that means for the future.
We have been in constant deliberations and discussions within the Atlantic
Coast Conference, with our presidents and our athletics directors for weeks.
We've also been in numerous conversations with appropriate health officials
through this, trying to make the right decisions for our teams and our
students, you the fans, to do what's right as we move forward.  
  
After a recent discussion of about 15 minutes ago with our presidents and
athletics directors again, the league has made a decision to end this year's
Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball tournament as of today. It's tough
to say those words, for these young men that are on the floor that want to
continue to play. It's tough to say those words for you fans that are in the
stands, for the media covering this great event, but we believe that it's the
right decision to make at this particular point in time.  
  
You can ask, why was it not made sooner. It's a fair question. The answer is
that it's an extraordinarily fluid situation with information coming at us
that changes -- I used to say by the week, then I said by the day, and now I
say by the hour. So hopefully we're doing the right thing in the context of
this great country of ours and in the context of intercollegiate sports. Thank
you for your understanding.  
  
Therefore, and I appreciate the class of the Clemson Tigers being on the floor
right now. When I spoke with Coach Brownell, his immediate reaction was we
want to be on the floor. I wouldn't expect anything else because he's a class
person and he's part of a class university and a class program.  
  
We usually give two trophies during this basketball season. One goes to the
regular season champion, one goes to the tournament champion and they continue
to the NCAA. Florida State University has had an absolutely tremendous
basketball season to this point. If there is an NCAA Tournament, and we hope
there will be, I can't assure you that there will be, the Florida State
Seminoles will be the Atlantic Coast Conference team that will represent this
great conference in every conceivable positive way because of the leadership
of Leonard Hamilton, the ACC Coach of the Year for the third time. We
appreciate you guys, the year that you've had, and hopefully you will have the
opportunity to represent the Atlantic Coast Conference as our champion going
forward.  
  
We've got a trophy here somewhere. I'm not strong enough to hold a microphone
and a trophy. The Florida State Seminoles, the Atlantic Coast Conference men's
basketball champions 2020.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good morning. Thanks for your patience as we get settled up
here. Just a couple quick reminders, we'll have an opening comment and there
will be a number of questions. We do have microphone holders here. We'd
respectfully request that folks eliminate any flash photography as we go
through this morning. With that, I want to introduce ACC Commissioner John
Swofford.  
  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Amy, thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting, but I was on a call
with my A-5 commissioner colleagues, as I have been a lot recently, discussing
together the situation that we're in. We're in a very fluid situation,
obviously uncharted territory for us and for you, as well, I assume. Then it
changes daily. It did change weekly at one point in time. It changes daily now
and may well be changing hourly.  
  
Right now we are ready to tip the afternoon session. We want to provide an
opportunity to continue to compete in this tournament for our players. Our
understanding and belief is that that is what they would want. It'll be under
unique circumstances and will certainly be a moment and a tournament that
those players will remember for unusual reasons, a tournament that you will
remember because you'll be covering one unlike any other, a tournament that
I'll remember because I've certainly never seen one like this or a situation
like this.  
  
Over the past two to three weeks, we as a league have been in almost constant
conversations with the health authorities locally and in the state of North
Carolina, with the CDC and with the NCAA. Those conversations and the advice
that we have been given has changed along the way, as you well know. We try to
make the best decisions we can make based on the best information that we can
get at the time we make those decisions, and I think we have done that.  
  
But with a situation that is as fluid as this one seems to be, now on a daily
and sometimes hourly basis, that gets to be more and more challenging. We had
thought going into this tournament that once the decision was made to play we
would have the opportunity to complete the tournament. As it has turned out,
obviously that opportunity did not happen.  
  
We've had to make adjustments. Hopefully we won't have to make another
adjustment during the next few days, but if it is deemed appropriate to do so
and necessary to do so, we would do so. That's the type of fluid situation
that we're in.  
  
We want the environment that the players will play in today to be as good as
it will be given the circumstances, and that's what we'll be trying to create.
But obviously it will be different. The most important aspect of this is the
protection of fans and anybody associated with this particular tournament, as
well as the greater population. As I've said, going about that in the most
appropriate way has changed and could possibly change again, and what the NCAA
is doing next week could possibly change again.  
  
So this is something that's much bigger than this tournament, much broader
than this locale, because it's worldwide, and as I said, something we haven't
faced in our lifetime.  
  
So let me stop there. I will tell you the way we make decisions in our league
generally is by consensus. That's the way I like to operate. That's the way
I've tried to operate for 23 years now, and it's worked for us. I think we
have an excellent culture in the league of trust, and that comes in really
handy when you have a crisis situation, and this is a crisis situation.  
  
We speak with regularity with our athletics directors and presidents, as we
did yesterday. If we need to do so again, we will do that on a daily basis as
we move forward. And obviously this won't stop with this particular tournament
because we will move forward in terms of the spring sports and their regular-
season competition and our ACC championship events. So we'll be making
determinations on that. We've already had several discussions on that, and
we'll move quickly on those decisions, as well.  
  
I said I was going to stop, so I should stop. Any questions that you have?  
  
Q. What does this mean for Greensboro in terms of getting the tournament
in the future? Will the city have priority for any future events?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I don't know the answer to that. We haven't really discussed
that. On a personal basis, my heart bleeds for Greensboro. What we have -- the
decision that we have made will have quite an impact on this city, and this is
where we were founded, this is where we live, this is where 27 ACC men's
tournaments have been played and 20 or so women's tournaments, as well, and a
lot of NCAA first and second rounds and even Final Fours. So there's a
tremendous basketball history. This town loves the ACC. This town loves
college basketball. So I feel for the impact on the city.  
  
Q. The NBA has suspended its season until further notice; what 's the
difference between the decision being made by the major conferences now and
the NBA and other professional sports organizations? Is it because college
sports right now are heading into their postseason and this is where you make
a lot of money?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, I wouldn't say it's because of that. I'd say it's because
the NBA made the decision when one of their players contracted the virus. I
think that's the biggest difference.  
  
What we have to look at, I think, is should you make that decision before one
of your players contracts the virus. I don't know the answer to that right
now. But that's one of the tough questions that's there that you weigh as you
evaluate all this.  
  
Q. Mark Emmert announced his decision regarding the NCAA Tournament
yesterday about 4:15 and then you guys followed suit. Was there any
consideration into closing the doors last night, and if not, why?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I received an email from Mark Emmert at 4:35 yesterday telling
us what the NCAA had done yesterday afternoon and immediately set up a call
with the other four commissioners, and I immediately set up a separate call
with our athletic directors and our presidents. Both were fruitful. Both were
extraordinarily helpful, and on our call with the presidents and ADs, there
was full consensus that we should play last night. It was too close to the
doors opening. And we would be creating more problems than we would be solving
by not playing last night. So that's why we played last night.  
  
And then we turned our attention to today and what we should do today, and we
had a full consensus after a long discussion that we should proceed under a
similar basis as to what the NCAA had indicated it would do during its
tournament.  
  
It was also evident that the other A-5 conferences were leaning in that
direction and intended to do the same. I also called Val Ackerman at the Big
East, who's a trusted colleague, and they have a great tournament, as the ACC
does. Had a conversation with her, and the same conclusions came from that
conversation as well as Bernie McGlade, who used to work here and many of you
know is at the A10.  
  
There's a lot of discussion and playing off each other and relying on each
other as these kinds of decisions are made because we're all striving to do
the right thing at the right time.  
  
Q. Since this is a public health issue, you said earlier that the NBA
canceled games because one of their players tested positive. Is that too late
at that point? So we don 't know if players have this virus? Is waiting for
somebody to test positive too late?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Fair question, and I don't know the answer to that. It's
probably a really easy answer to have after the fact. We're in a situation
where we don't get to make decisions after the fact, and we're dealing and the
medical people are dealing with a lot of unknowns in terms of the nature of
this virus.  
  
I think the answer to that question, if someone gets it, then maybe it was too
late. If someone doesn't, maybe it was the right decision. There's risk in
every path you take with something like this.  
  
Q. Is there a protocol in place either from the conference level or the
NCAA level in terms of if a player or coach or any participant is exhibiting
any coughing or anything like that, is there anything, like a predetermined
protocol that every team has to abide by, or is it a case-by-case basis?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Oh, I'm fully confident our medical people that are with our
teams know fully well what to do with that if that arises.  
  
Q. As the decision was being made yesterday afternoon, with all the
discussions with all the presidents and ADs and athletics people, where were
the health officials? Where was the governor? If you 'd relied on their
information all along to get to yesterday, where were they when the decision
had to be made, and why were the sports people making the decisions?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: The sports people were making the decisions based on the advice
of the medical people. The governor's office has been terrific, his director
of state health affairs, Betsey Tilson. We've had numerous conversations with
her, too, yesterday. The governor was actually here yesterday morning for a
brunch, then left, but spoke with him during that time, as well.  
  
We had the benefit of the NCAA's medical advisory committee. We had that
information.  
  
So we're not going to make medical decisions in a vacuum without relying on
medical people. I didn't mention all those calls. All those calls were a part
of getting this all done, and some people want those decisions made within
about five minutes. It doesn't happen that way. But the appropriate medical
people continued to be involved. That was just a continuation.  
  
There was also some -- I don't remember the name, but in Congress yesterday,
another expert, medical expert testifying about the virus that came forward to
us, as well.  
  
Q. Has there been any discussion concern of administrators as to a
specific school not wanting their athletes to play and withdrawing their team,
and if that happens, how would the league proceed?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: We have not had that come. It hasn't come up at this point in
time. You know, if it did, I don't know that I could tell you in advance what
we would do, but we would obviously need to address it and address it very
quickly.  
  
Q. I realize the tournament is taking up a lot of your decision-making
time right now, and you mentioned there have been spring sports conversations.
Is there any reason at this point to -- NC State just announced that they 're
basically following the same protocols that we are here now for their spring
sports. Is there any reason at this point to expect the spring sports would
proceed as normal, and what in your mind would lead to cancelling the spring
season altogether as the Ivy League has done?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, we haven't talked about cancelling the season as the Ivy
League has done at this point. It could come into consideration, determined by
what the virus turns out to be. You know, that's why all of this is so fluid
day-to-day or week-to-week, because we don't know. That is one foggy crystal
ball in terms of what our country and the world is going to be dealing with
over the next however long, which I think means that we will continue to make
decisions that we hope are the right ones, but they may need to be adjusted
fairly frequently.  
  
Q. Based on your timeline as to when you all heard from Mark Emmert
yesterday, it sounds like you and your fellow commissioners were left kind of
scrambling after the NCAA 's announcement. Does this highlight college
basketball's need for more central leadership, a so-called commissioner for
the sport?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: You know, I don't know in a crisis situation like this if it --
I don't know that you translate that to the normal operational aspects of
college basketball. I have for a number of years liked the idea of a
basketball commissioner per se, and Danny Gavitt does a tremendous job in his
current role, but his role has parameters.  
  
Could that help? I think it generally could help, and therefore when there's
something like this, and there's never been anything like this, so I don't
think we normally -- we all of a sudden think, well, we have to develop a
structure that is built around this being normal. But you do have to have a
structure that's built to effectively manage crises when they happen. Not to
say that this is mismanaged; I'm not saying that. The NCAA's action yesterday
was surprising at the time that it happened, although we had some anticipation
that the tournament itself may well be altered by that point in time.  
  
So it was really probably just the timing, and as I said earlier, the timing
with the way this is evolving, can't be helped. So we're all trying to do the
best we can with something that you can't relate any of your past experiences
to in reality.  
  
Somebody asked me earlier, the only thing I can think of, and it's really not
the same, it's just an extraordinary crisis, was my first year as the AD at
North Carolina we played in the Final Four in the National Championship game
against Indiana, and we left the hotel, and by the time we got to the arena
President Reagan had been shot, and there was an immediate and long set of
meetings with Walter Byers and Art Watson, who was the president of NBC
Sports, and Bill Friday and I and the representatives from Indiana and Dean
Smith and Bobby Knight were outside the door wanting to plead their case, and
they weren't allowed in. But that was pretty sobering when you're sitting
there and you don't know whether a president who has just been shot is going
to live or die, and you're trying to determine whether you're going to play a
National Championship basketball game or not.  
  
Things like that and things like this, which could affect a multitude of
people, it puts things in perspective. As much as we love this sport and all
college sports, this will sober you up because the most important thing now is
the well-being of our citizens.  
  
What we have to try and do is continue to try and make appropriate decisions
that are reasonable and responsible and hopefully in the best interest of
helping do just that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This is really bigger than just from an athletics
standpoint. This is a worldwide epidemic. We will have more opportunities to
play basketball, but the down side of some of the circumstances that could
happen as a result of us not being cautious, not being properly cautious,
would be something that we don't want to have to deal with. I'm pleased that
the leaders have thought things through with the information that they have
and they have decided that we -- that it's best for the betterment of our
student-athletes and administration and for the game of basketball for us to
proceed with caution and not allow ourselves to get caught up with maybe the
fact that this is something that we have to deal with, that we don't have all
the information, and it's fluid, and we don't know what the outcome will be.  
  
As a coach, you're always trying to prepare yourself for the unexpected, but
this is truly one of those circumstances that we're preparing ourselves for
what we don't really know what to expect the outcome will be.  
  
Any questions?  
  
Q. Your players were out there and they went in the locker room, then
they came back, then they went back in. Can you walk us through what the
situation was and how you found out what was going to happen?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, these conversations I'm sure have been going on with
our commissioner, with the powers that be where he gets his information from,
the NCAA, the other conferences, so in the background I'm sure that there's a
lot of communications going on almost hourly, minute-ly as we were approaching
the start of the game.  
  
As a staff, we had talked about it earlier, anticipating that it was a pretty
good chance that this could happen, that the games would be canceled, because
of the nature of what we're dealing with. So we had gone in to talk to our
players as in preparing for the game, our normal routine of going over the
scouting report, the last-minute details, talking to the players about the
game plan, and then our athletic director came in and motioned for me to come
and visit with him over in the coaches' room, and I was prepared mentally for
what I thought was getting ready to happen.  
  
Then the commissioner came in and we had a discussion. I think the Big Ten and
the SEC had canceled their games, and whatever the information that he got, I
thought it was in the best interest for us to follow suit, which was probably
the most logical decision to make. And as we talked about the details of how
we would proceed from this point, that we bring the players out on the floor,
give us the trophy and then acknowledge the situation to our fans and the
media that was there.  
  
At that time I went back over -- when our players came off the court, I
thought that made it a little earlier so we could discuss what the
circumstances were surrounding the situation, and they were disappointed when
I told them that it had been canceled, but I challenged them to be mature and
understand the challenges of what's going on in the world and that they had to
be patient with the process, and I felt very confident that we were making the
right decisions, and I want to assure them that whatever medical attention
that was needed, whatever we could do to make sure that we made them secure
and their parents secure, that we were doing the very best that we could to
make sure that everything that we did was in their best interest and in their
safety, and that we would do that.  
  
I wanted to assure them that we had handled this in a mature way and move on,
and that's how the process played itself out.  
  
Q. As you were approaching today, do you speak on any hesitation of
playing and the circumstances or did you reach out to the powers that be --  
LEONARD HAMILTON: No, I felt that it was in my best interest not to be part of
the confusion, that they were going through enough, and I trusted they were
gathering all the accurate information that I would not have access to. I just
wanted to make sure that we had enough information to explain to our players,
because you have the players, you have their parents, and everybody is
involved, and I just wanted to be sure that we assured everybody that we were
doing the right thing by their children, the young men that we are responsible
for.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you kind of came into today knowing that this was
a very real possibility and understanding that things change minute to minute,
hour to hour. Right now can you anticipate there being an NCAA Tournament?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: It would be out of order for me to start voicing my opinion
and trying to look into making comments about decisions that would be made
with a lot more information than what I have right now. That would be
disrespectful to the people who are making those decisions. We're going to be
prepared for whatever decisions that are made and in support of the process.
That's the best thing for us to do.  
  
I mean, I'm sure there are options all over the board. You could play it
without having fans, you could delay it until maybe we get a handle on the
epidemic and play it at a later time. I have absolutely no idea about how to
go about this, but I'm just going to trust that we have tremendous leadership
in the ACC with John Swofford, and I truly believe whatever decisions that are
made, along with the other commissioners and athletic directors and presidents
of the other schools around the country, that they will make the right
decision.  
  
Q. As of 11:00 the commissioner sat on that stage and said that the
tournament was a go. Do you have any sense of what the tipping point was?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: There again, for me to start commenting on something I don't
know anything about would be disrespectful to the people that are making those
decisions. It's challenging right now to allow your emotions and your feelings
to get involved without having all the facts, and when you're responsible for
the well-being of individuals, if you're going to err, you're going to err on
the side of precaution. I'm sure that they made those decisions based on that.
What the timing was I think is irrelevant. I just think that it's kind of a
moving target all over the place.  
  
I'm sure it was week by week, day by day, hour by hour, gathering information,
and they come to the conclusion that I'm tremendously in support of.  
  
Q. You have years of experience and maturity and wisdom to deal with all
this --  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Are you trying to say that I'm old?  
  
Q. No, but the players, they 've been training for these moments their
whole lives. Did they ask questions? How have they been through this
process?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We have not had any real detailed discussions because I
didn't want to enter that into their mindset as we were preparing for the
game. Our guys, I think, trust us and the information that we give them. I
just wanted to assure them that the decisions that have been made would be in
their best interests and that whatever the best approach was, I wanted them to
have confidence that we would adhere to that, if there's testing, if there's
anything that is in their best interest to help us through these
circumstances, I wanted them to understand that that's how we operate, and
that's what's going to happen. I wanted to ease their mind.  
  
But we had to handle this in a mature way and not emotional. We had to
understand that this was something that was going on that has come along. I
don't know that we've ever had a situation like this. This is unusual. This is
something that's different, and we have to handle it in a mature way.  
  
Q. Other than just what we do from here and the longer term
ramifications, how do you process that scene? What did you make of being out
there, and how are you going to remember that moment, I guess?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I'm extremely proud of our players because we're in a
conference with the best basketball teams, coaches and programs ever assembled
in the history of college basketball. Most of the schools got 75, 80 years of
successful success ahead of us. Florida State started out, I think we were an
independent, we were in the Dixie Conference, we were in the Metro Conference,
and then we were independent, while everyone else was in the SEC, the ACC, the
Big Ten, having success in basketball, having established their legacy.  
  
So we're kind of the new guys on the block, and we got invited to the party.
So we try to carve our own niche out. That was significant for us today to be
the regular-season champions. Our guys have worked hard for us, and it's
allowing us to carve out this little niche for ourselves that we are in. We
belong to an establishment of some of the best of the best, Hall of Fame
coaches, Final Fours, NCAA Tournaments. I mean, there's a whole list of them.  
  
So this moment is important. I'm not really sure our players understand how
important it is, but they enjoyed the moment for what it is today. I'm looking
at what has happened in the past and look where we're going toward the future,
so it was important for us to have this accomplishment, and I'm proud of them
because in order for us to be successful, we have to be a little different. We
play more players than most people. We share more minutes. We share playing
time. That's part of who we are. Our guys have developed the theme that we're
18 strong, we win games by committee.  
  
In this day and time of the quick fix and everything wanting to happen fast
and one-and-dones and two-and-outs, sometimes that's a little challenging for
guys to accept, but our guys have bought in, and that was their reward. Being
recognized and getting that trophy meant something to them, and I'm sure
they'll remember this moment for the rest of their lives.  
  
Q. Outside of the basketball and the decision making, was there a point
this week where maybe you just started getting personally nervous about how
this could affect your family, how this might affect the guys ' families, this
virus continuing to spread, dominating the news cycle?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, obviously I'm aware of taking precautions for your
family, but the players, they are our family. So as I think about myself
personally, I'm also thinking about what's best for our players. That's on our
mind on a regular basis every day. Most of them, they say I'm germophobic. I
use hand sanitizer, have to go to the dermatologist and see why my hands are
cracking up so much. That's just kind of my nature. We have hand sanitizer at
almost every stop, in the locker room, before games, after games, so our guys
understand -- we talk about hygiene. We had our team doctors go over the
information with them in the last week about how to proceed with caution from
a health standpoint. We try to get them to eat right and drink a lot of water
and do all the things that we know that can keep them healthy. But we really
don't know how to deal with this. We don't have a cure for it. It's
challenging, and so we do what we think is best, and we proceed with caution.  
  
Yes, I feel a lot of responsibility. Every time I hear one of them cough, in
my mind I'm saying, wow. But that's part of being a parent, in a parent
situation.  
  
Q. Have you or any of your players been tested for coronavirus?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I don't even know where the tests are, do you? Do you know
where the tests are? So I think what I'm saying, from what I understand, we
don't have enough tests available now, but we're going to start looking into
that. I think that's the best thing for us to do is to make sure we don't have
anyone infected by anything. But right now we're gathering information like
everyone else, and this becomes real serious. I wish I could tell you that I
could go in there and pick up about 100 tests, but I don't know how to do that
now. But we have already started making calls trying to figure it out.  
  
Q. I know this is all happening so fast and maybe you 'll get more
clarity soon on the NCAA Tournament, but if you don't have a decision or know
what's going to happen, will you guys just go back home and start practicing
and preparing for games?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, what we're going to do is we're going to gather all
the information. I would love to keep all our players together from a safety
standpoint. I'm not reassured that I want them doing a lot of traveling and
being in large crowds. That's just off the top of my head. But we're going to
sit down. We are going to discuss it with our athletic director and our
medical staff, and we're going to try to make sure that we make decisions
based on all the information that we can gather. But my initial thought was
that we get back and prepare ourselves as much as possible anticipating that
there will be an NCAA Tournament until we are notified otherwise.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Garrison Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37064)

### [Leaky Black](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39018)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 81, North Carolina - 53  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Okay, guys, it's a very difficult time right now. We didn't play
very well, and I certainly didn't coach very well. Syracuse came out early and
made shots, and we got in foul trouble in the first five minutes. There's not
a lot to say. I mean, I think that we played them 10 or 11 days ago and played
extremely well, and they may have had more incentive to come back or they may
have just played better and coached better today.  
  
But we didn't get off to a good start, and then we made a little run to try to
get back in the game, and it was a four-point game, and then we just --
everything we touched turned bad, turned badly I guess is better English. They
made shots. We couldn't make a shot. And we came out in the second half and
tried to get more involved and got the ball inside three of the first four
possessions and scored, and then we lost the ability to get it in there either
by not making the right pass to get it in or the big guys not moving as well.  
  
And again, I've got to do a better job of coaching, and I didn't do a very
good job of coaching this game. That's the bottom line.  
  
Q. To either of the players, what happened during that 14-0 run late in
the first half? What caused it, and how much did that take out of you guys?  
GARRISON BROOKS: They ended up getting a lot better shots that they wanted,
they forced us to take a lot of bad shots. I think we turned the ball over a
couple times in that stretch, and they took advantage of our mistakes.  
  
LEAKY BLACK: We got in foul trouble and started turning the ball over and they
started capitalizing on that, and we just dug ourselves into a hole and just
couldn't pretty much dig ourselves out.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: I don't think it took a lot out of us. It was just the time
that we struggled, but I don't think that we quit from that time, but it was
just -- we took a blow, but I don't think we quit after that.  
  
Q. Garrison and Leaky, it seemed like with some of the foul calls early,
the team kind of got frustrated, and as the game kind of got out of hand, that
frustration grew, especially there late. Was that a challenge kind of keeping
those emotions in check?  
GARRISON BROOKS: It's tough, especially when you see calls like that don't go
your way. The officials made the calls, we just have to live with it, but I
think we could have controlled ourselves a little bit better, especially with
our frustration, and I don't think us fussing at the refs and crying and
whining will help eventually any of those calls, it only makes it worse for
us, so hopefully our players that were whining and complaining learn from
that.  
  
LEAKY BLACK: We just have to learn how to play defense without fouling pretty
much. We can't leave it up to the refs, and our job will be simple pretty
much.  
  
Q. What can you learn from a season like this? What can you take from
it, and how do you get better because of it?  
GARRISON BROOKS: What I take from it is you can never quit. You're never down,
you're never really out. But we dug ourselves that hole in our season, but I
think we can just take a lot from it, just perseverance and just always being
grateful that we're able to do what we love. I'm thankful to be able to come
here, I play basketball every day under Coach Williams, and I enjoy it. So
just taking advantage of stuff like that and just coming to work hard every
day. I think sometimes in our season everyone didn't come as hard as they
should have, come as hard to work as we should have, and as a leader I think
that I have to do a better job motivating everyone to come to work every day
and come with our hardhat and lunch pail to show that every day is meaningful
and every day means something to us.  
  
Q. Roy, this is clearly a frustrating end to a frustrating season. Did
you feel at any point during the course of the year you kind of got a glimpse
of the potential of this team?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I thought -- needless to say, I thought we'd have a better
record at the end of the year. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about what
our record is going to be, but I try to evaluate our team, and I thought that
we could be better.  
  
Things didn't go very smoothly for us. You know, the Oregon game, it was
really at that point I said, we've got a chance to be really good, and we
never got that feeling again the rest of the year. And you know, it was a --
Garrison and Cole and B-Rob probably are three statistically, in everybody's
eyes, the three best players. We didn't have those guys together but 10 or 11
times, and some of those like B-Rob at Gonzaga just played in the first half
and never came out in the second half. But those are all excuses. There are
reasons to us that went through it, but they're also excuses.  
  
I didn't find the right buttons to push. I mean, even today it's just -- I got
them together after pregame meal and before we went over the scouting report
and talked to them about what's going on in the world and told them things are
changing, things are changing with this tournament and the whole bit, but
let's just get it out in the open and see what questions you have because I
wanted just to really focus on the game. Evidently that didn't work, either. I
felt like that I'd take two steps and one of them would go forward and the
other one would go back just immediately. Or I'd take one step forward and two
would go back. I told them in the locker room, I'm as lucky as you can be. I
get to coach. That's all I've ever wanted to do. Right now it's not fun. It
has been a difficult year. But this is what I want to do.  
  
I didn't see this coming tonight, and so that's another way I made a mistake.
I should have prepared them differently. I've did more soul searching this
year than I've ever done because I've been so lucky, but bottom line is that
Syracuse beat North Carolina tonight and Jimmy Boeheim did a better job than
Roy Williams did. Those things aren't easy to say. I have a great deal of
respect for Jimmy. I think he's one of our great coaches, but I didn't have my
guys to play as ready as he has his guys.  
  
Q. Speaking of what 's going on in the world, as you put it, during the
game the NBA suspended its season. Is it your belief that college basketball
games should be played moving forward knowing that the pros aren't playing?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I don't know any of that, so I'd hate to make an evaluation, but
this is a very serious problem. You know, last night I made a joke about how
it had frustrated me because they said old people and it was 60 and I'm 69.
But this is the most serious problem that I can remember in our country that
there's no answer for. You know, the stock market is going crazy. Well, let's
just see if you can do some things. But this is a virus. This is the
possibility of people getting very sick and dying, and it's something that in
my mind is more serious than anything I can remember, and I'm way older than
most of you guys. I remember when I was little that people were preparing
places for you to go and hide underground because of nuclear weapons, and that
was not a very comfortable time, and I was really little. But I know my mom
was really, really scared.  
  
But this is something that you can't see, and this is something that -- I used
this statement last night. We have very intelligent scientists and doctors and
people that are in charge of this kind of thing, and the American people have
been very resilient over the years, and I think we'll come out of this thing,
but this is a scary time period. But I don't want to try to get in and
evaluate what should or shouldn't be done with college basketball. Again, we
have very intelligent people that will make the right decision. I just got my
rear end beat. I don't know that I can evaluate anybody doing anything.  
  
Q. From a basketball perspective, what point of the season was the most
frustrating period for you, and did you learn something about yourself how you
sort of found a way to navigate through that process?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Tonight. First time in my life, I felt sort of hopeless. I
couldn't find any cures, couldn't find any solutions. You know, and I've lost
before, Jiminy Christmas. We've had great teams that have lost before. But
tonight wasn't much fun.  
  
Q. Like you said, it 's been a tough season. How do you mentor and learn
the experience for yourself and mentor the kids through the pressure of
playing for a North Carolina team?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I told them that what you have in life is you have a lot
of challenges. There's nothing more fun, guys, than being on a team. There's
nothing more fun than being willing to make sacrifices towards a common goal.
There's nothing more fun than doing something with somebody else. And that's
called putting a team together. And now the ones that are leaving are going to
be challenged later on in life because they're going to be putting another
team together, and that's their family. I told them that the preparation that
they put in every day for those kind of things are extremely important, and
our preparation for this game didn't work, so learn from that. Learn from the
love that you have when a team comes together, and learn from the sorrows that
you have when you don't step up. If you felt like you gave in too much
tonight, learn from that a great deal because you can't do that in life, as
well.  
  
You know, that sounds philosophical, but I really believe that everybody is
better off if you play on a team and share things and learn things about
yourself. I'm old-fashioned, but I love being on a team. And I think that's
pretty neat.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [DJ Vasiljevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38105)

### [Chris Lykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34998)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 69, Miami - 64  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I thought it was a very hard-fought contest. Both teams
played very well, especially in the first half where neither one of us could
get anything going offensively. We were hoping that we could continue to play
that kind of defense in the second half, but Clemson got it rolling. They had
no free throws at halftime, and they made 18 of 19 in the second half, so
obviously that's the biggest difference in the game.  
  
Q. Chris, how restricted were you by wearing the mask today?  
CHRIS LYKES: I put the mask on, and I got cleared to play, so I was able to
get out there and play on the court. Once I'm out there, it's no restrictions,
it's no complaints. I've just got to do what I know I can do, and my teammates
did a good job of getting me in rhythm early and just telling me keep going.  
  
Q. Jim, that last minute, were you flashing back to any other kinds of
incredible rallies, the way you turned them over twice on inbounds and had
chances to get within one possession?  
JIM LARRANAGA: This season I have witnessed more crazy endings in our league
and in other leagues than I've ever seen before. One crazy ending was Duke at
Carolina. They have to miss a free throw, they come up with it, they make an
incredible shot. Louisiana Tech was at Western Kentucky, and Louisiana Tech
was up I believe it was seven with 10 seconds to go, and Western Kentucky tied
the game.  
  
So, so many things can happen in a very short period of time. We put Anthony
Walker in the game because he's such a good athlete. We were hoping he could
bother the inbounds pass, which he did. Sam Waardenburg stole it, got it to
Anthony inside, and he got fouled, but he really had a chance to get a three-
point play with us down four. And I know he's heartbroken right now because he
missed the shot and missed the two free throws, but when you're asked to come
into a game with 10 seconds to go or 14 seconds to go and help us make some
miraculous comeback, it's very, very hard to do that.  
  
So he gets a lot of credit for stepping up and helping us in that situation.  
  
Q. What have your seniors meant to you? I know you guys have had a lot
of ups and downs this year, but seeing D.J., I know how it is to end a season
like that, but he 's had a tremendous contribution to the Miami program.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, the first is if you looked at our team before the season
and you anticipated that a guy like Keith Stone could end up being a major
factor for us at both ends of the court, and when he first becomes eligible
and we win five in a row, we think we're heading really in the right direction
because he improved our defense tremendously. But then he got hurt on the road
at Clemson. We win in overtime, but he got hurt, he ended up having surgery
the next week, and we were back to square one.  
  
He came back, helped us in February, in March, and I think it's very difficult
when a guy is a fifth-year senior trying to acclimate himself to a new coach,
a new program. But he could not have been a better teammate nor better young
man to coach.  
  
D.J. Vasiljevic on the other hand has been with us for so long and has done so
many great things on the court, off the court. He's a great role model for our
program. He's the number two all-time leading three-point shot maker. He's in
the top 20 in the ACC in shot-making from three. He is as hard a worker as
you'll find in college, and he's a limited athlete. He doesn't think so, but
he's not the run and jump athlete that some of guys in the ACC are. And yet
he's been able to compete at such a high level because of his work ethic, his
intelligence, his basketball IQ, and he's also on the ACC all-academic team.
He's already graduated. He's working on his master's degree, and I couldn't be
more proud of the contribution he's made and the kind of young man he is and
how enjoyable it was to be with him for four years.  
  
Q. When you talk about the young pieces with this team that you bring
back, what excites you most, and then I know you have a transfer that sat out
this year that 's developing, a big that would have really helped this year.
Just your thoughts there.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, with Keith moving on, we bring in Nysier Brooks, a
transfer from Cincinnati, who possesses a lot of the same qualities as Keith.
He's a heck of a defender. He's a terrific rebounder and shot blocker. He
gives us a presence inside. Rodney Miller was really the only guy that could
play with his back to the basket this year, adding Nys Brooks, we've got
another guy, and that will give us a much different look going into a game. So
as you see, Clemson shot 19 free throws, we shot seven. Just couldn't go
inside, get inside their defense well enough. And hopefully those things will
change next season.

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [C.J. Bryce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33041)

### [Devon Daniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38984)

### [Derek Funderburk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38985)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 73, Pittsburgh - 58  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: I'll start. I thought our guys did a tremendous job of -- let's
give Pitt a lot of credit. I think what Jeff is doing there in his second year
is really good. Obviously it's tough as we've seen in our program to continue
to build a culture and a program. That being said, I thought our guys in the
second half, we won the game because we completely defended better than we did
in the first. We started off well and then at the end of the half, certainly
because we stopped making shots, we stopped defending.  
  
Some of the keys to our game and our success today was we were able to get out
in transition. We were able to make some shots. We were able to get some
player and ball movement against the zone, and certainly that helped us get a
win.  
  
These guys here and the guys in the locker room did a tremendous job. It's
always tough playing your first game, even though you're playing against a
team that played the day before and they may be a little bit tired, but
obviously that first game is always tough in the tournament, and I thought our
guys did a tremendous job and we can obviously survive and advance.  
  
Q. C.J., after Duke 's success against you guys with zone, did you
figure you'd see some more of that today and probably obviously again
tomorrow, and did you feel like you guys handled that, some better looks today
out of that?  
C.J. BRYCE: Yeah, I felt like for a couple minutes we got a little stagnant.
We figured that they would play zone coming in after such a quick turnaround.
But I feel like we got our shots, we got our open looks and we knocked them
down tonight.  
  
Q. For the players, Coach mentioned that you guys struggled on offense
late in the first half. Devon, you were out with two fouls at this point, but
I 'd like to know what you guys thought contributed to the lack of success
offensively. For about four or five minutes there you lost your 10-point
lead.  
DEVON DANIELS: I feel like we got stagnant like on offense. I feel like we
started getting really aggressive on defense and were getting a lot of steals,
a lot of deflections, not getting easy baskets. At the end of the half I feel
like we got a little stagnant when they went in zone, weren't looking for our
shots enough, and I feel like we turned it around in the second half.  
  
Q. Devon, I know Coach prefers you to go hard to the rim rather than
take the floater, but it was working for you tonight. Was that just a product
of the zone and what was available or did you just kind of feel that?  
DEVON DANIELS: Yeah, I started off going hard to the right, but when they went
in the zone, their big man was down giving me space to operate like in the
middle area, so I just read the defense and the floater was open, so the touch
was there today.  
  
Q. Do you feel an extra pressure with the NCAA Tournament stuff swirling
around or do you just go play?  
DEVON DANIELS: Honestly, I don't think our team is really too focused like on
the outside talk. Inside the locker room we're just focused on one game at a
time. We know we can't go where we want to go, like unless we take care of the
game at hand, so we're just taking it one game at a time.  
  
C.J. BRYCE: What Devon said, just taking it one game at a time. We can't
control the future. Obviously it's at the back of our heads, and that's
obviously the ultimate goal to be playing for, but one game at a time, and
we'll get ready for the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Adding on to that with the NCAA Tournament, do you guys feel your
resume has kind of spoken for itself so far leading up to today, and how much
does that Duke game tomorrow add on to that?  
C.J. BRYCE: I feel like up to this point we have pretty good wins on our
resume, but that's something that we're not really focused on right now. We're
trying to win the conference championship, and we'll get ready for this game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. C.J., you guys have at times had trouble putting two really good
games together; what do you do to kind of be a little bit more consistent and
try to get this kind of effort here tomorrow?  
C.J. BRYCE: Just pay attention to the details. We've obviously played all
these teams before in the conference. I think we play Duke tomorrow, so we had
that loss to them last time, so go in there with we want to get this win and
not just for it being Duke, but like I said, we want to continue to advance,
win and advance in the conference.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys have seen Duke twice pretty recently. You
played today, you won, you 've got some momentum. They were off. Will that
maybe help you get to a quicker start against them tomorrow? What do you see
in tomorrow's quarterfinals match-up?  
DEVON DANIELS: I feel like if we played or we didn't play, we're going to have
to come out focused and energized. We're going to have to lock into the game
plan and the scouting report we're just going to have to go out there and
compete and play with a lot of energy.  
  
C.J. BRYCE: We've just got to play our game, stick to the game plan. We've
beat this team before, so we definitely have confidence that we can do it.
We've just got to get it done tomorrow.  
  
Q. The NCAA just came out with another statement saying they 're now
recommending against games being played with the public in attendance. I'm not
asking you guys to be epidemiologists, but what's your reaction to the
eventuality of playing in empty stadiums?  
KEVIN KEATTS: I don't think these guys are ready to answer that. I'll take
that if you want me to take it, but I don't think they're prepared to answer
that question. Look, we've got to -- it's a serious problem, and it's not an
athletic problem. It's a problem all across the country, and so I don't think
anybody here or anybody in the sports world should obviously complain about
what the people that know what's going on will decide to do.  
  
In our situation, we'll play wherever they tell us, but we also want to make
sure that our kids and our coaches are all protected and are safe. I don't
really have a true answer other than I'm not the smartest guy when it comes to
this. I'm going to listen to the people that's above us, and wherever they
tell us to go, wherever they tell us to play, or if it's fans or not fans,
we'll do it.  
  
Q. Kevin, was it good to see the zone today to prepare you for tomorrow,
or will Mike play 3D chess and come out and play man tomorrow?  
KEVIN KEATTS: You know, it's crazy because I told our guys that I figured that
if we played Wake or Pitt, there's an opportunity for us to play against the
zone, and the reason being is because in a tournament situation, when you play
the day before, you don't have time to really go over people's sets. You don't
want to go on the floor because you don't want to take people's legs.  
  
So our anticipation is that we're going to see some zone from everybody that
we play as we continue to advance.  
  
But it was good to see it. I thought in the first half we were non-aggressive
towards when they went to the zone, and we talked about at halftime continuing
to drive and ball screening, and we got shots, and then we talked about
offensive rebounding and I thought we did a good job.  
  
So it was good to see it. I have no idea what they're going to play tomorrow.
I anticipate that we're going to see some zone and some man-to-man.  
  
Q. One of the things that hurt you when they went to the zone last time
was their ability to get out on the break. I think they got 25 fast break
points. Thoughts about your transition defense heading into this game?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I don't disagree with you. I think one of the things that
hurt us when they went to the zone, we didn't make shots. Like we got wide-
open shots. When I went back and watched the tape, we didn't make shots.  
  
That being said, because we didn't make shots is where this team has to get
better and grow because sometimes -- and we're not the only ones around the
country, when you don't score, typically your defense struggles. We gave them
run-outs, we gave them offensive rebounds, we didn't rely on our defense. When
we keep people in the half court, we're very productive on the defensive end.
But I didn't like it, you're right. We gave up 25 points in transition. We
have to be way better. They're one of the better transition teams in the
country.  
  
Q. Champagnie for Pitt, he had 31 yesterday, you held him to just nine
today on 4 of 13 shooting. Was there a conscious effort to a certain way you
wanted to defend or attack him or force him into certain things?  
KEVIN KEATTS: No, he's a good player. He played a great game yesterday, and we
just concentrated on defending the way we did. I sit there and watched him, I
was proud -- I did tell our guys that he had 31 yesterday and played great.
But I thought we did a really good job not just on him but most of their
guards, forcing them into tough shots. Even the shots they made were tough
shots.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Juwan Durham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39001)

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Temple Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39002)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 80, Boston College - 58  
  
MIKE BREY: Well, I'm thrilled with how we played on both ends. I thought we
were really ready, really focused. I thought our defense kind of sparked us,
and I thought our zone helped us. We had success with zone against them up in
Chestnut Hill, so we rode it. But any time we can get that thing to 80 and
make double digit threes, that's how we have to advance and beat people in
this league.  
  
Q. You heard Coach just say, get it to 80. Last time you played
Virginia, 50-49. I 'm sorry I'm asking you to jump ahead, but what do you
remember about the match-up with Virginia and why is it so hard to approach 80
against them?  
TEMPLE GIBBS: We know that they're a solid defensive team. Last time we played
them they did a really good job of being in the gaps. The thing about us is
when we move the ball and we play how we play, I think the sky's the limit for
this team. We know that we're good. We know that they're going to come down
and they're going to slow it down and play at their pace, but we're mature
enough this year, this year we've matured, that's the biggest thing about this
team, we've matured it comes and breeds confidence, and that's what we have
NOW.  
  
JUWAN DURHAM: Basically just piggyback off what T.J. said, they're a poised
team and we just know that we got to come in and play as hard as we can, and
it was a close game, like he said, but I think we can make something happen
next time.  
  
Q. For T.J., the ACC has announced there will be no fans at the games
tomorrow. I 'm just wondering as a player what do you think that experience
will be like?  
TEMPLE GIBBS: It's definitely going to be different. Coach said it's going to
be more like a scrimmage than it is an actual game. But we can't have that
mindset, we have to come out and play like our lives are on the line still. We
play for the fans, it's going to be, not sad, but just a little bit of a
different environment. Our families are usually here and it's a little bit
easier to play and a little bit more energy in the building, but we have to
bring our own energy and just play the way we play.  
  
MIKE BREY: We'll be able to bring our families, right? Your families will be
there.  
  
TEMPLE GIBBS: Perfect, yeah.  
  
Q. Have either of you ever played in a basically empty gym, and what was
your memory of that?  
JUWAN DURHAM: Probably just for a practice or for a scrimmage.  
  
MIKE BREY: Cincinnati last year we scrimmaged them in Bankers Life, where the
Pacers play, so it was a different kind of atmosphere.  
  
TEMPLE GIBBS: Yeah, you could hear your echo in there.  
  
Q. Going off the last question as far as there not being the fans, the
crowd noise not being there, how much of an effect is it going to have with
this not being a scrimmage, this is an ACC Tournament game?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I think everybody is mature enough, our players are mature
enough, and I would include Virginia and everybody that's going to keep
playing tomorrow, that they know you get a chance to advance and play for a
championship and you get to compete and go for it. So I don't think there's
going to be any letdown or distraction. You know, we practice over 100
practices a year in a gym like that tomorrow. It'll be a very -- I'm going to
remind us of some of our great practices when there's seven people in the gym
and we're going at it.  
  
I think kids want to compete. They still know they're playing on national TV
and everybody is watching them and still know they're playing for a trophy. So
I think kids will -- this level of guys just love to hoop, so they get to play
again.  
  
Q. Mike, as President of the Coaches ' Association, how closely have you
been monitoring all this, and did this kind of decision to you feel
inevitable?  
MIKE BREY: You know, I've been -- Jim Haney and I have been texting all day. I
owe him a call here in about an hour, because we've got to got our board on
the phone here one day this week, even though we're very busy. Kind of almost
felt this was coming, after I saw the announcement from the NCAA, that it
would trickle down to here. I think moving forward, one of the things you
think about is player safety, the student-athlete. I spoke to my kids last
night before we went over the scouting report, and I told them, look, I want
you to know, if you talk to your mom, we're going to keep you safe. I've got a
band and cheerleaders, I've got a heck of a travel party down here, and so
moving forward after this week is going to be really interesting as we all are
probably getting a feel for it, but I mean, that was the decision, and I think
the ACC did a great job reacting quickly. I thought there's no way, after I
saw the NCAA's decision, that we'd have people in the building tomorrow. I
even thought maybe they'd shut it down tonight.  
  
This is unbelievable, interesting times as we move forward. But again, I go
back -- kids just -- they love to play and they love to compete. I think
they'll really play their backsides off, even though it'll be echoing in there
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned 80 points.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, no way. 80 combined. We're going to go 80 combined.  
  
You know, the one thing, again, we've had -- maybe the law of averages finally
kicks in against them because they have dominated us. I'm the first one to
admit it. You know, you just have to value the ball and value possessions
because you're not going to have as many of them.  
  
We do that well. We're good with the ball. That's why we had a chance. And
we're just going to have to really value it, and you can't -- I'm going to
remind them the same thing we did in Charlottesville and we had a chance to
win, but it's going to be game situations, and they're really good at it
because they're in them all the time. They're in close games all the time.  
  
But I know they're coming in rolling with winning eight in a row, but we'd
like another shot at them. We respect the heck out of their program.  
  
Q. What does Virginia 's length do? How does that cause problems? Jae,
obviously, but their wings are also really long.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, that's one thing they've done is the court seems smaller when
you play against them on the offensive end because their wingspans are so good
and their recovery time is great. Now, the lineup we start now is a little
more conducive to play against a jammed-up defense because we can spread you a
little bit and handle the ball a little better with our guards. We rarely
played Mooney and Durham together much tonight, which was kind of by design --
and I have all the respect in the world for Juwan Durham because he started
every game, and he didn't sulk, he went about his business and had a great
impact. And then Dane Goodwin -- Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewsk have to play
more for us. I've been trending this way. You start one of them, and then
we've just got to get those guys on the court more.  
  
But hopefully with our smaller lineup, maybe we can open the floor up a little
bit more. Easier said than done, though, against these guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Steffon Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34824)

### [Jay Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39000)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 80, Boston College - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players first, please.  
  
Q. Just give me a sense for what today is like when you hear all the
stuff that surrounded this game about the idea of fans not being allowed to
attend and on top of that, just this entire week and what the coronavirus has
been.  
STEFFON MITCHELL: Yeah, I think that played a factor, but I don't think it
played too much of a factor. We knew what was going on and we got emails from
our school and stuff like that, but I don't think that affected us today.  
  
JAY HEATH: I feel like we just tried to stay focused on winning. We didn't
really let the outside noise bother us. But we knew it was going on. We really
can't do nothing about it.  
  
Q. John Mooney, first team all-ACC type of guy. When you 're trying to
impact his game, what are some of the difficulties of trying to defend him?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, he's such a hard guy to go at because he scores -- he
can hit threes, he can score in the post, and he's such a good passer. You
know, the goal is probably not to let the other guys beat you, because he's
hard to guard, he's going to get his. We did a poor job of that tonight, the
first two games we did a great job of trying not to let the other guys beat us
with open threes, driving angles, and kind of make him try to beat you from
the two. Just play without fouling him. He's such a hard guard. Keep him off
the glass, but it's really the other guys, the things he does for the other
guys to open it up for them is what makes their team good.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any difficulty in trying to recruit at Boston College
to keep up with say the talent level of a Duke and a Carolina and trying to
compete for that top spot in the ACC?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I think there's a lot of people that have trouble keeping up
with the talent level of Duke and Carolina. Every school has its challenges,
we obviously have ours, and I think what we've done is we've tried to address
them, and for the first, maybe the last year and a half, I think our
administration is really trying to move our program forward. We probably
hadn't done that for a while, and I think it's great to have those
conversations, just long-term for Boston College. I think that there's some
things I think that we've recognized that we need to do. And Boston is a
tougher area than most to do it in because of all the things that go with it
in terms of building costs and room on campus. We don't have the biggest
campus. So I think we've done a good job of really addressing those things,
and hopefully those things will continue to improve.  
  
Q. I know your AD is a North Carolina guy. Give me a sense for your
thoughts on Greensboro as an ACC Tournament site.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, I played the first one here my first year, and I
thought it was tremendous. We were in the 12-13 game and it was 13,000 people
here. Actually the bus pulled up and people were tailgating and I was
wondering where they were going, because it was us and Georgia Tech. Neither
one of us travel well.  
  
So I think it's -- you could tell how far the city of Greensboro extends
itself for this tournament, how much pride they take in it. Just the people
working in the hotels, we went out to eat with our team, and the people
couldn't have been nicer. It's a great venue. I think it's a great place.  
  
Q. How much did the early shooting problems impact the outcome and were
you getting shots you wanted and just missing?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I think they impacted the whole game. Against Notre Dame
you've got to get into a good offensive rhythm early. I think we missed like
nine straight shots in the paint. So I think, yeah, that's about as good as
you want. If you get an open three and you get the ball on top of the basket,
I think we had some young guys playing in this tournament for the first time
that maybe -- maybe a little too excited. We let them get into a huge rhythm
when they stretched the lead to about 18 in the first half, and if you dig
that big of a hole to them, it's hard to come back.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half when Notre Dame started pulling away a
little bit, it looked like Boston College, instead of looking for maybe the
best shot, was looking for the first open three. I got that impression.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: I don't know, we were attacking the basket, cut it to seven,
and then we had a couple guys go down. So the guys who were attacking the
basket for us were hurt. If you put in a -- we went to four guards, so it's
hard for us to run as much of our stuff because we had guys not playing the
right positions, so we were kind of trying to spread them out a little bit and
attack off the dribble, kicking for threes. We're trying to -- I don't think
we were rushing, taking bad quick shots, we were maybe not just not scoring on
the break. But we weren't able to run the stuff we were running because two
guys got hurt during the game. It's hard to play like that when you're putting
a guy in a new position he hasn't played all year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Trey McGowens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36698)

### [Xavier Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24958)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 73, Pittsburgh - 58  
  
JEFF CAPEL: First of all, congrats to N. C. State. I think they're a really
good basketball team. They play really hard, play together. They're a veteran
team. I think they're certainly very, very worthy of an NCAA Tournament bid.
You know, Kevin has done a really good job in a short time there with some
adversity that had nothing to do with him, and he's been able to assemble
talent, develop talent, and play a style and get those guys to fight and play
together, so congrats to them.  
  
I'm proud of our team. I think we took a step as a program. Like I just
finished telling them, it's been an interesting year. I think at times we did
some really, really good things, and I thought we were a good team. And then
there were times where we didn't do good things and we were not a good team.  
  
I'm proud how we came here and fought. It could have been easy for us just to
maybe want to get the season over with, with losing seven games in a row. But
these guys showed that there's something in them. There's a fight, there's a
competitive spirit that we have to figure out how to tap into all the time.  
  
So I'm proud of that. Again, I thought we took a step forward as a program.
You know, it stinks that it's over. It hurts. But hopefully we can use this,
use the pain, use the disappointment to fuel us in our work and our commitment
to getting this program back on a national level.  
  
Q. For Xavier or Trey, Coach talked about how you guys showed some
fight. From where you were a year ago to now, do you guys feel like you 've
made real strides in not only your personal game but growing this program and
kind of taking the step forward that Coach talked about?  
TREY McGOWENS: I mean, yeah, this summer we worked real hard. I mean, of
course the season didn't go as planned, but I feel like we got better and made
a step in the right direction for the program.  
  
XAVIER JOHNSON: I felt like we worked hard this summer. Everybody came in
every day and tried their hardest, but it didn't go as we planned.  
  
Q. For each of you guys, what do you want to work on this summer? What
do you think is kind of the biggest thing you want to improve on in your
games?  
XAVIER JOHNSON: I mean, the main thing is my jump shot. I think my jump shot
is still not there to where it has to be at this level.  
  
TREY McGOWENS: Just jump shot, handle, and being a better leader.  
  
Q. Late in the second half, it seemed like you guys, as soon as you were
getting the ball into the offensive zone, it seemed like you were pressing the
first shot available rather than not necessarily the best shot. Was that what
you were thinking out on the floor, too? You 've just got to try to make up
some points, et cetera?  
TREY McGOWENS: I don't think so. I think at the end they only went zone like
one or two possessions.  
  
XAVIER JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, they didn't really go zone, so I can't speak on
that.  
  
Q. Jeff, you guys were down, I think, six, and they scored five straight
possessions, like Devon Daniels got in the lane a couple times for some
floaters, a couple of stick backs. What went wrong for you in that sequence?  
JEFF CAPEL: I felt like one of the main things was Xavier picked up his fourth
foul so he was out of the game, and I thought that threw off the rhythm of
what we were doing offensively and defensively. They were able to get in the
paint, get easy baskets. You know, they were able to get offensive rebounds.
They were able to get some turnovers and attack us in transition. But I
thought that was a big key when he picked up his fourth foul. That was a big
key for us.  
  
Q. Jeff, just following up on that, when Xavier got the flagrant foul,
it really seemed to knock your players back a little bit. State got on a roll.
Was there a reason why you saw that they kind of just looked a little aimless
for a while on offense trying to find their way back?  
JEFF CAPEL: I think if you take anyone's starting point guard off their team,
there's going to be a drop. I thought Xavier was doing some good stuff for us.
He was getting in the paint. He was creating offense for us. And when he goes
out, our offense changes. Some of the things that we run, some of the things
that we're able to run, those things change, and so I thought that was a big
key.  
  
Q. The shooting percentage kind of dropped off from the first half to
the second half. Do you think that had to do, I guess, more with you guys,
more their defense?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, I think their defense was good. Again, they're a really good
team. I don't want to take anything away from that. But Xavier was out of the
game for a good part of it, and I thought that had a lot to do with it, as
well. We missed some lay-ups. We missed some stuff around the basket. I think
their size, their length and their relentlessness made us maybe peek over our
shoulder a little bit instead of concentrating on finishing. But I do think a
big part of it was Xavier was out of the game.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Aamir Simms](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38104)

### [Hunter Tyson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38983)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 69, Miami - 64  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Great win for our guys. I thought we played very well
defensively throughout. Certainly Chris Lykes was outstanding, especially in
the second half. He's a difficult cover. I thought these two guys really gave
us a lot of energy, and Amir played with tremendous poise in the second half.
Hunter made some big shots. And I thought offensively we just were really
good. The longer the game went, I thought we got into a better rhythm, I
thought our pace was better, and certainly the ability to make free throws
down the stretch by Al was big, as well.  
  
Q. Amir, what was kind of the main difference there that last 15 minutes
offensively for you guys? It just seems like not only do you find your shots
but you were maybe more aggressive. Was it kind of a go-for-broke style in
some ways because you knew there was no tomorrow if you didn 't make something
happen?  
AMIR SIMMS: I think the key for us, I think in the first half we got sped up a
little bit and that kind of gave them the opportunity to come back a little
bit and make their run because when you speed up and play fast on offense, it
creates offer for transition and stuff, and I think in the second half once we
slowed down, we showed poise and just played together and kind of controlled
the pace of it, we just got -- we were able to make more shots than they were.  
  
Q. Amir, where is the confidence level with this team? You guys have
beaten some of the best teams in this league, a little bit inconsistent but
you guys got to be feeling good right now?  
AAMIR SIMMS: Most definitely. That's a good win for us. We had to get pay back
from them for the first time anyway, but even going into tomorrow we're not
looking back on the first two times we played Florida State think like it's
going to go like that again. We've got to refocus, watch film, learn from our
mistakes and see if we can apply. We don't question our confidence because we
know we can do it, we have the evidence, coach told us we have the evidence
that we can compete with the best of the best and going into tomorrow we're
just going to try to play our game and not let their game affect us.  
  
Q. Hunter, what was it like for you to be in such a crucial stretch in
the second half? You had some veteran guys like Mack and Clyde on the bench
and then Coach stuck with you out there in a long stretch and obviously with
the season on the line.  
HUNTER TYSON: Yeah, I think that just goes back to my work. I feel like I work
really hard, so when we get in positions like that that are really crucial, I
just fall back on my fundamentals and my hard work so I know I'm prepared for
that moment, and I feel like my teammates trusted me and my coach trusted me,
so I think that's why we were able to be successful with me out there on the
floor.  
  
Q. I feel like it 's fair to say that this team is different than the
team that played Miami back in December. What's the difference, and how has
this team grown?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Probably just a little more consistent in terms of us having
our roster the way that we've had it for the last couple months. We were still
getting players back and adjusting our roster and trying to play with rhythm,
especially on the offensive end. And I think that the longer this group that
we've kind of had here for the last six to eight weeks has been together,
we've played better. So really I think that's the single greatest factor. I
think the first two months of the season, we were still a team trying to
really figure out who we were in terms of not just our identity but really who
we were in terms of who can play, who's going to be here every day, who can we
count on, who's not hurt, who's not injured. And so I think that's helped.  
  
Q. Coach, felt like in the middle of the second half it was mostly a
three-point shooting contest, but then Hunter scored on a drive, I think
Newman scored on the drive. Was that a conscious effort to start taking the
ball to the hole, get to the line?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, we made a little bit of an adjustment to try to create a
few more gaps on the perimeter so we'd have more space to make some plays. You
know, I think both teams tried to protect the paint, and so it's hard to get
it inside. I know everybody sometimes challenges teams that shoot a lot of
threes, but sometimes the defense kind of dictates that, and I think a lot of
the game both teams dictated that with each other, that there just wasn't a
lot of ways to get in there. We made a couple adjustments that helped us on a
few possessions and then they adjusted back, and then we just kind of went
back to our base offense and ran that pretty well for a good portion of the
second half.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on, again, allowing Tyson to kind of ride out that
hot streak for a while, and then obviously you have to be thrilled in a win or
go home game, 18 of 19, all in the second half from the free-throw line from a
team that 's been a little inconsistent obviously from the line this year?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, the free throws were big. You're trying to close out
games and really we were aggressive in executing our offense, and so we made a
lot of drives and made some cuts. I think Al made a great back cut off a post
feed, and so we made aggressive offensive plays that resulted in drawing
fouls. So pleased because that's really -- for our team, our team is about
executing. We have to execute. We're not physically as dominating as most of
the teams we play in this league, and so it's a little bit more of a challenge
for us to score at the rim, to score in the paint without executing.  
  
Just in regards to Hunter, we've got a lot of confidence in Hunter. He's grown
tremendously as a player from his freshman year to his sophomore year. He's a
confident player. He's a confident person. So it doesn't surprise me in the
least that he's going to raise up and shoot a three with a minute and a half
or two minutes to go in a game. That's what he does. It's one of the reasons
why we recruited him. We felt like he was a confident player.  
  
He's still developing physically to be able to sustain and to play long-term
minutes at this level, but certainly he was playing with confidence. He was
giving our team energy on the defensive end, and I wanted to reward that
because the group that was out there was playing very well together.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Buddy Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39020)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 81, North Carolina - 53  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: After the game in Syracuse, they just dominated us on the boards
and their ball movement, they just got a lot of good looks, so the one thing
we wanted to try to do tonight was to just shore up our defense a little bit
better, try to make it a little bit harder for them to get open looks. I
thought our perimeter defense was good tonight, and they missed some shots. I
mean, that's part of the game.  
  
Offensively Elijah and Marek got us off to a good start and we got control of
the game early and just never let it up. It was a great win after what just
happened not very long ago in Syracuse.  
  
We've been resilient. We've bounced back. The teams that have beat us in
Syracuse, we've come back and beat them on the road. But this was kind of like
a road game.  
  
But really proud of these guys. They played really well today.  
  
Q. The announcement that tomorrow 's games if they're played will be
played without fans, what are your thoughts on playing in a potentially empty
gymnasium?  
BUDDY BOEHEIM: It's obviously for the right reasons, just trying to prevent
this in the best way possible. Obviously it's a different feel. It's going to
be much different. Our fans are great on the road, so that's definitely a
setback. But we've just got to treat it like another game, the same thing, and
we just need to play off our own energy, and it will take probably a little
bit to get used to it, but just go out there and treat it like another game.  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Piggy-backing off that, just bringing our energy. We have a
great fan base on the road. They're really big for us, but this happens for a
reason, this is a good reason and can't do nothing about it, just got to try
to control the controllables and try to bring our energy tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you guys are locked in on the game, but how aware are you of
some of the stuff happening throughout the day, the ACC announcing no fans
tomorrow and even at halftime of your game the NBA suspending its season?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: I found out the NBA suspending the series at halftime, and it's
something, like I say, we don't control, but we've just got to come tomorrow,
bring our energy. It sucks what's going on, and I hope they find a cure for
this soon, but we've just got to control what we can control.  
  
BUDDY BOEHEIM: Yeah, it's tough. I heard the news also at halftime, and it's a
little, it takes a while to get used to what's really happening that the NBA
is in a lockdown. We've just got to be as cautious as possible and really take
this seriously, but it's just kind of keeping track with everything and making
sure I'm aware.  
  
Q. Elijah, obviously you got a chance to return to play in this
tournament in Charlotte last year, but having this monster performance in such
a lopsided win, does it mean anything for to you that you started your college
career about 160 miles down the road in this state?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: I mean, it's cool, I guess. I had a couple friends from my old
school come and support me and watch me, and that was pretty cool. But it's
just another game. Just going out there and doing what I love to do.  
  
Q. I believe they got to within four at one point and I think it was a
seven-point game late in the half and then you went on the 14-0 spurt late in
the half. What got that started and what was successful for you there and do
you feel like that took them out of it?  
BUDDY BOEHEIM: Well, we just started getting stops and Bourama stepped up on
Anthony and got a flagrant foul, which was huge for us. He hit two free
throws. I was able to hit a turnaround, go up 11, and from that point on it
was just a big momentum shift, and I thought we really took the game over. We
were just getting stops, then Elijah operated on the offensive end and he had
a big first half and then just played off him and getting stops.  
  
Q. You guys enter tonight with a nine-game losing straight to UNC, first
win in six years. What about that match-up was so difficult for so long, and
what was kind of the prep heading into tonight that led to this 30-point
blowout?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: I mean, they're a good team, well-coached, they run good sets
against us, they hit the glass, they run the court, and they're a good team.
We came out today wanting to take it a little personal. They came to our home
court and they beat us, and we just wanted to take it personal.  
  
BUDDY BOEHEIM: Yeah, like he said, North Carolina is always a great team. Even
this year they have the pieces and they always have a good rebounding team,
one of the best in the country, so that's tough against the zone. We all have
to help out and that's all we focused on today was getting to the boards, and
we did a great job only losing by four. So just rebounding and getting on the
shooters, not letting Cole Anthony get his looks.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think the main thing is I think five losses they had the
National Championship team and a runner-up, so I think that's why we lost.
They were good, really good, and we weren't.  
  
Q. In the first game Cole Anthony really shot the ball well in the
second half against you guys. Tonight he was pretty locked from the get-go. Do
you change anything schematically to focus on him?  
BUDDY BOEHEIM: Just staying out on their sets. They ran a scissor cut twice
against us where the two guards are screening me and Joe up top and he got a
three on one play and an alley-oop so we knew coming in we had to stop that,
so just little things on him, getting out, not letting him get to his right
hand and we did a really good job on him, everyone was locating him and we did
a great job finding shooters.  
  
Q. You 've been around college basketball for 44 years coaching. How
surreal of a moment is this for you right now with what's going on?  
JIM BOEHEIM: It's really, really difficult. It's really hard. You know, I'm
hoping as a coach and a former player that these kids get to play. But I don't
think we know the depth of what this is. It obviously is not a good look,
what's going on, what happened to the rest of the world and now come here. I
just don't know how we keep people safe because if kids go home they're going
to go out. They're going to be in the community. It's difficult. It's
difficult to know what the right thing to do is.  
  
I think that my hope was that we could play the games. This could have been
our last game, but my hope would be for the players to get to play the games
that they've worked so hard to get to where they are. Teams like Dayton who
have come out of nowhere and just have an opportunity to really win a National
Championship. You hope those kids get that opportunity.  
  
Obviously we've got to be safe. We've got to do what's the safest thing. I'm
not sure anybody knows yet from listening to everything. But I just hope as a
coach that we can play these games.  
  
We practice every day with nobody there, and we expect our players to go as
hard there as they do in the game. And many times it's ironic, in the NCAA
Tournament, we've many times had games in the first and second round where
there's been almost no noise, little noise, very few fans. I just hope the
kids get to play the games. That's all. They've worked hard to get here.  
  
Q. I 'm wondering, since you guys were the last game today, there was
all kinds of strangeness going on, all kinds of reports going on about what's
happening in your league and different leagues. How much did you communicate
to your team?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I slept all day, so I don't know. Didn't talk to anybody. I don't
talk to anybody the day of the game. We have a meeting, we go over what we're
going to do with the players, and then we come to the game. We can only
control what we can control. They make -- whatever decisions are made, we're
going to have -- we will obviously do what we're told to do. But a typical
game day, yesterday we had a pretty good solid -- really good short practice.
You know, the way North Carolina played against us in Syracuse, we had to make
some unbelievable changes, and the players had to make some unbelievable
adjustments in how they played. Really my only hope in this game is that we've
played better on the road this year, and this was like a road game.  
  
But the players just took the game over. Bourama was tremendous, as he was the
last time we played Carolina. When we played in the Dome, Buddy and Bourama
played well, everybody else just didn't have a very good game, and we didn't
defend at all. But I thought obviously we defended -- they're a hard team to
keep off the board, they attack our zone as well or better than anybody, and
we just did a better job. A lot of it was Bourama and Quincy and Marek were
really good. Marek we wanted to get him isolated in the beginning, get him to
the basket against their big guys, and he did that and got us off to a good
start. Then Elijah got going. So we got a great start, and then we were able
to keep it up, keep going.  
  
But it's a really good win. Really good.  
  
Q. You talked about how well Bourama played tonight. He 's really been
good over the last five, six games. What are the little things or specific
things he's doing to make him better?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, six games, seven games I gave him a couple hints, and I
should have told him those things earlier, right? No, he just started playing
like that. I don't know what happened, honestly. You know, when he was a
freshman, he was hurt, he really had pain. But for some reason he had some
pain-free days, and at Pittsburgh he had 17.6 rebounds, another game like that
and then the rest of the series he was hurting all the time. Same thing last
year. So this is the first year he's been healthy, in the summer he was really
good and I really expected him to do what he's doing, 12 -- 10 points, 10
rebounds. I figured that would be the low end. And he was like five and five.
Part of it was foul trouble. He was five rebounds -- five and a half rebounds
in 20 minutes. If he can stay in the game, he's going to get eight or nine.
And he's staying in the game now, and he's just moving better, playing better.
I think he's a really good player -- I mean, I think he can really get a lot
better. Marek helps him because he finds him. They're a good combination
together, and I think they're getting better all the time. And I think Quincy
is getting better. And those guys are young guys that can come back. And I
think our guards are getting better. So I think we've shown improvement and
we've shown toughness. We just have for some reason on the road -- I mean, we
had Clemson beat the whole game and we had Florida State four down with a
minute, two minutes to go. We win those two games it's a different season.
It's not that easy to win when you're a young team on the road in any league.
We had an opportunity, until Elijah got hurt at Miami, to win our seventh
league road game, and they've done a great job. We're young. We started out,
we were terrible in the beginning of the year, and we've gotten better. We
have gotten better.

## March 10, 2020

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Landers Nolley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38980)

### [Jalen Cone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38981)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Virginia Tech - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: There will be better days ahead for the Hokies; I can assure you
of that. You guys go ahead.  
  
Q. What about North Carolina 's defense made it a tough shooting night
for the team?  
JALEN CONE: They can shoot the ball really well. Brandon Robinson, we knew
coming into the game he was a great shooter, and we gave them some wide open
opportunities, so next year that's just something we got to work on on the
defensive end is getting to those shooters.  
  
Q. Landers, you guys scored 56 points tonight; 45 of those were scored
by freshmen. What does it say about the youth of this group and how do you
think that group kind of gelled all year?  
LANDERS NOLLEY: We played well together, got better as the season went on, did
what we always did. That got us some success early in the season. Hit some
rough patches but tried to weather the storm and get back to playing Hokies
basketball and we just came up short.  
  
Q. Jalen, you mentioned Brandon Robinson; at that point when he made
those two back-to-back 3-pointers, did it feel -- did you see anything
specific on that play and did it feel like that was sort of a turning point
momentum wise?  
JALEN CONE: When he hit those shots he definitely got the arena into it, and
he gave their team a lot of energy and momentum, and I think at that moment we
should have shut his water off and not let him hit any more and really got
some stops. But we failed to do so, and they kept knocking down shots.  
  
Q. Tough shooting night for your team. What about North Carolina 's
defense made it a tough shooting night, or was it just kind of missing good
looks?  
LANDERS NOLLEY: Got great looks, just missed some open shots. Shot a couple
contested shots, defense was -- they play a pretty good defense. I mean,
credit them, they got the win. But we had good opportunities, we just didn't
capitalize.  
  
Q. Jalen, I think the team went 5-14 on lay-ups today. Something about
their size that when you go in for a lay-up that it 's a little nerve-racking
in there, or do you have any explanation for why it was so tough to make lay-
ups tonight?  
JALEN CONE: They are big down there, so when you get down there in the lane
they kind of force you to get it up a little higher, but some of those were on
me. I'm going to see that in the film to where I actually should have kept my
dribble alive and got it out to one of my shooters because they like to crash.
But we just weren't knocking down shots that we normally make tonight.  
  
Q. Landers, how much difference, if at all, did kind of the atmosphere
make in what was supposed to be a neutral site game but kind of felt like a
North Carolina home game?  
LANDERS NOLLEY: Great atmosphere for them, great atmosphere for us. I mean we
just came to play basketball. The atmosphere was good, it contributed to their
run, got them sparked. It was a good atmosphere to play in.  
  
Q. Jalen, you committed to the Hokies a little bit after Mike took the
job. What are some of your biggest takeaways from your freshman year? You had
some very successful games here as a freshman.  
JALEN CONE: I knew Coach Young was a great coach coming in and I liked the
style of play, and I knew most importantly he was a winner. He was able to win
with the team he had versus bigger teams, so that's the main thing, I wanted
to play for a winner and I know we're going to look back on the season and
look at our takeaways and this off-season be a different team when we come
back.  
  
Q. You guys beat these guys during the regular season. Obviously they
didn 't have Cole Anthony, but how different a team did they look like feel
like tonight?  
LANDERS NOLLEY: Different pace, kind of a different style of play, more not
really running plays, just good movement, good basketball. It was just a
different look.  
  
JALEN CONE: The game was a lot faster. They play faster with Cole on the
floor. On our make and miss shots, he's getting the ball at the three-point
line and pushing it full speed. So it causes us to have to get back on
transition. Last game they really didn't have much transition, but this game
they had a lot more with him on the floor and Brandon Robinson shooting the
ball well, running the lane lines.  
  
Q. Landers, you finished with 16 wins this year, seven in the ACC. With
a young team, how do you view the season and what does that mean for you guys
looking ahead to next year?  
LANDERS NOLLEY: Great season, great takeaways from it to help us get better
for next year. I enjoyed it, playing with the guys. It was fun. I mean we're
going to get better in the off-season and come back stronger.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You 're not only the youngest team in the league but you're the
smallest team. Given those circumstances, how would you assess your first
season?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know what, pretty damned good. Considering what I found on
April 8th with good players graduating, 7-13 is never going to be good enough
in Blacksburg nor should it be. 16-16 is never going to be good enough in
Blacksburg, nor should it be. But to cobble that together and do so with some
really quality people and scrap and claw and some great moments, some not-so-
great moments, but we're off and running now, if you will. Things are in
place. The foundation is in place.  
  
We start back with our spring workouts and it's not new. We have done it. We
know what we're looking at now. We know how things are going to operate and
how we're going to run. And I am looking forward to that. I'll be honest with
you now, there were times I thought I was hanging on for dear life trying to
get a little bit more and we did. We had a tough stretch late January,
February. This isn't the best league to be young and small in. As many of you
that have covered this league for many years, I'm not sure that there's a
league in America that's good to be young and small. We're going to look a lot
different a year from now, I can assure you of that.  
  
Q. What about North Carolina was a tougher matchup today than when you
beat them in January at your place?  
MIKE YOUNG: Well, obviously not being in the Castle. It was like being in the
Smith Center in there tonight. Bacot and Garrison are just big physical
presence type of people, and Cole gives them the opportunity to push the ball
at a different pace than what we encountered in our first meeting with Black
and Francis playing the point. That's just a different game. And that's not a
knock on Leaky; I think Leaky is a terrific player, but that's not his natural
spot and he doesn't move as briskly up after a made shot, after a missed shot,
what have you.  
  
And I think Brandon Robinson has had really a nice year for them. I thought
going into our first meeting he was their best perimeter shooter. I certainly
feel that way coming out. That's difficult for any of us to lose two front-
line guys like that, to have them on the shelf as they were in the first
meeting, so there were a lot of things that went into it.  
  
Q. You heard me say 45 of your 56 points come from freshmen. You
mentioned the crowd, the Smith Center atmosphere. How do you think your young
guys handled the ACC Tournament this week?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know what, you know, fine. We're still, we're hanging on, we
just can't put a couple of stops together, we can't get a couple of shots down
and we're trying like crazy to get Cone and others behind some things. All of
those experiences, I go back to Maui, Michigan State and playing that terrific
Dayton team and all of these experiences that we have had throughout the year
will benefit us greatly. That can be overwhelming, that can be intimidating
for young people. I thought they acquitted themselves quite nicely throughout
the year, I really did.  
  
Q. You had some momentum going into halftime.  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, we did.  
  
Q. You started the second half with seven straight empty possessions,
and I think you only scored on two of your first 12.  
MIKE YOUNG: I recall. I recall.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts about what happened to the offense?  
MIKE YOUNG: Well you've got to score. I mean, you've got to score the
basketball. I can remember three of the first seven, four of the first seven.
There was a quick shot in there, I'll go back and look at it tonight, tomorrow
morning and I'm going to -- I know I'll say that was a kid that we want
shooting the basketball, and it was a rhythm shot, it was a practice shot, he
just missed it. Certainly North Carolina's defense had something to do with
it, but as I said earlier, you put so much pressure on your defense -- I
haven't that a lot in my career. You put so much pressure on your defense when
you don't score it. At some point the levy breaks and you got a problem
against, you know, I think a more explosive North Carolina team here in the
last two, three weeks than we have seen to this point.  
  
Q. When you go into game that on paper is a neutral site but in reality
is a home game for North Carolina, how does that impact your preparation? Did
it affect the execution at all?  
MIKE YOUNG: You know, somebody does those probabilities, you know, and I think
going into Saturday's game I think our probability to play North Carolina down
here was not very good. That's my luck this year. We get that, but, you know,
certainly special to be here, Tobacco Road, Greensboro and to play the Tar
Heels and see Coach Smith compete against, pardon me, Coach Williams, and
compete against Coach Williams again, we'll look forward to wherever we go
next year. This is a special event and it was a treat to be a part of it.  
  
Q. 29 percent from the field; was that a lot of bad looks because of
their defense, good looks that just weren 't falling?  
MIKE YOUNG: Let me go back and look at it. I thought we had great shots. Now
we had a couple, the environment, we haven't had very much of that at all
through out the year. We had a couple of -- we had a terrible turnover. We
weren't aware of the shot clock. The awareness of the shot clock offensively
is every bit as important as the defensive end, and we had a couple of cracks
at it and we were looking for something a little bit better. I would say when
it's all said and done, go back and watch it, a combination of the two.

## March 10, 2020

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Brandon Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38099)

### [Garrison Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37064)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 78, Virginia Tech - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we're glad we're here. I'll donate some money to the
conference office to get a lightbulb in those steps up there where I am almost
broke my dadgum neck. If we had lost the game, I would have done it
intentionally probably, so if you'll let me know how much a lightbulb costs
there, I know John Swofford, I'll send him a check.  
  
Very happy to still be here. Told the kids, let's play as hard as we can play,
as well as we can play, and at the end somebody may let us stay around and
play another one, and I thought that's what we did. I thought we were really
lucky early in the second half because they had a tremendous number of shots,
lay-ups and shots that just rolled off the rim. I think they just missed them.
Our defense wasn't making them do that.  
  
And after the first five or six minutes of the second half I thought our
defense got a lot better. We fouled one of the three-point attempts, which we
don't like to do, but I thought our defense was better.  
  
But in the second half we were good offensively, we only had two turnovers I
think in the second half. We tried to make an effort to get the ball into
Garrison and he made baskets. He also found B-Rob on one big three, and B-Rob
going five for six from the three-point line was extremely important to us, as
well. So we're lucky, we played well enough and we now we get to stay and play
another game. Unless they cancel the tournament or something we'll be here
playing tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Garrison and Brandon, please.  
  
Q. Garrison, what did you guys do to get you more involved in the second
half? You had a couple of slips and some other stuff in the lane?  
GARRISON BROOKS: Just basically executing our game plan. There's a couple
plays that Coach drew up and we just executed well.  
  
Q. Brandon, after the step-back three, I believe you yelled, "I'm here."
What was kind of the emotion there and what was going through your mind?  
BRANDON ROBINSON: I'm just fired up. I get another opportunity to put this
jersey on. It is my senior year and I don't want it to end, and just our fans
were doing a great job tonight. It felt like a home game and I just love being
here.  
  
Q. Garrison, what did you make of B-Rob 's night? Did you think he had a
cross-over like that?  
GARRISON BROOKS: Yeah, for sure. I know B-Rob had that cross-over since high
school. I saw it a real long time ago.  
  
Q. Garrison, sort of a related question, when you see B-Rob 's shot "I'm
here," what are you thinking when you see that sort of energy?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I'm really excited to see him out there, playing with him.
He's been just really big for us this year and just seem seeing him do all
these good things for our team is great.  
  
Q. Brandon, when you 're hot for that, five for six, what does that feel
like to you?  
BRANDON ROBINSON: It's a credit to Garrison, honestly, because he did a good
job of scoring the ball besides just playing his butt off all year, and so
teams have been looking to double down on him, so when they leave me open,
it's my job to knock it in, and he's been doing a good job of finding me and
just always in my ear just telling me to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. Brandon, you mentioned this feeling like a home game tonight. Given
the hill you guys are trying to climb this week, how critical is it to have
the fan support like that?  
BRANDON ROBINSON: It's definitely good to have the fan support. They were
getting into the game and they were getting loud and they made it difficult
for the other team to hear their offensive sets because every time down the
court they were calling plays and looking over at their bench so it was good
to disrupt their communication.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: What B-Rob said. (Laughing.)  
  
BRANDON ROBINSON: You can just say the same thing over again. I feel you.  
  
Q. Garrison, you started just one for five from the field in the first
half. You made our free throws. You made everything in the second half. First
time you played a game in this building this year, was that it? Or why did you
shoot so much better in the second half?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I took the goggles off. Yeah, that's it. I think that's the
thing. I take the goggles off, I think I shoot a little bit better.  
  
Q. For either, can you speak to the brotherhood that you guys have,
because Christian Keeling went out and he was seriously hurt and then he came
back and you could see him pushing over the trainer 's help, like he wanted to
get back in that game. Can you guys speak to him wanting to come back and be
with you all?  
BRANDON ROBINSON: That's Paul Pierce right there. Go look up the Paul Pierce
video.  
  
No, but we all love each other. This whole year we have all been battling
injuries, we all have been going through tough times. So just to see him come
back out there and push through it, I was proud of him, and it just speaks
volumes to this team. We all care about each other. We all have one goal, and
that's just to win this tournament, but we got to take it game by game and we
need all hands on deck to be able to do that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said at the end of your opening statement that you guys will play
as long as the tournament doesn 't get cancelled. Other tournaments are not
allowing spectators, one tournament has been cancelled. What are you hearing
from your end as far as the possibility of the ACC deciding to cancel this
tournament or not allow spectators to participate?  
ROY WILLIAMS: The only thing I'm hearing is because of this that we're going
to cancel the ACC spring meetings. I think that would be the greatest thing in
the history of this conference. (Smiling.) No, I'm like you guys, I watch TV
and don't hear anything else. Bubba is in constant contact. Different leagues
make their decisions for their reasons. The ACC will make whatever decision is
continued to be made for the right reasons, as well.  
  
It's a terrible situation. I mean, it's scary. I mean, at the end of the game
I was mad at myself because I shook hands with all the other guys and I meant
to give them the elbow hit, but, no, it's -- this is not a good situation in
our country right now and we don't have a great handle on what's going to
happen next. I watched CNN most of the day today and about every hour the
numbers go up of the cases and numbers continue to go up about the people that
lost their lives.  
  
So on a humorous note, I get frustrated because they talk about old people and
they started that at 60. I'm 69, God almighty. So that's the humorous thing
that I can put. But it's not a humorous situation, I mean it really is not.
It's sad that it's happening, and our country is always very resilient and
make great decisions in what to do and people are -- the governor of New York,
for example, closes down one area trying to get people to come in to clean
things and to provide help, and it's very scattered. You listen to one news
station compared to the other news stations it's like we're in two different
countries and that frustrates me.  
  
But with the ACC, if they tell me to show up and coach a game, I'm going to
show up and coach a game. But I do think you guys should try to promote no ACC
meetings this spring. I'll play 36 more if we can do that.  
  
Q. Mike Young and his players touched on the difference that Cole made
running and getting the pace faster than it was up in Blacksburg. What did you
see from your vantage point?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Cole was very important to us and was good. And he can be really
good. I mean, he ran the play that we sincerely put it in -- maybe it was
yesterday or today one. I just wanted something different to play and he ran
it to perfection twice in a row and Garrison got dunks out of it.  
  
But having Cole in the game makes me a lot better coach. He didn't have one of
his great games. He's four for four on assist-to-error ratio, but he was the
man in charge out there, he was the guy that put us where we needed to be and
made some shots, missed two straight free throws, which he hasn't done that
very often, but the good news is he got his feet wet today in his first ACC
Tournament, and we need him to play better tomorrow.  
  
But there's no question Virginia Tech beat North Carolina at Virginia Tech,
but there's also no question that we're better off with Brandon Robinson and
Cole Anthony on our team.  
  
Q. Was this one of your more balanced games in terms of inside offensive
production and production from numerous players across the board?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I was trying to remember what we -- we shot 7-13 from three and
B-Rob's five of six, and then Andrew made one from downtown Greensboro at the
end, so that's probably better than any game we shot this year. But Garrison
has been effective inside, and I thought Armando was effective inside. He had
four offensive rebounds, 11 total, so we did have a little bit.  
  
Christian's been really shooting the ball really well and didn't make any in
the first half. I think he made one in the second half or something, or no,
maybe he made one late in the first half. But we did have a lot of guys that
got involved, and that usually is the best team when you have more than one
guy scoring.  
  
Q. You play every night as long as you keep winning. Does that affect
your substitution plans and pattern?  
ROY WILLIAMS: In some ways, but if you plan -- make substitutions hoping
you're going to be there the next night, sometimes you're not there the next
night. So what we're trying to do is put the best guys in the game at that
time to give us the best chance to win the game and then at the end if it's a
margin that you can get them out, then get them out. When I was 18, 19, 20
years old I never thought I was tired, so I think it's overrated.  
  
Q. B-Rob made those back-to-back 3-pointers you mentioned. What 's the
value of him then showing that sort of energy afterwards, and is that
something that even at the beginning of the year you maybe would have expected
from him?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I didn't hear him say it and didn't see him. I know he was
excited. We had a player one time for Coach Smith that took a bad shot and it
went in and took a bad shot and went in and took a bad one and missed it and
he came over and Coach Smith took him out, and he said, "I was feeling it,
Coach, I was feeling it." And Coach Smith said, "Well, see how that bench
feels." If I had known he had said "I'm here," I would have said "Well, come
right over here and be right here." You know, just play the game. Kids are
going to be kids though.  
  
Q. How much of a benefit at all is there playing a team from a
preparation standpoint on day 2 that you faced nine, 10 days ago?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's the same for both teams. So it's not an advantage either
way. In one situation that's the only team we have played all year long that's
played almost an entire game in the zone. And that's what Jimmy does and they
can press and they can play man-to-man, they work on that regardless of what
people think, but they press and they play zone. So in one way that possibly
could help, but again that's the only team we faced all year long that played
zone the whole game.  
  
Q. Can you speak to Christian or speak for Christian and bringing him
back in, what was your decision making going with that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, if he was going to sit over there, if he was able to go
back in and play, I wanted to put him in because if he is sitting over there
he gets even more stiff. And then if he goes out and plays and perhaps
loosened up and feeling better about it and feel more confident about it, that
if we do win, then he's got a chance to a better chance, in my opinion he's
got a better chance to play the next day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, Coach.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Remember what I said when we were talking about ACC meetings.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2020

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Brandon Childress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32821)

### [Olivier Sarr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38977)

### [Isaiah Mucius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38978)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Pittsburgh - 81, Wake Forest - 72  
  
DANNY MANNING: Really exciting first half of the game in terms of you're
looking at the score, I thought both teams played at a high clip offensively.
In the second half both teams cooled off a little bit. We cooled off a little
bit more than them. We didn't do a good enough job of staying in front of the
basketball and challenging shots off of any type of dribble penetration. They
got to the point of getting the shot up and then also they had 11 offensive
rebounds, but they really did a good job of converting those into points where
they got 17 second-chance opportunities. We got 13 second-chance opportunity
points off of 16 offensive rebounds, we just didn't convert enough in that
category. We had some guys do some really good things offensively, but at the
end of the day we didn't make them miss enough shots to give ourselves a
chance to win, and that created some separation from us in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what clicked in the first half for you and what got you
going, and then did they make an adjustment on you that kind of took those
things away from you?  
ISAIAH MUCIUS: I think the confidence from my teammates, I think when the game
started they told me to be aggressive on both ends of the floor and try to be
a vocal leader out there. And it started clicking, I was hitting shots, they
kept feeding me the ball. I think in the second half they just started to take
me away, deny me, make other people score, so that kind of slowed me down in
the second half. I was in foul trouble so I was out for a couple parts of the
game, and that kind of affected how I was playing.  
  
Q. Brandon, they had 11 steals. What were they doing? Were they cutting
off passing lanes or were they just aggressive? What led to that?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I knew going into the game that every ball screen they were
going to either trap or the big was going to corral me; what that means is
basically when I come over, the big is going to stay there until the ball gets
out of my hand, and sometimes they were more aggressive than usual, and I was
careless with the ball. So as a senior point guard with four turnovers, it's
unacceptable.  
  
Q. Brandon, this might be the last time you wear a Wake Forest uniform.
How much pride do you have in this place, considering your dad, considering
everything you 've said about being Wake Forest's point guard, how much that
meant to you?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I mean, you can tell by my emotions after the game when I
came out I just let everything out. I gave Wake Forest all I had from the
moment I committed on October 24th of 2014 during Midnight Madness. I told
Coach Manning I wanted to come here and didn't even hesitate when I got the
opportunity. People don't know this; my father had no fingerprint in my
recruitment. It wasn't a bad thing, he just wanted me to make my own decision.
Coach Woodbury recruited me and he built the relationship, and after that I
always knew about Wake Forest but I always knew where I wanted to go and prove
people wrong that I belonged in the ACC. So being black and gold, that was
just, it's in my blood, so...  
  
Q. Olivier, given you guys shot over 60 percent, I think, in the first
half, did it feel like you guys should be up more than just one at halftime?  
OLIVIER SARR: Offensively we did a great job, we just didn't play defense
enough and that -- we didn't carry that on the second half, and that's what
got them the lead and they played really good, so yeah.  
  
Q. Brandon, obviously your relationship with your dad has been
tremendous for you this season. Can you just look back over your four years at
Wake Forest and talk about how that time has been for you?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: My father has played a tremendous role from being a mentor,
a friend, a brother, a father and a coach. From day one he told me we've got
to be able to separate father and son and coach and dad, and we drew that
line. I said going into my junior year when even Coach Manning told me I would
have to accept a bigger role, and there was going to be a little more weight
on my shoulders so I embraced that, and so the sacrifices he made for me from
-- I remember him picking me up from school and taking from me Winston to High
Point every day, to now we sit beside each other on bus trips and even plane
trips sometimes, watching film, and I can go home and get a home-cooked dinner
whenever I can.  
  
I mean a lot of people don't know what that guy does for me outside of
basketball. I mean, I try not to stress about basketball as much, but our
relationship outside of the 94 feet, I will always forever just cherish that,
and I love him. I can't thank him enough. We both let out a lot of emotions.
This was a heck of a journey. It's been a heck of a ride, and I appreciate
everyone that's been supportive of this. I'm thankful for these guys beside
me. I'm thankful for my coach and everyone else, but my father, I mean, these
guys will tell you how that relationship is, man. It's unbreakable; it's a
bond that will never be broken.  
  
Q. Brandon, can you reflect on maybe what you 're most proud of when you
think about your career here at Wake Forest?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: Just the development of our coaching staff, our development
of individual players on the team, as well, and the culture's gotten a lot
better since my freshman year, meaning that we just became a lot closer, and
it's really you can tell it's more like a fraternity with us, how well we bond
off the court. We spend a lot more time with each other.  
  
I can't wait to spend time with these guys soon just to embrace it. I graduate
in May, so spending time with these guys and just showing love to them and
just embracing what we built, and I know that I left a tremendous gift for
these guys, man, just showing these guys what it means to bleed black and
gold. I'm really proud of Olivier, third-ACC all-team. I mean, no one expected
that. I mean, I believed in him. I told him before the season I need you to be
the most improved player of the year. And as soon as we got in the locker
room, I told him I want nothing less than Player of the Year next year, so...  
  
Q. To all three, Brandon my first question for you is did you feel
snubbed by not being on any of the all-ACC teams, and to Olivier and Isaiah,
next season coming back, of course, you 're losing a dog in Brandon, but you
two God-willing will be coming back and Chaundee will be there. What are you
two looking forward to or optimistic about next season? I know it's a tough
loss you've just come off of, but thinking about next season.  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: You're right. You're right.  
  
Q. You feel snubbed?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: Definitely.  
  
Q. Or you felt like you should have been -- if you feel like you should
have been on the third team, do you know whose spot you should have took off
that team?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: It doesn't matter. My play showed for itself. You can --
despite numbers and whatever, I know I should have been up there and all the
guys who were voting know I should have been up there.  
  
Q. Olivier? Talking about next year.  
OLIVIER SARR: For us it's just we got a lot of returning guys. Even though
we're losing a lot of guards and especially Brandon, it's going to be a huge,
huge difference and we got Jacoby coming in. I think he's ready he to step in
that leadership role, too. We just got to work again, go back to the basics.
We got a lot of work to do off-season, film to watch, and use that time to get
better.  
  
ISAIAH MUCIUS: I think we're ready to work. The core guys, the older guys, me,
Olivier and Chaundee, I think, are ready to lead the young group of players
that we have. I think we have a lot of guys that have contributed throughout
the year. Ody, I don't think anybody really thought that he was going to be an
asset but he came in and was a dog for us, offensive rebounding, just really
attacked the glass every time he had to. Ish came in and had good minutes.  
  
So the young guys, they work every day. People don't really see it, but it's
just in the gym almost 24/7 they work. So they want to get better and they
want to win as much as we do, and I think Brandon and the seniors left their
mark of like, oh, yeah, just work. Brandon is one of the hardest workers I
ever met in my life. He just works every day and he rubs some of that on to
every single person on our team, and I think that's going to carry into next
year and I think we're going to make a change.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Last season ended with a press conference that said you were coming
back as coach. Do you expect to be back next year too?  
DANNY MANNING: Absolutely.  
  
Q. Have you seen the development and the steps taken to justify that?  
DANNY MANNING: I think our team has definitely improved. I think if you look
at the individuals that are on our team and how they have come from where they
were last year to where they're at right now, I think without question there's
been improvement. I think when I look at our team, I think the young men have
put forth great effort. Extremely proud of this group, and I definitely feel
like we have taken some steps, not as many as I would like, not where I'm
content with where we're at, but I certainly feel like we have taken those
steps in a direction that I want our program to go in.  
  
Q. Champagnie surely was showing up on your scouting report. How did he
get so open for a career high of 31 points I believe it was?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, he started out, he was their leading scorer in terms of
what they do, production-wise, and field goal leader, and we knew he was
certainly a capable three-point shooter. So he shot seven, he made three, but
he did a really good job of getting on the baseline and getting some back-door
cuts behind our head in our zone, and they did a good job of finding him.
Yeah, he got a hot hand and they did a good job of finding him, and we weren't
good enough in terms of trying to slow him down. So he got the hot hand and
they rode him out.  
  
Q. Did you need to stay in the zone because of the lack of options off
the bench, looked like you had basically a six-man rotation tonight.  
DANNY MANNING: No, I mean, going into the ballgame, the analytics piece, they
average about five threes a game. And that's something that they if I
understand, they finished the game with six tonight. We wanted some long shots
coming into it, so that was part of our game plan, and like I said, Champagnie
just, he got hot. I thought their other guys did a really good job. I thought
Xavier Johnson was really good in terms of coming off and attacking,
attacking, attacking and finding the open man with eight assists.  
  
Q. Five seasons out of six so far in your tenure have ended with more
than 18 losses. At this point are you enjoying your job as head coach at Wake
Forest, and are you at all concerned about fan apathy, given the lack of
attendance at Joel Coliseum?  
DANNY MANNING: I love coaching. To have an impact with helping young men grow
and develop and help them prepare for the future, I feel very fortunate and
blessed to be able to share my experiences. Our staff the same way. And then
help these guys. We want them to get better as basketball players, we want
them to continue to develop and grow as people and certainly I feel like that
is happening. Yeah, you want to win more games, there's no question about it,
and continue to work. But I will say that this is a group that I'm extremely
proud of because I think we have gotten better throughout the course of the
year from where we started.  
  
Q. What about the fan apathy?  
DANNY MANNING: Yeah, I mean, your fans are your fans. A lot of them expect
certain things, but at the end of the day you're going out there and you're
trying to do the best you can, night in and night out. And we certainly
appreciate our fans and we want to have that support to continue, but these
guys and the coaching staff are doing everything we can to continue to take
steps and get better.  
  
Q. The 18 turnovers and their 11 steals, was that more on their defense
or was that more on you guys not making great decisions passing the ball?  
DANNY MANNING: I think it's a little bit of both. We knew that they were going
to come out and be aggressive and we talked about getting to 3 near outlets
any time one person was double teamed. A lot of the turnovers for us too, you
factor in some, a charge or two, you factor in a travel or two, which
contributes to that, but a lot of times it was a deflection that they would
get and they would somehow come up with a loose ball. I think in the second
half -- in the first half I think there were three possessions where we
created some type of miss or deflection and we didn't come up with a loose
ball and they were able to score like six points. And that happened in the
second half too.  
  
But to answer your question, we knew they were going to come out and be
aggressive and we knew we needed to handle their pressure better. I think some
of those turnovers, you are never happy with them, but when you're down late
in the game you do have to press and try to go make some plays.

## March 10, 2020

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Trey McGowens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36698)

### [Justin Champagnie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38979)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Pittsburgh - 81, Wake Forest - 72  
  
JEFF CAPEL: First of all I'm really proud of my team. I didn't think we
defended well in the first half. One of our goals coming into the game was to
force turnovers. I thought we did a good job there, we forced 18. We wanted to
get the ball out of Childress's hands and so we tried to double him, really
from the four-minute mark of the first half on, every time he was in the ball
screen, and so our guys did a really good job of executing that.  
  
I thought these two guys up here were tremendous. To play with poise, Trey
made some big-time plays, a big-time pull-up jump shot, a big-time pass to
Justin cutting on the baseline, and had some really good moments. For Xavier
to have eight assists and only three turnovers, again, I thought he really
stirred the engine for us and made some big-time plays.  
  
And I thought two of our freshmen, Justin obviously and Karim, for those guys
in this stage, their first game in the ACC tournament, to come and have the
performances that they had is remarkable. And so proud of them, proud of all
of our guys.  
  
I feel for Wake. Brandon Childress has had an outstanding career. He's a kid
I've known since he was young, over at Wesleyan, and have known his family
forever and he's had a an amazing career. And Danny is a great guy, does a
really good job with his team. You look at the improvement of guys
individually and how much better they have gotten, particularly Sarr this
year. So feel for them, but excited for us and excited to have an opportunity
to play again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Justin, being a New York guy, did you follow the ACC tournament much
growing up? Were you a fan of some of the teams in this area or were you more
just kind of a Big East guy or did you kind of dream of getting to play in
this event, especially on Tobacco Road?  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: I never really watched it. That's the truth. But I used to
like watch St. John's because my dad went there, but it means a lot to come
out here and get the opportunity to play on a stage like this.  
  
Q. For both you guys, how beneficial was just having a little bit, a
little bit of time off, I think it was five or six full days, and where were
you guys physically before that stretch?  
TREY MCGOWENS: Physically I feel like we were kind of drained, legs were dead,
but mostly mentally the time off just gave us time to get our mind right, kind
of get away from basketball a little bit.  
  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: I think that helped us lot. I feel like getting away from
basketball sometimes is good for us as kids, so we could like regain focus on
like what's the task at hand. So I feel like it played a big part in how we
came out here and played today.  
  
Q. Justin, when you had 30 last time, we asked you if you were aware of
that during the game. Did you know you hit that mark again and had the chance
to break your career high there at the end with the free throws?  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: Yeah, that's why I held the ball. Murphy was telling me to
him to give it to me so I said no, I'm going to hold it.  
  
Q. For both you guys, seemed like as the game went on you got better and
better on defense. What did you feel like was working? They were making
everything in the first few minutes, but by the end you were really shutting
them down. What happened and how did you improve as the game went on?  
TREY MCGOWENS: I just feel like we just had to be in the right spots. We were
kind of late in our rotations early in the game. The energy was there but it
was just tough not being in the right spots.  
  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: We were so focused on the offensive end that we kind of
lacked on defense, so we just had to come out with more energy on the
defensive end and just be in the right spots.  
  
Q. Justin, you 've got other guys on here that all had double-digit
scoring. How much does that help you, knowing that you've got so many other
guys, that the team has so many other options, how much does that help your
game?  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: Yeah, because sometimes I can't always score the ball, so
it's good to know that my teammates around me like always have support around
me and that they're always playing and fighting together.  
  
Q. Justin, was making the all-ACC freshman team something you were
thinking about, and was not making it any kind of motivation?  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: Yeah, I wanted to make that team. I felt like I should make
it. I kind of felt disrespected when I found out I didn't make it, but at the
same time I used it as motivation and I just came out here and showed why I
should have been on the team.  
  
Q. Between the seven-game losing streak and this being a win-or-go-home
situation, for y 'all as a team, I mean, how much urgency, aggression and
intensity was there going into this game?  
JUSTIN CHAMPAGNIE: A lot. We always were talking about before the game started
like just leave it out on the line, like whatever you got and be the better
team. Don't want to go home, nobody wants to go home, so we're just going to
keep fighting and keep pushing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right we'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. How do you prepare your players for five games in five days?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, we just prepared for one. That's it. It was really, really
important for us to finally get a break. We were the only team in the league
that didn't get a bye. Our bye for whatever reason was at the end of the
season. So to go this year, being the first year of 20 ACC games, league
games, that's a lot, and we are -- this is not an excuse, this is just a fact,
we are a very, very young team. And from January 4th until last Wednesday we
were playing two games a week -- sometimes three games, three times a week.  
  
I thought we hit a wall there after we won the game against Georgia Tech. We
couldn't push through. So for us to have a chance after that game last
Wednesday at Georgia Tech, we got back at 3:00 in the morning, but to give
them Thursday and Friday off, and what I told them was just get completely
away from basketball. We have been in this, we have been mired in this losing
streak and there's a lot of stuff written, a lot of stuff said, and these
young people read this stuff. As much as you don't want them to, they do, and
it affects them.  
  
But I just thought physically I thought we were drained but mentally I thought
we were even more drained. We got back together on Saturday, and we really
just had individual workouts because we didn't know who we were playing. So we
got together and worked out for about 45 minutes to an hour, got a great lift
in, but took the rest of the day off. Then we traveled here, and so really our
focus is one game, all of our focus was on Wake Forest, that's it.  
  
It's no need to worry about tomorrow or what's upcoming, because we have to
earn the right to get there. And what we were able to do today we have earned
the right to play tomorrow. We're going to play against a really good NC State
team that's fighting for their post-season NCAA tournament life. We had a
great game with them a couple of weeks ago. Hopefully we can be a little bit
better tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned Justin earlier. Could you just go a little bit more in
depth just about how aggressive he was both inside and outside on the
offensive end and just how consistent he was from the start to the end of this
ballgame.  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, you know, you I think he's a really good player and I think
he's been one of the five best freshmen in this league all year. I think his
numbers show that. He's been our leading scorer and rebounder all year. That's
a heck of a thing for a freshman. He's been -- I think he was in the top 10 in
rebounding all year, and so he's had a heck of a season.  
  
I thought he was the one that really hit the wall the hardest. This is
different for a freshman, when you get to this level and the pressure and
these games coming at you. So I thought all of our guys benefited, but I
thought our freshmen really benefited the most.  
  
He's able to shoot the ball from the perimeter. He's continuing to get better
at putting the basketball on the floor. That's the next part of his game. He
can finish around the basket. That's what he did in high school. In high
school that's really what he did; he was mid-range to the basket, he didn't
really shoot threes. The three-pointer is something that he's added since he's
been here. He's really worked at it. He has the ability to do a lot of things.  
  
Q. Given the short turnaround, how beneficial is it to be playing a team
that you just saw less than two weeks ago?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, it helps. It helps because there's some familiarity, but
they're really good and they're going to run a bunch of ball screens, they
have multiple guys that can dribble, pass and shoot. I think Funderburk has
been one of the most improved guys in our league; I think Johnson is one of
the better guards in our league; Daniels has had a heck of a season; C.J. --
they can come at you in so many different levels. Their last game of the
regular season, Beverly went nuts, and so they're a really good basketball
team and it helps, but we worry a little bit about fatigue, but hopefully the
adrenaline of still being alive and having the opportunity to play will push
us through that.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked about Karim earlier; do you see something in these
games where he 's -- there's been a couple times this year where he's really
shown a greater potential than maybe we have seen at other times. What is it
about these games where he's able to come in and have some success?  
JEFF CAPEL: I think he's a good player. That's the very first thing, and I
think his transition to college has been a little bit tougher because of the
language. He didn't get to spend a summer with us. He was with his country and
they had an amazing run in their tournament, in the U-19s, but I just think
the more game experience that he's got -- I think that every game he's played
he's done a good job, and he's a guy that for whatever reason, he's been
better in games than he's been in practice. And he's a gamer and I thought
today he finished. I thought he did a really, really good job out there today.  
  
Q. You opened your comments by saying there 's been so much history in
this building, so many great games played here. Given your history in this
state, how important is it to you that Greensboro remains a part of the
rotation for this tournament?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well I think it's important. I mean, if you look at the history of
this league, this is where the tournament traditionally was before we had
expansion. I think it was here and Atlanta, in the Omni. That's the only two
places I remember it being as I was growing up here.  
  
You think of the greats of college basketball, they played in this building.
This state loves basketball and they love the ACC. And you know, anytime you
play here there's going to be passion in the building, there's going to be
excitement, there's going to be people and there's going to be people that
just love basketball. Certainly they have allegiance to their team, but they
love basketball.  
  
Q. I think it 's awesome that you're actually on the bench beside your
brother. Could you just speak on that a little bit and how that relationship
is and like growing up was there times where you dreamed of this or did this
just sort of work its way into fruition?  
JEFF CAPEL: Number one, it's awesome to be able to work with my brother and to
have him be a part of what we're trying to do and rebuild and all the things
there.  
  
It's not something that I dreamed of because I never dreamed I would be a
coach. That's not something when I was younger -- hell, even when I was in
college I never thought that I would do this. I got the bug a little bit
later.  
  
But once I got in the profession, I always wondered if there would be an
opportunity for us to work together. And when this opportunity came available
at Pittsburgh, one of the things that I knew, I understood that it was a
major, major rebuild, and so for me it was very, very important for me to have
people around me that I could trust, especially with my history and in
coaching. I needed people that, number one, were good. And he's been a head
coach, he knows this league, he played in it, he covered it, was a really good
player in this league. He's able to teach, he's able to connect, he's been a
head coach, so he has sat in the chair. But most importantly I trust him. And
it's been terrific.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Xavier Sneed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34871)

### [Mike McGuirl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39022)

### [David Sloan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39023)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 53, TCU - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We are now joined by the Wildcats of Kansas State,
Coach Bruce Weber. Coach, we will call on you for an opening statement.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: We have been through a lot of these games all year, people that
have fouled us and I think it's nine games we looked at last night that was 6
or less. A lot of them the same thing where we had leads and teams make runs
and we get dysfunctional and all three of these guys made good plays, David
back-to-back jump shots, Mike with a big pull-up and Xavier with a big shot
down the stretch. I'm happy for them. They grinded it out, fought their butts
off. I thought our defense was really, really good, slipped up a little bit at
the end of the half. You know, I know Bane had 16 but he had to take 17 shots
and has 5 turnovers, and I thought Mike did a great job with everybody
guarding him.  
  
I'm just happy for them. We get to live for another day and finally found a
way to win a close game and it's been a while, since the second game of the
season at UNLV, oh, Tulsa, I forgot that one at Christmas. Big plays, happy,
team effort, get to play another day.  
  
Q. Mike, what was going through your mind when you made those plays
coming down the stretch and what do you think led to your success there?  
MIKE MCGUIRL: Same thing Coach been preaching, X preached it before the game,
crunch time, or gut check time of the game, not folding this time and being
ready for it and executing and making the plays that we need to make and I was
just focused and along with my teammates, we were able to gut it out.  
  
Q. Xavier and David, would you mind talking about Mike 's game tonight,
8 points, 7 assists, 1 turnover and how big he was for you guys tonight?  
DAVID SLOAN: I feel like personally, I think Mike is really our glue guy. He
had 8, 6 and 7 and the stat sheet shows it and he usually guards the best
player then Xavier, so I feel like he does a lot on the court.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: Just like David said, you know, he does a lot on the court for
us. Sometimes it goes unnoticed and today he shined for us today.  
  
Q. Mike, just with everything going on today and also it being a new
season, new life for you guys, did you enter this game with a different
attitude or mentality than usually?  
MIKE MCGUIRL: In a way, yes, but I mean, it really started on senior night
when obviously X had the big at that game and we played defense and it started
against Kansas and we started to lock in on defense. We have just been trying
to carry it over and improve from game-to-game and I think we're building up
to what we know we could have been or should be.  
  
Q. Bruce, when it comes to Baylor, your next opponent, it didn 't go
well the second time you played at Waco and now you're going to play in front
of 350 people, your overall reaction to playing to an empty arena?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's let the student-athletes answer that.  
  
XAVIER SNEED: It's definitely going to be a different feel. It's basketball
the same way, lace your shoes up and go on the court and make the plays.  
  
DAVID SLOAN: Basically what X said. You gotta come out and play no matter
whose in the stands and just be ready.  
  
MIKE MCGUIRL: Piggyback off that, regardless of who is in the stands, although
we love to have our fans in the crowd, but regardless, we're trying to win the
game.  
  
BRUCE WEBER: You know, it's going to be different, like the guys kind of
teased, a preseason scrimmage. I think it's 125 tickets, that's what they're
going to allow for family and staff, so it will definitely be a different
feel. But you gotta come and play.  
  
You know, that's what it's about. For us it's our last chance. We said we had
dreams and goals before the season and didn't happen like we had hoped, but
now you got one last chance to be something you thought you could be. We
played them very well at our plays, obviously at their plays it was different
and they made every shot. Come and play. We had a game, we got to play, they
didn't. So hopefully we're a little more ready.  
  
Q. Xavier, you guys have been in this situation a lot this season coming
down to the wire and it 's gone the other way. What was special about tonight
that allowed you guys to make the clutch plays late and win?  
XAVIER SNEED: Like I said earlier, we learned and grew from all the
experiences we had this season and kept growing like I said before. These guys
did a good job of buying into the scout, had a really good game and locked in
on defense as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will let you guys return to the locker room. Thank you for
coming. Congratulations on the victory. We will see you tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bruce, with everything that 's gone on today and the news about the
fans and the NCAA tournament, the Big 12 tournament, what has been your
reaction and how tough was it to stay focused?  
BRUCE WEBER: The big thing is we knew we were going to play a game tonight and
if you win you get to play another one and that's the main thing for these
guys to have that one more opportunity for the seniors. I think what they said
was right. The last stretch probably after Baylor, the Kansas game, played 'em
really hard, I thought we played hard against Oklahoma State. Same thing, Iowa
State, Iowa State comes back tonight and it takes a game winner to beat them.  
  
If we guard and play that hard, I think we'll have a chance. Obviously it
helps to make a few shots, we did early, we didn't as it went on. Grind it
out, find a way to win. I would say that I know it's a tough decision, NCAA,
the Big 12, everybody. But, you know, I've tried to watch and we just can't
let what happened in China and Italy happen to our country. I think it's the
best decision for everybody. We gotta keep people healthy and safe and that's
going to keep our country strong over the long haul.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked about Mike already, but on a night where you had 14
turnovers to 10 assists, he was 6-to-1 assists to turnovers.  
BRUCE WEBER: He made some big-time passes. The guys were calling him "March
Mike" in the locker room. He's had some big games this season. I'm happy for
him. He and DaJuan have been in the gym just constantly. He wants to do well.
Not only this year, he's got to be the leader. He's been through it and it was
good to see some things go for him. That's a great line and Bane, who was
really, really good.  
  
Q. Coach, you just be kind of touched on there with what 's best for the
country and everything like that but you wake up tomorrow and the Big 12 comes
out and said we're not going to do it kind of like the NBA said tonight, how
do you go from there?  
BRUCE WEBER: It would be sad. But if they make that decision, obviously it
would be an educated decision. We're trying to protect everybody's health and
we don't want our country locked down like Italy is right now where everyone
is quarantined. It's scary. I'm old. I'm in that group where people die. I
don't want to die. I want people healthy, including myself. I got a grandson
coming soon, any day now. I want to be able to hug and hold him, and play with
my other grand kids.  
  
We've got to do what we have to do. I would feel for the kids. I feel for the
Ivy League kids. I know they cancelled their spring sports because kids work
so hard. But at the same time we're talking about the long haul of our country
and what it means to stay strong and healthy.  
  
Q. Coach, you 've played Baylor twice this year. Didn't go your way
either time. What do you feel you need to address before tomorrow night's
quarter final?  
BRUCE WEBER: We have to guard 'em. The first time we were not ready. We
spotted them 22-2, I think it was and we came all the way back, cut it to 1,
they made the shot before half, we were in the game pretty much on and off the
whole game.  
  
We have to guard 'em. We can't give them the easy looks. They got great guard
play, very unselfish. Their defense I thought early was disrupting some of the
injuries, some of that has taken a toll on them, but Scott has done an
unbelievable job. I know his big dream and goal is to get deep into the
tournament and I'm sure he would like to get a little momentum here so they
will be ready to play.  
  
Q. Bruce, this is two games in a row now where you 've had really good
starts. I think you were up 10-2, something like that early. Is there a change
there?  
BRUCE WEBER: You could say we put Pierson in last time and he helped us get
going. This time we went with DaJuan, I think the biggest thing is we guarded
and that's big. We guarded and played hard.  
  
Even Carti, Carti had the good start. He got a little shaky in the second
half, but, you know, he's a guy who can break people down and make plays for
us. If we can keep him solid, when you talk about Baylor he's the key because
he's one guy that can get by people along with David. If they can make the
right pass, obviously it helps us.  
  
Q. Bruce, this is the first time you guys started 4-0 that you won back-
to-back games this season. One, is that hard to believe? Two, how good is that
you are putting momentum together?  
BRUCE WEBER: I thought Senior Day gave us momentum. It's been a long time. It
was a long month of February for us. To the guys' credit, to our staff's
credit, we had a couple, Baylor was probably our worst game where, you know,
some of it was them, some of it was us. But for the most part they have come
to play, and like I said, just go through the scores.  
  
Number one team in the country. We're tied 48 deep into the game. They made
the plays. Tonight we were fortunate they didn't make that 3 at the end and we
made a couple of big stops, got a rebound and guys were, why did you call
timeout? I didn't want anything to go wrong, foul a three-pointer that would
have been typical of our season, but we were able to get a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma State - 72, Iowa State - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Cyclones of Iowa State, Coach
Steve Prohm and he has four student-athletes with him, Caleb Grill, Tre
Jackson, Prentiss Nixon and Michael Jacobson. Coach?  
  
STEVE PROHM: First off, congrats to Oklahoma State for their win tonight and
advancing in the tournament. Obviously it's a special tournament, special
place, special environment and venues. It's great to be a part of it. I was
proud of our guys. Thought we competed and put ourselves in the position to
win the game. They just made one more play at the end. We didn't get back in
transition and they were able to get to the basket. Proud of our guys and
hopefully tonight is another learning lesson for these young guys as we go
forward.  
  
Q. Prentiss, with six, seven minutes to go in the first half, what was
going on there? With your head or whatever?  
PRENTISS NIXON: I split my head open. Went back to the locker room and got it
fixed up and that was really can. It was bleeding a little bit, put a little
Vaseline on it to stop the bleeding and went back out there and played
basketball.  
  
Q. Mike, what did you see from Prentiss offensively, obviously he made a
ton of shots for you guys?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, he came out and battled, give him a ton of credit,
obviously with what happened with his head. Biggest thing making shots, he got
to his spots on offense and played with a ton of confidence and knocked 'em
down and it was great to see that for him.  
  
Q. Were you guys kind of following the situation today, just kind of
wondering if fans were going to come and what are your thoughts about just
playing knowing that tomorrow they aren 't going to allow fans in?  
PRENTISS NIXON: I just think you gotta play basketball at the end of the day.
You can't really worry about what's going on outside the game. You've got to
stay focus and had stay honed in on your job and go out there and do what you
got to do, no matter if there are fans out there or not, we still got a job to
do. You've got to get out there and do it.  
  
Q. Mike, the two guys sitting on your left what can you say about the
way they played this year?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: I'm proud of them. I told them this after the game, proud
they stepped up. Obviously we had two guys out and just the way they stepped
up as young guys and filled the big role especially in an environment like
this. Like Coach said, March is here and I thought they did a good job in
their first game and I think they will have a ton of success going forward
they will have to keep moving forward and build on it and realize what this
program is about and the year that they had this year is unacceptable and keep
moving forward.  
  
Q. Mike, you touched on it there, calling the season unacceptable. But
how do you, I know it just ended, but how do you evaluate your year as a
team?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, I think just what I've talked about all season, a ton
of ups and downs. You've got to find some consistency and just make sure
you're competing every day, competing in the games. Just understanding, I
guess, the biggest thing is what it takes to win at a high level. This year we
didn't have a ton of guys that had that experience. So just realizing what
that takes and everything that goes into it and taking nothing for granted.
Like I said, just realizing what Iowa state is about and the success they have
had and how important it is to this fan base and going out there with that in
mind every game and every day at practice and competing.  
  
Q. Steve, how tough is Isaac Likekele for you guys to defend?  
STEVE PROHM: He was good tonight. The biggest thing with him is when he gets
downhill -- you want to put pressure on him so he didn't have a burst of
speed. When you play off him he has a burst of speed. He's got good size,
physicality, physical guard. There are not many guards that can go the length
of the floor at the end and finish like he did with their left hand, credit to
him he had a very good game for them.  
  
Q. Caleb, what can a game like this do for you launching into next
season and what I asked those guys, you have family in the area, how much were
you paying attention throughout the day wondering if they would be able to
come to the game?  
CALEB GRILL: The whole thing with the Coronavirus thing, I have not paid too
much attention to it today, just trying to stay focused on the game come you
go up and Oklahoma State and for the most part they were saying media and
family could come so nothing like that was concerning me or anything like
that. This game, going into next year gives me confidence going into next
year, just going to come in every day with a different mindset and try to do
with these two did. They came in and worked every day, so I'm going to follow
in their foot steps and do what they did.  
  
Q. Steve, you mentioned a couple of times this year that you would does
it down with Tyrese, can you tell us about the timeline, what that might be
and for him to make a decision on his pro future?  
STEVE PROHM: He will go home for spring break. I will meet with him after the
break. The guys are supposed to be back after the break. I will talk to him
and his family this week, I'm sure. But he will be out this week for the break
and then I will visit with him in person after that. I don't think it will be
a long drawn out process. But whatever he decides.  
  
Q. (No microphone.).  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, there is a lot. I don't want to talk about that right now
because I know there is a lot of unknowns. So for right now our guys are going
home for spring break and like I told them in the locker room I will meet with
the administration this week and we will put a plan together and go from
there. But I can't talk about that until I talk to my administration this
week. Sorry about that.  
  
Q. Coach, just your opinion, the NBA League cancelled or suspended the
rest of the regular season. Do you think the NCAA, just your opinion, do you
think that they will follow their lead and cancel the tournament all
together?  
STEVE PROHM: I don't know. I heard about the NBA. I heard it was suspended. I
didn't know they cancelled the season.  
  
Q. Suspended.  
STEVE PROHM: Suspended for the rest of the season. To comment on that I will
leave that up to Mr. Emmert and those administrators. Obviously you pray for
everybody affected and you pray that we can find a cure and everybody can get
back to their simple lives. The most be important thing is people's health.
You can trade a lot of things but you can't trade your health. Whatever the
best thing is to keep people healthy and safe, I'm in support of.  
  
Q. Steve, what must happen during the off-season for this next season to
improve? For things going forward to improve?  
STEVE PROHM: I think we've got some good young guys in the program, guys
returning, I think we've got a good class coming in, obviously we've got to
address some needs in the spring recruiting. But like I told the guys in the
locker room, I said I've got to change in some ways, they've got to change. It
starts in the spring when we get back on campus and start our spring and
summer withouts. Workouts. Our mental and physical toughness has to get better
and there are a lot of little detailed stuff we gotta clean up so we can get
back to the tournament and be back where we need to be. I'm not going to give
you 25 different examples, but everyone in the locker room that's returning
and I know myself I'm the leader, I'm the head coach, I judge myself the
hardest to where there is I need to change in but 1-25, everybody needs to
change in certain areas for us to get back where we need to be.  
  
You could see a year ago today, you know, we won this tournament. We were
top-20 basketball team and had a terrific team. You know, it can change in a
year, it can flip in a year. I'm excited to lead this program and get us back
to where we need to be.  
  
Q. (No microphone.).  
STEVE PROHM: I think I just gotta change. I gotta be a little bit more
aggressive in a lot of different areas. That can go in a lot of different
areas but I think I gotta be aggressive and I've gotta continue to be myself,
but the areas that I need to improve in and get better in, I've got to
challenge myself to do that. It will happen and we will get back to where we
need to be.  
  
Q. Tre, how do you feel like the second half of your season went?  
TRE JACKSON: Of course it didn't end like we would wanted it to or anything
like that, but I feel like my shot was falling the second half of the season.
That's what boosted my confidence but just losing and stuff, that's not what
we want to do. So I'm not really satisfied with anything, but I'm satisfied
with our effort and everything but just going into next year trying to
improve.  
  
Q. Steve, what was your comfort ability level when it came to playing
with fans tonight knowing that tomorrow it 's going to be shut down for
fans?  
STEVE PROHM: What was my comfort level?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
STEVE PROHM: To be honest just wanted these guys to get to the next day.
That's all I really -- family and close family I think have been here. I think
they're allowed to come maybe it what I heard, for tomorrow. I could be wrong
on that but I just wanted these guys to have an opportunity to play Kansas.
Obviously in the tournament form you love playing Kansas. They wouldn't be a
50/50 split obviously because nobody would be there. But I wanted these guys
to win a game like that because they've been through a lot and I thought, you
know, we made the last play but they made one more and that's what as a coach
that's what bothers you, because you get opportunities. You've been to the
tournament. You've won championships, but not all these kids have shared in
that. So you want them to have that moment and this would have been a good way
to tough one out because Prentiss got hurt. We had adversity. I think our two
freshmen, both almost played forty minutes tonight. Caleb was 3 for 5. He had
8 rebounds. We showed grit and we've got to build off that.  
  
But you hate going home right away because this is the best time of the year.
This is what you work all your life for, to be in these moments and it's a
special tournament.  
  
Q. Caleb and Tre, now that you 've been through the grind of a college
season it's longer, more physical. What did you guys learn about yourselves
during the last few months and what can you take from that into the off-season
for your sophomore campaigns?  
TRE JACKSON: I've learned personally just the physical side of the game at
this level, gotta get better with the physicality and everything and being
smarter, a smarter player mentally and physically, stay on the court, not foul
and all that stuff. I've got to be a better player.  
  
CALEB GRILL: I would say for me, positioning is a huge thing because if you're
in the wrong spot it can go that quick and you can mess up a play or something
like that. You know, you can have a defensive breakdown or something like
that, pretty easy. And offensively, I've never been part of a coach who likes
spacing that much, so that was a struggle for me a little bit, I thought, with
spacing and I thought having the floor space and giving opportunities for
everybody else to get open shots and opportunities to drive and things like
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much for coming.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [RJ Nembhard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39024)

### [Desmond Bane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32886)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State - 53, TCU - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have TCU, head coach Jamie Dixon and Desmond Bane and RJ
Nembhard.  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Congratulations to Kansas State for the win. I was proud of our
guys, how we played in the second half and late in the first half. We
obviously weren't very good to start the game and turnovers I think we turned
it over 11 times in the first half, most of them early in the game.  
  
Disappointed how we played, how we performed but fought back, came out ready
to go and compete and then that second half told them we could cut this thing
down and we did rather quickly. But, you know, we didn't get it done. 4-point
lead and I don't know that we scored after that. I guess we scored but didn't
execute down the stretch, they made some tough shots. I give them credit. They
made some tough shots, jump shots I thought we defended pretty well, we got
better shots than they did and they made the tougher shots than we made.  
  
That's sometimes how the game goes. But I'm disappointed in this loss. There
is no question about it, but we fought and we competed but we got outrebounded
by nine and that can't happen. We've come up short on a number of things all
year long and that was just another one of them today.  
  
Q. Desmond, how tough is it to kind of end your career on this note,
and, you know, can you put that into emotions yet?  
DESMOND BANE: Not really. Like Coach said, I'm proud of the way we fought back
in the second half and I mean, I enjoyed every bit of playing with these guys
all year long. I mean, I wish the best for them and for the program moving
forward.  
  
Q. RJ, game high 19 points, did you feel like that 3, did you feel good
about it at the end, hey, you had it there?  
RJ NEMBHARD: For sure. Been in that situation numerous times. Desmond had a
great attack to the rim, found PJ, they threw it to me, just didn't knock the
shot down.  
  
Q. Desmond, why do you think you guys kind of got off to a bit of a
sluggish start and then in the second half what changed? You guys went on a
15-2 run, were able to tie it and take the lead?  
DESMOND BANE: I think we settled in. We were playing out of control and kinda
trying to do too much early on, playing one-on-one and we got the ball moving
in the second half and I think we only turned it over three times but once we
got settled in and stayed true to our stuff we played pretty well.  
  
Q. RJ, how much do you think you grew this season? When you look at the
freshmen how much potential do you think you guys got going forward?  
RJ NEMBHARD: I personally think I grew a lot, coming in under older guys like
Des and guys before him, Coach Dixon has instilled a lot in me throughout the
season. Didn't end the way we wanted to. The young guys showed a lot of fight.
This team is close knit. We got a lot of good guys. We gotta execute more
consistently and I think that's going to happen next year for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank you for
coming.  
  
Q. Jamie, why do you think you guys got off to such a slow start and
what turned in the second half?  
JAMIE DIXON: The turnovers, as I think I mentioned earlier, 4 of our first 6
possessions we turned it over. They were aggressive, they got into us, we told
them that, we prepared that way, I was disappointed how we handled it, there
is no question, that's on me if we didn't see it, didn't recognize it, but
we've had this trouble before.  
  
We're an impatient group as far as making -- and sometimes we make bad
decisions with the ball, we have been a high turnover team all year, highest
I've every had and it's been a challenge all year long and it probably has
something to do with our youth and we only had three returning guys. We fought
back. We cut it down. I like how we competed in the second part of the first
half, cut it down to where we wanted to, executed at the end of the half and
got it down to 10. I told our guys, given how bad we were, 11 turnovers in the
first half to be down 10 have the ball coming out I thought we were in a
pretty good spot.  
  
We had an opportunity. We came out. We did it. We played and competed and
seemed to be getting the loose balls early in the half and made some shots,
got to the basket. But, you know, same things got to us. We get outrebounded.
It's a problem. When we turn it over at that rate, it's a problem. And when we
be don't get to the free throw line it's a problem.  
  
So that's why we came up short in the end but at this point you get the lead,
you're up 4 and you just -- and I'll go watch it again, but I mean, I think it
was a unique game in that I would say we probably had better shots down the
stretch than they had, they made 'em, we didn't. That's not usually how it
works. But that's kind of how this year has gone for us, as far as gotta get
it done. We won a lot of close games but this one I thought early part had a
lot to do with it. But we fought. JR was out with the injury, so we had to do
some things differently and I don't know if Francisco every got back to where
he was from the concussion. So we were down in numbers there. So we battled.
We fought. I thought Ed gave us good minutes, defended pretty well and
hopefully it's something we can -- for these young guys because we're playing
a lot of freshmen out there. Hopefully we can get something better for it, but
I thought they hit tough shots at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, did you notice any difference in the way Kansas State carried
themselves in this one?  
JAMIE DIXON: No, similar game, pretty similar game. They were close. I guess
the difference was in the first two games we got off to a good start. We had
the lead early but they fought back similar to what we had. I think at the end
of the day we were in a good spot, we were up 4 considering how poorly we
played and they made shots. I think if you look at the four shots they hid,
the jump shot from the big kid, which is probably the shot we wanted, and then
three mid-range jump shots all tough shots, down the stretch. I'm not sure,
but I think Sneed hit 2 of 11, the one was big down at the end there. I
thought we guarded pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, on your last possession there you call a timeout, you get a
play drawn up and an open look for RJ. Is that the look you were look for in
that final possession?  
JAMIE DIXON: It was to get Desmond the ball and we figured they would double
team and someone would be open and that is how it played out. That's how we've
been playing lately. Our offense, we like the growth of our offense the last
two or three weeks, even though we came up short in games, beat Baylor, came
up short in Oklahoma although our offense was good for most of the game,
played pretty well at Kansas, but we thought our offense was good playing
through Desmond a lot more and we got some good looks on that one we got what
we wanted. Des made the right pass and the right play. That's all you can do
is get the best shot you can possibly get and that's a pretty good shot.  
  
Q. Jamie, 16-16, your fewest wins, but you guys were picked to finish
last. Do you feel like you exceeded expectations this season or is it too
early to evaluate?  
JAMIE DIXON: I don't know what expectations are. We were picked last. We
finished seventh, had a chance to be 5th, 6th in the end. You have a team that
has three guys coming back from your thing. We're all in a new world of
college basketball and everything seems to be something new every day in this
last couple years.  
  
You know, we had a good group of kids. They worked hard, they liked each
other. Could we have won some more games, yes, I wish we would have. But, you
know, I think the last game hurt a lot, the Oklahoma game, I was wondering how
we would respond and to be honest with you, practiced very well on Monday, so
I was encouraged by that.  
  
But, you know, we didn't win as many games as I'm used to. But, you know, we
certainly, I don't know that I've every had a team this young. I was proud of
how they competed, kept battling, played down the stretch and had some good
wins. But I'm obviously disappointed right now. Again, once you look at it you
see the team was down, fought back, got a lead. It was an effort. We do some
things wrong. We make some mistakes. I believe it's because of experience.
Hopefully we won't be this inexperienced again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Mike Boynton Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39009)

### [Isaac Likekele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39010)

### [Cameron McGriff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32861)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma State - 72, Iowa State - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will start with our student-athletes before Coach gets here.
We have the Cowboys of Oklahoma State. Welcome back for Coach. He is en route.
Our four student-athletes, Cameron McGriff, Isaac Likekele, Yor Anei and Lindy
Waters III.  
  
Q. Ice, breakdown the final play for us.  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: After I seen that they scored, Avery Anderson listened to
Coach very well. Coach said we need to hurry and get the ball out and try to
drive it as deep as possible into the paint as we can. Just because we were in
the bonus and that's our style of play, attacking the paint. Yor had a great
seal down low and he opened me up for a layup so those two pivotal things that
they did that let me get to the game-winning layup.  
  
Q. How big was Yor 's offensive rebound that led to your free throws?  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: It was very big. I believe if we didn't get that offensive
rebound we would have had to foul and they would have been 3 points or 1
point, I don't know, but it was very big that Yor got that rebound and led us
to the two free throws and I had to step up to make them, which I did.  
  
Q. Lindy, Cameron you guys have been here a lot of times, Iowa State is
tough to beat, how satisfying is it to beat Iowa State with their great fan
support at Kansas City?  
CAMERON MCGRIFF: It was what we game here to do. We came here on a business
trip. We understood that it was practically going to be a road game with their
fans here and we stayed composed throughout the game. I felt like we stayed
with their runs and we only led about 50 seconds throughout the game, so that
showed our composure and resiliency to fight back no matter how things may be
going.  
  
Q. With the Big 12 making the announcement about no fans the rest of the
tournament, how y 'all going to feel tomorrow when it's just you and Kansas
and 250 people here inside the Sprint Center watching you play?  
YOR ANEI: I guess it's going to feel like a scrimmage. You don't really have
that much people at a scrimmage.  
  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: I mean, I feel like we'll be fine, create our own energy and
my momma will be there so I'll be fine. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. The fact that there is going to be no fans here, can you guys tell us
how you found out, when you found out there would be no fans here tomorrow if
you happened to win, how Coach told you?  
LINDY WATERS III: We didn't find out until after the game. He had just
mentioned it. I mean, now that I think about it I heard a bunch of boo's, so I
guess that's when the announcement was but after the game, Coach Mike told us
and it's just going to be another basketball game for us. We're all playing
for the same thing, the Big 12 championship.  
  
Q. Facing Kansas again, what is the challenge like to face the
Jayhawks?  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: We have to play much better than we did the first time and the
second time. We gotta stick to our defensive scheme and just trust in our
coaches and actually out there and execute what they need us to do and at the
end of the day we've gotta go out there and make plays. They're a very
talented defensive team so a lot of stuff you try to run to get you out of,
the fact that they defend and make you become a player, make plays, and that's
what we gotta do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lindy, same goes for Kansas, only they 're Kansas. How much easier do
you think it's going to be to play Kansas here without their 10,000 fans?  
LINDY WATERS III: Much easier than being in Lawrence, that's for sure. But
like you said, they will have a similar amount of fans, family and friends
there. But at the end of the day it's what happens on the court.  
  
Q. Cameron, you went about 5 minutes there at the end of the game
without a basket until Isaac 's layup, except for free throws. Can you talk
about how close your were down the stretch because you guys struggles at
times?  
CAMERON MCGRIFF: We have a lot of capable guys to make free throws throughout
the game. We just stepped up and knocked 'em down. It shows our confidence and
our toughness s and that's what Coach always tells us, making free throws is
just about toughness, especially down the stretch. So for us to close out the
game in that fashion, it shows we put the work in, definitely pivotal, every
shot is a game winner, Isaac's layup was a great shot down the stretch. Missed
the free throw. But credit to making free throws down the stretch.  
  
Q. To start the second half, Iowa State jumped on you guys early. What
were the conversations in the huddles when you guys were trying to get back in
it?  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: I mean, Coach Boynton was really just telling us that we
needed to stay focused and had we really came out flat lined. We didn't come
out with any energy like we should have.  
  
That's what made us lose our 2-point lead so fast at the half. He was telling
us we gotta amp it up, amp it up, and he kept trying to push us and push us,
everybody knows we have it in us, we're a great defensive team. That's what
kept us going, and Cameron staying on us, like he's been the whole year, he's
always been that guy, yelling at us, and he showed us by example. Cameron
played very hard the entire second half, you can go out there and replay,
Cameron was all over the place and same thing for Lindy. That's what seniors
do. They led by example and they led my communication. So when those two guys
are doing that, you know, you just gotta follow their lead and that's what led
us to come back late.  
  
Q. Isaac, you seem aggressive in attacking the basket. Was that a
mindset going into the game or did you see opportunities there and take
advantage of them?  
ISAAC LIKEKELE: My teammates just tried to tell me to stay aggressive when I'm
playing passive. That's when we're not at our best because I cause confusion
and whenever I'm playing passive. Whenever I'm attacking the rim that's when
things open up for everyone else. Whenever I'm going to the rim and playing
passive, that's just me defending myself. So I just gotta stay aggressive and
that will get other people more involved the more aggressive I am.  
  
Q. Cameron, Isaac just mentioned you didn 't come out with a lot of
energy to start the second half. Have you thought much yet about energy in
general tomorrow? It's going to be such a strange game, high stakes game in an
empty gym that seats 18,000 people. I assume opposing fans help you generate
energy, how are you going to get your energy tomorrow?  
CAMERON MCGRIFF: Just within ourselves. We're a team that definitely, you
know, we start within and then we go out. So the 14 guys have to I bring
energy amongst each other and then the little amount of fans we will have, we
will feel their energy, too, but it starts within the huddle or within that
timeout, every time we go out there we know we got each other's back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by head Coach Mike Boynton, Jr.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at the last play that Isaac 's layup, how does that
show the poise that he has had in this game and for you guys all season?  
MIKE BOYNTON JR.: He's a pretty mature sophomore, started every game for us as
a freshman and learned and is still learning how to play the position but I
think really it goes to the growth of our team as a whole. We still have some
good pieces and when we're playing together and executing at a high level we
feel like we can play with anybody. He leads us because he affects the game in
so many different ways but that play in particular was made by Avery Anderson.
We told him in a timeout going into that last possession, I didn't want them
thinking timeout if we score, we wanted to get the ball in as fast as we
could, we usually have a big take it out, but I said whoever gets it, just go
in, because the other team is usually excited and you can catch them off
balance in that situation, and whoever got the outbound pass, and we wanted to
get is to Ice, don't settle, as fast as you can, one dribble per second ask we
had enough time to get all the way to the rim and he did a great job of
reading the scenario and obviously was able to complete the play.  
  
It shows poise from him in particular but I think our team was prepared for
the moment and that credit goes to those kids.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win. I gotta ask you about the other
big story that 's happening. Can you take us through when you found out about
the fact that there won't be fans at the rest of this tournament and how you
told the team and what affect that could have about playing the Jayhawks in an
almost empty gym tomorrow?  
MIKE BOYNTON JR.: I just found out after the game. I heard a lot of booing
during the game, but when I hear noise, I don't really understand what's being
done in the crowd.  
  
So I just found out. I just told our team. Hey, we have to control what we can
control. The most important thing for us is to get rested and to be able to
get ourselves prepared to play a really, really good team. Doesn't matter how
many people are in the stands. They got the Player of the Year, a Hall of Fame
coach and probably if their Player of the Year wasn't the Player of the Year,
their point guard would have been Player of the Year. So we got a big task no
matter how many people are in the stands tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you say that but you and actually none of us have every been
in a situation like this before. What type of changes or anything, even though
you just found out about it do you think that you will have to make as far as
adjustments because obviously it 's been said before you feed off the crowd
noise, either pro or against, tomorrow, you're not going to have that type of
atmosphere for either team, of course, but how do you coach and keep your
players adjusted to something like that?  
MIKE BOYNTON JR.: I think the first part of your statement maybe tells it all.
It's uncharted. I don't know. I'm not prepared, right, for this. Because you
don't expect to be not have anyone even in the building. Especially until a
conference tournament where fans are all the teams are able to come and this
is one of the most well-attended conference tournaments in the country.
Because of where it's located and all the fans are able to drive from the
different parts of our region.  
  
Yeah, it will be different. I'm not sure exactly how it will play out. But
what I can only focus on is trying to get these guys rested and put a game
plan together because really the crowd noise helps the environment of the
game. But the five guys on each side of the court really settle in and the
game ultimately becomes the same regardless.  
  
But I don't really know. I don't have a great answer for you in terms of how
do I make an adjustment. We will all be playing it by ear tomorrow. Once the
game tips and we look around and we don't have that noise and maybe the
environment isn't as great. I'm sure these guys will be excited to play
another day and that's what I'm excited about being able to be a part of.  
  
Q. Yor, you 're from the area. What impact does this have on you with
the fans not being here? You would have had a large crowd.  
YOR ANEI: It's a pretty big impact because, like, I'm pretty well known
locally so a bunch of random fans, even if their fans of the other team they
know me and they might, like, cheer. So I guess it has a pretty big affect,
but it's the same for the other team. They're not going to have the same fan
base. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. Coach, what is your message to fans that have driven or flown here to
Kansas City to catch you play that won 't be able to come to the game
tomorrow?  
MIKE BOYNTON JR.: Obviously we're following our leadership. We didn't make the
decision. We have fans come up, too, and they won't be able to enjoy the
experience either. It's unfortunate, but I think at the same time there is so
much unknown out there, right? We want to take as much precaution as we
possibly can to ensure the safety of the kids, right? And as adults, although
it may not be fun, I'm sure it sucks for people who maybe have flown from far
away and have hotel stays that maybe they can't get out of rental cars,
whatever. It's just unfortunate. I don't have a great answer for them, either.
I just hope that soon we all can figure out what it is and we can figure out a
way to have a better situation moving forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will let you get out of here. Thank you for coming
and congratulations.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Naji Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36264)

### [Zach Freemantle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39017)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
DePaul - 71, Xavier - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Xavier.  
  
COACH STEELE: Obviously first, congrats to DePaul. Obviously a really tough
loss for us. I feel bad for our guys. I thought we played hard. Thought we
competed. But obviously we weren't good enough today to defeat DePaul.  
  
Obviously I thought Paul Reed and Charlie Moore, they dominated the game on
the offensive end for them. Charlie Moore had 18 points, nine assists.
Obviously Paul Reed had 23 and 12.  
  
Paul Reed is an all-league player. That's what he does. But, again, we just
came up short. Again I feel really, really bad for our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Travis, particularly in the second half, once you guys were able to
make a run and get back in the game, I think you took a five- or six-point
lead. What was the difference closing why you guys weren 't able to finish
this one?  
COACH STEELE: I think it was a game of runs, I mean, it was one possession
here, two possessions there. Again, whether it was a turnover or they got a
lot of points out in transition, which really hurt us. And it allowed them to
go on their runs. They went on a couple of 6-0 runs there when we were up by
six.  
  
So, again we have to give ourselves a chance on the defensive end to get our
half-court defense set. We didn't do that in the second half.  
  
Q. The 3s weren 't really falling there in the second half. KyKy put up
two towards the end, in under two minutes. Did you want him to take those
shots? Is that what you were looking for or are you just looking to get
points? Or what were your thoughts on that?  
COACH STEELE: He had a couple of good looks. He's one of our better shooters.
He has been all year. Thought he had a couple of clean looks. We'll live with
those.  
  
He probably wish he had the one back that he drove the ball into the guy but
nobody's perfect. I thought he had a couple of really nice looks. And, again,
we'll take those shots.  
  
Q. The nature of being on the bubble was this was a game that you guys
needed to win tonight. Where do you think that this puts you guys in the NCAA
Tournament landscape? Do you feel like you did enough in the regular season?  
COACH STEELE: I don't know. That's up to the people on the committee,
obviously. I think we play in the toughest league in the entire country. You
look at our strength of schedule, I think it was fifth heading into the Big
East in the entire country. And we've beaten some good teams. Again, I think
we deserve to be in there. But, again, at the same time it's not up to us.  
  
Q. One of the points of emphasis was rebounding coming into this game.
They won that battle. Why do you think that was? Where were you guys coming up
short?  
COACH STEELE: I thought we got a little tired. They had one offensive rebound
in the first half. I thought we did a really, really good job. I thought they
had about four in one possession on the offensive glass. So I think they ended
up with nine.  
  
I think we got a little fatigued as the second half wore on. And I think our
guys were battling and trying and competing, just fatigued.  
  
Q. For both players, your team was able to get a six-point lead with
about nine minutes to go and then suddenly it turned. Can you both talk about
what DePaul did to turn that because it really seemed like you guys had DePaul
on the ropes? At that point, you guys had come from, I think, nine down to go
six up. Can each of you players talk about that critical stretch in the game
and what DePaul did to turn it?  
NAJI MARSHALL: I think basketball is a game of runs. Like you said, they was
up nine, we were up six. Next thing you know we lose the lead. Coach said
there, we were pretty tired. Crashed the offensive glass towards the second
half. Like he said, we was tired. And we didn't execute our system on defense
or offense. I think that's how the game changed.  
  
ZACH FREEMANTLE: I would agree with that. We got the lead up and then we
started missing a lot of shots. And they went on a run, took the lead back
from us.  
  
Q. Naji, how tough is it to come this close and come this far and leave
this arena with that loss?  
NAJI MARSHALL: Very, very tough. Like Coach Steele said, life gives you tough
battles and it's all about how you battle the next one. Move on to the next
one. We'll be back. This isn't the last Xavier. Hopefully this isn't the last
for Xavier this season. But it's all about just getting back and hopefully
next year when we come back we'll win the championship.  
  
Q. Naji, there was obviously some speculation over an Instagram post you
made. A lot of Xavier fans took that to mean that you might be done after this
year. I wanted to give you the chance to kind of clarify and explain what you
meant.  
NAJI MARSHALL: It was the last home game of the season. That's why I said
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Dave Leitao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30496)

### [Charlie Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32893)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
DePaul - 71, Xavier - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by DePaul.  
  
COACH LEITAO: Very happy, obviously. For everybody this time of year a lot at
stake. Want to live to play another day. And in order to get to where you want
to get to, you've got to take it one step, one possession at a time.  
  
I thought we did do that, and I thought we were really good defensively,
particularly early our hands were in passing lanes. We got deflections. They
were a little off balance. We got some turnovers. And it fueled some fastbreak
offense. And that's what you've got to do with a really good defensive team
like Xavier.  
  
We outrebounded them, which is the number one key because they feed off their
ability to get second shots so much. But Charlie with a lot of minutes playing
real well, 18 and nine with only two turnovers. Paul, in the first game back,
with 23 and 12. I thought Jaylen Butz was really good. And solid by Romeo and
some of the guys off the bench. Nick, I thought, gave us quality minutes. And
you're going to need that. Everybody has to be at their best if you're going
to win at this time of year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Charlie, this was a team that swept you guys in the regular season.
What was different today that helped you guys come out on top?  
CHARLIE MOORE: We just came out and stuck with the plan, the game plan. Came
out, gave energy. Tried to limit their rebound, offensive rebound attempts,
just play defense as a team. I thought we did a great job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just expound on what Paul Reed 's return meant tonight
because he was just everywhere on offense, defense, making clutch free
throws?  
COACH LEITAO: He's well rested. No, that's who he is. He's so long and he's
hard to box out. He's hard to find. In the most positive, ways he's awkward
about how he does things. He scores in unconventional ways. As I've said all
along in the three years he's been here, you don't have to run a bunch of
plays for him to be in the middle of all the action.  
  
And he did that today through some early foul trouble but he stayed with it
emotionally, and he came up really big with those free throws at the end. But
for us, his ability to get second shots for us is really important. And having
him in the lineup gives us that advantage that we don't have when he's not
there.  
  
Q. Charlie, Xavier 's not really known to be a 3-point shooting team,
but they normally aren't as bad as going 0-for-10 in the second half like they
were tonight. What were you able to do defensively on them, especially when
they were desperate down the stretch to make sure they weren't making any
3s?  
CHARLIE MOORE: The two games we played them, they killed us from beyond the
arc. We wanted to lock in today and take the 3-point attempts away from them
-- do a high hand and closest out to them aggressively. And I think we did a
great job of that especially the second half, since they went 0-for-10.  
  
Q. During your game the league announced that there will be limited fans
tomorrow -- each school will have 200 people because of the Coronavirus. What
's your reaction to now all the leagues are kind of doing this now with
playing all these conference games without fans?  
COACH LEITAO: I think the first responsibility for everybody in this world
that we're living in currently is safety at the expense of a packed building.
We all would love that; players would love it. The coach would love it; the
fans; anybody would love it.  
  
But if one person suffers because of it, or if it spreads because of it, then
it's probably -- whether it's fan interest, economics, whatever, it's probably
not the right thing to do.  
  
So I think you saw across the board what's going on in this country and around
the world as to the limitations for exposure as best we can. Most Americans, I
mean people around the world, but in America, don't have an idea of what it is
and what's going on. And so you just have to follow the experts and do what
you're told.  
  
If it means that we'll play tomorrow night with a limited amount of people,
we're still going to try to bring our best effort. And it means more people
will be watching on TV, I guess.  
  
Q. Oscar Lopez played an extended amount in the second half. Can you
tell us how he played and your confidence and it rewarded for you?  
COACH LEITAO: He's the one guy other than Charlie that can go north really
well, meaning he can get deep into the paint. And his ability to do that
allows Charlie, which is -- one thing we haven't done a whole lot this year
and haven't talked about it is that Charlie is a very accomplished scorer. He
hasn't been able to score as much or to the percentages that he would like or
we would need him to because he's always got the ball in his hands.  
  
Oscar provides an opportunity for Charlie to not have the ball in his hands
all the time and to be able to receive it and make a play as opposed to being
an initiator. That helps our offense and helps our spacing. And he was really
good battling their big guys, Carter or Freemantle on the defensive end, and
got some key rebounds too.  
  
Q. I believe the last game that Paul played before this one was against
Xavier. Did he get hurt in that game?  
COACH LEITAO: Yes, he did.  
  
Q. It was his hip?  
COACH LEITAO: Yep. He got hit in the hip and he had -- he had to come out,
went back in and played with it injured and then after the game realized that
it was more problematic than we had known during the course of the game. So
the next morning that's when we shut him down.  
  
Q. He had a big game today, but there was the one juncture where he got
the technical foul for hanging on the rim, and Xavier took advantage and went
on a run there. What was your message to him at that point?  
COACH LEITAO: I didn't really say anything to him, to be honest with you. My
message to the team was to be poised through all the highs and lows. We got up
12 in the first. They came right back, six points in a row, it was a four-
point game.  
  
And just allow us to be who we're supposed to be -- live in the moment, live
in the moment. And for that time that you mentioned for Paul, they got a free
throw. They made it and then ran quality offense after that.  
  
They were getting the ball inside. And I was trying to get the guys to
understand that through what we're doing well or times they're playing well,
we've got to be just even keel and live in that moment.  
  
Q. There was a report by Jeff Goodman on Twitter saying you were going
to get extended today that you were going to get an extension, do you know
anything about that, contract extension. He tweeted that you were going to get
a contract extension at the end of the year --  
COACH LEITAO: I could talk to you about it. It's private -- it's not private
business, excuse me, it's something that's been ongoing. It probably doesn't
have a real place -- no disrespect -- but during this tournament.  
  
I think both parties are in a good place, the university and me on my side. So
once it comes time to handle that, we'll handle that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Val Ackerman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=31484)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
VAL ACKERMAN: I'm going to speak from the heart a little bit here. This has
been the most extraordinary stretch of days I've ever had or ever seen in my
30-plus years of working in the sports business. The developments seem to be
changing by the hour. As I mentioned yesterday, for those of you in the
conference, none of the people -- there were -- few of the people running
sports leagues or sports organizations are qualified medical professionals. So
we're relying on the judgments of doctors and experts. The conferences are
looking to each other in many ways to try to figure out what to do. We take
guidance from the NCAA. I can tell you that as part of our scheduled meeting
this morning with the presidents and the athletics directors, we had on the
call video conferencing in from Indianapolis senior executives from the NCAA.  
  
So as recently as 10:00 this morning, as I'm running this meeting, we had no
idea that these developments were going to transpire with conference
tournaments.  
  
We all reacted yesterday, of course, to the NCAA's news, based on the opinion
of its medical experts, that it was going to adopt a restricted attendance
policy for the NCAA Tournament. They were not talking at that point about
canceling the NCAA Tournament and none of the conferences -- I can tell you
that last evening I was on the phone with the commissioners of other major
basketball conferences, who I learned were going to adopt a restricted
attendance policy as a cautionary measure, et cetera. So we went into our
meeting today and that's really where everybody was.  
  
Our meeting broke up a little bit before noon, and that was when we heard
literally for the first time that other conferences were beginning to make
this move. I was able to connect with one of the other conference
commissioners, just because I wanted to understand their thinking, and he said
that for his conference it was largely driven by directives that he was
getting from the municipality in which their conference tournament is being
played.  
  
So I then reached out to a contact that I had established over the last week
with the City of New York, in the Office of Emergency Management -- this is
now afternoon -and learned that New York City is, in fact, very shortly going
to be bringing forward directives related to large gatherings here in New
York.  
  
So this had not yet hit. I can't give you any more details than that, but I
can tell you that an hour ago -- plus ago, I was learning for the first time
that the city now -- and we've been dealing with them for days -- and they
have been telling us they're not recommending cancellations or any adjustments
to large gatherings. It now appears that the city is prepared to act in the
same way that some of the other major urban markets are acting.  
  
So once we heard this news, play had started here at the Big East, we know. We
then had to mobilize to get our presidents and our athletics directors
reassembled. And so we did that in a conference call that was held about half
an hour ago because I need to act, like all commissioners have to act through
the authorization of their boards, and so our board quickly agreed.  
  
When we alerted them to what was happening with other conferences, including
the major basketball conferences, the Atlantic 10, we learned, is also making
a move with respect to their tournament in Brooklyn, and importantly because
of guidance that we were -- just today, the first time -- getting from the
City of New York, it would be prudent to cancel the remainder of our men's
basketball tournament.  
  
So now you know the news that we decided, out of an abundance of caution, even
though everyone's already gathered here, that it would make sense to not have
our [inaudible] court after halftime.  
  
So we have, here in the 2020 Big East Tournament, we have two completed games.
We have half a game. And that's all we're going to have in 2020. I've got to
tell you, it breaks my heart. This is the greatest college basketball
tournament ever. But we respect the decision of authorities. We're very
mindful about what's happening nationally. We do not want to be imprudent as
it relates to the safety of our participants and our fans.  
  
And it's terrifying, frankly, what's evolving here as the science and the
assessments of the science are progressing. And I don't think any of us know
what's going to happen tomorrow.  
  
And, again, just to reinforce this, we had NCAA staff, who we've been looking
to for guidance on a video conference with our presidents a few hours ago, and
they did not let on that even they knew that some of these moves were being
made by these other conferences.  
  
So that's kind of how the last 24 hours have gone. I want to just extend my
thanks to all of you for supporting us here at the tournament. Sorry to put
you through any trouble.  
  
I want to thank, again, I know Joel Fisher from the Garden is here. And I
can't tell you, we were up all night planning out the limited attendance
policy that we had going into today. It's not easy to turn on a dime and tell
all 20,000 people or 19,000 people they can't come to the Big East Tournament,
but we had to do it.  
  
And I want to thank Joel and his amazing staff for turning with us as we were
trying to put all this together. And, I mean, you all can second-guess our
decision to play that first half. That's your prerogative. But I can assure
you we were doing the best we could with the information we had. And when we
had to make the decision -- and as soon as we got the information,
particularly from the city, we didn't hesitate to do what we had to do.  
  
So with that, that's kind of -- that's where we are -- and I can't opine on
where the NCAA will go. I think, I'll just add this because we were on the
line with their folks this morning, they're just monitoring this by the hour
themselves. So as it relates to the NCAA Tournament, spring championships, et
cetera, I just predict that we haven't seen the end of this. It's going to be
a fast-moving set of circumstances. And we'll be doing our best to keep up and
to do what we have to do as a conference to adjust accordingly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. If the Atlantic 10 can pull the plug literally two minutes before the
tip off, why wasn 't it done here? And if it is because the decision hadn't
been made until during the half, then why wasn't the game stopped when you
made the decision?  
VAL ACKERMAN: It was our view that we didn't feel like we needed a dramatic,
pull-the-players-off-the-court-in-the-middle-of-the-game gesture. Folks were
here. We just literally didn't think that another 15 or 20 minutes of game
time was going to make that much of a difference.  
  
That said, we didn't think it was appropriate to send the athletes back out on
to the floor during the halftime. So it was a judgment call that we made. It
was just based on an assessment that we made. And, again, we didn't -- we were
making calls -- once we got this news about the other conferences, I felt it
important to confer with the city, and that happened.  
  
And, again, the city hasn't made its announcement yet but it will. But we just
thought under the circumstances the most appropriate, the least disruptive
gesture for the student-athletes who are on the floor -- because this is a
trauma for them, too, I suspect. For us to sort of have Garden security march
out on the floor pull them into locker rooms didn't make sense to us.  
  
But that said, we didn't believe it made sense to pull them out after halftime
either and send them out there. That was a decision we made, and we stand by
the decision.  
  
Q. When the news started to come down that other conference tournaments,
especially ones played in NBA arenas had started.  
VAL ACKERMAN: I felt it important to confer with the city and that happened.
The city hasn't made its announcement, it will. But the most important, least
disruptive gesture of the athletes on the floor because this is a trauma for
them, too, I suspect.  
  
For us to have Garden security march out onto the floor and pull them into the
locker room didn't make sense to us. But that said, it didn't make sense to
pull them after halftime and send them back out there. That's the decision we
made and we stand by the decision.  
  
Q. When the news stories came down that other conference tournaments,
especially ones playing in NBA arenas had started to cancel their tournaments,
was there consideration given to delaying the start of this until conference
could be had before this even got underway?  
VAL ACKERMAN: We didn't entertain it. When we got this news, we were just not
aware. We were just taken aback by the news. We just, we just we thought it
was appropriate to start, to play until halftime and that's what we decided to
do. That was a decision we made.  
  
Q. Sounds like that 's the entire gist of your statement, but how much
harder is it to move things like this as the NCAA, which is so decentralized,
unlike the NBA, which just has the Board of Governors meet, how has that been
affecting things for you all week, really?  
VAL ACKERMAN: Great question. The NCAA, their decision to go to a restricted
attendance policy for the NCAA Tournament was made by their Board of
Governors. Just a little primer here: The NCAA's highest governing body is the
governors; it's made up of representatives from all three divisions. That was
the body that made the decision relative to the NCAA Tournament that broke
yesterday afternoon.  
  
That decision was made in consultation with a COVID-19 medical panel that the
Board of Governors had assembled representing pre-eminent doctors around the
country. One of them was the former Surgeon General of the U.S., Vivek Murthy,
who is also a member of the BOG.  
  
I will tell you up until we actually had -- we've had multiple conference
calls in the last several days with our board. As recently as Monday, the
NCAA's medical director, on advice of the COVID advisory panel, was telling us
that the NCAA was not planning any adjustments to their tournament at that
time. So as recently as Monday, the guidance we were getting from the NCAA was
not to cancel and not to go to a restricted attendance policy unless the local
authorities are telling you to do that.  
  
The answer is the NCAA is making a decision about its tournament because
that's where it has jurisdiction. But then each conference is left to itself
to make decisions relative to the events that it, manages, and in the case of
all the conferences that includes their basketball tournaments.  
  
Q. Today you were finding things out in real time. You weren 't getting
heads-up about it?  
VAL ACKERMAN: We had no heads-up on this one.  
  
Q. Last night, when the National Basketball Association deemed that it
wasn 't even safe to play games with limited access or no fans or not open to
the public, should this have happened then?  
VAL ACKERMAN: Well, hindsight maybe is 20/20. I don't know the answer to that.
At the time we heard that directive, the NCAA was not making any
determinations, other than restricted attendance. So we were following their
lead. The City of New York at that time was still not making any
determinations, and we've been consulting with them multiple times daily.  
  
And so we felt that with the information that we had at the time -- I think
the NBA decision was in part driven by a positive Coronavirus test as well by
an athlete, which we don't have in the Big East. So they were operating on a
slightly different fact set. And all I can tell you is based on the
information that we had at the time last night we thought it was prudent to
move forward with limited attendance, which we did. But we were prepared to
adjust as needed, and that's what we've done now, with these late-breaking.  
  
Q. Were the athletes tested?  
VAL ACKERMAN: No, none have exhibited any signs of sickness. This is generally
what happens is they exhibit signs of sickness, they're tested. If they're
exposed to individuals who have tested positive, then we're just following the
guidance of everyone in terms of the directives issued by the CDC and the New
York City Department of Health. We're not aware of any positive tests of any
athletes in the Big East.  
  
Q. Should the NCAA play its tournament, knowing what you know now about
the risk to student-athletes? Should they hold their tournament?  
VAL ACKERMAN: Well, Dick's asking a hard question here. Again, the NCAA is
going to decide, their board of governors, which I just referenced, is going
to have to make that decision. My prediction -- and I think that's why they
acted yesterday with the restricted attendance policy -- my prediction is if
things escalate in this country, as we've seen in other parts of the world, I
suspect it's going to be very difficult for them to hold onto the NCAA
Tournament as planned.  
  
That's just a prediction. It's not my call. But again they're conferring with
expert doctors and they're going to have to make these judgments. The
tournament starts next week. Of course the Garden is supposed to host the East
Regional. They'll be directly impacted by any decision they make.  
  
But it just seems, Dick, I'm not a doctor here, but it just seems like this
trajectory is only intensifying. And so I suspect it's going to be very
difficult to do it.  
  
Q. Commissioner, during the early part of this week Mayor de Blasio went
on to different media outlets to talk about his feel about, unless he got the
word from the Feds, about what to do here. He thought he wanted all the
activities in New York to continue. When you talk about talking to the city,
did that include his feedback?  
VAL ACKERMAN: No. My information is limited to the contacts that we have. I
don't have -- I don't want to sit up here and pretend I'm an authority on what
New York City will do or won't. I can tell you that my information, from the
contact that I have and I trust is that the city is preparing to adopt some
measures. I can't speak how far they're going to go. But I think every city
right now is grappling with large gatherings, public schools, mass transit.  
  
The Theater District, in the case of New York, I mean school closings, of
course, have already started to happen. So, look, folks, we're dealing with
just -- it's an extraordinary and in many ways unprecedented set of challenges
for all of us.  
  
I take the subway to work. So we're all -- we're all just having to rely on
the authorities who are in the best position to assess the risks and to opine
on the available science. And it's just -- it's just progressing in a way
that's, I think, unprecedented. And so I think you're going to continue to see
these real-time reactions from various entities. Frankly, we know more today
than we did a week ago or the week before. And we'll know more a week from
now. And so that's why I'm the last one to be able to opine on what's going to
happen to the NCAA Tournament that's supposed to start next Wednesday.  
  
So the city will make its announcement and we'll see and we'll take their cues
and we'll go from there. Thank you.

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Patrick Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17044)

### [Terrell Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38996)

### [Jagan Mosely](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38997)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 75, Georgetown - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgetown.  
  
Q. Patrick, your two guys here, they obviously couldn 't take you to the
NCAA Tournament, but what did they give Georgetown this season? What kind of
reputation did they give the team?  
COACH EWING: They gave it their all. They gave it their all -- blood, sweat
and tears. I had to play them 40 minutes a game. They worked hard in practice.
They played hard in the games. Like I said, they gave it their blood, sweat
and tears.  
  
Q. When did you know that Omer (indiscernible)?  
COACH EWING: He practiced two days with us, so, still didn't know until today
when he said that he was.  
  
Q. Played him five minutes in the first half. Gave him a lot longer in
the second half. What did you see, (indiscernible) Omer?  
COACH EWING: That was his first game back, first really all out. He played
well in the first half. Went a little longer with him in the second half. It
was winning time. We were right there, up 10 with about six minutes to go,
just couldn't score after that. He went down. When he went down everything
just went downhill from there.  
  
Q. Terrell, you had obviously a great game tonight, can you tell us what
changed in the second half for you? And then also what kind of your last game
at Georgetown has meant to you?  
TERRELL ALLEN: St. John's, they played hard and they fought throughout the
whole game. Credit to them. I'm just glad I was able to play with Coach Pat,
great coach. With everything that he went through this year he continued to
make us believe and continue to keep fighting every single day.  
  
And then playing with Jagan, he's one of the best teammates I've ever played
with. Gave it all every day in practice, in weights, in the game. I just thank
Georgetown.  
  
Q. Mosely, the same question for you, what was it like standing out
there? You walked off with Muresan and Terrell.  
JAGAN MOSELY: It still doesn't feel real, to be honest with you. After their,
I guess, 20 -- 20-0 run, it kind of still hasn't hit me that the game ended
like that. You never want to go out on a loss. Obviously, 95 to 99 percent of
the teams in college end their careers in losses. But you never want to end it
like that.  
  
Still stinging right now. I'm not sure how to find the words right now. But
I'm appreciative of Coach Pat, Terrell, all my teammates and the Hoya fan
base. They embraced me with open arms when I came in when I was 18. And I
can't really find the words right now.  
  
Q. You had a long season, a lot of things were tough, couple of losses.
Can you talk about the mental and physical of your team during the season,
because they played really tough all year long?  
COACH EWING: I thought that they embraced the fact that we lost guys; guys got
hurt. I thought that they still believed in themselves. They kept working.
Both these guys stepped up and played extremely well for us. Jamorko Pickett
had a spell. And Jahvon Blair had a spell. But I thought the whole team,
especially these two guys, when you are building a team, you want to build
your team like with guys like these. They play hard. They practice hard. They
have a great basketball IQ. And they're winners.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Marcellus Earlington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38998)

### [LJ Figueroa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38999)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 75, Georgetown - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by St. John's.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: Proud of these guys. I always think the way we play is a game
of runs, and we had one of our better runs this year. Fatigue, I thought, was
a factor. You look at these two guys up here, I thought they were so important
in this particular win.  
  
And Georgetown, Pat has done an unbelievable job. He has a short bench. But
those guys continue to play at a high level. Allen, we had no answer for him
in the first half -- he and Pickett. I thought in the second half we did a
much better job of really making them feel our pressure defense.  
  
Fatigue was a factor in this game. I thought they wore down at the end. With
six minutes to go I think it's a 10-point game or something like that, 62-52,
I think, and we went on an unbelievable run.  
  
I just saw our guys, the energy level pick up. But it started with our
defense. Just first game you never know how your guys are going to come out.
Especially in the tournament setting, I didn't have a clue. But I guess they
satisfied me from the standpoint of they actually put together a much better
second half than they did the first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Marcellus, can you describe what it feels like to be in what those
last six minutes were, 23-0 run to finish the game, 3-pointers falling? What
was that like?  
MARCELLUS EARLINGTON: It was a great feeling. I work on my shot every day. So
it didn't surprise me as much. And my teammates did a good job of finding me
at my spots. I had good spot-up shots. Like I said, it was great to go out
there and go on that run.  
  
Coach always talks about periods. In practice we run four-minute periods,
three-minute periods. And I think we translated what we did in practice to the
game. So the outcome is great.  
  
Q. Coach, how are you guys able to turn it around the way you did during
the regular season? You 've lost a lot of close games. So how difficult was it
for you to, like, impress upon these guys it's not over?  
COACH ANDERSON: It tested my patience, I know that. I had to constantly preach
to these guys, just don't let go of the rope. We're close, guys, we're close.
And you could see it, because we had -- we started getting contributions from
some guys that, number one, they hadn't played at all last year. So they were
learning their roles.  
  
You talk about Marcellus. You talk about Greg Williams. Even Rasheem. He had
to settle down. The guy that constantly, I think he's -- I think he's kind of
the litmus test for our basketball team is Nick Rutherford. When he comes in,
things happen. And it seems like he's the Energizer Bunny or whatever, and he
just trickles throughout our team.  
  
I think it's just a combination of guys understanding their roles and not
getting so down because we were losing some close games. And all we had to do
was learn how to finish.  
  
We're competing, competing at a high level. But I guess to answer your
question, we got more guys that are giving us something. I thought our bench
played really, really well.  
  
We don't wear them down if David doesn't come in and give us those minutes.
Damien comes in and gives us quality minutes. Nick comes off the bench and
gives us quality minutes. So everybody that came in in this game contributed
in a big way.  
  
Q. You 've lost some games at the Garden like that where you've had
leads and haven't been able to finish. Obviously didn't lose on a 23-0 run.
But what was it like to pull a game out like that at the Garden, especially
the Big East Tournament and the way you did?  
LJ FIGUEROA: It's an unbelievable feeling. Just Coach always emphasizes we're
never out of game. We just go out there, play as hard as we can. I mean,
honestly I don't think anybody knew on the court that we were on a 23-0 run.
It just felt like we were out there having fun, and that's how it's supposed
to feel.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: And I think, you know, it's taking your practice to the game.
We always talk about that. And I even have to tell them sometimes don't act
like you never seen that before or act like you've seen it before because
they'll do something and they'll just kind of go crazy.  
  
I say, we do that every day in practice. But to see it in a game, it just
tells me that these guys are -- they're playing for each other; they're
trusting each other offensively and defensively. I thought the last six
minutes was a classic. I thought the trapping, the rotation -- just, I just
think guys just fixing things on defense, they were rotating the right place.  
  
We got every loose ball. We were getting rebounds. We were in attack mode. And
as Marcellus started knocking shots down we found the mismatch. Then, guess
what? It opened up the lane. And LJ Figueroa, he'll shoot it from half court
if you let him. That was a big shot he hit in the corner with the game still
in balance. But Georgetown was never out of the game.  
  
Q. Just to piggyback on that, in the beginning of the first half you
guys were giving up on the wings in the perimeter. Weak side help wasn 't to
your liking. Second half you pushed the tempo and the paint got restricted.
What halftime adjustment did you make and your team make?  
COACH ANDERSON: If you know what Georgetown was getting they were getting
layups or 3-point shots. That's what they were doing. I think early in the
game we had a little success touching balls and stealing some balls, and I
thought we got greedy. When you get greedy, guess what? You get out of
position.  
  
We shoot it. We're settling for jump shots. We shoot it and they get it and go
to the other end and we're jogging back. I talked about, guys, transition
defense will be first and foremost. Not only that, let's make sure our
pressure is going to be effective and with purpose.  
  
I thought let's make sure our rotations -- and take some pride in your
defense. I think sometimes guys have to take some individual pride. And let's
say the Allen kid, he was on a role, run. Somebody has to step up and say I
got him. Guess what? At halftime that's what they said.  
  
And then you look at the rebounds. I mean, we went small, went small in that
game. I thought it was an effective lineup. We had those three small guards,
and, LJ, you were my power forward?  
  
LJ FIGUEROA: Yeah.  
  
COACH ANDERSON: He was my power forward and look at the center here, but he's
shorter than me. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Each one of you give your own sort of version of the answer here. You
're about to play Creighton. They're the top seed but they're also a team that
you guys just smoked. Do you guys feel like maybe you're on the cusp of
something here?  
MARCELLUS EARLINGTON: I feel like as a team, feel like we could beat anybody
in the country. And you know we're just going to build off this win, the
momentum. If we come out and play the style of basketball we've been playing
all year, and if that outcome is the win, then it's a win.  
  
Q. L.J., what do you think?  
LJ FIGUEROA: We're going to go back to the hotel, get some rest, wake up in
the morning, the next game is the biggest game on our schedule. So we're just
going to come in and execute, play high energy, play our type of basketball
and live with the results.  
  
Q. How much confidence do you have playing Creighton here at the Garden
on your home court? Also they don 't have Marcus; he's injured, how will that
factor into it? How much confidence do you have playing them here,
Creighton?  
MARCELLUS EARLINGTON: I believe we can beat any team. So we're going to take
it like as it is any team. Have the same preparation. Go in with the same
mindset.  
  
Q. What about that, L.J.?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'll jump in on that one. They have players. They're a top 10
team, I think.  
  
Q. No. 7.  
COACH ANDERSON: That being said, Greg has done a great job with that
basketball team. They're the Big East champs. And so it's going to be an
awesome challenge, but at the same time it's a great opportunity and one of
the greatest tournaments there is, the Big East Tournament. So look forward to
the opportunity and the challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Commissioner Kevin
Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39029)

  
_Bankers Life Fieldhouse - Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Big Ten Conference Commissioner Kevin Warren.
We'll start with an opening statement.  
  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: Good morning or good afternoon now. One, I would like to
thank you all for making the time to come today, but also I thank you for
everything you all have done to promote and report on our great tournaments
and all of the Big Ten intercollegiate athletic sporting events.  
  
Today has been an interesting day. I would say the last couple months have
been very interesting from a health and wellness standpoint.  
  
As you make these decisions, which are not easy, you have to always ask
yourself, What is the right thing to do? I just felt very strongly that the
right thing to do for our student-athletes and for our fans and for the media
and for our families, our coaches, our administrators, was to make sure that
we cancel the Big Ten men's basketball tournament.  
  
I just found over my career the more complicated decisions are, basically the
answer is much more simple, and that is to always base your decisions on what
is the right thing to do.  
  
I strongly believe we have a fiduciary responsibility to our student-athletes
first and foremost, our fans, coaches, administrators, what is fair, even if
they want to continue playing.  
  
But I think as the administrators, as a conference, as our chancellors and
presidents, athletic directors, the athletic representatives, senior women
administrators, we have a responsibility to make sure we're always taking care
of the health and wellness and the safety of our student-athletes. So the
decision was made this morning to cancel the remainder of the men's basketball
tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions.  
  
Q. What changed from last night to this morning?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: I don't think any changed. Quite naturally this has been
something that I have been evaluating over the last six weeks as far as even
going into our women's tournament, then the men's tournament. I went and
attended the Big Ten wrestling championships at Rutgers on Saturday, then
coming back here.  
  
One of the great things we did some time, a week or so ago, we actually formed
a Big Ten Infectious Disease Committee. We have 14 incredible academic
institutions. One of the things I want to make sure that I do is rely on the
information and guidance from individuals in our conference.  
  
Also it's just to make sure we are thinking what's best for our student-
athletes. So I spent a lot of time thinking through this, meditating on it,
and really this morning praying on what is the right thing to do for the
health and safety of our student-athletes.  
  
It became crystal clear to me that I would recommend to our chancellors and
presidents and athletic directors that we would cancel the men's basketball
tournament.  
  
Q. Obviously the players got as far as onto the court at 11:00. It
seemed rather instantaneous if you 're thinking about it at 8:00 in the
morning. Why allow them to go through the emotions?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: That's a wonderful question. I had to make sure that I
was comfortable, that I had spoken to the appropriate people.  
  
I think one of the things that is important to me, not only as a human being
but as a commissioner, is transparency and communication.  
  
It was really important to me that I had an opportunity to talk to all of our
chancellors, presidents, athletic directors and other key individuals on our
campuses to discuss this issue.  
  
These are big decisions. They have major ramifications as far as scheduling,
all the other different things. So those things take time to be able to do it
with people's schedules. You don't want to rush these decisions. It would have
been great if it could have been two hours earlier this morning, but it
wasn't.  
  
I think the biggest thing is we made the right decision. I feel very good with
our decision. I'm very confident with our decision. We have a fiduciary
responsibility in the Big Ten to always show leadership especially in tough
times. I think that's something that we did today to do the right thing.  
  
Q. With what transpired last night with Coach Hoiberg falling ill, the
quarantine of the Nebraska players, did that get a lot of people 's attention
and raise the concern level?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: The answer is yes, quite naturally when it happens in
your environment. But that was one piece of the decision-making process. I
feel confident that I would have come to the same decision this morning with
or without that. That was an element of it, but it was so much bigger than
that.  
  
I think the biggest thing for me was to make sure that we had time. I just
found during life that if you take a step back, very rarely do you regret it.
We needed to make sure we had the appropriate time to make the appropriate
decisions. This won't be the last decision. We'll go right from here to start
evaluating how long is this for, what other events does it impact.  
  
But I think the biggest thing for us is to make sure that we had time. This
allows us to take a step back, take a deep breath, gather information, gather
qualitative medical information, consult with our experts and continually make
good decisions. Time is our friend in these kinds of situations.  
  
Q. The verbiage in the release is 'canceling'. The NBA said 'suspend'.
Is there any chance that later on you might revisit concluding the
tournament?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: I would say no. I think it's important, we wanted to make
it clear, that we're canceling it because, again, first and foremost we need
to make sure we protect the health and safety of you all, of our student-
athletes, of our administrators, of our fans.  
  
I wish I knew more information. This is a fluid situation. I can't recall the
last time we've had a pandemic, but we do here. It's really important that
we're thoughtful. If it comes down that I overreacted or we overreacted, I'm
comfortable with that.  
  
I think as I sit here today in these kind of situations, you can never
overreact from a safety standpoint, and I think we needed to make sure we went
to the highest level to give us a chance to deal with this acute problem.  
  
Q. With the weight this league carries, what should happen with the NCAA
tournament?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: I did communicate with Mark Emmert right before the
release went out so he would know what was going on.  
  
I'm a big believer, once you make a decision, once you feel in your heart that
it's the right decision, regardless of what anyone else did, it was not going
to sway me or sway us as far as the decision that we made.  
  
The only thing that I would offer from an advice standpoint, whether it's the
NCAA or any other person in my seat, would be just make sure you put the
student-athletes at the epicenter of your decision. If you do that, I think
you'll be led to the right decision.  
  
As I thought through it, like I say, spent time, when I woke up this morning
even more so than I felt yesterday, I just felt in my spirit that this was the
right thing to do to make sure that we're doing what we're saying we're doing,
and that is that we want to make sure that our student-athletes have an
opportunity on our college campuses to get a world class education, to
participate in intercollegiate athletics, but we create an environment that
they are healthy from a holistic standpoint, from a mental health standpoint,
physical standpoint, and we show them leadership.  
  
This is a chance for a lot of people to understand and learn what the Big Ten
stands for, that's to make sure we're going to make decisions, whether they
may seem complicated, I know for us, I'm honored to be able to serve our
presidents, chancellors, athletic directors, faculty, athletic reps, 10,000
student-athletes who call themselves Big Ten student-athletes.  
  
Q. As far as you know, to be clear, no one here has tested positive,
been quarantined?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: No, no, not at all.  
  
Q. In your conversation with Mr. Emmert, did you get any sense about
what they are going to do at the next level?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: I did not. It was a very, very brief conversation. It was
more so out of respect. I just wanted him to hear it from me first before he
read it. We didn't have that conversation. Probably lasted about a minute. I
just wanted to let him know so he was aware. I'm sure people would call him,
but to let him know what we were doing.  
  
Q. Did the use of that word 'pandemic' by the WHO sway you?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: No. Again, whether they had used the word 'pandemic' or
not, I still would have reached this decision.  
  
I think the biggest thing is the uncertainty. I'm a big believer in asking a
lot of questions, gathering information, and making decisions based upon the
best information that I have.  
  
This is one of those situations that there were a lot of people who were
telling me: I don't know. I get concerned when I hear 'I don't know' a few
many times.  
  
I don't want to have any regrets. I want to make sure as a conference we do
the right things because if something had gone awry here, I don't want to be
in a position looking back saying, Only if we would have canceled this
tournament.  
  
I know we all love college athletics, we love basketball, women's and men's
basketball. This is a great time of the year. It's part of the fabric of our
country.  
  
Again, these are not easy decisions, but I feel very good with the decision we
have made at the Big Ten Conference to cancel our Big Ten Men's Basketball
Tournament.  
  
Q. We 're at a basketball tournament. The Big Ten Hockey Tournament is
next. Decisions made regarding those games?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: Again, that's what my afternoon will be filled with, is
making those other decisions. I just thought from you all's standpoint, from
our fans standpoint, student-athletes and coaches standpoint, we needed to
make this decision for this tournament today because that's right in front of
us.  
  
We have a hockey tournament coming up, gymnastics, wrestling, a lot of
different things that are coming down the path that we need to decide on. I
just wanted to be able to take a breather today and start working through
those different issues. Again, have a lot of conversations. I know this won't
be the last time I'll see your smiling faces so we can talk about these
issues.  
  
Q. You mentioned the good news that no one has tested positive. Do you
know if the Nebraska players and staff were tested?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: I don't know that. I will find that out today. Last night
quite naturally the games went late. Last night was a late night. This morning
was an early morning. I've been working on this throughout the morning.  
  
As I sit here today, I don't believe anyone has tested positive for the virus,
thank God.  
  
Q. When you were making the announcement, the teams were preparing for
their game, specifically the two teams including Michigan, when they were
getting ready, how did they find out you were making this decision and stop
warming up?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: Once we made the decisions and talked with our
chancellors and presidents, I made it very clear we did after that call, we
had a call with our athletic directors, senior women administrators, faculty
reps. I believe the two athletic directors were Warde Manuel from Michigan and
Pat Hobbs at Rutgers, talked to their appropriate coaches, who also then
disseminated that information to the team.  
  
I thought it was important that the individual institutions have a chance to
communicate that to the teams because then that way, if the student-athletes
or coaches had questions, they could answer them. That's how the information
was distributed to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I believe the ACC just crowned Florida State the No. 1 seed, the
tournament champion. I was wondering if you had any plans to crown a champion
when there wasn 't a tournament played?  
COMMISSIONER WARREN: As I sit here today, it is difficult to crown a champion
if you don't compete. We do have three champions from the regular season.
That's the other thing, when you think about it, we were blessed with an
incredible Big Ten basketball season, the number of teams that played well. We
have those memories to really think about as we sit here today.  
  
I don't think I would recommend to our staff or crown a champion from the
tournament because we didn't get a chance to play the tournament.  
  
Again, I just want to thank you all for everything you do. I know your jobs
are not easy. You take time away from your families to sacrifice. It's these
kind of memories that will carry us for a long time. Again, I thank you for
your professionalism and supporting our conference. Look forward to working
with you.

_Bankers Life Fieldhouse - Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 74, Northwestern - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now going to be joined by the Minnesota Golden Gophers.
Coach Richard Pitino, along with Payton Willis, Marcus Carr, and Daniel Oturu.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Obviously, they were very, very aggressive with us on ball
screens, and I thought we did a terrific job of adjusting in the second half
and spreading out the basketball and sharing it very, very well, as well as
not turning the ball over was key for us.  
  
So a terrific second half offensively as well as defensively holding them to
26 points. So a great win for our guys. Excited to continue to move on in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Marcus, just talk about what the difference was in the second half
with the three-point shooting. Obviously, Gabe hit one early, and even Alihan
hit one. Did that get you guys going?  
MARCUS CARR: Yeah, it was just the mentality coming out of halftime. We knew
we weren't playing the way we wanted to play. That kind of just fell into
that. We were being more aggressive, getting the assist to jump shots, driving
the ball, kicking it out and getting guys open and taking good looks and
shooting with confidence.  
  
Q. Daniel, 15 in the first half, 24 overall. Obviously, it 's the Big
Ten Tournament. Any extra motivation coming in given all Big Ten teams?  
DANIEL OTURU: Not really. We just came in prepared for aggression, and we were
just trying to get a win, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. For the students, Coach mentioned the ball screens. What were some of
the other things that Northwestern was doing that made it difficult for you
guys in the first half that made it kind of tough?  
PAYTON WILLIS: They were doubling Dan down low and somebody caught it. Besides
the ball screens, I think that was the big adjustment we made in the second
half. And handling their ball screens and dribble handouts, that was also an
adjustment we made.  
  
Q. Marcus, for you, what was the message at halftime after a 29-point
first half?  
MARCUS CARR: We weren't really too focused on offense all the time. We know
that defense really kind of fuels us. We were playing well on the defensive
end, we were able to get stops and get rebounds and then run out and get easy
points in transition. I would say most of the talk was let's get some more
easy baskets and just attack more. We were kind of being kind of stagnant, get
some better movement in our motion. Whenever we were passing to Dan or whoever
or just moving the ball or just kind of cut with a purpose, screen with a
purpose.  
  
Q. For Daniel, what do you take from the first two meetings with Iowa in
terms of Garza, the challenges of trying to slow him, and how much did you
learn about what you might need to do tomorrow in that way? For the other two
guys, I don 't know if you know, but tomorrow starts the fan free, the very
small group out there because of the virus. Have you thought at all about what
that might be like to play in that environment? How might that force you to
draw more motivation from within or intensity from within?  
DANIEL OTURU: Luka Garza is one of the best players in the country, so being
able to go up against a guy that always brings the best out of you, you want
to compete with him because you know he's going to bring it. And you know,
just being solid on defense and trying to make it as hard as possible for him
is a key. He's a great player. He's going to make tough shots, but at the end
of the day, just going to try to compete with him and maybe even compete
harder than him.  
  
Q. Payton, can you talk about tomorrow 's game?  
PAYTON WILLIS: Certainly, with no fans, it will be a different atmosphere,
kind of like a closed scrimmage but obviously more on the line. We'll be
coming out and competing just like there's fans out there and trying to get
the "W" tomorrow.  
  
MARCUS CARR: Just like Payton said, we're going to come out with the same
mentality. Obviously, it's going to be a new environment for us, but we're
just going to come out with the mentality to win.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on what the previous question was, when is the
last time that you probably have played in front of such a small crowd, and
did you have any health concerns coming in here?  
DANIEL OTURU: I don't remember it, to be honest.  
  
Q. Payton, in the second half there, you hit those back-to-back threes.
It looked like you were ready to let it go before you even got the ball. Could
you talk about your confidence level tonight and overall going forward?  
PAYTON WILLIS: Yeah, I always have confidence in myself to shoot the ball and
knock down open shots. It just so happened those two plays, we had good ball
movement, and I was the recipient of the jump shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Students, thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how can you get off to a better start offensively and make
sure you don 't come out sluggish tomorrow?  
RICHARD PITINO: Got to give the defense credit. Defense had a lot to do with
it. I thought Chris put together a really good game plan, and they guarded us
differently than we anticipated, and I thought we did a good job adjusting. I
thought our defense was pretty consistent, and we stuck with what we do, but
also adjusted a little bit at halftime, but give them credit.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys beat Northwestern pretty handily in your last
matchup. It was obviously tied at the end of the first half. Do you think that
was more of your team coming out sluggish or, like, Northwestern just having a
lot of improvement since you last played them?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I think Northwestern won 2 of 3 and beat Penn State,
who's a really good team, handily. They went after Nebraska, which is hard to
do, and they had a really good game plan. They changed up what they did.  
  
So give them credit. I didn't think we were sluggish. I thought we missed some
open looks at the beginning, but it's a 40-minute game.  
  
Q. Weeks ago, you guys obviously were playing for a lot, NCAA Tournament
and such. Do you feel like the last couple games recently, that they 've been
a little bit more pressure free?  
RICHARD PITINO: I don't think so. I think we've been playing the same all
year. I think that we're playing good basketball. We've just had a couple of
bounces not go our way, but I think it's a good team. I really do. I think
that you look at all of our numbers across the board, obviously, a young team
that's played a very, very tough schedule and just had a couple bounces not go
our way. But I think we're a good team and we're playing well.  
  
Q. Richard, the challenges of facing Garza here this time amidst the
record setting kind of year, what do you think improved from the first meeting
to the second with him specifically? And the trouble you 've had getting your
three-pointer going against him in those two meetings, what did you do?  
RICHARD PITINO: We haven't been great offensively against them. Obviously,
Garza is one of the best players in the country. We've got to -- you know,
with short prep time, we've got to be confident. I think we're scoring the
basketball pretty well as of late. Obviously, Garza from a defensive side of
it for us is such a load. He's so hard to guard. They run so many good things
for him, and he just keeps coming at you.  
  
We've got to get great rest, get off our feet, try to watch a little film
tonight and tomorrow and get excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. You 've been incredibly positive during this end of the season and
talking about it now as well. What was the message at halftime? Obviously, it
was a point in the game where you guys weren't playing very well.  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, just make an adjustment. I thought we did a good job
adjusting to what they did. Again, give them credit. I thought they had a
really good game plan to try to take Marcus out of it, to try to trap Daniel,
and we did a good job of adjusting.  
  
Like I said, we've lost so many close games. We've had some devastating ones.
But it's an easy group to coach. They're great kids. They're fun to be around.
So we stayed the course, and hopefully we can take advantage of a great
opportunity tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_Bankers Life Fieldhouse - Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 89, Nebraska - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, begin with an opening statement about the game.  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Credit to Nebraska. I thought they started the game ready to
play, and we knew that they would. They've been a really tough guard for us
all season long with the way they space the floor and shoot the three. Early
on, I didn't think we were ready, and then as the half sort of closed, we had
a big run, which was a real key part of the game. Being able to go into
halftime with a lead was important, and then we started the second half, I
thought, really well as well to build a cushion.  
  
They made their runs during the half, got us a little bit stationary at times,
but I thought overall our guys responded and were able to finish the game in a
big way. And I'm proud of our depth. I thought we had a lot of guys. We were
committed to playing a lot of guys tonight, and we had a lot of guys play
valuable minutes and get some things done.  
  
This closes the chapter of the first one, which is always the hardest, and now
the energy level and the adrenaline and feeling good about yourself, playing
in postseason, you know, is upon you. You get an opportunity to play against a
really good Penn State team tomorrow. I would say it would probably be a heck
of an environment in here, but I think it's going to be more of a closed
scrimmage, it seems like, which is unfortunate, but we'll be ready to go, like
I said. Penn State's had a heck of a season. They have a heck of a team, so
we've got a good challenge.  
  
Q. I think Armaan Franklin took around three charges tonight. Before,
you talked about how he takes a lot of charges for the team. How pleasing is
it, when he comes into the game, for him to make those kinds of plays?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I'm proud of Armaan. Here the last three or four weeks, his
role really hasn't diminished in our eyes, but his minutes have gone down. He
stays with it. He's a great kid. He's an unbelievable teammate. In some of our
biggest wins, as you finish the regular season and you look back on your
season and you figure out who can help you at this time of year when it means
the most, it's the guys that care the most. Armaan really cares, and lo and
behold tonight, when he got his number called, he was able to play 25 good
minutes. He was plus 32 in his minutes out there, so it was a direct result of
how he played.  
  
But like you said, he drew three charges. He's done that all season long. He
leads us in that department. He also made some shots for us, which was great,
and had eight defensive rebounds. Proud of Armaan. He really stepped up. Like
everybody who got in, I thought everybody contributed in a big way, and we
needed it, and 23 assists and only 10 turnovers with the ability to rebound
the ball much better in the second half, especially Trayce. He had 14
defensive rebounds. I think he had 8 in the second half.  
  
But we got the job done. That's what you ask for, and like I said, we're
moving on.  
  
Q. Archie, I don 't know how much you know, but seasons are getting
cancelled or whatever all over the place. You sound like tomorrow's going to
happen with Penn State. Are you kind of hoping, or do you know? Furthermore,
what's it like to be you right now? We have no idea if we're going to watch
you play again this year.  
ARCHIE MILLER: I was told coming off of the floor, obviously, of the
unfortunate circumstances with the NBA, putting it on hold. I told our team
that that happened, and we'll brace ourselves for what happens next. I think
it's an evolving situation, and it's rapid, but it puts it into reality of the
seriousness of it. When world experts start to recommend things, you obviously
better listen. Obviously, you cross your fingers that the college basketball
landscape can continue on, even if it means there aren't fans.  
  
You grind it out and get to this point of the season, it's the most special
time for our young guys. It's most special time for, obviously, the fans, and
to get here with this happening, obviously, is a little bit unfortunate. So I
think we're all crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, which is
allowing us to continue to play. But like I said, when experts speak up, you'd
better listen, and I think the NBA just probably put the sporting world on
hold. We'll hope for the best that clearly we're preparing to play tomorrow.
Hopefully, that continues on.  
  
Probably a lot like you guys, this is uncharted territory, and it's serious,
and we don't want to do anything to harm anybody. We've got to listen to what
they say, and we'll go with it.  
  
Q. Archie, two questions related to tomorrow. One, not getting the fan
support that you did tonight, I mean, what kind of -- not disadvantage, but
does it kind of neutralize them being here?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, I think one of the great things about being at Indiana is
the fans. Whether we would be playing in Chicago or whether we'd be playing --
I mean, obviously, we come heavy when we come. To be able to play in
Indianapolis, you felt it tonight. We have unbelievable support in here, and
each day that you'd be here, if you're fortunate enough to keep going, it
would only grow. The city of Indianapolis is by far and away the best place to
host it. So you know it's going to be an unbelievable vibe for our players,
their families, and whatnot.  
  
We've scrimmaged in here, so we've had some closed door scrimmages in here
last few years. Like I told those guys, we've already done it once. So we'll
play the game with no one in here, and we'll let it rip. I think TV is still
obviously going to cover it. Everyone is going to find a nice patio or bar or
whatever you do, and you're going to cheer like crazy outside.  
  
It is what it is. The other team is going to have the same circumstances with
nobody in the arena. I probably would say, yeah, we'd love to have our people
in here. Maybe they'll just let our people in here and not let their people in
here, I don't know. It's unfortunate.  
  
Q. Do you think you or other coaches would coach differently if
everybody could hear what you 're saying? Whether it's cursing or barking out
stuff to players. How do you think that could be different?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, I think so, when there's 20,000 people in there and you
are able to scream and yell and do whatever you want to do. I will say it's
going to be a lot easier to get Trayce's attention tomorrow, and that's
probably an advantage for me because I think he'll be able to hear me, and
he'll be able to look at me clearly and know I'm talking to him. Yeah, I don't
think we'll coach anything differently. I think you're going to coach your
heart out as a coach. I think you're going to play your heart out as a player.  
  
But not having any fans will dim the noise a little bit, and maybe you got to
cover your mouth with the playbook, play card or something, I don't know.  
  
Q. Archie, what do you think of the way you closed the the first half,
opened the second half, and really took control?  
ARCHIE MILLER: The close of the first half was the most important because I
thought the pressure of the game coming in obviously felt a little funny.
Nebraska being shorthanded, the talk around our team needing to do this and
that, you can get tight in a game like that. Nebraska started off loose, and
they were playing fast, and we weren't ready for that early, but I thought our
guys did a good job of kind of hanging in there, and right when we were able
to get a few stops, we capitalized. Devonte was a big part of the end of the
first half. To start the second half, Rob was a big part of the second half.
He got going and made some really good plays. To be able to extend the lead at
the end and then the beginning, I think showed that we were able to put our
foot down defensively to get stops. They're a hard guard for us.  
  
Then we were able to play through a run in the second half, which was good.
They made it a little tighter with about eight to go, and we were able to make
a couple plays. I think that's the big thing this time of year for our team;
who can step up and make free-throws or step up and make a couple plays when
you need a play, offensively or defensively. Tonight what I was proud of is we
had a lot of guys in the game doing good things, not just one.  
  
Q. Coach, when you updated the team in terms of what had transpired
during the game in terms of the health scare, what did you see on their faces?
What was the reaction you got?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, it was like telling them a family member was sick or
something happened to somebody. Obviously, our guys are in tune with what's
going on with the virus, but when you say, fellas, you've got to hear this,
but the NBA season has just been cancelled, you see a bunch of young guys
looking at you like, yeah, what we've been telling you is things are kind of
serious. Go wash your hands. Make sure you're doing what you're supposed to do
right now.  
  
Hopefully, we can get things cleared up. We have the world's best. Hopefully,
we can get this thing under control a little bit and get back to business.
Hopefully, the NBA can get back into the arenas and start playing. I think the
big concern for us right now is the collegiate game. I think we're all sitting
here teetering on worrying about not only the Big Ten Tournament in the next
48 hours but what happens after Sunday. So I think that's obviously a little
bit nerve-racking for a lot of people right now.  
  
Q. Archie, since everybody 's so concerned about this, is everybody
healthy on your team? Health-wise, there's no colds or flus or sicknesses or
anything? People are concerned.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, it's a good question. I think that we're okay. In terms
of that, obviously, we've got unbelievable medical staff here with us, and
Tim, our trainer, is on it right now. But all of our players coming into the
game and coming to the tournament are all doing really well. I think right now
you're monitoring every situation with the best you can, but I think we're
okay there.  
  
Q. I 'm sorry this is the last one, Archie, but you had three players'
names up there, and now they're gone. What happened?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I decided to basically just move those guys as fast as we
possibly can to get cleaned up after the game and get to the hotel as fast as
possible. I think, once you start getting the news that we got after the game,
I think right now for our players, it's let's get cleaned up, let's get out of
here, and let's get back to the hotel where we can keep our group kind of
tight and move forward with tomorrow.  
  
They're not going to have a whole lot of answers about what's going on anyway.
Nothing strategic there or anything other than the fact that, hey, let's get
these guys moving on their way, and I'll take care of the press conference.

_Bankers Life Fieldhouse - Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 74, Northwestern - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Northwestern is going to bring Boo Buie, Miller Kopp and Pete
Nance.  
  
We are joined by Northwestern Coach Chris Collins and their students. Coach,
can you give an opening statement?  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: First, congrats to Minnesota on advancing. Really proud of my
group. I thought we played a very good first half tonight. I thought we were
defending well, we were doing a good job. Their three-point shooting can be
really devastating when they get going, and I thought we did a great job in
the first half, even though Oturu was scoring, we were doing a good job on
those other guys.  
  
And the second half it got away from us, obviously. They hit nine threes in
the second half and only had three in the first. That's where the -- with us
only hitting five threes, that's a minus 21 at the three-point line, and
that's hard. That's hard against anybody to make up.  
  
I'm really proud of this group. It's not about the wins and losses this year.
We wanted to win more. We fought all year long. That's what I'm so proud
about. That's what I'm excited about these young guys sitting up here. There
was never a day throughout any losing streaks or tough losses or whatever we
went through, there was never a day that I came in the gym that they didn't
want to get better, they didn't want to get to work, and they didn't want to
keep fighting and keep playing. They won some games late, which I think gave
us some momentum going into the off-season. We've got work to do. We'll have
most of our players back. We'll be adding some guys that were injured sitting
out.  
  
I'm really excited about the direction of where these guys are headed.  
  
Q. For Pete and Boo. Pete, start with you. You seemed to really figure
stuff out in the final month or so. Like, what happened with your game, would
you say?  
PETE NANCE: There's nothing really to it. I just kind of got in the gym. I
knew I had to stop pointing fingers and look inward, and I just really got in
the gym and got to work. I'm glad I could get some momentum leading into the
off-season.  
  
Q. Boo, you had that great stretch midway through the season and then
you got hurt and couldn 't seem to get back on track. What's the state of your
game now and what was going on the final several weeks?  
BOO BUIE: I think that any lower body injury sets you back a little bit. I
continuously got in the gym. I just tried to keep getting better and help my
team out. So it wasn't really that I was any worse or anything. I was just
doing anything for my team so that we could be better and I could be better.
So even if that's not scoring a lot of points like I was early on, you know,
just learning and growing is what I was focused on when I came back from my
injury.  
  
Q. How do you feel about where this program is at now that you 're at
the end of your sophomore season?  
MILLER KOPP: We're really positive. We're using this game and this season
really as motivation going into the off-season, going into next season. Our
heads are up, and this season was tough, but we're using -- we have used and
will use every loss, every trial and tribulation as motivation going into the
off-season.  
  
PETE NANCE: He said it exactly right. We've got a great young group moving
forward, and we're all going to put our heads down and just work. We have a
lot to prove, and I know that we believe that we can accomplish a lot. That's
what's most important, and we're going to stick together and just get to work,
and we're going to get a lot better, and we'll be back.  
  
Q. This one 's for Coach. What are some of the biggest things you think
you learned about your team and your program this season?  
CHRIS COLLINS: With so many new players and so many new faces, it was a great
opportunity for me to kind of watch these guys develop as players, try to put
them in the places where they could be successful. We had some injuries. We
lost Anthony Gaines. We then lost Boo. Miller was a rock for us all year. He
made a huge jump in his game from last year to this year and became, in my
opinion, someone who's going to be an all-conference guy going forward.  
  
To watch Pete's development the last month, where there were a lot of critics,
a lot of people down on what he was doing, and like he said, he just got to
work. He listened. He learned. He got in the gym, and he had a great last
month.  
  
Our young core, Ryan Young, Jared Jones, Robbie Beran, Ryan Greer. There's a
really young group of guys that I was still learning as players. These guys
are playing together for the first time. I'll be better for it, too. These
guys are saying they're going to be better. I'm going to be better for it,
having coached these guys for a year, understanding their skill sets a little
better, seeing what we can use, and how we can do things offensively and
defensively. It's going to be a huge off-season of development for all of us
-- players, coaches, everybody involved in the program.  
  
It's not about having a bunch of new guys. We're going to have most of these
guys back. We'll have a few new pieces. We'll lose a couple guys, but the core
of this team is going to be back, and it's going to be a great opportunity --
spring, summer, fall -- until we play again next November to look like a
different team when take the floor. I'm really confident about that. I really
am. What these guys showed me with their fight and their -- this Big Ten this
year was a monster. Everybody saw it. You guys saw it. And they went out every
night. Maybe a couple games that we weren't competitive. For the most part,
over a 20-game season, we were competitive night in and night out with a group
that's never been out there before, and that showed me what these guys are
going to be, and it makes me really encouraged about where we're headed.  
  
Q. Boo, your off-season, man, what are you going to work on? Are you in
the mode of thinking jump shots first or are you going to try to get to the
rack more? Tell me about your off-season plans.  
BOO BUIE: In my off-season, I'm going to work on -- I'm going to get with the
coaches. I'm going to talk to my coaches and trust them in what they have to
say and what they think I need to develop in. I'm always going to continuously
work on my game and my craft. This off-season, I think, is going to be huge
for me to get in the weight room and gain a couple of pounds. Just keep
watching film, studying guards, and becoming a better point guard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That will conclude questions for our students. We'll continue
with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, Gabe Kalscheur had eight threes in his last game.
You limited him to one. Were you surprised they got contributions from so many
other guys from the three-point range?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Payton has made them all year. Marcus has made them all year.
Against us, for whatever reason, Oturu becomes like Klay Thompson. He made 3
of 5 in our last game. He makes 2 of 2 tonight. He's 5 for 7 against us from
three, Which, really, that's where you want him. You want him shooting threes
because he's a load down low.  
  
I thought when the game was in the balance in the early part of the second
half, I really thought Demir's seven points were big. He went down there,
scored twice in the post, and hit a three. That gave them a little separation
when the game was still in doubt. Obviously, Alihan has been a guy that's been
making shots for them. I don't think tonight -- these guys, if you let all
four of their guys get going, if you let Oturu, Willis, Carr, and Kalscheur
all play well, you've got to try to do a good job on two of them. That's when
they've struggled is when they don't have 3 of the 4 going.  
  
I thought in the first half, it was going by the book for us. Oturu was going,
but the other three weren't really getting the shots, getting the points, and
that's why they only had 29. Then in the second half, those guards really
picked it up, and that's when it got going downhill for us.  
  
Q. What do you think the decision to play the rest of the tournament
without fans and obviously the NCAA Tournament without fans will do? What do
you think about that?  
CHRIS COLLINS: The players and coaches are going to be super invested. You've
played a whole year. Obviously, everybody wants what's right for -- if there's
a health issue that's going to impact the people in our near -- our vicinity,
globally, whatever it is, we've got to take care of that, and I think
everybody is in full agreement of that.  
  
I think the players that are here, the coaches that are here, even though the
fans won't be -- there won't be any lack of intensity or want to. This Big Ten
season has been such a fight for all these teams, that I'd be shocked if you
saw in the dip in the level of play. I think everybody is just curious and
concerned to get more information to figure out what's going to be best so we
can stop this thing and not let it become worse.  
  
Q. Coach, in your last matchup with Minnesota, they handled you guys
pretty well in the first half, like 44 points. This time, you only limited
them to 29 points. What do you think your defense did better? What did you
guys improve upon to hold them down like that?  
CHRIS COLLINS: We were trying to get up on the three-point shooters better.
They hit 14 on us last game. Our goal was to try to hold them under 10.
Really, like I said, we knew that Oturu was going to score. We couldn't allow
him to get like a 30, 20 game, but he's too good of a player because of
offensive rebounds and activity. He finds his way to 20 points. He's done it
all year long.  
  
Could we limit his just completely going crazy and then do a great job on the
guards? I thought early in the game, we put a little bit more -- Marcus Carr
really dominated us in the last game. I thought we tried to be a little bit
more aggressive. We tried to get the ball out of his hands and make those
other guys be playmakers, and I thought for a while it went well, but they
adjusted, they actually regrouped at halftime, and obviously in the second
half, they scored 45, which is just not where we needed it. If we were going
to be competitive, we couldn't allow them to get going offensively like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question for coach. Second row on the right.  
  
Q. What 's the biggest thing you have to change to make the jump next
season?  
CHRIS COLLINS: I think physicality. Physical and mental toughness. You see
that a lot. It's not just one. I think, as a collective group, just fighting
through stretches and games where it's not going so well. That's where
experience, that's where toughness -- a lot of our guys have younger bodies
physically. I think we have to have a big summer in the weight room getting
stronger just to endure the physicality of this league, and I think we've got
to get better as players, and I think that starts with me being able to help
these guys in skill development, player development. I think you saw guys got
better this year, like I said, with Miller. He was a much better player this
year. I think you saw with Pete within this season, and that's a testament to
the work our coaches do.  
  
That's something we've always prided ourselves on is that our guys get better
during their careers. So I think we're just anxious. We're going to go a
couple weeks, obviously figure out what's going on with school and all these
things, and then we'll get back at it. I know our guys are anxious. It's a
good, young group. How our guys have been this year through some adversity has
really showed me a lot. They never fragmented. They never splintered. They
never pointed fingers. They just kept coming back and wanting to work and
getting better. That's why I was so happy they found some wins late in the
season because that can go a long way in helping us get ready for where we
need to be next year.  
  
We've got to be better. There's no question. We've got to be better in almost
every area.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Craig Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13780)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

### [Neemias Queta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36863)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 59, San Diego State - 56  
  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, that's what March Madness is all about right now, and I
know that's easy for me to say being on the victorious side, but that was a
whale of a basketball game, and two highly competitive teams, two very, very
talented teams, and let's not forget like these guys are basketball players
and they make all the plays, and tremendous defense I thought by both teams.
Very good offense, as well. We played three games in three days; it's a bit of
a grind. They are very, very well-coached. They're a very, very good team, and
they can do it all at every position.  
  
I thought our guys played with tremendous poise tonight. Early on we got a bit
of a lead, and these two guys had great looks, I thought, most of the night.
We just couldn't get them to fall at times, but they were getting clean looks.
But we just -- instead of letting frustration set in, we just kept battling.  
  
I thought a big key to the game, certainly down the stretch, but besides that,
the way we finished the first half was huge because not a lot was going right
on the offensive end, and we kind of weathered the storm. Went on a little bit
of a run, and then even that last play with 1 point whatever seconds it was,
Abel Porter was our inbounder and finds Brito wide open, kind of on the other
side of the top of the key, and he sticks that three, and we go in at halftime
down eight, but quite frankly it felt like we should have been down 18. And so
that was huge for us.  
  
And then we had a great start to the second half. I think we went on a 7-0
run, if I remember correctly. That gave our fan base a lot of juice and I
think it gave our guys some juice.  
  
Alphonso Anderson, and I'll get to these guys, but Fonz gave us some huge
minutes all game long but certainly hit those two huge threes when they were
up eight or seven, and it kind of kept them at bay, and then we were able to
get enough stops there down the stretch. And Neemy hit a big kind of jump hook
late in the clock, hits the front rim and rolls in, and he's been working a
lot on his touch, and then certainly Sam's three right at the end.  
  
It kind of felt like one of those games where whoever is going to have the
ball last is going to find a way to win, and then they almost throw in a half-
courter. But it was a heavyweight fight. We knew it was going to go 15 rounds,
and fortunately for us we were the last man standing.  
  
One more thing: You know, I said it out there, but our team has been through a
lot of stuff this year with injuries, and I know that people can roll their
eyes, and I get all that, but our guys stayed the course and stuck with it and
stuck with it, and just never lost confidence, and we just were never going to
flinch. We were just going to keep going and keep going. And I'm a history
major, so where we are, where we were, where we're going, and this league has
such a rich tradition in men's basketball, and to be able to repeat back to
back, it hasn't been done in a long time, I'm not sure when the last time, but
it's been quite some time, and that's a difficult, difficult thing to do, and
I couldn't be more proud of these young men.  
  
Q. Sam, what 's going through your head on that final shot?  
SAM MERRILL: I was just trying to get a good look. We had been hoping that I
would get that opportunity. I barely slept last night, partially because the
schedule is rough when you play that late-night game Friday night, and it's a
quick turnaround, only got a few hours of sleep, but I was just hoping that
I'd get that opportunity, and I had a move and vision that I was going to do.
I didn't get to it because he took it away, but I just threw it up there and
it went in. I made that shot before, but you guys know what I'm saying.  
  
Q. Can you tell me what the importance that Justin Bean brings to the
table, being able to get all those rebounds tonight?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Amazing. Bean is a great offensive rebounder, and a defensive
rebounder, too. I just feel that he just has a knack for knowing where the
ball will fall, and he positions himself in the spots to get the rebounds, and
he outworks everybody. I feel that his juice never ends. He's just constantly
outworking everybody, and I just feel that he's amazing at it.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, he's the ultimate glue guy. Just like Neemy said, he's
always getting after loose balls, always getting rebounds. He's got such a
knack for the ball, and he makes timely plays. He made that play sometime in
the second half when he drove a closeout, and we'd been yelling at him to do
that. We were going to try to throw it back and he was going to drive the
close-out, and he finally did it, and he was under control and lofted it over
to Neemy and that was a big bucket. I think that put us up four. So he does it
all.  
  
Q. Sam, it 's no secret that you grew up a Utah State fan. What does it
mean to you personally to be not just a part of one of the greatest stretches
of Utah State basketball's history but also be one of the main drivers of
it?  
SAM MERRILL: Oh, it's everything. Like you said, that's what I've been
reaching for my whole life and trying to accomplish, and when we lost at New
Mexico last week, I know Coach said he doesn't pay attention to bracketology,
but I do, and I knew that the cards were stacked against us, and this morning
getting prepared for the game, I was just -- I did not want to play in the
NIT. I didn't know what was going to happen if we lost, but --  
  
CRAIG SMITH: We would have got in to the NCAA. They're smart people.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, but we had a sense of urgency all week. We didn't play
incredibly all week, but we found a way to win, and for me personally, just to
be a part of it and to see all those fans there and to see Utah State back on
the map is -- like I said last year, it's unlike anything I could have ever
imagined.  
  
Q. Sam, where would you rank that shot in your career?  
SAM MERRILL: One time, my seventh grade year of junior high, my coach didn't
play seventh graders but one game were up like 40 and he decided to put us in
and I hit a half-court shot at the buzzer, so it's comparable to that one
probably. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Halftime adjustments are a big part of the game. Same, obviously
fatigue in the first half must have been playing a role, but you come out in
the second half and you think you 'd be more fatigued then, but you guys came
out a different team, what was your locker room atmosphere like at halftime?  
SAM MERRILL: Well, like Coach said, that finish to the half, we had 11 points
with three and a half minutes left. Part of that was -- everyone knows how
good San Diego State is but we had missed a ton of open shots, and then we
were able to score 10 points in those last three minutes and get it to eight.
Like Coach said, that was a big shot by Diogo. We felt confident because we
had missed so many shots, and defensively we had been pretty good. Just made a
couple mistakes.  
  
We felt confident. Felt like if we could fix a couple things and make a couple
adjustments, we'd be in good shape, and just came out with a ton of energy and
our crowd was fantastic. I know there was a ton of San Diego State fans, but
our crowd was just as good tonight.  
  
Q. Sam, seriously on that last shot, when your legacy is written, will
that be the most iconic shot in your history and also in Utah State 's
history?  
SAM MERRILL: Well, I hope there's a few more. I hope there's a few more games
to be played and a few more big shots to be hit. But you know, the shot went
in, but basketball is absolutely a team game, and like Coach said, he talked
about everyone that played well and everyone that stepped up, and we wouldn't
have been in that position without those guys and without doing it together as
a team.  
  
I know I made the shot and whatever, but we could not have won three games in
three days without doing it together.  
  
Q. Neemy, last year when you were up on the stage, you couldn 't believe
the path Utah State had taken you to winning a title. What do you think of
back to back years of doing so?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: This one is even sweeter than last year's. We had a lot more
ups and downs -- a lot more downs than last year, and we just stuck together
and just found a way to overcome everything that came at us. Coach Smith just
always told us to like stay together and just always try to think of the next
play and keep staying together.  
  
It was just great. I don't have words to explain it.  
  
Q. It 's been a while since a team in the Mountain West Conference has
been able to make a really deep run in the NCAA Tournament. My question to you
guys is talk about your chances; what do you think you need to do to make a
deep run, and then your thoughts on San Diego State, do you think they're
capable of making a deep run?  
SAM MERRILL: San Diego State is definitely going to win a couple games. They
have everything. Malachi is obviously a phenomenal player but they have so
many other options, as well, and that opens things up for him and the rest of
the team.  
  
So they'll win a couple games for sure, but for us, that last year was really
tough to go out that way, losing in the first round. We are going to have --
luckily we can just not worry about everything that was new last year with all
the media and all that stuff that goes on, and we can just focus on just
trying to win our first one and then hopefully go from there.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: And I know they're fired up for practice tomorrow.  
  
Q. Neemy, obviously this game -- you 'll remember Sam's shot at the end
but you had a huge play there in the second half, and this is a game of ebbs
and flows as far as emotion. How big was that highlight-reel dunk that you had
in the second half, and what do you think that meant for you guys going
forward?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I think it just helped me feel more comfortable during the
game. Stuff wasn't going my way during the game, but after that I think that
we just started playing with a lot more confidence. I think it just helped to
settle in in the game, and just keep playing hard and knowing that I was going
to still be a threat down there.  
  
Q. If you guys could put into words what this tournament has actually
meant for you, what would you say?  
SAM MERRILL: What this tournament or --  
  
Q. This tournament.  
SAM MERRILL: Like I said, we weren't sure -- we felt like every game was a
must-win game for us. This year feels sweeter than last year. Last year it
just feels like everything went perfect. We had no injuries. We obviously lost
a couple games, but this year we had to go through some stuff, Neemy missing a
ton of games, some other undisclosed injuries that slowed us down a little
bit, and lost a couple games that we really had no business losing.  
  
To be able to just find a way to win three tough, tough games against New
Mexico, who was probably playing their best basketball, Wyoming, who was
absolutely playing their best basketball of the season, and then San Diego
State, who's as good as advertised, it's super sweet.  
  
Q. Sam, I 'm not going to ask you to disclose your undisclosed injuries,
but I did want to ask you about that quick turnaround. Players never get a say
in this type of thing, but they moved up the start of the final a half hour
this year, so it's even quicker. If you could say something to a TV executive
about how hard that is and how unfair it is to make players doing that after
playing two straight games, what would you tell them?  
SAM MERRILL: I wouldn't necessarily say it's unfair, but that 2 seed game is
definitely tough because our game ended at like 10:45, we didn't leave the gym
until probably 11:45, midnight, so we get back to our hotel at 12:15, and then
we went straight into our meeting room, walked through San Diego State stuff,
so that took about a half hour. So we weren't even done until about 1:00, and
then we had to do ice bath and some recovery stuff, and I didn't get to bed
until like 2:15. Then we had to wake up at about 9:00 --  
  
CRAIG SMITH: But that's 10:00 our time.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Had to wake up at 9:00, go straight to another film session and
walk-through. So it almost felt like we had no time at all. I mean, it worked
out for us and it worked out for us last year, as well --  
  
CRAIG SMITH: I kind of like the 2 seed.  
  
SAM MERRILL: It's definitely difficult for sure, and I'm a big-time sleeper. I
need like 10 hours of sleep a night.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: He goes to bed at 7:30. This year he's got online classes, so
it's 9:30.  
  
Q. I 'm sure that you've been -- well, I'm not sure since you've had
such a busy schedule, but with the NBA talking to its teams about possibly
having to play in front of no crowds due to the coronavirus, I wanted to know,
it could happen with the NCAA championship, although that's obviously coming
up pretty quick. What would your thoughts be about having to play in that kind
of situation and how would it affect your games?  
SAM MERRILL: That would be really odd. I don't know, that's all I can say.
Will there be TV?  
  
CRAIG SMITH: We're going to triple our cheerleaders.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I never even thought of that.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: We're going to need a lot of media and a lot of cheerleaders.
Double our managers.  
  
Q. For the players, I want to get your thoughts, Coach touched on a
couple players, but I wanted your thoughts. First, Abel Porter, you could see
he was kind of obviously hurt from the past couple of games. Zero points but
he was the team high plus-10. Can you talk about his effort and his ability to
play through whatever was ailing him?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Abel yesterday only played I think two minutes, two or three
minutes, something like that. Today he played 25, so you see how resilient he
is. Especially after the injuries that he's had lately. I just think that he's
one of our glue guys, too. He knows how to run our team, and as you see on the
plus-minus, he had plus-10, and I think that he knows how to guard, too. He
just knows how to share the ball, too. He only had two assists, but he pretty
much just set up everyone to have good shots, and I think that's what we need
from a point guard.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, that might have been the most impactful zero points, two
assists in three rounds ever. People don't realize that Abel just settles us
down offensively. It helps us -- if he's not in, I usually run the point. But
there's a lot of plays that we run where I'm not the point guard, so we have
to like -- I have to bring it up and then give it to Diogo and then move
around, and it takes some time to get into sets, but with Abel he can just get
us into our sets, the ones that we want to run.  
  
Like Neemy said, he's great defensively, and he's been in a lot of pain, but
for him to be able to battle and play 25 minutes and be as impactful as he was
just speaks volumes to who he is as a person.  
  
Q. So you guys have talked about the constant wheel of injuries. You got
another one tonight - Sean goes down. Only played about a minute. How does
that affect you guys going forward?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, that's really tough for him. He's come along so much as a
freshman. I don't know exactly what the extent of the injury is, but he was
super distraught at halftime when we came in. You feel for a guy like that
that was so helpful for us last night and the night before. I know he wanted
to come in and make an impact, and that was unfortunate, but like we've done
all year, we're just going to have to find a way to regroup and make things
happen.  
  
Q. Sam, you talk about your lack of rest; how do you then find the
energy to go out and play the entire 40 minutes?  
SAM MERRILL: Coach Smith tried to take me out, but I said, "No way."  
  
CRAIG SMITH: That was right about when Sean got hurt actually. It was on that
play where he took the charge, and I think it was 8:02 on the clock, so we
were just trying to manage it, obviously, and he kind of had that look, but we
had back-to-back time-outs right before that, long ones, and Sam just kind of
gave me that look like, he was staring right through you, kind of one of those
-- oh, you're good, we'll get Sean out.  
  
SAM MERRILL: But if you can't get -- you might have seen a little bit of
fatigue. I missed probably four or five shots short, so maybe that was part of
it --  
  
CRAIG SMITH: Free throw missed.  
  
SAM MERRILL: First ever in the last minute of a game in my career, so that's
sad.  
  
But if you can't get motivated and physically ready and emotionally ready for
a game like this, then you have no business being here. Coach does a good job
of letting me rest every once in a while on the court. And it helps when you
have Neemy because you can go two, three possessions where I hardly have to
move, because we just give the ball to Neemy and let him do his thing. When
you play for four years, you find ways to rest up during the game.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: That's why Sam likes when we play 1-3-1, he just stands on the
side, okay, drive it in there to Neemy. Neemy will get it to the rim.  
  
Q. Sam, do the back-to-back titles and MVPs rival your ultimate goal to
win an NCAA Tournament game?  
SAM MERRILL: I mean, I'll look back when this is all said and done and be
grateful and obviously have fond memories of Utah State. But it's been the
goal from day one. We had a chance last year, didn't come through, and
fortunately found a way to get another opportunity. You can bet that we'll
bring our best to wherever and whoever we play.  
  
Q. I want to look forward a little bit instead of back. You 're going to
have maybe 13 days off, and college basketball teams almost never have that,
particularly this part of the season. Have you started thinking how you're
going to possibly occupy those 13 days? Will you scrimmage somebody, take days
off? What will you do?  
CRAIG SMITH: We're definitely going to take a couple days off. I've thought
about it a little bit because I knew -- obviously we knew for a long time, and
we knew we'd be playing some sort of postseason. Obviously we always held out
hope, and hope is a dangerous thing, but I've thought about it a little bit
but not too seriously.  
  
Now, the one thing we can draw back on is last year we had the bye going into
the conference tournament, so we clinched the regular season title at Colorado
State on a Tuesday night, and then we didn't play for -- until the following
Thursday. So that's about nine days. And that was a grind early in that game,
if you remember. I think we had 18, 17 turnovers in the first half, and we
were like Edward Scissorhands out there dribbling and dribbling off our knees
and catching with our nose.  
  
And then we settled in, and I thought it helped us in the back half of the
tournament. I thought we were the fresher team in the title game, especially
the second half.  
  
But that's less time than 13 days. That's a long time. Basketball is such a
rhythm game.  
  
That being said, I think it can benefit us, too, and we've just had such an
uneven year with, okay, who's playing in this practice, and like who do we
have today. Our athletic trainer and our strength coach, I can't tell you how
many conversations we had. Who's clear today, who's got this today, who's got
-- so we've always just been kind of having to redefine ourselves, and then we
finally the last four or five weeks had pretty much a good rhythm. Neemy was
healthy and in good condition, know what I mean? His conditioning took a while
to kind of go.  
  
And so we finally kind of got into a rhythm I would say. But one thing we've
emphasized with our team all year is listen, we're just scratching the surface
of how good we can still become, and that's what I think is really exciting is
if you look back to where we were five or six weeks ago, I feel like we've
just gradually gotten better week to week. And obviously we had a minor -- now
it ends up being a minor setback at New Mexico.  
  
But I feel like we got better since that game, certainly this week. And so
that's what's exciting. I think with good quality practice, we have great
character in our locker room, we have a bunch of guys that love to compete. We
have a bunch of guys that love to play, and we have phenomenal chemistry. And
we're a driven team.  
  
Sam touched on it; when we got there last year, it was a typical, oh, we're
going there to win it, but you kind of -- it's a little bit of a -- not
daunting, but you have this media obligation, you have this going on and this
going on, and I remember riding in the bus when we landed in Columbus, and you
know, the police escorts -- the guys are like, oh, the police escorts. So
everything was a big deal. Now we've been there. We know what to expect. And
we had a phenomenal summer this summer with our guys.  
  
Sometimes when you do something that -- the highest seed in the history of
Utah State and there's a great tradition at Utah State basketball, 28 wins
last year, first time ever winning in the Mountain West Tournament, go on and
on with all the accolades last year, and then we have that disappointing loss
to Washington, and they played great. I'm not sure we were our best, but a lot
of that was them. It looked like Thybulle had like four arms out there, he was
so athletic and everywhere.  
  
But our guys over the summer weren't beating their chest about how well we
just did, right, and we always say if what you did yesterday is a big deal,
you haven't done anything today. And we just have a driven, driven group of
individuals.  
  
I would fully expect us to have a very good 10 days of practice or so, and
whoever we play and wherever we go, we're going to put our best foot forward.  
  
As we know, this year has just been a topsy-turvy year in Division I men's
basketball, and I think it's just really, quite frankly, a wide open
tournament.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had a really good shot at earning an at-large bid
regardless of today, but how relieving is it to not have to worry about that
at all?  
CRAIG SMITH: It's been like this all year, and it's definitely relieving,
there's no doubt. Coach Lappas who did the television today, he goes -- and
I'm not sure what he was trying to say, but he goes, "Best of luck these next
eight days," and I'm like, well, let's just win the game and we don't have to
worry about the next eight days, and that was our mindset the whole time.  
  
I know in today's day and age, everybody has got the world at their
fingertips. People kept asking me, what do you think about your chances? I
literally didn't look at any prognostications, which I know sounds crazy to
you guys. I understand that. I was kind of living in a bubble. My oldest son
pays attention to all of that stuff. My wife does, my kids -- I don't want to
know. "Dad, it was a good day for us." I don't care. I don't want to know. So
I never got caught up into all that stuff.  
  
As a coach, all I can do is be the best I can be for our guys every day,
motivated, not worried about did Stanford win or whoever. Like I don't care. I
have no control over it. And I think part of that, not to get too deep, part
of the problem -- in life, I think so many times people, it's easy to worry
about so many things that don't matter or that you can't control, so let's
just lock into the controllables. And when we lost -- we've only -- we lost
those three games in a row in early January, and I think that's what Sam was
alluding to was, some of the stuff that maybe wasn't out there with our guys
being hurt. I just was like, you know what, quit worrying about all that
stuff. We're going to beat Florida and beat LSU, and when you beat Florida on
a neutral floor -- neutral in the Orange Bowl, right? That was far from
neutral, but that was huge for us.  
  
If we wouldn't have won tonight, I guess my hope was our intent of schedule
was very, very good. We played any high major that was willing to play us, and
you saw the two that we played, and then we agreed to a home and home with St.
Mary's, and of course they wanted to play at home first and we did it, and --
screw it, if we play at their place we know that'll be a quad 1 game. If we
play at our place, it's not guaranteed to be a quad 1 game. So we scheduled
aggressive. We have a six-year deal with BYU. We scheduled as hard as we
possibly could, but scheduling isn't just a thing where you get to go out and
say, hey, we want to play you. Oh, sure. It just doesn't work like that.  
  
So our intent was very, very well. We had to do some -- we bought ourselves
out of a tournament, and I give our credit to our administration, to pay a
decent amount of money to get out of that at the recommendation of the
Mountain West Conference because that would have really hurt our schedule, so
to speak. That was the first thing we scheduled when I first got hired. I
don't think anyone could have totally predicted that when we got hired less
than two years ago we'd be back to back Mountain West champs. So I give our
credit to our administration for doing that and making our schedule right. But
it sure is nice to do this.  
  
Wow. Wow.  
  
Q. You had only 11 points about four or five minutes to go in the first
half but you were only down 13. Did you feel like at that point that you were
actually in a really good position and did you communicate that with your
players?  
CRAIG SMITH: Yeah, every huddle. Our guys have pretty good stick-to-itiveness
but it was all about effort, effort, effort tonight, execute, execute,
execute. But more so than anything, in a basketball game like this where it's
two heavyweights, and especially the -- I mean, to have two -- what is the
record, 30-1 going into the game, I think? That's incredible. That's
incredible. And so to be able to go toe to toe for a long time, we just have
to stay the course. There's going to be up and downs, but you just can't get
distracted, and effort, effort, effort, and we did say that every time-out. So
how many clean -- like Merrill missed a lot of clean looks early. I told one
of the officials during the game, I'm like, Merrill in the first half missed
more shots than he missed the first two games. Maybe not quite, but it felt
like that. Then Neemy missed a couple and then he steps out of bounds on a
dunk. I think you asked the question to Neemy -- yeah, well.  
  
So that dunk, I thought kind of certainly changed -- not changed his mindset,
but it just gave him a little juice. It's like you see the ball go through the
hole -- Diogo only made one shot tonight, but it was a big one, and that gave
him some -- that dude, Diogo Brito is a winner in every way, shape and form
and he doesn't get enough credit. We put him in the starting lineup and you've
got to give this guy humility. He started almost every game as a sophomore.
Didn't start one game last year. Didn't start until Senior Night this year.
His mom and dad came over from Portugal to see him play the first time in his
college career. Saw him against Wyoming. He didn't play great. I think he was
nervous. I put him the lineup for Senior Night. We played really well. 19-0
start.  
  
First game here I think he played 36 minutes, last night 37 or maybe it's
flipped, and tonight I think he came out one time. He's never played those
kind of minutes, and he's guarding, by the way, a really good player on the
other side, right.  
  
You go right down the line. We talked about Bean. Somebody brought up Abel
Porter being plus-10 and just a sounding board for our team, was just
humongous for us tonight, and that's what we had.  
  
I felt like last year our role guys were just such studs in their role. They
were just stars in their role, and we had some serious shooting woes for a
while this year where we couldn't make -- I don't know how many point-blank
wide-open shots that we had and we just couldn't make a shot. It's kind of
ironic you look at the numbers tonight, these guys made 15 or 16 threes last
night, 15 or 16. And tonight we were able to hold them to 5-for-9 from the
three and we flipped the script and go 9-for-24 from the three.  
  
So we felt like if we could stay the course we're getting good looks, and
certainly just that three-minute stretch or whatever it was, and certainly
Diogo drilling that three was huge, and that 7-0 start, I mean, we made up
some monster ground in that about six-minute stretch, and then we knew it was
just going to come down to the wire, and fortunately for us we were able to
make one more shot.  
  
Q. Just going back to that second-half offensive stretch, you guys hit
five of your first six threes. Did you make any offensive adjustments or was
it more of a confidence seeing your guys see shots going into the net?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, going into -- in the last media time-out of the first half,
they were playing Bean really soft, which is what we expected. That's what
they had showed the first two games. And Justin, we kind of got on Justin
about being more of a player without the ball and being more of a screener and
being more active to help other guys get open. You know, and that's kind of --
Justin has got such a unique game, and it's hard to describe, but you don't
want Justin overthinking. He's a smart kid. He's compliant. He wants to be
coached. And I thought he did a much better job doing that.  
  
And then of course he's all over the place with rebounding.  
  
The other thing we said, I thought we were very physical on the defensive end,
but I felt like we had to be more physical on the offensive end, do a better
job setting screens. I thought Neemy had to post-up harder, not just kind of
accept posting up at 15 feet. No, you've got to get deeper catches and post-up
harder. When we are turning the corner on a ball screen, you have to be
tougher with the ball. So just kind of challenging them.  
  
And the other thing we did, honestly we didn't call as many plays, because not
only are they a very talented team, they're a very well-coached team, and I've
known Coach Dutcher for a long time, and I was an assistant at Colorado State
for five years when he was an assistant, and all their other staff members,
they've kept the family together. Coach Fisher's son Mark is a very good
friend, and they do it right, man, and they're very, very well-coached. You
call a play, they know it's coming. They call a play, we know what's coming.
They call a play, our guys know what's coming. They call a play, our guys know
what's coming.  
  
A big strength of ours last year was our motion. We struggled earlier this
year with our motion. A big part of that Queta not playing. He's got such
great feel for what's going on out there, and our motion offense has gotten
much better here the last three weeks.  
  
So we just said, you know what, we need more randoms. We've got to let our
players play, but we've got to do a better job screening, attacking and
sharing for one another.  
  
Q. Last year one of the main qualms with the title was that you never
played Nevada, who was the top seed and a lot of people wanted that match-up.
How good does it feel to have the match-up with one of the best teams the
Mountain West has seen for a couple years and to come out with a title?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, to be quite frank, and I don't know this for a fact, I
think our guys really wanted to play San Diego State. I wanted to play San
Diego State. And not because -- I made very clear, we respect them like beyond
belief, but we lost to them both times in the regular season, and last year we
beat everybody on our schedule that we played, that we played twice, we at
least beat them once.  
  
So we were 0-2, and it gave me a lot -- at our place, we had just lost to
UNLV, Queta didn't play, that was his first game back. They made some big-time
plays. They scored 15 points with five seconds or less on the shot clock, and
that kind of reared its ugly head a little bit in the first half. I think they
scored six points on us right at the shot clock buzzer going off, right at the
rim. So we talked about that at halftime, and I'm not sure they did that in
the second half.  
  
And then at their place, just by coincidence, they're retiring Kawhi Leonard's
uniform. And so my mom, just like moms do, she saves the newspaper, like I
don't even know anyone that reads newspapers -- no, I'm just kidding, guys.
I'm kidding. (Laughter). I actually do read the newspaper religiously.  
  
But she saves the newspaper, they were at her house for a week, and usually
they're good luck charms, and then they flew to San Diego, we have family out
there, not to bore you, they came to the game, and of course they stayed and
then flew back because we had two more home games. She gives the me the
newspaper like a week later, like "thanks for reminding me, mom." A big
picture of Kawhi, who was my favorite player in the NBA, by the way.  
  
But in that article -- and we all know playing at Viejas is ridiculously tough
to do. Very rarely do they lose there. When it said in that article, This is
the most rowdy and electric that building had been since Kawhi Leonard and
their teams, I'm guessing Billy white, Malcolm Thomas and that whole crew was
playing, BYU and Jimmer Fredette and they had it rolling, that was incredible.
So for us to go toe to toe with them in that environment at their place, we
were up eight at half, up 12 in the second half and then the wave kind of got
the best -- I should have done a couple things differently. When we can go toe
to toe at their place knowing we didn't play our best yet, we had so much
confidence that we can come in here and take care of business. We have ultra
competitors on our team, and obviously we were fortunate to find a way to win
that game. But I think that gave us a lot of confidence that we can do that.  
  
Q. You 've coached Sam Merrill for two years now. First player ever to
win tournament back-to-back MVPs. How often do you have times on the court
where you see something he does and it leaves you speechless?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, nothing surprises me with him anymore. I remember last year
for quite a while I would have to tell him, Sam, a bad shot for you is better
than a good shot for someone else. He's just so programmed to make the right
play all the time. Now the dude is -- I said it after New Mexico, now he's the
second all-time leading scorer at Utah State, No. 2 in assists. That is
unheard of, and he never plays point guard. He's played more point guard this
year than any other year.  
  
Nothing surprises me, and everyone is going to talk about that shot, and that
was a shot of the ages certainly, without a question. The dude guarded Malachi
Flynn all night. He guarded Malachi Flynn all night. That guy, every single
night that we go out -- and Neemy is obviously just an incredible defensive
player. But Sam is guarding the other team's best guard every night. Every
night.  
  
Now, he might have to take a break off and Diogo is a great defensive player,
as well. But Sam gets nowhere near the credit for how elite of a defender he
is. He understands angles. He understands scouting reports. He's a legit 6'5"
and long, and he's way more athletic than people give him credit for.  
  
To do that -- and we have to depend on that dude every night on the offensive
end certainly, but he's a two-way guy. He wants the challenge of guarding that
other team's best players, and that's a rare -- that is getting rarer and
rarer to find.  
  
And then at the end of the day, I could talk -- we could do a half-hour
dissertation on this, but he's just the ultimate winner and competitor, and he
grew up an Aggie, and it means so much to him. He has so much pride. Dude
shows up every -- this is not a -- I know how coaches can get, "guy shows up
every day to play." That dude, every day. Every day. Doesn't matter, 45-minute
workout, hour and a half practice, three-hour practice. His team loses, he's
so PO'd without taking it out on anyone. When we lose we run sprints and he
wins that sprint every time. Wins it every time.  
  
And that exudes to everybody else on the team when you can do that. I get a
little animated because I love that guy. He's just everything that a college
athlete is all about.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the impact he has in those late-game situations and
the leadership he brings to the rest of the team?  
CRAIG SMITH: He makes everybody better, and he has a unique -- is it Tom
Rinaldi that asks those questions that gets everyone to cry? I've said this
multiple times, but he gives everybody confidence. He just -- when he's on the
floor, there's just so much confidence that he provides everyone else. He's
out there and guys just play better. And I think a big reason why is he's a
star. He's the most unselfish star I've ever been around. I think he brings so
much confidence because he's so humble, and he makes that shot, he didn't do
-- none of that. And the guys are so fired up for him. What he did at the end
of that New Mexico game, are you kidding me? He gets four fouls in the first
five minutes of the second half, doesn't play forever, they go up, we're down
eight, and it's like, guys, we've got to do it without Sam for a while, just
got to figure it out.  
  
But he brings this level of comfort where guys are so confident. But he
doesn't, like, "Give me the ball!" You'll never hear that out of the that kid.
He's a shot-maker. He's a great decision-maker, without a question. And he's
an elite defender. And so that's a great combination to have.  
  
This is the ultimate player's game. Queta is a phenomenal player. Certainly
Sam does. Our role guys are stars. The evolution of Bean has been huge, and
players win games, man. As a coach you do everything you can to put the guys
in the right position, but those dudes are out there in front of 15,000 people
or whatever it is, where you see every facial expression, you see every -- and
they get -- you lose a tough game and everyone is coming at you, oh, why are
the Aggies falling apart and this guy doesn't do this. You've got to eliminate
the noise and trust who you are. You cannot flinch and just keep going
straight ahead.  
  
Obviously it was exciting.  
  
I do want to real quick thank our coaching staff. We have a great coaching
staff. The preparation those guys do, all the extra hours that they do and
their families, we all know this is a lifestyle, just like you guys traveling,
it's a lifestyle thing, and you've got to have everybody on board. I have an
amazing wife and family, as do our staff guys, and there's such support there,
and it's always fun when we can get together and do it. John Hartwell, our AD
is incredible, and the strides we've made as a program in support have just
been incredible.  
  
And I want to thank all you guys for everything that you guys do reporting it,
and you guys have a thankless job, and I really appreciate everything that you
guys have done for Aggie basketball and for our players with the exposure and
just being fair and real people.  
  
And I want to thank the Mountain West Conference. This is -- I've been in the
Big Ten, I've been a coach at every level, NAIA, D-II, D-I, and this as good
as it gets with the pomp and circumstance, the support, everybody coming to
this incredible venue, and I know I might regret saying this, but I think it's
so great that it is in this venue where everybody can get to and support it
and back it and get here, and to have the spirited atmosphere that the
Mountain West conference provides, it's absolutely incredible. It's first
class in every way, shape and form.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 59, San Diego State - 56  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, congratulations to Craig Smith and Utah State.
They've got a very good team. We've known that all along. It was a battle
between two very good teams, and Sam Merrill made a really hard shot over a
great defense played by KJ, and that was the difference in the game. Malachi
had a look at the buzzer, and it kind of hit the rim a couple of times and
didn't go in.  
  
That's March Madness basketball. It just started in the conference tournament,
and we will learn from it and we will be ready when we see who we play in 10
days.  
  
Q. KJ, on that last possession, obviously you 're guarding Merrill, he's
got the ball. What's going through your head?  
KJ FEAGIN: Just lock up. That's what's going through my head. Do whatever you
do to stop him from making a shot. I felt like up until the release of the
shot I was right there on every move, but props on him for making a good shot.  
  
Q. Yanni, in the first half you had almost a double-double, but in the
second half you only had three points and three rebounds. What sort of
adjustments did Utah State make in the post?  
YANNI WETZELL: I don't know if they made a whole lot of adjustments. It was
just a matter of me putting two halves together. I think I performed better in
the first half, and that's something I'm going to take and try and improve on,
and promise you I'm going to put two halves together once that Tournament
comes.  
  
Q. There 's going to be a lot of fans who say this wasn't the worst
thing in the world because you drop to a 2 seed, maybe stay in the west, who
knows, but it could have been beneficial in that respect, but looking at your
faces, it doesn't seem like you feel that way.  
KJ FEAGIN: I think I speak for everybody when I feel like that shot and us
taking this loss just took all the life out of us today. I wanted to cut down
nets. We all wanted to cut down nets, and it was an accomplishment of ours. We
weren't looking forward to the NCAA Tournament, we were looking at the task at
hand, and we didn't get the job done.  
  
Q. You had a 16-point lead on them in the first quarter and they were
totally cold, they went totally cold for about 12 minutes there. What do you
feel like was behind that? Was that defense that you were playing, and what
adjustments did they make or did you make that changed in the second half?  
KJ FEAGIN: I think we guarded hard all game. They just made shots. I think
right now I can't really think of anything else to say. They just made shots
when it mattered.  
  
Q. Malachi, what did you see on that final shot there?  
MALACHI FLYNN: I mean, I saw a look, and it missed. That's all that really
matters.  
  
Q. Malachi, on that last play, it looked like you guys had something
else diagrammed and when they called a time-out you switched to a different
play; is that true?  
MALACHI FLYNN: Yeah, we switched it up at the end, and you all saw the result.
Not because of the play, though.  
  
Q. As Coach Dutcher said, heading into the Tournament, there 's going to
be a lot of games like this that go up to the very last second. What do you
think there is to learn from that game moving forward as you head into the
Tournament?  
KJ FEAGIN: It's just a thin line between winning and losing, and as we look
back on film, we'll see that we got a lot of opportunities to win, and we just
didn't capitalize. Going into March, we just have to take away the mistakes
and the small things and just the loose balls, the rebounds, the extra shots.
We can't give that to other teams. It's just the little things. It's a thin
line, and you saw it happen today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first half? It was the first time you guys
didn 't trail and you guys didn't allow 50 percent shooting. What kind of
changed defensively in the entire first half?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Sam Merrill decided to take over the game. That's it. And they
Queta had a good low-post game in the second half. There were some shots that
rang around and fell in. So Sam Merrill is -- I mean, he averaged 20 a game in
the conference. But then he comes here, it's 27, 29, 27, so you know what it
is. March is for players, and he played great today. He made the timely shots.
He made timely plays, and he had a great game.  
  
Q. Dutch, you were up 24-11, they went 13 minutes without scoring. Did
you feel that was kind of a missed opportunity at the time not to extend the
lead at that point?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: No, I mean, both teams are playing three games in three days.
There's tired legs. It's a game of runs, so they made a run. The three at the
end of the half was kind of big for them. They cut it from 11 to 8, I think.
So it gave them a little momentum and then they got off to a good start in the
second half. Then it was pretty much back and forth at that point.  
  
But Sam Merrill stepped up and made great plays. Basically the game ended like
this: Our best player had a step-back three, he missed it; their best player
had a step-back three and he made it. The current MVP, Malachi Flynn, had a
shot, it didn't go in; Sam Merrill had a shot, it went in. So both coaches put
it their best players' hands. Malachi even had a half-court shot that looked
like it was going in. So that's March basketball.  
  
And I thought KJ did a great job. Sam is a hard guy to guard. Even that one,
the foul where they called a foul on KJ, there is a lot of contact there, and
I thought KJ did a great job on that play, but he got called for a foul and
Sam made a big free throw. He missed one, so it gave us an opportunity, but I
thought KJ played great defense on that play, too.  
  
Q. Matt and Jordan only combined for four points today. Why do you think
they weren 't able to get anything going?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: You know, Jordan, they stayed out on Jordan. He couldn't find
any opportunities. He was off the bounce, and they didn't want to give him any
threes. Everyone knows that's what he does. So he spaced the floor, we tried
to go to him at times, but he couldn't find any open looks on the lifts and
that. They were out there quick on the catch, and he tried to go to the basket
a few times off the bounce, but didn't go in.  
  
Matt didn't have a great game today. Obviously I think he'd be the first to
say that. I don't know what he was from the field, 1-for-7 from the field,
0-for-2 from three. Not one of his better efforts, but like I said, it's three
games in three days, and it's hard to play out there.  
  
Matt will bounce back. Matt is a first-team all-conference player, so he had
an off game today, but I don't doubt when we play our first-round opponent in
the NCAA Tournament, he will be ready to go.  
  
Q. What does Malachi bring to the team when he 's having a cold shooting
night and not scoring as much as he usually does?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, he was not making shots tonight, and so I don't know if
they didn't help a whole lot. They made him try to take some shots, and that's
why the three-point shooters weren't open. They were crowded in on him. So
they didn't help a lot. And he had opportunities to make baskets, and he
didn't have enough go in for us to win tonight.  
  
Q. KJ mentioned that the team feels deflated from this loss. What do you
say to them to reenergize them going forward into the tournament?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I tried to lift them up after the game as best I could, but
they're competitors, they want to win every game. So I don't mind them being
down right now. They'll get over it and we'll give them a couple days off to
rest their legs up and we'll start getting ready for Selection Sunday and get
the energy back.  
  
But right now I don't mind that they're disappointed. They're used to winning.
They've only lost one game to this point. They're not used to losing, and
they're disappointed when they lose. I think that's a good thing. It shows
their competitive spirit and how bad they want to win and how much energy they
put into winning.  
  
Q. You could have 13 days before you play again, which is sort of an
unprecedented stretch for San Diego State. How do you plan to use those days,
and how much harder does it become having to sit on a loss?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I don't think it's that hard to sit on a loss. It's hard losing
the conference championship in the last two seconds of the game. But we'll
bounce back. These kids are -- they love basketball, so they'll be back in the
gym, then we'll get them in the gym for practice and we'll find a way to get
better.  
  
You're not going to stay down that long. I mean, you look at all these
conference tournaments, there's games like this all the time. You'll see it
next week. Teams will lose in the championships but they'll be ready to go for
the NCAA Tournament, and that's what we will do.  
  
Last year at this time it was way harder. We lost and our season was over.
Right now we lost, and they're debating on TV right now whether we're a 1 or 2
seed, so there's not a whole lot to be upset about. We lost a really hard-
fought game, but we'll be excited for our next-round opponent and excited to
get into March Madness.  
  
Q. You kind of mentioned this at the end, but given the r�sum� and what
happened in this championship game, as they debate a No. 1 versus No. 2 seed,
I know you don 't get to decide that, but what do you think your r�sum� should
be in terms of that seed?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I think at the end of the year we'll have the best record in
the country. I don't think anyone can pass it. No one is going to have fewer
than two losses, and so we'll see if someone gets 36 wins and -- I don't know
what the most games they can play.  
  
Obviously we didn't play a full schedule. But we'll have the best record in
the country, and walking out of the locker room, they had a TV on and I know
they're already debating, should we be a 1 or should be a 2. Some of them are
saying we should be a 1. That's going to be the debate. That's going to be the
fun. That's fun for you guys over the next week to speculate that.  
  
We can't control it. The conference tournaments will determine a lot who gets
seeded where, but that's what makes this part of the season so exciting. And
when our name comes up on the board, whether you're 16 or 1, you're excited to
see your name come up. The kids are excited to see their name come up on the
board, and the same thing for Utah State. Whatever seed they are, they're
going to be excited when their name comes up, and that's everybody in the
country that's fortunate enough to make this tournament.  
  
Q. Obviously when you talk about Utah State, everybody wants to talk
about the likes of Sam Merrill and Queta, but in the second half there, it was
Anderson and Bean 's contributions that were big, particularly Bean on the
boards and of course Anderson with some big shots. Your overall thoughts on
those two guys in that second half?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, Anderson hit two big threes in the second half. Those
were tremendous. Big, uplifting shots for their team. And then Bean is what he
is; he's a warrior, plays hard all the time, gets in there, he rebounds, he
makes plays, and he's an unsung hero.  
  
We all look at the numbers, everyone looks at numbers, and they say Queta and
Merrill, but Bean is a glue guy. Everyone knows that. We have great respect
for Bean as a player and tried to do our best to keep him off the glass.  
  
Q. You 're talking about the NCAA Tournament and I feel like this has to
be asked: The NBA just told their teams to start preparing to possibly hold
games where there are no fans. Can you imagine an NCAA Tournament or what it
would be like to play in an NCAA Tournament where there are no fans?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Well, if they send us out east, I hope that rule goes through,
and if we stay west, I hope they let the fans come. So it all depends on where
we get sent. So if we get sent east, no fans. If we get sent west, everyone
can come. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You get a very unique turnaround in this tournament. You play two
games in two days and then you come back in like 16 hours and play again. They
moved it up even a half hour earlier this year. How unfair is that for
players? In a lot of these games shooting percentages are really low, you see
a lot of tired legs. I know in a perfect world you 'd like to have more rest,
but is it borderline unfair to make teams play this quickly?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, it's super hard. Play three straight games and not have a
full day's recovery time, that's super hard on players, so there's no question
about that. It's hard on both teams. But it's what we deal with for conference
tournaments. It's what it is, and so we make the best of it.  
  
But then NCAA Tournament is nothing like that. You get a day in between, you
get a prep day, and you save up legs. You know, the NCAA Tournament is a lot
more fair to a small team with not great depth because they get a recovery
day. These tournaments are really hard, and we've got great depth. I thought
our bench played well. They came in and gave us quality minutes, and obviously
Utah State used a lot of their bench, they gave them quality minutes.  
  
But is it fair? No, it's not fair for the kids to have to play a turnaround
game in less than 24 hours.  
  
Q. You 've gone on record saying that you would prefer to stay out west.
Do you prefer having a 2 seed in the west than a 1 seed in the east?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I want to be a 1 seed, so I want to be a 1 seed. I want to be a
1 seed in the west. So we'll see what happens. I mean, I think we're good
enough.

### [Neemias Queta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36863)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 89, Wyoming - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: I know it's a late night so I'll be quick. But congrats to
Wyoming. I thought they have had an amazing tournament. I know certainly
anytime you lose it's always very, very difficult, the finality of it. But
they are, they have always had our ultimate respect. They always show up. They
play super, super hard every night out and they play together and they play
connected. And they have been playing very good basketball now for the last
three to four weeks. And maybe it hasn't always shown in the win/loss column
until this tournament, but it was easy to see. You can just go back and look
at their scores over the last three to four weeks. And they played
unbelievable tonight. I mean, literally they played fantastic. You go 15-33.
It felt like every time we made a mistake they made us pay. They played very
connected, they played with great pace, and they made it very, very difficult
for us. But at the end of the day our guys finished very, very strong,
finished on a 13-0 run, we had seven straight stops down the stretch, and we
found a way to win. And at this time of year, March Madness, it's the old what
do they say? Survive and advance. And that's what we did. So these two young
men played fantastic. I thought we played very connected on the offensive end.
I wish we could have had a few more stops but that's a great credit to
Wyoming. So we'll take it and move on to play a heck of a team tomorrow night
or tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes or coach.  
  
Q. Sam, we 'll start with you again. Once again, right down the stretch
you had hit a couple of big shots. That three almost the same spot as last
night. Was it just time for you to go one-on-one? Did coach give you the okay
to go one-on-one again?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, he just let me go. Just echoing everything that coach said.
Every time it felt like we were going to make a run they responded and hit a
three or got to the basket. They just made a ton of plays and they tied it up
with, what, four or five minutes to go. And I don't know, I just felt
confident and coach let me go one-on-one. And it was fun going against Jake,
because I know Jake pretty well and we played pickup all the time in the
summer. And on two or three of those he played really good defense. I just hit
some pretty tough shots. But, yeah, it was just like you said, time to work.  
  
Q. Sam, you took a couple big spills out there. Looks like it took you a
second to come back to it. How are you feeling and are you going to rest and
be ready for tomorrow?  
SAM MERRILL: I'm feeling great, Bill. I'm just happy that you're here. Yeah,
I'll be good to go. We'll all be good to go tomorrow for sure. If you can't
get yourself physically or emotionally motivated for a championship game
against a top-10 team, then you probably don't deserve to be here, yeah.  
  
Q. This is for both of the players. What was going through your minds
when the score was tied 66 against a scrappy upset-minded team? And also, my
second question is for the coach, how do you think you guys match up against
San Diego State tomorrow.  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, you just got to keep playing. Like we said, they hit a ton
of really tough shots. Guys that haven't hit a ton of threes all year
continued to make shots. And I think you feel a little pressure, but we do a
good job normally of just moving on to the next play and focusing on the task
at hand. And I think once they tied it up we went on like a 13-0 run, so that
was a pretty good response by us.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: In terms of tomorrow night's game, they have had an unbelievable
year, certainly being the top 10 most of the year, top 5 most of the year, and
they have playmakers at every position, whether it's their 5 man, their 4 man,
3, 2, 1, you can go right down the line. They have a great bench, and they're
one of the best defensive teams in the country. So they took care of us both
times. I thought we played very, very well at their place and gave us every
opportunity to win that game, on their Kawhi Leonard night. So we know it's
going to be a heck of a battle and we'll see where it goes from there.  
  
Q. Seemed like the momentum kind of changed when you got a few blocks
there. How much does that help the momentum and kind of energize you guys at
the end of the game it seemed like?  
DIOGO BRITO: After they started making a lot of threes we just kept sending
them to the paint. I think that I did a really good job just staying out of
foul trouble and just either blocking or an affecting the shot. They were not,
they were not doing that the whole game, so I just, I felt that we got them
off rhythm by doing that and I think that it helped us a late, especially
late.  
  
Q. For Sam and coach. Sam, I 'll start with you. So you guys kind of had
a rocky regular season. Started the season off ranked number 15, big wins
against Florida and LSU, and then there was a loss against Boise State in
January, which is one of the worst losses I'm sure you've had in your career.
After that loss it seems like you guys kind of flipped the switch and started
playing excellent and it's showing in the tournament. What did that loss do to
you guys?  
SAM MERRILL: To be honest, I think we flipped the switch, not flipped a
switch, but started playing much better even before that. We lost those three
in a row ending at Air Force, where that was embarrassing. And then we came
back and beat Nevada soundly, had our bye week, and for 37 minutes played
probably our best basketball of the year at Boise and then everyone knows what
happened those last three minutes. But, yeah, from that point that was very
devastating for us. But like I've talked about, we have a ton of resilient
guys, a lot of guys with high character and a lot of pride, so we responded
from that and we have been playing much better lately.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: Yeah, I echo Sam's thoughts. This isn't an excuse. It's just
reality. We had to, we have had to deal with a lot of things that are a little
bit out of our control, and that's injuries. And basketball's a game of
rhythm, right, and continuity and fluidity and chemistry and all that stuff
and we have great chemistry, but you got to go do it on the floor. And so
getting Neemy back, and his injury that he had this summer, we've had to kind
of change our identity two to three times now this year and that takes some
time. We have kind of had to re-invent ourself. But we have tremendous
character. We have had a few ups, we have had many, many ups and a few downs.
But there was never a doubt, we weren't going to flinch, we were going to keep
responding and keep fighting and we put ourselves in a very good position and
now we get to play for the title tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sam mentioned a lot of you guys are going to be ready to go after the
question about the injury. What about Abel?  
CRAIG SMITH: Just don't know yet. I would anticipate that he'll give it a
whirl again. It's just, you know, a day-to-day deal and obviously, he was out
there and kind of tentative and kind of, so we'll just see what happens. But
it's nothing like, I don't think his injury is like a long-term deal, by any
stretch. It's just a day-to-day thing right now.  
  
Q. For the players, but then also coach. You faced San Diego State in
the title game again last year. There 's already been a couple of those
through the tournament so far. How much does last year's game kind of factor
into your preparation for tomorrow and how much can you rely on that
experience?  
DIOGO BRITO: I think that everything is pretty much similar. The game is
pretty, I think it's at the same time. We played, they played the first game.
We played the second game of the semi's, and I just feel that we're still
going to go through everything that we still did last year and I think that
we're going to keep the routine and I think that that's the right way to do
it.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, the teams are, obviously both teams are very different. But
we went through this exact schedule last year, so we'll finish up here, go
back to the hotel, watch some film, and walk through their stuff, and then
hopefully coach let's us sleep in a little bit and walk through their stuff
again in the morning and be ready to go by 2:30.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: Breakfast at 7 (Laughing.)  
  
Q. Sam, when Neemias is playing with the type of energy that he did
tonight and is active at both ends of the floor, how does that rub off on the
rest of you? What sort of, I guess, energy does it translate?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, he does a phenomenal job. That's, when we went on that big
run that was spurred by him and his blocked shots and his energy. And he also
helps us a ton on the offensive end. He's a good pressure reliever for us. We
know he can score on the block, but he's also a great passer when teams
double-team him. So he's one of our catalysts for sure.  
  
Q. Neemias, you 've had an injury-riddled season. And when you played
San Diego State the first time at home your knees were still hurt. How are
your knees feeling now going into the championship game?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: After two games in two days I would say pretty good. But I'm
just ready to go, whatever. Even if my knees were pretty bummed, I would just
try to play. It's the final and we're just trying to win another conference
championship. And that was the goal for the season and I think that we just
got to put aside whatever we got and just try to play through whatever
adversity we got and just try and win it again.  
  
Q. So last, I think last night 's game seemed like it probably
frustrated you a little bit. What was your mindset coming into this game and
what were your motivations, what did you want to improve tonight?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I wouldn't say it frustrated me. I would just say that it just,
I just had to deal with it and just try to overcome the foul trouble and not
being in the game for too long and just getting warmed up again. I just felt
that today I needed to give another, have another edge and just try to play
harder than yesterday, but still staying out of foul trouble. I think I did a
really good job. I think I only had two fouls. I had two fouls and they were
both late in the second half. So I think that's a big key for us for us to
keep climbing the ladder and just keep climbing and keep playing hard and just
trying to win another one.  
  
Q. The bigger the game gets the more you 've had to use your veterans on
the court and spend some minutes on them. Can you talk about how nice it's
been to be able to rely on those guys to give you those heavy minutes but yet
be extremely productive down the stretch late in the game?  
CRAIG SMITH: Yeah, we have, we got a lot of dependable guys, been down this
road before. I think they do a great, a very good job of taking care of their
bodies with rest and recovering and nutrition and hydration. And that stuff
can't be understated, how much that stuff matters. We do have an influx of
quite a few new players in our program but yet we have six guys that have
played a ton of minutes last year, obviously, a ton of minutes this year. But
we still have a relatively young roster. Obviously Sam is a senior and Diogo's
a senior and Abel is a Junior, eligibility-wise, senior in school, and those
three guys are going to be graduating and moving on. But Neemy's still a
sophomore, but obviously has tremendous experience. Justin Bean is a sophomore
but didn't play a crazy amount last year. So we're just kind of getting a mix
with some of these guys. Brock Miller is only a sophomore, did play a lot of
minutes last year. So those guys have been there, done that. We've played a
very difficult schedule, our non-conference schedule. I mean, you're playing
at Florida and in the Orange Bowl Classic in a neutral game, right, and
playing LSU in Jamaica and North Texas, wins there. We played some very
difficult teams in very difficult environments. So they know what that's like,
they understand the moment, so to speak, and I think most importantly they
just really trust one another. And it's amazing what you can do when you
believe in each other and you can look each other in the eyes that we can get
this done.  
  
Q. So this is for Sam. You went on a tear in the second half scoring 18
points, including a seven-point burst to put the team up by 12. Do you ever
have a moment where you just like think to yourself that you need to turn it
on?  
SAM MERRILL: No, not necessarily. I think I just try and let the game come to
me. I know everyone says that, but I truly feel that. Obviously, there's
moments where you feel like maybe guys aren't making shots or maybe guys are a
little tense and I need to take a shot myself. But at the end of the day, with
the, with our style it's about creating open shots for whoever. It's not about
getting shots for one specific guy. So hopefully tomorrow night we can create
open shots for each other and knock them down.  
  
Q. Abel only played four minutes tonight. When you took him out was it
more of him saying he can 't go or did you just see that he wasn't ready to
play?  
CRAIG SMITH: It was a little bit of both. I took him out because it was about
the four-minute mark and just like we know he's not a hundred percent, so just
trying to get him a quick rest. And then just went to talk to him and I could
just, could just kind of sense, you know, where he was at. He never said like,
Coach, I can't go. But you just get a feel for things that way. And we have
very capable guys on our roster, obviously, and so we went with those guys and
we'll see where he's at tomorrow.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CRAIG SMITH: Yes.  
  
Q. Sam, going back to your second half scoring, down the stretch coach
puts you in an isolation situation late in the game last two games. What 's
your mindset going into those possessions when coach trusts you to go one-on-
one and get a bucket?  
SAM MERRILL: We talked about this a little last night, this is the first time
that we have done this, really, coach isn't a big one-on-one guy, but --  
  
CRAIG SMITH: Tells you how smart I am (Laughing.)  
  
SAM MERRILL: But I don't know, I just, you work on that all the time, those
one-on-one moves and you play one-on-one with your buddies all the time, so I
feel confident out there when there's space and feel confident in my jumper,
so I feel like can I get a shot whenever I need one. But shots fell tonight,
they fell last night, hopefully they fall down tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- Alphonso Anderson really had some big minutes
off the bench for you. He 's done that earlier in the season, but lately he's
been really playing big for you again.  
CRAIG SMITH: He has, I'm glad you asked that. Fonz had I thought, a very -- he
was very good in the first half, didn't quite go to him as much in the second
half, I thought Neemy was really good all night and I thought Bean really kind
of settled in. He took a couple, he had a couple in the first half that, you
know, but he's always going to bring great energy. But Fonz was kind of
cooking and he got going. He took the one shot that kind of he missed badly,
but he really settled into the game and he's really been sound for us and
we're asking a lot out of him, we put him in some different spots. At times
he's our, you know, a lot of times he's our back up 5 when Neemy has been out
of the game and so some of those guys got a lot more height and a lot more
girth, but he's a strong dude and has played very good minutes for us, both
last night and certainly tonight really kind of was a catalyst there for
awhile in particular from that first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you for your time, coach. Thank you, guys.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: All right, thank you, guys.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 81, Boise State -68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
LEON RICE: I loved the way we came out in that first half. We were playing
great basketball. But, you know, I knew they would counter punch and I knew,
they have done it all year long. And, man, they got it going and that lead
went away in just a second. But we knew we weren't going to win that game in
the first half. So but you got to credit San Diego State, great defensive team
and when they're making shots like that, they can beat anybody. Anybody in the
country.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you guys could just talk about the start. Getting up 16 on them
and really kind of having your way there for awhile and just what was that
like and then just, I guess, on the counter side of that, how quickly, as
coach said, that the lead went away and they started taking over?  
ABU KIGAB: It's a 40-minute game. We knew we weren't going to beat them in the
first 20 minutes. They're a very good team. They are ranked 5th in the nation
for a reason. So we knew we had to come and play 40 minutes really hard,
rebound, defend, hit shots. And give credit to them. They were hitting shots
too, playing good defense, and it's basketball, at the end of the day. You win
some and you lose some.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, how -- I will ask you Alex, how aware were
you that San Diego State 's been doing this? This is their fifth straight game
where teams have pretty much torched them in the first half and they've come
back. Were you aware of that? Did you kind of know that their run was
coming?  
ALEX HOBBS: Yeah, I mean, you can kind of be aware of that, but it just comes
down to what coach is always telling us, we want to make sure we throw the
first punch and not take that first hit coming out. So it was same old, same
old with that. We wanted to come out and make sure that we asserted ourselves.
And I think we did a good job of that, but then like everybody said, they kind
of came back pretty quickly with some threes and whatnot.  
  
Q. The 15 threes was the most you 've given up in your 10 years here in
a game. What did you guys think of your defense and were some of those just
crazy shots, because you guys did control Wetzel on the inside pretty well.  
ALEX HOBBS: Yeah, talked about protecting the paint. Coming into this
tournament, that was going to be huge for us. So some of those were part of
the game plan necessarily, not wanting to give them layups, and we'll give up
a through threes here and there. But some of them, too, were lapses as well
where things that we shouldn't have given up and then some of them were just
tough shots that they made.  
  
Q. Alex, what do you think the difference was in the second half?  
ALEX HOBBS: I would just say little lapses here and there. I think in the
first half they were kind of making their run. And I feel like besides like
one of the shackled threes, the threes they were kind of getting were kind of
on our terms. We wanted to be in in certain situations and then they made the
right play and hit the three off of that. And I think in the second half is
where you could see kind of a few of our more lapses where we gave up threes
where we shouldn't have.  
  
Q. I 'm sure before the game if we said you were tied at halftime you
would have taken that in a heartbeat probably. But to be up 16 with five
minutes left how much did that late run right before halftime where you guys
worked so hard to build that lead and then it didn't really have much to show
for it at halftime, how much did that hurt going into the second half?  
ABU KIGAB: I mean, it's basketball. It's a game of runs. We went on a run,
they went on a run, and at the end of the day it's going to happen. They're a
very good team. We're a very good team. Every team's going to go on a run. And
like I said, it's just a game of runs and whoever makes the most runs wins,
and they did today.  
  
Q. Alex, this may have been your last basketball game for Boise State.
How do you feel walking away from your career and enjoying your time at Boise
State?  
ALEX HOBBS: Yeah, you know, in the locker room I think me and the guys, we
kind of, we were sitting there kind of thinking and reflecting a little bit,
but I think it kind of came together and we're still hoping for that NIT
chance to keep playing. But yeah, like you said, if this is last time that I
get to put on a Bronco uniform, it's, it's been an honor from the second I
stepped on campus. And everything I learned from Coach Rice, all the staff,
and just all the memories and all the things we learned. And I don't think too
many teams could bounce back this year the way we did from last year and so
that's definitely something we can hang our hats on and be proud of and know
that whether we are leaving this program and it's our last game or not, we
left our mark and we left it in a good spot going forward.  
  
Q. That was my question, but if you both could touch on season as a
whole, 20 wins after you lost 20 last year and do what you did, and how badly
do you want to keep playing and keep this team together moving forward at the
NIT?  
ABU KIGAB: I think we showed a lot of relentlessness going from last year
losing 20 games and this year winning 20 games. Not many teams in the country
can do that. We flipped the switch and very proud of my guys. We came in every
single day working hard in practice in the weight room. We knew what we wanted
from the start of the season and all the guys were in on it, talked about it
every single day, and we knew at the end of the day, it was going to be tough.
Nothing's easy in this world. If it was easy, everyone would do it. But I'm
very proud of my guys and what we accomplished and one hell of a season. More
to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and take questions for
coach.  
  
Q. What did you see on the 15 threes? Was it a combination of defense or
were they just hot? And it seemed like on some of those there wasn 't much you
could do.  
LEON RICE: It sure did. There was a couple in transition where we didn't get
and they're really good at that. And there was a couple, there was one in the
zone and then there was some that were pretty well contested, I thought. But
they, that stretch where we had the good offense and we were scoring and doing
that, a big part of that was because they were missing threes and we were able
to run and kind of get us in transition a little bit. So in that aspect it was
going good. But when the team's that good, it really is pick your poison. It's
not you can shut down one thing and then the other thing they can't do. I
thought we did a good job Yanni and we handled the ball screens pretty good
and then they just went boom, boom, boom. And it's not a surprise. I mean,
like I said, I've watched them a lot. I know how good they are and I know how
explosive they are and I know how clutch they have been in those situations.
They don't get fazed by the score. And in this day and age up 15, 16 point
first half lead has got almost a fool's gold situation where, I'll take that
in the second half, but in the first half teams score so fast and they're so
good defensively too that I thought they did a, they ratcheted that up a
little bit more, and they got, we went, we struggled from, for a long time
offensively there.  
  
Q. In regards to post-season play, how deserving is this team?  
LEON RICE: Well, you know, I think if Utah State and San Diego State are going
to the NCAA tournament then we're next in line. We advanced the farthest. We
were right there in that group that's being considered. And I think right now
as of this morning our NET was the best of all of them. So I think we're the
one from the Mountain West, if those two go to the NCAA, which they're both
deserving of and they both should. So, but I don't get to choose. But I, you
know, I hope we get that opportunity because I got a lot of guys in that
locker room that don't want to take off the uniform yet. And it feels like
we're getting better, you know. I mean, I think I got a group that's still
improving.  
  
Q. Could you expand on what you said about it being fool 's gold? What's
it like as a coach when you're up 16 and you start feeling pretty good and,
but you know what they just did in the last five games, you've seen them all
year. Is it just you know it's coming or is there any kind of helpless
feeling?  
LEON RICE: You got to be able to counter punch and you got to be able to keep
playing good. And we were playing great in those minutes, early, and then they
gave us a good shot and then we got to be able to keep counter punching. And I
really thought they ratcheted up their defense a little bit and we weren't --
you got to be able to make some of those shots that we missed because in the
end you don't get that many good looks, so when you have a good one, you got
to make them. And I think there was about three or four possessions I can
think right off the top of my head that seemed like we had a good open three,
a couple from the corner, and players, they got to hit those in those
situations for us to have a chance there in the end.  
  
Q. To be in this round for the first time in like five years and win the
game yesterday and I know you 're hoping you're still playing but this isn't
the end. But your one of six teams that lost 20 last year and won 20 this
year. And last year you said sat up here and said I think everybody enjoyed
beating up on us. We'll be back. And maybe you're not back as far as you want
to be this year, but how do you feel about how you did this year?  
LEON RICE: Well, you've got to get take that first step of getting really,
really good again and we're on our way. And that is, that's quite a testament
to the seniors that I had. They've got a lot of character. They went through a
tough one last year. And there's just so many close games they lost and they
responded. We played a tough schedule. They had a lot of great moments, a lot
of great wins that -- right off the top of my head we had just a lot of
special things happen with this group. And the biggest thing is they were so
fun to coach, so fun to, I get excited to see them every day, win or lose, and
that's what you want as a coach. You want character guys that will pick each
other up, they will play for the right reasons and work hard and represent us
the right way and battle. I want our team to play hard and play with passion
and they certainly did that all year long. And we weren't perfect a lot of
times, and we had good games, bad games, just like any team, but in the end
they always responded. And I think the example was what you said, like last
week they got their hats handed to them by UNLV and they responded and came
back down here and played great. So that's kind of who they are as guys. You
know, when a senior class, that's why I want to keep playing with them. I
don't want to -- I mean, they're great guys, just fun to be around, like I
said. And when I say fun it's because the kind of people they are. They work
hard and they let you coach them and they want to get better. You get guys
that are seniors that want to get better, that's pretty special. And they did.
They kept getting better all throughout the year. And I mean, the distance
that Rod came in these two years, and then even Justinian, he just got more
and more consistent as we went on and Hobbs was, he's just, like he showed
tonight, the scorer that can get it going. And Smooth is one, Big Smooth is
one of the most unselfish guys and then Marcus is just a pit bull. He was
banged up tonight. His ankle was hurt but he wanted to be out there and help
these guys and anything he could do.  
  
So that's the kind of guys that I got to go coach every day and that makes my
job pretty special and I'm pretty humbled to be able to do that. And so really
proud of these guys. Obviously, I wanted to keep playing, these guys want to
keep playing, and they didn't want it to end that way, but you faced a really,
really good team tonight and I think that's pretty evident and I'm excited to
watch them in the NCAA tournament. I think they can go a long, long ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you for your time, coach.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 89, Wyoming - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
ALLEN EDWARDS: First, before talking about the game, just want to send our
seniors out the right way. What I told Jake and A.J. in the locker room for
the two years both of them being Junior college guys dealt with a lot last
year with injuries, this year injuries, illness, and youth, but of this made
sacrifices for these young guys in this program. So I told the young guys to
show their respect because even in life and in your journeys sometimes what
you go through may not be for you, but it may be to help someone else. And I
think these two guys have given our young group a good foundation by being a
right example, on and off the floor, for the type of kids that we want to have
in our program.  
  
Tonight the game, you know what, proud of our guys, to fight all the way down
to the end. I think sitting there with under three, a little under four
minutes, 4-point game, and even when we started pressing and trying to get
quick fouls and quick baskets, I thought we had a few good looks to even cut
it back to four. But I thought Sam Merrill made some really big, timely tough
shots down the stretch. But, again, loved our guys' fight, proud of them,
nobody thought we were going to be in this situation, like I told them, nobody
thought we were going to be here. But I said, nobody but the guys in the room.
Everybody looked at this as a Cinderella situation. I told our guys, even at
the beginning of the year, just to stay focused on the work, the process, and
again, don't pay attention to the outside noise. We understood that we were
young. We didn't expect to go through the injury and illness bug again. But
being one of the last four or three, however you want to put it, coming into
the tournament as an 11 seed, nobody thought we had a chance, and with under
three minutes left we're playing a very good Utah State team down to the wire.
So appreciate our fight. And also what I told them, any team in America, I
shouldn't say any team, but most teams going through what we have went through
probably would have packed it in, but like I said on previous opportunities,
these guys come with the right energy to put in the work and just stayed true
to the process. So happy to be their coach. And again, we left it out there.
We left it out there. So I'm proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jake, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guarded Sam for quite a bit of
that night and I know that you mentioned yesterday and you came up kind of in
the same area. What was that like guarding him? What did you feel like you
needed to do or did you feel like you had anything to prove? Or just kind of
describe what that was like guarding against him.  
JAKE HENDRICKS: It was a lot of fun. I know Sam pretty well. I, when I go back
home I talk to him quite a bit, so it was fun for me. I didn't feel like I had
anything to prove. I just wanted to come out and win and guard him the best I
could.  
  
Q. AJ, what was the scene like in the locker room after the run that you
guys had and then coming up short?  
AJ BANKS: Kind of like coach said, we just took it and looked at it from our
perspective from the inside. We were believing that we could win every game
that we played in. So this tournament wasn't anything different as far as
within ourselves just believing and knowing that the work we put in would
eventually pay off. And so just after, obviously it hurts, but we know how
much we overcame and how much we were against and we know that within
ourselves we believed the entire time.  
  
Q. Hunter, you guys have been a media darling the past couple of days. I
know a lot of college basketball players they don 't really like to talk about
the media attention but was it nice for you knowing how poor of a record you
guys had, a lot of guys would talk about how poor the record was, was it nice
to get that media attention and recognition the past couple days?  
HUNTER MALDONADO: I think like AJ kind of said we always believed in
ourselves, so whether the media was giving us the recognition we thought we
deserved or they were hating on us, we kind of just put that aside and I think
this tournament kind of showed that, that we still believe in ourselves and
just coming out and fighting with the guys we had, just locking our arms and
being together. We didn't really care about what the other people think
because if we would have thought that the season would have been over a long
time ago. So just to be able to come out here and just believe in ourselves, I
don't think the media affected it at all.  
  
HUNTER THOMPSON: I agree with everything Maldonado said.  
  
Q. AJ, for the past couple seasons coming into the tournament you 're
kind of coming home and having an opportunity to play in front of your family
and the community you grew up in. To come back this time and to really put on
this kind of a show and show this kind of effort and shock people, does it
feel a little bit better to for your senior year to kind of go out this far
into the tournament?  
AJ BANKS: Yeah, I'm very grateful that I'm able to end at home. I had a lot of
people come out in support, I've always had support from afar, but it's
different when they're actually here. Not everyone gets an opportunity to come
out and see games and be an active member in what I've been doing the last few
years, so being able to come here and just having their support from the
beginning was great, but then being able to win for them, not once but twice,
was even better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you for coming down, guys.

### [Matt Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34889)

### [KJ Feagin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38937)

### [Malachi Flynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38866)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 81, Boise State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, I want to say thank you to Aztec Nation. We
travel better than anybody and it makes a huge difference. When we got behind
tonight the crowd got behind us when we made a little run. And I imagine we'll
have another two or three thousand making the trip for tomorrow's game. So I
want to thank all the Aztec fans for supporting us the way they do and it
makes a difference.  
  
I want to say congratulations to Boise. I mean, they rocked us on our heels in
the first half. We got off to a good start, made some shots, and then they
went on an incredible run on us. I don't know what the lead was, 16 points,
something like that, 14, 16 points. And just shows what kind of team I have
with great resolve, they didn't panic, they just fought their way back into
it, tied it at halftime, and then it was a very competitive second half. And
I've got good players and they make me look like a good coach many a night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's take questions for the student-
athletes, please.  
  
Q. KJ, you dropped 21 tonight. Did today kind of feel like what you did
against Boise a couple months ago in Viejas? And can you also talk about the
19-3 run to kind of claw your way back, you guys back from the 16-point
deficit in the first half?  
KJ FEAGIN: Today definitely felt like our game against Boise at Viejas. I got
going in that game. And in this game, I got going early as well and I didn't
slow down. But the 19-3 run in the first half was a big momentum boost for us.
And after we tied it at halftime, you guys saw how pumped up we were at
halftime, and I knew that we weren't going to lose after that. So we got into
halftime, we made our adjustments, and we were ready to go out and just
unleash after that.  
  
Q. Matt, how much of a fact for was KJ 's leadership tonight?  
MATT MITCHELL: It was a very big factor. He was a leader, vocal. He showed it
as well. So that's what, as he's done all year. That's nothing new to us. So
he did an excellent job leading us tonight and taking over in that first half
and taking over in the second half and making tough shots. And I'm just happy
to have him on the team.  
  
Q. Malachi, have you guys kind of have given up on the whole we 're
going to have a fast start thing because it's kind of working for you just to
fall behind and come roaring back?  
MALACHI FLYNN: No, I think we did a good job getting off to a good start
today, especially the first couple minutes and they just went on their own
run. And then that's just how it goes. Basketball's a game of runs and
eventually it's going to turn our way.  
  
Q. KJ?  
KJ FEAGIN: Just beating a team three times is hard and like you said, we got
off to a great start, but basketball is a game of runs and teams are going to
hit shots. And we're not perfect as well and we made some mistakes that they
capitalized on. So it's just that time of the year where every other team is
kind of hitting their stride so the ante is getting upped a little bit. But
we're resilient and we're a talented team so we know that we're going to get
everybody's extra best shot at this point. So they came out and they were
pumped and ready for the game, but we had a better punch at the end.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys are going back to the championship game tomorrow. What
's the emotion like knowing you can kind of avenge what happened last year,
obviously, the disappointment last year and potentially against Utah State
again.  
MATT MITCHELL: Well, being on this team for the third year and having what
happened last year, I definitely want to get back and get back at Utah State
and get that win. No matter who it is, Wyoming, Utah State, whoever wins, I
think we definitely want to win that championship. It's no doubt about it. No,
I definitely want it for myself, I want it for this team. I mean, I just want
to avenge it.  
  
Q. KJ, what were they doing defensively that was maybe a little bit
different from other games? It looked like they were really gapping up and
taking away the paint and that opened things up for you on the perimeter?  
KJ FEAGIN: To be honest, I didn't really notice anything differently
defensively. Offensively, I felt like we got any look that we wanted. We just
weren't hitting shots at one point in the game and the reason they made that
run was just on the other end of the floor. I don't think offense is ever a
problem for us at this point in the season. So to say I saw any adjustments, I
don't think I saw that. But maybe I'll look at film and see something else,
but right off the top of my head I don't think I saw any.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll dismiss the athletes and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You held them to 23 percent shooting in the second half. What were
some of the defensive adjustments you made at halftime?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I don't know if they shot that low. I haven't looked. I thought
they were higher than that. But, no, we just got out of our help positions.
They were doing a great job gapping up on us and we needed to gap up better on
them so we needed to shrink the floor where they didn't have as many lanes to
drive to the basket. We didn't want to switch as many ball screens, even
though we ended up doing it, because they were rolling us in with a big and
posting us and causing us issues there. They had a good game plan, they
executed it and we were very fortunate to come out and get a victory tonight.  
  
Q. In the first or in the last game at Boise you switched almost
everything. And this one it didn 't look like you were switching as much
early, but what was the thinking behind that change?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: We switched everything at the very start because that's what we
had success with the other game. But when they were rolling us into the post,
they were throwing over us, they were posting us up, scoring in the low post,
so we tried not to switch as much. And as much as we tried not to, there were
times in the game where we still switched. And so sometimes that's good,
sometimes you switch, sometimes you don't switch and they don't know what
you're doing. And sometimes we don't know what we're doing. But it found a way
to work out. So we didn't want to switch as much the second half, we did at
times, but I thought we did a better job not letting them go in the low post
on us in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the back court duo of KJ and Malachi, they
combined for 43. And just, for most of that game, it seemed like they were the
only ones in double digits. Could you talk about what they meant to the
offense?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I thought KJ had a really good first half. I mean, he drove
into traffic in the first half and hit a really couple hard shots, right at
the front of the rim. So those were really hard finishes for him, but they
were timely. And we made I think three threes to start the game. But when we
started missing them we couldn't all of a sudden say, well we're missing
threes, we'll just drive in and get layups. We were getting threes because
they were packed in the paint. So eventually we kept shooting them, kept
shooting them and then we started making some again. So they forced us into
shooting threes, so Malachi would come off a ball screen, they collapse in the
paint, and he kicked the ball out and then we had to make the shot. And to the
credit of our guys they made a lot of threes in the second half, maybe 15 for
the game, high for the year. So that's what they were giving us, that's what
we had to take.  
  
Q. Is there any chance this team ever becomes a little too reliant on
the three or is that not even a concern with these guys the way you
collectively shoot?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I mean, it's all based on how we're guarded. I mean, they
weren't going to give us anything but threes. There was no room to the basket,
they were packed in there, and so we took some threes. Later in the game Matt
got to the basket a couple of times, Malachi on a ball screen, and that's as
much a byproduct as we made some threes and now they're nervous, so it pulls
them away. But at some point we have to make threes in order to stretch the
floor. And so if we stretch it and all of a sudden they're nervous, then
that's when we go inside to Yanni and let him try to score in the low post
because they don't want to give threes up.  
  
Q. What qualities does a team need to continue to come back in these
games that you 're down and ultimately go 29-1, 30-1?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Confidence and talent, swagger, belief. They never think
they're out of a game. There's never an over reaction in a timeout even when
we're down 16. They just keep chipping away and playing with great confidence.
And if you don't have confidence you have no chance and this team has great
confidence.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, what 's your comfort level now on the
sidelines that you've been through this five straight games where teams shoot
50 plus in the first half, you fall behind by eight, 10, 14 tonight. Are you
just like, Oh, okay, it's happened again, we're going to win, or are you
nervous?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I mean, you're always nervous as a coach, you're trying to find
something that works, something you can go to. And obviously we always go to
ball screens with Malachi. Sometimes we don't go to them as early as we did in
the game, try to get everybody involved, get them touching the ball, run some
stuff for other guys. But when we got down that many I just at that point
said, Let's put it in our best player's hands and let him make plays for
everybody. And that's the beauty of Malachi. A lot of guards you put in that
position they're going to shoot it every time you call their number. And all
he does is tell people where he wants them, comes off the ball screen and he
finds them. And then if they make a mistake or they duck under and he feels
like he wants to shoot a three, he raises up and takes it. So you put it in
your best player's hands and you let him make plays for everyone else.  
  
Q. What are the emotions coming into tomorrow with the championship game
and how do you balance that with your team, knowing what happened last year,
and how do you kind of tell them it 's a new year and how do you guys deal
with all that?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: It's a different feeling than last year, even though it's still
the championship game. Last year we weren't going to the NCAA tournament
unless we won it. This year we know we're going to the NCAA tournament. So
it's just another feather in our cap, we can cut nets down again, but we're
focused beyond tomorrow night, we're focused two weeks from now when the NCAA
tournament starts. So, yeah, we want to win it in the worse way, but there's
not the same feeling as last year where it was, if we don't win, our season
ends.  
  
Q. Is that confidence that you mentioned different than teams past,
because you 've had really talented teams before and obviously they haven't
been 29-1.  
BRIAN DUTCHER: 30-1. No, no, we have had teams with great confidence, I mean
the 34-3 team with D.J., Kawhi Leonard, Malcolm, Billy, that team had great
swagger and confidence. And that comes from winning. So the winning and the
confidence go together. Sometimes they can rock you and lose a couple games in
a row and it might slip a little bit. But that's why coaches, you have to keep
their team believing in themselves through hard times too. So Aztec basketball
has always had a strong belief that we're good and that we can get better. We
never just think we have arrived. So as good as we're playing now, we think
there's another level we can play at and we have to try to get there tomorrow
and then in the eight to 10 days leading into the NCAA tournament we have to
raise our level of play.  
  
Q. You guys have are the first team to win 30 games. Just having a
30-win season that 's remarkable in itself. You still have work to do, but
just reflecting on that accomplishment what does that mean for you?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Like I said, I reflect on it when the season's over. Right now
I'm focused on Utah State and Wyoming. I'm going to go back and watch both of
our last games, both, against both opponents, and try to get ready for
tomorrow, where we have our best chance to win our next game. And we're
looking forward to that, to that environment, to this building being full of
Aztec fans and trying to take advantage of all those things to try to cut nets
down again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 75, New Mexico - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
PAUL WEIR: Credit to Utah State. They were really good. We kind of went back
and forth between man and zone there late to stop Merrill, but I just, I
couldn't coach us well enough to a victory. These guys played their hearts
out. Unfortunately, I just couldn't create enough defensive stops down the
stretch for us to get the victory.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student-athletes
first.  
  
Q. For both you guys: This season you guys know it better than anybody
you guys lived it. The ups and downs of what went on this season and to be so
close again, to have a lead against Utah State, everything seemed to be what
you guys expected it to be these last few, this last week or so. How
frustrating is it? Would it almost have been in some ways been better had you
guys not shown, again, what this team could have been?  
VANCE JACKSON: It hurts because we played them last year and lost and we lost
this year and it's just crazy because we had it in our hands. We just didn't
finish and pull through. So any loss hurts, but this hurts the most because
the season is over and now we've got to start over.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is probably a tough one because obviously you 're
emotional about it. Could you just talk about when do you think the game got
away from you guys?  
PAUL WEIR: Really, our inability to stop Merrill and quite frankly my
inability to coach us to get some more stops there down the stretch. These
guys played their hearts out. I told them in the locker room they did
everything they could have done. I just, unfortunately, could not get us a
stop there late. Merrill was awesome and he was better than me.  
  
Q. Vance, what happened with that foul when you got mixed up or tied up
with Queta? It was really confusing. I don 't know what they told you, but
what happened on that situation?  
VANCE JACKSON: I just went up with the rebound and his arms just got caught. I
didn't do nothing intentionally or nothing. It's just basketball. It's a
basketball play.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you guys were against San Jose State. Vante Hendrix
played. Today he didn 't warm up with the team. What happened?  
PAUL WEIR: Nothing substantial. Our focus was on trying to win this game. I
didn't feel his focus was there, so I sent him home.  
  
Q. Corey, this is the end of your Lobo career. Reflection on kind of
what happened this season -- or not what happened, but your memories of a
Lobo. Vance, when he 's done, curious what your future holds, if it's going to
be in a Lobo uniform or not.  
COREY MANIGAULT: Just having the greatest coach ever beside me and taking me
here, actually working with me and things like that. So just learning from
him. Even though he say this game is his fault, we was out there on the floor
and stuff like that. So I don't want to say it was a hundred percent him. He's
still the greatest coach in my eyes, ever, as I move forward and be ready for
my next chapter.  
  
VANCE JACKSON: Right now I'm not even, I can't even really think about what
I'm going to do. I'm just, like this loss hurts, so I can't really answer that
question for you.  
  
Q. For both of you: I believe Utah State was favored by double digits
coming into the game. What was your mentality?  
VANCE JACKSON: Winning. Win or go home. They won and we lost and we're going
home.  
  
Q. Vance, obviously you started your career at UConn, but in your entire
college career has there been a game that you played in that 's been this
emotional?  
VANCE JACKSON: No.  
  
Q. Why was this one so emotional?  
VANCE JACKSON: Our team, we have been through so much. We've had so many
adversities. We've had so many highs and lows and I built so many
relationships. Each and every one of us and coach Weir, like Corey said, he's
the best coach that I've ever played for. And just to lose, you know what I'm
saying, it just hurts. Coach Weir put so much effort. The whole coaching
staff, they put so much effort in just the game plans and everything. And to
not win, you know what I'm saying, it just hurts, man. This is his last year.
I just want to win for him, so it just hurt.  
  
Q. As you said yourself, there were a lot of ups and downs this season.
As one of the leaders of the team, how did you overcome that adversity with
all the negative news put out there about you guys?  
VANCE JACKSON: Blocking the outside noise. Everybody had their own opinions
about what's going on, but deep down inside we're the only ones that know
what's going on. So as long as we was just staying together that's all that
mattered and just staying positive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank
you for coming down, men. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You 've mentioned Sam Merrill a couple times, the chess match with
him. What makes him so difficult to game plan against?  
PAUL WEIR: I thought at our place he had issues off the dribble. I thought our
ball pressure really bothered him at our place. I thought tonight -- or today,
I don't know what time it is, but he just did a much better job with ball
pressure. I thought his -- I mean, they kind of let him go there down the
stretch. We got stuck in some isos up top. He scored in the lane on an up and
under, got to the free-throw line, made that tough three. We went zone. I
mean, I just -- I don't know. I didn't do a good enough job. He beat me, at
the end of the day. He's a great player and I could not find a way to stop him
when it mattered. He can beat you from all three levels, as he showed it, and
he was awesome tonight.  
  
Q. I know you got asked earlier. It 's really hard to hear out here any
of your answers, so I'm going to ask again. Vante Hendrix gets sent home on an
airplane this afternoon. What was that about, A, and B, how is this team
still, on the final day of your season, facing situations where players are
doing things that are taking away from pregame moments, game moments?
Situations like this are the stories of this year's team unfortunately for you
and this program, and I'm curious what you as a coach need to do to fix that
moving forward and really more to the matter of today, what was today's drama
about?  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, I guess it could be looked at -- I'm sorry, I think maybe
they turned it up too much -- I guess it could get looked at that way. Really
didn't do anything serious at all. Given the time, the intensity of today in
the moment, I just felt like we were better off without him. It really wasn't
anything serious or anything to worry about, but given the nature of how
important I wanted to treat this past week and what I wanted out of our guys
just didn't quite meet my expectations.  
  
Q. Is Vance -- I mean, is Vante Hendrix a member of the Lobo basketball
team next season?  
PAUL WEIR: To be determined.  
  
Q. When Sam Merrill came back with four fouls --  
PAUL WEIR: Sam Merrill, Sam Merrill, Sam Merrill. I'm going to see this kid in
my -- for a long time. Trey Kell, part two. Yeah, sorry. Sam Merrill. He's
amazing. He should be in the NBA draft. He kicked our ass. He kicked my ass.
He's a great basketball player. I wish him all the best. He was exceptional
tonight.  
  
Q. And then, Coach, you guys started out, Utah State jumped out to a
20-8 lead. What was the adjustments the team made early in the first half to
get back in the game and tie it at halftime?  
PAUL WEIR: Yeah, that starting five just, unfortunately, I went back to it
again. It just has not gotten us off to good starts. Hasn't really in either
of these games. Unfortunately, it just wasn't a great group. Bringing in Kurt,
again, plus 12 tonight. Unfortunately, him fouling out really hurt us. Kurt's
pretty much been our probably most under-appreciated player here in the last
couple of weeks. So bringing him in just kind of usually jump starts our team
and I thought he was awesome again tonight and unfortunately losing him down
the stretch hurt us a little bit.  
  
Q. This was a very dramatic season. What was the biggest take away and
what can you do as a coach to have a different type of season next season?  
PAUL WEIR: Oh, that's really, I wish I could compact that into a nice tight
answer for you, but there's a lot that went on this year in many different
levels. On the court, off the court, each of the individual players, maybe
myself, and then all of us collectively with our different relationships. But
I think at the end of the day, what I've really impressed, I hope I've
impressed upon them is just to keep a really good attitude in the face of
adversity and just continue to work through it. We finished the season, maybe
not strong, but stronger than where we were. When you're down 14 at home to
Utah State, I think it's a pretty easy time for a lot of kids to just pack it
in. They didn't. They fought through it. We got that win. We got the next win.
And for 30-something minutes tonight we were trying to get this win, just
didn't quite have enough. So hopefully these guys, we all want to hold the
trophy at the end, but they will learn from this and take these lessons for
the rest of their life, just to fight through things when life doesn't go your
way.  
  
Q. I 'm not sure if you knew this. Vante Hendrix actually did speak out
about the situation. He made a tweet virtually implying that he does not know
what he did and he's still waiting to hear the reason why he was sent home.
Was that argument -- not argument, but was that decision mutual and how did he
react when you told him the news?  
PAUL WEIR: Again, I was just really trying to get focused for today's game. He
is aware. I sent him home and I'll deal with it. We can talk about Sam
Merrill, but I don't think we need to talk about Vante Hendrix that much.  
  
Q. I asked your players, need to ask you the same. The plan for you is
coming back next year as the Lobo basketball coach? Have you heard anything
different?  
PAUL WEIR: I have not.  
  
Q. And your desire is to come back as Lobo basketball coach?  
PAUL WEIR: It is. Good to go?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, coach.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 75, New Mexico - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
CRAIG SMITH: It was a heck of a basketball game. March Madness is definitely
here. Got to give credit to New Mexico. I thought they played fantastic. It
was an odd deal with the schedule. We just played those guys five days ago,
and so there's a lot of familiarity. But they're playing, I mean, they're
playing, they were playing really, really good basketball. They're a very
talented team and they really kind of redefined who they are, honestly, in the
last 10 days or so and got to give them a lot of credit with that.  
  
It was a great game. We had to overcome lot of different things tonight. Foul
trouble with Queta gets two in the first five minutes. Gets his third with
about a minute and a half to go. We had our guys sitting at the scorer's table
ready to check in for him. Sam gets three or four fouls in the first five
minutes of the second half and then our starting point guard, Abel Porter was
hurt and wasn't able to go back in. So now all of a sudden they're, it's a
feeding frenzy out there and we had some guys out there in some different
positions and trying to break the pressure and called timeout just to try to
get us our poise and confidence back. New Mexico always shows up big-time at
this tournament. And but credit to our guys, to find a way to win. These two
young men here were unbelievable. Sam just stayed in the game after that long
break, and then Diogo made some incredible plays on both ends of the floor
like he always does. And so just really, really proud of our effort and that's
one down and got to be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's take questions for the student-athletes
first.  
  
Q. Sam, could you talk a little bit about playing the last 9:41 with
four fouls. How did you avoid that fifth?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, we sat in that 1-3-1, I think for the entire time that I
was in. And that wasn't just because I had four fouls. We, I think we did a
lot of damage with that with our length and guys like Diogo and Justin up top
who do a good job of communicating with each other and are really smart. So I
kind of just sat in the corner and I don't know, I just basically sat there.
But, yeah, not my best defensive game. But as a team we just, like Coach said,
we just found a way and that's how it has to be.  
  
Q. Diogo, with Merrill being out with foul trouble and also Queta being
limited with fouls as well, what was your mindset knowing that you kind of had
to step up and be one of the leaders offensively and also defensively?  
DIOGO BRITO: Definitely. Like, I looked at the floor and I saw that I had to
step it up because one of the biggest things also was that Abel was not in the
game, so we didn't really have a point guard on the floor. It was just me,
Sean, and then Bean bringing the ball up. And we struggled for a little bit
there, but I think when Coach called that timeout then just said to keep our
poise. And I think New Mexico also lost a little bit of the fire that they
were feeding off of from their fans. So we just kept our poise, kept playing,
kept trying to make plays, simple plays, and eventually we were able to start
breaking their press and get our, get it back in the game, get back into the
game.  
  
Q. For both of you: 9:38 remaining and you guys are down 57-46, Coach
calls a timeout. What 's that huddle like for you guys as players? What was
mentioned?  
SAM MERRILL: I don't know exactly what was mentioned, but those last those few
timeouts, I think he called one earlier, probably three or four minutes
earlier, and then there was the media and they had just slowly gotten a bigger
lead. So there was definitely a sense of urgency. But also, Coach just kept
telling us, Just stay poised, stay calm. We had made some silly turnovers that
we always do against New Mexico. They could be full-court press or not and
somehow we always do, make silly turnovers. So the mindset was just stay
poised, but got to play with a sense of urgency and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Normally, I would be asking Coach this, but Diogo, you took a really
hard fall and you hit your head on the floor pretty hard. I 'm amazed you're
sitting up here right now. How are you doing and did you go through some type
of concussion protocol?  
DIOGO BRITO: Yes, but I actually didn't get hurt in my head. It was more in
the back. But you just, you just -- yeah, in the tail bone. So just got to
play, you just got to play through pain, especially on these occasions. Like,
I don't want this to be my last game. That was definitely one of my mindsets
towards the end. You just got to play through pain, and I guess, you know,
whether you're hurt or not New Mexico doesn't really care, so I had to go out
there and just play my best as hard as I can.  
  
Q. Coach, they only ended up shooting 26 percent from three, but when
they were making those threes during that run, how big did they feel at the
time?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, Lyle couldn't miss. He had that stretch in that first half
when we were up, I think 23-9, and then he caught fire and made, what, four
out of five, I think scored four out of five possessions or something like
that, and it just felt like a wave. But, listen, when you're playing and
they're shooting -- last five games they were shooting 47 percent, 47 percent
of their shots were from the three. And they have guys like that that can take
over and make those plays. And we saw it last year with Jackson and I think he
had 28 on us here and caught fire and we were fortunate to be able to pretty
much relatively neutralize him. He goes 2-11 from the three, but of course, we
make the three to go up three and he answers the bell, you know, on the next
one. So you just got to weather that Storm. Certainly we played more zone
tonight than probably any time in my nine years as a head coach, but our guys
are confident in that and they're a handful to guard in their man stuff.  
  
Q. Sam, in your amazing career here at Utah State you played in a lot of
huge games, especially last year with the Mountain West championship and
playing in the tournament. But in your career have you ever played in a game
this emotional?  
SAM MERRILL: That's a good question. Probably not, just because we're both
seniors, so it may be the last one, so there's a different sense of urgency,
like we talked about. You never know what's going to happen. When I went out
with my fourth foul I was just hoping that they didn't go on too big of a run.
And we found a way to stay close-ish, and then found a way to win that game at
the end. So it's definitely one of the most emotional games I've played in,
for sure.  
  
Q. And when Abel went down, what was your mindset going for the rest of
the game, knowing you were going to have to be the primary ball handler?  
SAM MERRILL: I feel pretty confident as a ball handler, even when guys
pressure me, so I was hoping to take some pressure off of a freshman like Sean
or Bean. And Diogo does a good job with pressure as well. So just trying to
bring some poise and stay calm and do what we do.  
  
Q. Both of you guys hit big 3-pointers there in the last couple minutes.
Sam, you had a hand in your face, at least, pretty guarded, and Diogo hit a
big one. Can you both address those shots?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, Coach just let me go one-on-one for about three or four
straight possessions there and I don't know if he is a big fan of one-on-one
basketball, but he let me do it and I got to the free-throw line a couple
times. Missed two in a row, which is odd. I wasn't sure I was ever going to
make a free throw. But I just felt confident and stepped into it and made it.  
  
DIOGO BRITO: In my case, like before that I was just basically a spectator,
just watching that Sam Merrill show on the floor. And eventually I actually
thought they were going to zone. At first I thought they were going to just
trap him, either from me or from Sean. They went zone and we ran a play to get
the ball to Sam in the corner. They actually did a pretty good job. So at that
time I just thought I got to find a way to make a play and I saw Sam driving
baseline and from that point on I said, I'm just going to go crack back and
shoot it. I didn't think twice the whole time and just let it go.  
  
Q. Can you guys speak a little bit on Justin Bean? He kind of seems like
he 's one of those guys that likes to do the dirty work underneath and brings
the energy to the floor.  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, definitely. How many rebounds did he have? 15. That's a
solid number.  
  
DIOGO BRITO: I think he had like half a double double before the first media
of the first half.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, like he just, he's always in the dirty spots, he's always
diving for loose balls, getting offensive rebounds, getting rebounds, and
cleaning the stuff up, so he was big for us tonight.  
  
DIOGO BRITO: Definitely. And also in the 1-3-1 we're very susceptible to lose
rebounds, right, but he just comes from the top and just cleans that glass.
And I think that's also one of the things why that zone is successful because
we have Neemias, obviously, underneath and then Bean just go clean, just
cleans up everything outside of that.  
  
Q. Brito, you 've kind of had a tendency the past two years to really
show up in the conference tournament. What is it about this venue and about
this situation that really let's you kind of have these moments?  
DIOGO BRITO: I don't want to speak too early because it's still the first day
of the tournament, but I definitely love the big games, like, that's what we
work for and that's why you stay in the gym even when things are not going
your way during the season, you know. And I really love playing in the
conference tournament, like, we just, it's the best showcase in the whole
conference. And like I said, just keep working even when things are not going
your way and, I guess, in the big time games I think even I take even more
pride and I really love these games. Even when we're down 11, I just want to
keep playing. And Coach did a good job of really trusting in me, kept me on
the floor even though I did some turnovers and after that just clear your mind
and go make the next play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm going to dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank
you, men. We'll keep coach for a few more minutes.  
  
Q. You have a reputation of being one of the nicest coaches in college
basketball, but tonight you did not seem yourself. You were incredibly
animated on the sidelines. In your coaching career have you ever been this
animated?  
CRAIG SMITH: I'm looking for the other guy that I was fortunate to be a
coworker with for four years. But yeah, you go through ups and downs and
certainly March Madness is, can be emotional. There was a lot of emotions from
everyone, you know. New Mexico's fan base is incredible and they always show
up very, very well here. And certainly, I thought it was big to get up early
and, obviously, like I said earlier, being up 22-9. And then a lot of things
didn't go well for us and that's a credit to New Mexico, certainly. But it was
just, it was just kind of one of those games and we all saw it and were a part
of it and just kind of, every game has its own unique feel to it, right? And
you got to be able to play in a lot of different styles of play. And so, yeah,
you got to show poise and confidence when everything is kind of -- but then
the fire comes in some of those emotional plays and I try to, I like to bring
emotion to the game at certain times because I think our guys can definitely
feed off of that. But New Mexico is, they're a load and, you know, at the end
of the day they have won, what, 19, 18, 19 games, and they have had some
things that they have had to go through. So have we in some different things.
And I think when you can get through that stuff you find out who you are. And
they're playing, like I said, their best basketball. But for our guys, Sean
Bairstow, his numbers aren't going to look amazing, but he's a true freshman
and he gets thrown to the wolves and that play he made at the end to Bean as
the shot clock was winding down, to have the poise, to play off of two feet,
get that guy to help up and dump it down, and then Bean makes that great
finish. I think at New Mexico we missed nine shots around the basket. And
tonight we did a lot better job with that. But it's March Madness and you got
to be able to win in any style of play. And I just thought it was just a,
certainly I was emotional at times, but I thought the whole game was very,
very emotional and that's what it's about.  
  
Q. So your game plan to start the game, was that to get Abel to see if
he was able to start and play the whole game? And if so, did that change once
Sam goes to the bench with four fouls and you have Sean at the point guard?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well, we just -- I guess in my eyes we played Saturday, we were
off Sunday, Abel, we actually didn't do a whole lot on Monday, just because
the condition that we were in. And Tuesday he wasn't able to do a whole lot.
He practiced yesterday. And then you could tell when he was out there he just
wasn't moving very well at all. And then he basically asked to come out after,
during his first run of the second half. And when Sam got the foul trouble I
just kind of looked at Abel and said, Can you go? And he probably would have
went, but I just know that look and I'm just like, Nope, if you can't go,
we're -- so we went with the other, whoever we put in, I think we put in Sean
or Brock. But now you got -- I mean Diogo's played a little bit of point guard
in his career, Sean I think eventually maybe will be able to play some point
guard, but and then they smelled blood, there's no doubt and I think that's
when we got down 11 or eight and we called the timeout. We just did some real
uncharacteristic things and that's what happens when they speed you up and it
feels like you're playing in The Pit or it sort of feels like that. And we
just had to take a big breath, take a deep breath, slow down, trust your
training, trust everything you've done up to this point, trust one another,
and then just let's chip away at this, because, you know, 10 minutes is still
a long time to go in a game. Although that did feel like the longest game of
all time.  
  
Q. Sam Merrill once again was phenomenal tonight. If he didn 't get in
foul trouble, he could have had 60 points, who knows, he was killing it. I
know your season is not over yet and regardless of what happens tomorrow you
guys still have a great shot at making the tournament. But how much are you
going to miss Sam after this season?  
CRAIG SMITH: Oh, he's a, yeah, you don't, you don't get to coach guys like him
real, real often. And his accolades speak for themself. Utah State has a great
tradition of basketball, although we're a relatively new member of the
Mountain West Conference, but that young man, I mean, when I got hired all
everybody ever said about Sam -- and he could have went anywhere in the
country, basically anywhere in the country, all everybody ever said about him
is, all he wants to do is win. And it's amazing how his focus is always
winning. Obviously his focus is to get better all the time, but all he cares
about is winning. He literally doesn't care about his numbers. Doesn't care.
And he's going to probably finish his career, he's for sure going to finish
his career as the third leading scorer or the second leading scorer in the
history of Utah State and he's going to finish his career as the number two
guy in assists. And the dude never takes a bad shot. And he's almost so good
like when if misses a shot you're just mad at him and it's like, How dare you
miss an open shot, you know? But he just, he's a winner in every way, shape
and form, he wants to win everything he does. But he's just such a -- our
young guys are so fortunate to be able to play with him, all of our guys are,
but what a guy to be able to look at as a freshman and say, that's how it's
done. And I just can't say enough positive things about Sam.  
  
Q. This actually had a lot of parallels to last year 's game against New
Mexico and then you were tied at halftime as well and went on a late run to
win. How much does experience like last year's tournament help you guys in
preparing for this tournament and then also in the situations that you had
today?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well if you would have asked me that last year I would have said
it doesn't matter, because of what we did. But it definitely matters and we
actually brought that up in one of the huddles. Because it was eery the
parallels, except we obviously got off to a bigger lead tonight and it took us
longer to get the lead back.  
  
But Diogo makes the three in the same corner as he made last year. Last year
he made it with just over two minutes to go, tonight he made it with I think
just over a minute or just over a minute to go. There's just so many
parallels. Sam had foul trouble last year, right? Not quite as early as he did
this year, but he did. And so I think it matters to know that any time in
life, whether it's basketball or anything, when you can draw back on those
experiences and learn from those types of things I think it can make a big
difference. But we're a different team than last year, we have some new guys
out there, but there's no doubt that it makes, it can make a big difference.  
  
Q. Both teams double-digit leads in this game. For you guys of course it
was the second half that you had to overcome that double-digit lead. What do
you think that means as far as, and what does that show for intestinal
fortitude of your squad as you move forward now in this tournament?  
CRAIG SMITH: Well any time -- and New Mexico showed the same thing at their
place last week. We were up by a decent margin and even tonight when they were
down 22-9 I thought they showed a great fortitude and showed some,
demonstrated some things to be able to come back. I thoughts we had some
chances to kind of put them away and then of course we have some foolish
turnovers and some missed communication on some defensive things that should
be pretty straightforward.  
  
But I think it shows a lot about character, to be able to do that when it felt
like somewhat of a road game for a long stretch. And then when we were able to
flip the momentum it probably felt like a road game for them, because I
thought we had a great showing tonight with our Aggie fans.  
  
So it's not easy, those 10 players that are on the floor at that time, for
either team, you are, you see everything. It's not like football where you can
hide behind a helmet. Like the fans are right on you, they see every facial
expression, they see every exchange of words whether it's player to coach,
coach to the player, teammate to teammate, see it all. And you can kind of get
exposed and a guy like Bairstow gets in the game right away and his minutes
have been kind of up-and-down, but the one thing about that kid he's like,
Coach, I got to earn it. And he's always like, I got to prove that you need,
that you can play me.  
  
And he gets two five-second counts -- I'm not sure I've seen a five-second
count all year -- and he gets two in like when he gets in there. And freshman,
right? Like, and so, and I got to do a better job of help being him out. But
he settled in and like Diogo kind of went at him in a straightforward way,
like but also like, hey, let's figure this thing out, there's no time for
feeling sorry for yourself, right? And Sean's an ultimate competitor.  
  
But I was just so proud of just our poise. I thought we showed great poise,
which this team has pretty much done for the most part for two years. But
certainly with the Queta situation, the Merrill situation, with fouls, and
Porter being out, to be able to throw those three guards out there -- and we
didn't have any other options, like we were like we really have no other guard
to play. You know, we're relatively thin that way because we're redshirting
three guys and we got another guy out for the year and so you don't have a
choice, better figure it out in a hurry.  
  
Q. When Sam picked up his fourth foul what was your message to him and
your message to the team and then when you put him back in with four fouls,
you needed him, did you just have complete trust in him to let him do his
thing?  
CRAIG SMITH: I always have trust in Sam. He's a veteran guy, he's a very
intelligent guy. Usually when you get in foul trouble, usually when you get in
foul troubles it's because you're out of position, you can be overzealous,
right, you lack whatever foot speed or whatever it might be, but you're not
getting your work done early. Sam's a guy that very rarely doesn't do any of
those things. And so we always, we play him with foul issues all the time --
he doesn't have foul trouble a whole lot, but when he does I trust him to make
the right play -- and I think that's what he was alluding to with his fouls.
Jackson drills that one late because Sam was a little bit probably not as
aggressive as he normally would be if he didn't have four, but certainly that
was a pivotal moment in the game when he gets four and he got four in the
first five minutes of the second half. And so certainly we didn't handle that
very well for quite some time and then I thought we kind of settled in. And
then certainly when we got him back on the floor, you know, he just, he just
gives guys so much confidence when he's out there and that's what really good
players that are team players do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thank you for your time, coach.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Leon Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23356)

### [Derrick Alston Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38882)

### [RJ Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38883)

### [Justinian Jessup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34899)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 67, UNLV - 61  
  
LEON RICE: Well, we knew it was going to be a battle with these guys. I said
it before the game, UNLV, TJ has done just a terrific job and their guys have
done such a great job of -- they got better as the year went on, and they were
playing maybe the best basketball in the league down the stretch, and we knew
we were going to have to play a great game, and we knew it was going to be
highly, highly competitive, and certainly didn't disappoint.  
  
We also knew that we weren't going to -- there's no knocking -- somebody
wasn't going to get knocked out in the first round. It was going to go 40
minutes and it took all 40 minutes to get the job done. But I was really proud
of our guys. They took -- we came in here last week, and they handed us our
hats, and we responded the right way, like these guys always do, and they
adjusted some things, and it was on them. They had to come back down here and
play the home team and play a team that just, like I said, kind of stuck it to
us. So I was really proud of our guys, the way they approached it.  
  
Q. Defensively you guys obviously really packed the paint and tried --
took some chances there in terms of letting them shoot from the outside. Only
18 points in the paint after they had 42 last game. Their shooting percentage
went from 50 percent down to 32. Defensively what was the difference for you
guys, after how the last game went?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Yeah, you said it right there, just packed the paint. We
knew that wins or losses, they make seven threes, so it's really all about
just defending that box like we talked about all week and they're going to
make some, we knew that, and we were just going to stick with the plan the
whole game, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. RJ, you fouled out last time you played these guys with 8:03 left.
How much did that motivate you and factor into your performance today?  
RJ WILLIAMS: It just made me want to play harder for my teammates, to be there
on the floor and help the team out wherever I can, and that was staying on the
floor tonight.  
  
Q. What does this mean for you guys, to be moving on, to not have the
season be over and be playing another game tomorrow?  
DERRICK ALSTON JR.: Definitely huge. I mean, for us, like I said, nobody wants
to quit playing. We've got a 20-win season, got a great opportunity versus a
really good team tomorrow. We've got guys in our locker room who are very
excited to keep playing and want to keep winning.  
  
Q. Derrick, what allowed the defense to be so effective today?  
DERRICK ALSTON JR.: I think just really locking into the game plan. Obviously
like I said, they kind of torched us in the paint last game, and we knew that
was going to be a big factor, and just trusting the game plan, trusting each
other and just faith in each other knowing that we can get it done.  
  
Q. Could you tell me about the unique challenges of facing the Aztecs
tomorrow?  
DERRICK ALSTON JR.: I mean, they're a good team. Like I said, don't have a lot
of losses. They can do -- 1 through 5 they're very strong, have a good bench,
so it's going to be a great match-up. They're a really good team.  
  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Yeah, I don't think they have any glaring weaknesses. Like
he said, they're strong 1 through 5, got good guards, good bigs, so like he
said, it'll be a good game.  
  
RJ WILLIAMS: Yeah, like J said, they're a great team, just got to stay
connected like we did today, and the results will handle themselves.  
  
Q. RJ, big game today; what do you do to stay focused and have that
duplicated tomorrow against San Diego?  
RJ WILLIAMS: Just have the same mindset coming in today and just staying
connected. Leon harps on that for us and just staying connected as a team. We
have this thing called 23 strong, so just come in 23 strong connected, and it
should be fine.  
  
Q. You guys obviously had the lead and then they hit a couple shots and
the crowd is getting into it and you 're only up two points with about three
minutes left. I think all three of you hit some big free throws, but just to
pull it out at the end and make some key plays and key free throws and get a
couple stops in the last couple minutes, how were you able to do that and how
did it feel?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Yeah, the whole mantra this year has just been finish, and I
think we did a good job of that today. We had some lapses defensively, let
Antonio get going a little bit, but yeah, we did a good job of finishing,
keeping our cool, especially with a lot of UNLV fans there. It's going to be
the same thing tomorrow; San Diego State is going to have a lot of fans, so
we've just got to keep our poise and play the whole 40.  
  
Q. J, you 're a senior; what's it mean to you to have another
opportunity at San Diego State?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: It's great, just another opportunity, playing in a Boise
State uniform, really. That's the biggest thing. We're just one game away from
playing for a championship, so that's exciting.  
  
Q. RJ, you had the pass right to Hobbs; was that you that had the bounce
pass on the lay-up there? You obviously did a lot offensively in terms of
scoring, but in that spot to make that pass and then to have Alex hit that
shot at that time, I think it was his only bucket of the game, how big was
that play?  
RJ WILLIAMS: It was big. Hobbs, credit to him. He's a great scorer, just
natural scorer, so I knew they were going to overplay him, and then we
practiced it in practice, just throw it to him, he was open, he scored the
bucket. All the credit to Hobbs for sure.  
  
Q. Derrick, you 're a legitimate NBA prospect; you're in a lot of mock
drafts as a late second-rounder. I know you want to right now focus on beating
San Diego State tomorrow, but what can a win against them and potentially a
win in the tournament do for your draft stock?  
LEON RICE: Let's just focus on the games and talk about the teams. He doesn't
want to talk about that right now, so I'm intercepting that. I'll let him talk
about the game tomorrow. Do him a favor, let him focus on that.  
  
Q. Derrick, Coach alluded to it, talking about what happened last time
you guys played these guys here. How much of an extra emphasis kind of a kick
in the backside did that give you guys going into this match-up today?  
DERRICK ALSTON JR.: Definitely, for sure. My big thing is just continuing to
play with these guys. We have great seniors, and they need to go out on the
right foot, so for me it's just doing anything I can in my power to help them
win, and like I said, we've got a big opportunity tomorrow to get a great win
and have a chance to play for a championship and go to the NCAA Tournament. I
mean, you're not holding anything back at this time. Everyone is kind of
hurting and tired, but at this time, it's March, this is the best time to play
basketball and we're going to go out there and compete and go out there and
try to get a win.  
  
Q. Leon, the defensive game plan, going to pack the paint there, and
obviously you were kind of secretive when we were asking you the other day
what was going to change defensively, so you obviously had a plan and it
worked. How did you guys decide to go that route and how effective was it?  
LEON RICE: Well, that's the beauty of my guys because it was on them. They
bought in, they worked on it really hard. It was nice to have the bye to kind
of get refreshed, and then we had maybe three of our best practices, and
credit to our scout team, too. We've got one of the best scout teams in
America, and they couldn't get to the paint on us. It helped us.  
  
But again, all the credit goes back -- my staff did a terrific job, obviously,
but it goes back to these guys going out and doing it. And then UNLV comes out
first possession and hits a three, and they could have been like, oh, no, this
isn't going to work, but they stuck with it and they kept grinding all game,
and that's what it was going to take. We knew that that's what it was going to
take to be a 40-minute game to finish this one.  
  
Q. Leon, RJ with 23 and 15 today, what did you think of his
performance?  
LEON RICE: How about that? Like you said, that pass at the end of the game and
drawing nine fouls, and he just -- they have a plan. Those guys are good
rebounders. They're one of the best rebounding teams in our league and in the
country. He gets the ball somehow someway, and he's undersized and he just
plays with so much heart, so much passion, and sometimes he goes over a little
bit, and that happened tonight. We've got to correct that. But I just love his
passion and energy.  
  
I like those guys to play with that kind of fire, and when you do, when you
rub up against that line, sometimes you go over it a little bit, and I've gone
over it myself once in a while.  
  
But we've got to be smarter about that. We got two of them tonight, and can't
do that.  
  
Q. Earlier today it was Jordan Schakel for the San Diego State Aztecs;
at times it 's Malachi Flynn, it can be Yanni Wetzell, it can be Matt Mitchell
--  
LEON RICE: I'm familiar with them, yeah.  
  
Q. Where do you begin when it comes to game planning for this team?  
LEON RICE: Yeah, and in such a short turnaround, it's tough, because another
one that last time we played them -- both times we played them they handed us
our hats. They have that record for a reason. When a team is that highly
ranked this time of year, when a team has got that kind of record and who they
beat and the circumstances they beat them, I mean, they're -- don't
underestimate that because I've lived through this time and time again in my
career, don't underestimate how hard it is when you have a target on you night
in, night out. As they went down the stretch, everybody is trying to play
their best against them, every arena is full against them, and that team has
responded. I mean, time and time again, they've responded. It's been an
impressive, really, really, really impressive team, impressive team, and the
job Dutcher has done certainly is deserving of the Coach of the Year in the
Mountain West but maybe the National Coach of the Year from what I've seen.  
  
You know, you can't -- all those things are accurate that I just said. It's
not just a coach up here, this is who we play tomorrow. Those are all true.
Like you said, you go down each one of those guys and they've done tremendous
things for that team at some point in this year, and pretty darned consistent,
too. It's not like, well, one guy just had a great night tonight and then
another. Those guys have been -- I mean, you talk about consistency, it's been
so impressive.  
  
Q. Coach, big win obviously today; when do you get together with your
guys and shift the energy from celebrating today 's win to getting ready for
the biggest match-up of the season?  
LEON RICE: You know, that's the nice thing about playing in preseason
tournaments and that's the nice thing about having veterans. They know.
They're turning the page. You know, I mean, these guys -- it's so funny, they
just -- not an expression, not a -- but they're happy, but they're not overly
exuberant. We've got five seniors and we've got guys that want to keep
playing, so they get it. They know that we're not just going to go back and
celebrate. They'll turn the page. I think they already have it looks like.
That's why we came here. We want to keep playing, and they want to keep
competing, and we've got a huge challenge tomorrow.  
  
They also know that. They're not dumb. They watch -- these kids, players these
days, they watch everything. They know the team we're playing. They know who
we have in front of us.  
  
Q. When you 're putting together your defensive game plan, were you
taking into account that Mitrou-Long probably wouldn't play?  
LEON RICE: No, you know, I -- you never can count on that or think about that.
They always seem to show up and play. That's a tough deal that he got hurt.
He's a great player. But credit to their team. Those guys battled, and that's
what it's about. You hate to focus anything on that because that team we
played battled, and those guys, the five they had on the court were great.  
  
My guys did a terrific job with what was out there and what we had to do. But
yeah, he was -- we planned like he was going to play. We didn't know.  
  
Q. Leon, there 's good and bad to every win; what are some of the --  
LEON RICE: There's no bad to wins.  
  
Q. What are some of the positives you can take away, and what are some
of the biggest negatives you want to correct going into San Diego State
tomorrow?  
LEON RICE: Well, this time of year with however many hours, 16 hours we have
to play, it's not about like hey, we're going to go correct a bunch of things.
If there's things that need to be corrected, we probably have worked on it
this time of year. You kind of are who you are at this time of year.  
  
Like I said, the greatest thing about that game was the response from the last
game, I think, if you want to take away one thing that -- I mean, we were down
27 last week, and I think there's a lot of people that didn't give us a chance
in this game, and I got good -- not good, I got great character guys that
respond the right way to adversity. They respond to getting -- you knock them
down, they get up stronger, and that's kind of one of our things.  
  
So I think that's my biggest thing that I'm really, really pleased about is
that they took what we were trying to do. They went out on the floor and
executed and they played with passion and heart and togetherness and all the
things you want your team to be about. They looked great doing it. When you've
got a team that's this hungry to keep playing, that helps you and gets you
over the hump when the going gets tough because I knew that would be -- like I
said, I said it over and over again, I knew how good UNLV is playing, I know
it was home atmosphere, all those things that were going against you, you're
going to have to stand up to and get through.  
  
Q. San Diego State switched pretty much everything 1 through 5 against
you last time they played. How much have you seen that this year, and
obviously there 's counters to everything, but is it something that you can do
in 24 hours or is it really difficult when it's a switching situation?  
LEON RICE: You know, the switching to me is not the biggest part. The biggest
part is how good they're defending and how they defend -- at our place, they
defended without fouling so well. I mean, I don't know if I've seen one that
well.  
  
So the switching, it was -- I guess what I'm saying is it's a lot harder to
play against really, really good defenders everywhere you turn than the
scheme, and that's the most important thing, and that's the thing that they do
best is -- and that's no surprise. I mean, every year you play San Diego
State, there haven't been many I walked away and went, they're not very good
defensively. No, that's been the cornerstone of their whole program in the
Fisher era, and now Dutcher is the Fisher era, too, so it's not like it
changed.  
  
It's about their commitment to it, and it's about how good they are at it, all
those things that they're doing. It's never really about the scheme to me.

### [Sid Tomes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38867)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force, 60 - San Diego State, 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, get some thoughts on today's
game.  
  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Nobody brought my popcorn up today?  
  
THE MODERATOR: We had to hide it.  
  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Oh, okay. I mean, that was one heck of a game. I know from my
vantage point standing there on the sidelines and watching our team play and
the Aztecs, obviously it's Thursday and this is the first game of the
quarterfinals, but that seemed like a Saturday championship game the way the
two teams played and slugged at each other.  
  
A credit to them. They're a very talented and a team that can be playing in
the last weekend in March for it all. So proud of our team and our effort and
what we gave there today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. We'll start with questions for the student-
athletes, and then we'll let them go and keep coach a little bit.  
  
Q. For both of you, how much of what happened in the second half do you
think was -- San Diego State has done this the last four games, they lit up in
the first half, played very well in the second half. How much of it was that
and how much was just dead legs from having to play last night?  
SID TOMES: I think it was a combination. You know, credit to them. There is a
reason they're ranked so high in the country. They make big shots, especially
late, and that definitely doesn't help. They had a good turnout as well. It
was hard to hear in the second half.  
  
But, yeah, I think it was kind of a combination.  
  
Q. What do you think the key was in the first half that allowed you guys
to build the lead you had?  
SID TOMES: I think defensively we were just a step quicker in the first half
than the second half, and that allowed them to, in the second half, free up
and hit shots.  
  
Then they're a team once they get the momentum rolling it's kind of hard to
weather that storm against them. But credit to them.  
  
Q. And how much did the foul trouble play a factor, not only when Ryan
fouled out, but before that when they had to sit for long stretches, Ryan and
Lavelle?  
SID TOMES: Yeah, I don't want to get too much into that. That hurt us. That's
all I'll say.  
  
Q. For you guys, you 've been part of this class that's been such a big
part of Air Force basketball. What do you take away from your career, from
today, from the whole experience?  
CALEB MORRIS: I mean, you just got to take in every moment, you know, the
highs and the lows. That's what makes it enjoyable. You don't want anything to
be easy. Fought through a lot adversity not only this year, but just in our
whole careers, and it was fun. It was a good ride.  
  
Q. Sid?  
SID TOMES: He couldn't have said it better. You know, through it all, like
everybody wants to win the championship or whatever it is, but I know deep in
my heart like the relationships I made, you know, the experiences we've had,
the successes we've had, I'll never forget that.  
  
You know, people can say what they want, but I'm -- this senior class has
brought a different swag, man, just brought a different swag.  
  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Oh, they were different.  
  
SID TOMES: Little different edge, man. I'm getting emotional thinking about
it, but, you know, they're going to remember us.  
  
Q. You guys also had so many minutes. What do you think looking forward
for the program? I mean, the guys below you didn 't see the time you guys did
as younger players.  
CALEB MORRIS: I think they'll be fine honestly. They were battling with us
every day in practice making us better. Just because they didn't get the game
experience now, that's -- they'll be fine. Program is in good hands.  
  
SID TOMES: I would agree with that. We went hard at each other every single
day and they played against us every single day. We're Mountain West players,
and so they know, they see what it is, see what it takes. And there is a lot
of young talent on the team. There is a lot of young talent that I think is
going to surprise a lot of people.  
  
Q. Caleb, what 's it is like for you to play against San Diego State
having grown up in the area in the shadow of the school and seeing the
development of that program your whole life?  
CALEB MORRIS: It's definitely fun get to play the school that -- I mean, they
didn't recruit me, so always have a little chip on my shoulder coming out
against them.  
  
But, no, it's definitely cool, and happy for the state, for California, the
school and all that, and I wish them the best.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, so you played an awesome first half. You were
almost up by double digits. What was your confidence level heading into the
second half?  
SID TOMES: I would say very confident, but we knew that they were going to
make a run, so definitely wasn't cocky. But we were confident. I think we came
out the right way. We came out the half actually pretty strong. I know we got
a quick bucket inside and couple stops, so we were definitely prepared well.  
  
CALEB MORRIS: Yeah, like Sid said, we came out confident, just trying to
execute our game plan. But like he said earlier, there is a reason that
they're Top 5 in the country. They didn't fold.  
  
Q. What can you say about Lavelle Scottie. Amazing career here. From a
teammates ' perspective, what do you guys have to say about him?  
SID TOMES: Man, you couldn't write his story, man. He's a different dude. He's
different dude in a good way, though. I love that dude to death. I'd do
anything for him. He's a very hard worker. He's very humble. That's what a lot
people don't see. He's probably the most humble person I've ever met and he's
had a great career, yeah.  
  
Q. For both of guys, can you talk about aside from basketball what have
you learned in your career with coach, and what are you going to take away
from that moving forward?  
SID TOMES: Man, that's a big one, man. Biggest thing I think is just no matter
what, you got to continue to work. Like it doesn't matter what the product
necessarily is, I buy into the process now. I think the process is the biggest
part of all this.  
  
Whether you're doing good, bad, hurt, not, you just got to work every day and
believe.  
  
CALEB MORRIS: Yeah, for me, I think I'm a big believer in it's not what
happens to you it's how you respond to it. Just roll with the punches and just
keep fighting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We will dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank
you for coming down, men.  
  
Questions for Coach Pilipovich?  
  
Q. I know how much you wanted it for those guys. When you saw it was
there for the taking after the first half, I mean, does it make this one
tougher to take?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: You know, I mean, we were good today. We did some really good
things. As a coach, in your mind, okay, they're going to make that run.
They're going to -- because that's who they are.  
  
How can we weather that and delay it, maybe even postpone it? But we talk to
them about everything we got. We were on the floor, 50/50 balls, we're making
shots, we're matching, and we were there, even to the point where it got to a
6 point game under the four.  
  
And then they got on offensive rebound and score, and what a great game. The
effort from those guys. But I wouldn't have expected anything less. Just who
they are, how they've developed over the years because of what the Academy
does for them. Their toughness and togetherness, and I think we would've
shocked a lot people, right? It was good.  
  
Q. Is this class better than the record they 're going to leave
behind?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is no question. Like what they said
about Lavelle, Ryan. You know, Ryan got the fifth foul and it was a reach-in
foul, a reaction type play. He's in tears because he feels like he let his
teammates down, and he gave it everything.  
  
Ryan didn't play as a freshman. We held him out academically. He was around
the GPA I was when I was a freshman. I just remember his grandma and mom
sitting in my office, and I promised he would graduate an officer.  
  
And where he was that first semester, wasn't going to happen. I took
basketball away, and he came back that second semester and then look what he's
done. He's 1000 point scorer and he's going to graduate and be an officer.  
  
Lavelle, we all know where he's been.  
  
Caleb complained every day about the weather in Colorado Springs as opposed to
San Diego because it's too cold.  
  
Lesean Brown, unbelievable what he has given.  
  
And then Sid is kind of the ringleader. When they've be over at the house with
the guys, my wife would say, Just give him a few minutes and he'll stir the
pot, and then they go.  
  
So with that all being said, it's a great group. Yes, the record may not have
been what we would have liked obviously. But I told them and I mean this, and
San Diego State has an unbelievable program and a proud tradition and they do
everything the right way, and so happy for them.  
  
But I told our guys in the locker room, I won't trade locker rooms. I love our
guys.  
  
Q. What do you see moving forward for the players on your roster?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Good young players who work, and like they said, they battled
in practice. There was a lot of talk going on and they would challenge each
other. They grew a lot. They may not have had the game minutes, but they grew
with the experience and practice and competing against these guys.  
  
Q. And yourself?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Brent, I'm going to get the biggest cheeseburger in town and
the coldest drink and exhale.  
  
Q. Fair enough.  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Maybe a double cheeseburger.  
  
Q. There was a point in the first period where you guys were shooting at
73%. What was the key to get around this San Diego State defense?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: You know, we made some shots early, and when you do that,
especially with us, that basket becomes twice as big and it opens up a lot. We
were able to make shots and continue to do that.  
  
And then you know he's not probably going to continue that way, and we don't
want to live and die with it, but the first half was pretty emotional for us.
We were playing at a high pace. We made some shots. We got a few shops. They
had some guys in foul trouble, and it just fell into our lap a little bit.  
  
But we knew how good they are, that were going on have to be twice as good in
the last 20.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday Lavelle, he shot 50%, had 21 points; today 2 for 11,
only had the 6 points. Why do you think he struggled so much tonight?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Their defense. They're really good defensively, individually,
collectively as a unit. Their team defense, one of the best in the country and
they've always been that way. And I thought they took things away to him.
Maybe forced a few things he tried and didn't follow, didn't go.  
  
Our spacing wasn't great at times where we didn't help Lavelle. But it goes a
credit to what they did.  
  
Q. And Lavelle is going to go down is as Air Force legend. Can you see a
jersey retirement in the near future?  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Oh, gosh. You know, I just think we just need to, as all they
are, celebrate what they have done, but more importantly what they're going to
do for United States Air Force.  
  
Q. How hard is it to --  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Mark, I was going to ask you, we should have used a different
shot tracker ball for these guys, right? (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Not going to ask about shot tracker. Just ran into the CEO. How hard
is it to come back and play a game in less than 24 hours and logically
thinking it would catch up with you in the middle of the second half, and that
appeared to be when it did.  
DAVE PILIPOVICH: Now, if we had come back and played Thiel College where I
went, Division III school, it wouldn't have been that hard. But when you're
coming back and playing San Diego State, fifth ranked team in the country,
it's pretty damn hard.  
  
It is. The emotions you go through on the first day and you play and succeed,
and then just trying to keep them off our feet. We had a 6:00 shoot-around
time which we didn't take this morning.  
  
We tried to do a few things in the ball room last night and this morning, but,
yeah, it's hard. But anyway, if we wait two weeks and we wait two weeks and
play, they're really good. They're really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, thank you, coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [TJ Otzelberger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38873)

### [Bryce Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38874)

### [Marvin Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38875)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 67, UNLV - 61  
  
TJ OTZELBERGER: Hats off to Boise State. A lot of respect for Coach Rice,
their program. Their guys came in and were very ready for that game, and so
the credit goes to them.  
  
As far as our group, couldn't be more proud and honored to be the coach of
these young men. The work they put in every day and the fight that they had
even down to the finish there makes me really feel fortunate to be their
coach.  
  
Q. Not having Eli out there today, how much more difficult did that make
it as far as trying to run your offense?  
BRYCE HAMILTON: It was real difficult. You know, Eli is a huge spark for us.
We missed him today. We just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys struggled from the field. You struggled at the
free-throw line, as well. What would you attribute that to, more Boise State,
their tenacity on defense or you guys just weren 't making shots tonight?  
MARVIN COLEMAN: I think we didn't have too much focus like we usually do
towards the beginning of games. I don't think we were connected like we
usually are, and then down the stretch when we started looking in we got more
connected, but I think we were a little rattled at the beginning, just the
excitement, or I don't know what it was, but I think that's what it was.  
  
Q. Obviously not the end that you wanted, but overall, the season, how
would you view it?  
MARVIN COLEMAN: You know, we had a lot of ups and downs, and the ultimate goal
is you want to be playing your best basketball at the end of the season, and I
feel like we did that. You know, bigger than basketball, I feel like we came
together as a group. It's a new staff, new players, a lot of guys from last
year and this year, and I feel like it was an up-and-down year, but it was a
great year for us. We grew as young men. It's not the ending we wanted, but
I'm happy with what we did this year.  
  
Q. You guys are much better than your record shows and obviously you
finished the year on a great note, and of course you lost tonight, but how
much did that win against San Diego State catapult your confidence?  
BRYCE HAMILTON: You know, that was a great win for us. We showed everybody
that we could compete with the best. I still know to this day that we can
compete with the best. You know, we didn't get the ending we wanted today, but
I feel like our team was just good.  
  
Q. Bryce, being a sophomore and seeing how the Boise State game plan was
kind of to take you out of the game offensively, what do you think you learned
tonight that will help you in your junior and senior year?  
BRYCE HAMILTON: Just being patient with myself. Just try and read the defense
more, just try to play off two feet and just create for others.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played small most of the game. Williams from Boise
State had some key offensive rebounds late. When you 're playing small what
kind of adjustments can you guys make to keep the opposing team off the
offensive glass?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: There was two ways that we were defending them. One was a
situation where we were switching all of our screening activity and then put a
smaller guy on Williams. In that scenario, our guards, we've trusted them all
year long to block out, to be tough, to be physical and aggressive, and we
know that they can do that job. Sometimes the ball bounces one way or another.
Williams is also a high-motor tremendous offensive rebounder, so credit goes
to him, and sometimes things don't go the way you hope.  
  
Q. Marvin, you mentioned playing the best basketball at the end of the
year. May not feel like it now, but is there a confidence or an excitement
going into the off-season into next year, what this team can be going
forward?  
MARVIN COLEMAN: Obviously I'm confident in next year, but this is a bitter
taste in our mouths, so whatever happened this year is going to go out the
window and we're just going to work. We're going to work hard during the off-
season. We're going to stay in the gym. We're going to stay together, and
we're going to hope for a better year next year.  
  
Q. Bryce, obviously during tournament time you guys play all of your
games in this building, but everything else changes when it comes to the
Mountain West Tournament. Do you feel like you guys have a home-court
advantage when you 're here playing in games?  
BRYCE HAMILTON: Yeah, most definitely. We didn't see any change at all. We had
a good crowd come out today, and you know, nothing really much changed for us.
We just tried to go out there and just play our basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, in the one-game season scenario that the tournament presents,
what do you think this team needs to do better to advance in years to come?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: Our guys were really together at the end of the year. We were
playing not only our best basketball but playing as well as pretty much
anybody in the Mountain West come towards the end of the season.  
  
We caught an unfortunate break with one of our key members of our team who
wasn't able to play for us today. It's certainly not an excuse because all
year long we've had injuries and adversity, and we've bounced back from
whatever situation presented itself. At the same time, we'll continue to work
and get better as seasons move on and put ourselves in position to win and
have a tremendous amount of confidence when we do that that we'll be
successful.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on postseason play; would you accept an invite
to any postseason tournament? I know this is right after a loss, but can you
comment a little bit about that?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: We have a high standard for this program. We set out to play
against the best in the country, and we know that as we continue to improve,
we can compete against those folks.  
  
As far as postseason, right now it hasn't really been something we've talked
about. Just more still in this moment for our guys trying to be there for them
and who I can be as a coach to help them through this tough moment.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about what it meant to lose for this
game and this tournament and the magnitude, Eli not being there today?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: Boise State played tremendous. They did a great job. Do I wish
we had Eli? Of course I do. What impact it had on the game, hard to say.
Credit goes to them with the win.  
  
What I will say is how proud I am of Eli and what he's done for our team and
our program. Many times what young men do, their reward or the hard work that
they put in isn't showing until later. I'm confident as this program continues
to be on the rise that the impact Eli made and the confidence he brought to
our group, the character he showed, the determination and the heart will help
our young guys be better players, help our program be in a better place, and
help us be more successful. So I'm really grateful to him and fortunate to
have been his coach. Too bad he wasn't able to be out there today, and I can't
change that.  
  
Q. This being your first year with UNLV and the Mountain West, what did
you learn about the conference and about your team and what are you most
excited about moving forward to next season?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: Mountain West, the league, it's a class-act organization, from
people at the conference office to the other coaches, administrators and
players throughout the conference. A lot of respect for the hard work that
everyone puts in each and every day.  
  
As far as our team and where we're at moving forward, I'm excited to get
started on next season. I know our guys may not quite be ready for this and in
some ways maybe I'm not, but I want to start practice tomorrow. I love the
young men we have in our program. I'm excited about the future of this
program, and as much as I respect this conference and everybody and the hard
work they've put in, I also know the work that we put in and our guys put in,
and we believe in what we're going to do moving forward, so we're really
excited about our future.  
  
Q. Obviously there will be quite a number of changes to the roster, but
what carries over from this season to next season that will really benefit the
team?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: Our competitive spirit, our togetherness, the understanding
that if a group of young men come together and give everything they've on a
daily basis and take the work every day head on and give everything you have,
that you can change the outcome. You can change the way a team sees
themselves, and you can change a season. The guys that were fortunate in our
program to be part of this in the first year were able to see us have some
adversity, come back stronger, have some adversity, come back stronger.  
  
As the leader of this program, I want to win every game. Highly competitive,
and winning is really important. I also want to develop young men for their
life. What life is is getting knocked down and coming back stronger. Our guys
learned that lesson over and over this season, and I know they'll carry that
forward to be successful, in basketball, on the court, off the court,
classroom, community. We work on their those every day, and I know our guys
will do that.  
  
Q. With the big recruiting class coming in, moving forward long-term for
this program, what sort of skill set or abilities are you looking to improve
or to bring into the program? What do you need to get better at?  
TJ OTZELBERGER: We're looking for winners. We're looking for work capacity.
We're looking for character, guys that want to come every day and lay it on
the line. For me outside of my family, this is my second family, and this is
everything to me. And this opportunity I cherish with all my heart. So I have
to have guys in this program that are going to reflect that same degree of
passion that we have.  
  
Beyond that, there's some guys that shoot better, some guys are taller, some
guys run faster. All that stuff is important. The intangible qualities and the
character are really what's the most important to us. We'll continue to

### [Hunter Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38900)

### [Jake Hendricks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38843)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 75, Nevada - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Obviously, excited to be here in front of you guys after
tonight. Gutsy performance by our guys. Stayed the course even being down 10
in the second half, just stayed together and continued to chip away on the
defensive end of the floor and was proud of them of what they did in the sense
of sharing the basketball offensively. But gutsy performance by our guys and,
again, just excited to come away with the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions?  
  
Q. Jake, obviously maybe not the best shooting performance of your life
time, but you made some of the most timely baskets. Is that something your
coach gives you confidence in that even when maybe you 're missing a few shots
that you know your teammates behind you to make the shots when they count the
most.  
JAKE HENDRICKS: You said it. My team and my coaches, every time, if I'm
missing they all say, Keep shooting, keep shooting, and they always give me
confidence. And it also goes back to the all the practice. Every day in
practice we do shooting and it just gives you confidence when you shoot every
day.  
  
Q. I haven 't seen you guys play a lot this year, but at the end of the
game when they were shooting free throws you had all your guys back. Is that
something that you normally do? Is that a philosophy to maybe set up your
defense and not have anybody up there to rebound a miss?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Oh, I got Jeremy Shyatt on staff and we worked for his pop,
Larry Shyatt, and that's just always something we always just did. And they
just started doing it and I have no problem with it because I'm not so caught
up in trying to get offensive rebounds from free throws unless it's league
games scenario situation. But we have been doing that all year. Regardless of
it being early in the game or it being late in the game, we just, it's just
something we don't do. And it's not really something that was taught or like,
Hey, guys, get back. It's more, kind of happened.  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk a little bit about the journey you guys have been
on? You guys have had some really tough games where you 've come up just
short. All of a sudden now you're on a run, you're into the semi-finals. This
has to be a really great feeling for you.  
JAKE HENDRICKS: It's been a great time. Like you said, we have been in a lot
of close games this year. So it's given us, even though we lost, it's given us
confidence that we can play with everybody in the conference, even though
we're 2-16. We have had a lot of close games and we just didn't close them
out. We made a lot of mistakes. And I think down the stretch last night and
tonight we fixed those mistakes and it's just given us confidence that we can
beat anybody.  
  
Q. Hunter, you obviously missed seven games with mono this year. Do you
feel like you 're really starting to get your footing back in this game and
--  
HUNTER THOMPSON: I mean, it's definitely nice to have my shot fall and I mean,
cardio-wise I feel like I'm getting there, just getting a feel back for the
game. And I mean, I just got back cleared this past weekend, so I mean, it's
been a pretty quick turnaround, so it's definitely crazy.  
  
Q. Was that the biggest shot of your life?  
HUNTER THOMPSON: I mean, I don't know. That's, I guess that's up for you guys.  
  
Q. Marble, how do you hold, arguably, the best player, but the second
best player in the conference to 2-13 shooting and that type of performance?
What did you do to disturb him out there defensively.  
KWANE MARBLE II: Coach Edwards and the coaching staff drew up a good game plan
on the defensive end. We work on defense all the time in practice. We hang our
hat on the defensive end and we have all season. I just went out there and I
took pride in it and I stayed in front of him as much as I could.  
  
Q. Jake, can you talk a little bit about, your Cache Valley guy, you get
to play Utah State tomorrow night. Can you talk about what that means for you
to go up against them again?  
JAKE HENDRICKS: I know a lot of the guys, so it's going to be fun, it's going
to mean a lot. We just got to come out and work hard and follow the game plan
and just see what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe the regular season didn 't go exactly how you had
planned it, but this team has been obviously elevated to a whole new level
here in the Mountain West. Do you think your team is playing at a whole new
level or maybe like the game plan is just working out perfectly how you
planned it from the beginning of the season?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: I just think we're a little bit more seasoned. A great example
would be Kwane Marble. He didn't play as much early on in the season. And to
be honest with you, this is probably the healthiest we have been, just getting
Thompson back off of mono. So, you know, even throughout the year we had to
kind of put Band-Aids over scenarios and situations. And some of our younger
guys adjusted to playing at the college level. But Kwane, Greg Newton is a
first year player. He had a great game on the road at Air Force. Kenny Foster
has shown some brightness in his future as well. But Jake, Maldo, even
Thompson -- well, Jake and Banks are our only lone seniors. We have, again, 11
freshmen and sophomores and a lot of those guys play minutes. So again, what
I've talked to our guys about all year, it's still a process at the end of the
day and like Jake was saying earlier, we were in a lot of close games, it just
didn't work out our way. What I give these guys credit for is they didn't
pout, they didn't have a "woe me" attitude, the next day when we showed up to
practice they came with the right energy to get better. And I talked to those
guys all the time, even when you're going through some tough passages, the
best thing you can do is just keep going. You can't stop, you can't quit. And
that's a testament for life. Because I always tell our guys, basketball is a
direct correlation of life. The disciplines that you learn playing this sport,
if you carry on with them in your life, you're going to put yourself in
position to be successful. Whatever successful means to you.  
  
Q. Defense was a huge part of the win tonight for you guys. But
offensive timely baskets were also big. How much confidence does this give you
and your team going into the next matchup, given that like someone like
Maldonado goes 1-10 in the game yet you guys are still able to have a combined
effort and get it done on the offensive end?  
ALLEN EDWARDS: Well, again, like Kwane was saying, day one and even in the
summertime, our biggest thing was hanging our hats on the defensive end of the
floor. We understood that we were going to be young. We didn't know that we
were going to deal with injury and illness like we did throughout the season,
but you made the point about Maldonado, I think he was 1-8 in the first half
and he only took two shots in the second half. And that's probably a testament
to him, understanding that tonight wasn't his night, but he did a lot of other
things, he defended and rebounded. And that's kind of what we always talk
about. It may not be your night some nights, but how are you helping this team
when you're out on the floor. So to be able to put together a performance like
that and our leading scorer not being able to help, in a sense of point
production, but having him on the floor is still a very beneficial thing to
this program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, men, thank you for coming down. Appreciate your time.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
BRIAN DUTCHER: First of all, Dave Pilipovich is a very good coach and the
seniors from Air Force didn't want their season to end and they played like
it. They played with great grit and toughness like you knew they would. That's
the beauty of having a first-round bye. They had to play in a tough-playing
game and got off to a great start, but we were hoping our cumulative affect
defensively would wear them down some. And I think it did, because when they
were on fresh legs they were almost unguardable for us. I have a very
coachable team. I've already told them this. I told them I am tired of teams
shooting over 50 percent against us in the first half, so they let Air Force
shoot 60. So I want to -- they followed my instructions. They didn't shoot 50.
But we have been good in the second half most defensively all year, and today
was no exception. We held Air Force to 27 percent shooting in the second half.
We upped our intensity and we guarded the ball harder and found a way to get
out of here with a victory tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for the student athletes first.  
  
Q. For Yanni and -- or just all three of you guys, I guess. Jordan, for
you, you started off 1-5 from the field, end up scoring another -- end up with
17 in the game. What happened in the second half? And how were your teammates
able to find you?  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: Nothing different happened. Just had to keep shooting. My
teammates continued to find me and continued to believe in me, so I thank them
for that. But nothing really happened, just kept playing our game. The shots
just fell in the second half versus the first half where they didn't fall.  
  
Q. Malachi, during the second period you hit a three and the crowd
started chanting MVP. You 've obviously been in the spotlight for awhile. How
do you enjoy all of that but at the same time kind of like stay in focus and
in the game?  
MALACHI FLYNN: Yeah, I think during the game you're just trying to stay locked
in and then after you kind of just realize what happened. But we definitely
appreciate the fan support. I think they have been there all year, so it's
definitely been good for all of us.  
  
Q. Malachi, the coach talked about that stretch of teams shooting 50
percent or better in the first half. What do you attribute those slow starts
to? Is there any common thread in your mind that connects those first halfs?  
MALACHI FLYNN: Some of -- a lot of the shots were just good shots on their
part. I think we got to give credit where it's due. They made some tough
shots. And then the second half I think we just continued to guard and
eventually they started missing those. So it's hard to make all those shots
for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. For all three of you: It seems like in virtually every game in the
second half of the season you guys have gotten off to slow starts in the first
half. In the second half you guys kind of flip a switch. What goes on in the
locker room that makes you guys flip that switch?  
YANNI WETZELL: I mean, a lot of credit goes to Air Force today. They came out
and they made a ton of shots. I think they were shooting above 54 percent from
three in the first half. And I mean, we were contesting most of them. So a lot
of credit to them. But yeah, we came in the locker room at halftime and we
said, Hey, we need to pick this up. And that's our identity is defense and
rebounding. So we tried to get up in their stuff a little more and not give
them open shots.  
  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: Yeah, pretty much the same thing. We kind of pick up our
defense as the game goes along. We try to not feel out our opponent, but try
to give great effort at all times but sometimes it doesn't work out like that.
Teams may have scouted certain things that we do, but we try to pick up it up
as the game goes on. And I think guys see stuff on the bench, they tell us,
This is what they're doing this game. We continue to pick stuff up on the fly
and then the five guys that are out there on the court just continue to
execute, continue to get better as the game goes on.  
  
Q. Jordan, I want to touch more on on your shooting today. You started
off 0-3 beyond the arc. Hit five of your last seven. Can you talk about the
confidence that you need in order to keep shooting the ball even when you 're
missing early and the confidence that your teammates have and keep feeding you
the ball?  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: Yeah, you know, to be a shooter, to be a basketball player, in
general, at this level, you have to have extreme confidence in yourself. And I
think everyone on this team has extreme confidence. And then it helps when
everyone on the court is telling me to keep shooting. Malachi told me at one
point right after I had missed one, Just keep shooting. So that's just the
beauty of this team. Nobody gets down. And I think I give credit to my
teammates a lot for helping me out with that.  
  
Q. The fans were pretty vocal tonight and you guys have a pretty good
backing there. Can you talk about how comfortable it is when you have a fan
support like that, that comes out and makes it feel like a home environment?  
YANNI WETZELL: Yeah, the fan support's unreal. It's a five-hour drive or an
hour flight and you could tell today that a ton of the San Diego fans made it
out here. And their energy, it feels like Viejas, it's contagious. Once we get
a couple stops in a row or a bucket, we can hear them and it just pushes us
forward that much more. So a huge shout out to Aztec Nation and all the San
Diego fans for coming out here. Their support's been huge.  
  
Q. Yanni, you 've been talking all week about -- all your players have
-- about, We're not going to have a slow start. We're not going to let another
team get going. What's it going to take to change that? And going forward, how
dangerous is this kind of game for you as you get in the NCAA tournament and
start playing better and better opponents?  
YANNI WETZELL: Yeah. Like I said earlier, I think Air Force came out and they
made some tough shots. They had their run and they played like their season
was on the line. They were making difficult shots. We were in their face
still. But, yeah, I agree, we do definitely have to get off to a better start
and it's just a matter of turning up when the first whistle blows and not
waiting for the second half to come around. We're going it to talk about it
and we're going to come out and try and adjust it. But we also know that these
teams are playing for their season, so every game from here on out is going to
be a dog fight.  
  
Q. For all three of you: I know you don 't know yet who you're going to
play, but how badly do you want to play UNLV?  
MALACHI FLYNN: I don't think it matters. I think we're prepared for either
opponent. I just think that's how it goes. So we'll see who wins and after
that we'll prepare.  
  
JORDAN SCHAKEL: Yeah, I agree. Both teams, we have extreme respect for. It
will be a semi-final game, so I think we're just looking forward to moving on
to the next bracket.  
  
Q. Malachi, it seems like every week you 're getting nominated for a new
accolade. Obviously, you just won Defensive Player and Mountain West Player of
the Year. It seems like you play with no ego. How do you not let all this
media attention get to your head?  
MALACHI FLYNN: I think it's because of our team. I mean, we're winning games.
If we were .500 or not, like, at the position we're in, I wouldn't be getting
that. So I know it's a whole team award. It just has to go to one player
individually. And that's just who we are, who I am. I think we're all bought
into winning and that's what we're going to continue to do.  
  
Q. I know you 're focused on this season, but in a lot of mock drafts
now you're coming up as a first round pick. What does it feel like to finally
get that respect and the recognition?  
MALACHI FLYNN: I'm not worried about that at all, to be honest. I haven't seen
any of that, so I'm just worried about this Mountain West tournament and then
moving on forward after that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You made a point of saying, you even talked to the guys specifically
about the first half starts and the 50 percent shooting and they give up 60,
but what, I mean, I know you were joking a bit, but to a degree, this time of
the year on the calendar 's probably not the right time to have those kind of
trend lines. What do you identify there and what are you talking to them about
to try to find faster starts?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: Yeah, I try to make it a hot topic this game. I tried to say,
We got to get off to a better start. We got to be better. And obviously, I
didn't do a good enough job. But Air Force, like I said, credit to Air Force.
I mean, they were making step-back 3s. They were making hard shots and they
played a good brand of basketball. As bad as we want it, they want to be as
successful at the offensive end.  
  
So my focus is getting our mind wrapped around the fact that people are
getting off to a good start and we have to do better early in the game. And so
sometimes the message isn't rewarded, sometimes it is. But I thought we came
out focused and ready to play, just hat's off to Air Force for playing at the
level they played.  
  
Q. Yanni kind of started pretty hot, starting 4-4 from the field. He did
commit two fouls. How much of that attributed to the first half deficit? And
how were you adjust to him only playing 10 of 20 minutes in the first half?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: He got in foul trouble and so he was playing well offensively.
And it's game-to-game. It's like some teams choose not to double Yanni, and
when they don't double him, then he goes to work and he's able to score. If
they double him, he finds Jordan or Malachi or KJ. He kicks it out for 3s. So
he's dangerous at both levels. If they don't double, he can score. If they do
double, he can kick it out and get guys open shots. So he's a very good
offensive player. And we take some of a step back offensively. When he's not
in there, we don't have a low-post presence. But we bring Aguek in and we set
more ball screens and let him roll, and then Malachi found him on a couple
rolls and got him involved. So the way you play changes when Yanni's not in,
but we're still dangerous either way.  
  
Q. You guys switched almost everything right off the bat. They didn 't
get backdoor cuts, didn't get a lot of drives, but they were hitting threes.
What adjustment did you make at halftime? It looked like you weren't switching
some stuff.  
BRIAN DUTCHER: We didn't switch Walker the second half. We switched everybody
else, the way we did handoffs and ball screens. But we just left K.J. on
Walker and had him fight over and then try to give some help with the post. So
he was playing so well and he was shooting over our bigs on the switch,
shooting step backs. And those are shots you want guys to take, but he was
making them, so we decided we just leave K.J. on him and let him chase him
around and try to keep pressure. Then we brought Adam in. So we had two really
good defenders on him for that second half 20 minutes, and I thought they did
a good job of pressuring him. We picked up full court, where he had to bring
it up 94 feet instead of just running from the half court. Tried to tire him
out a little bit by picking him up full court and I thought we did a good job.  
  
Q. K.J. played about 35 minutes today, but he wasn 't as aggressive as
he usually is. Do you think that ankle is still really bothering him?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: You know, I don't think so. I mean, K.J. missed a couple early
shots and he realized other guys were hot and so he does what this team does.
Like, some nights it's not your night. And we have seen nights where K.J. hits
five, six 3s. But he missed a couple. He was guarding hard, so he was spending
a lot of energy at the defensive end. And then he did what good players do, he
moved the ball, he got his teammates involved. And our guys don't feel a need
to put up their numbers every night. The only number they care about is the
winning number and that's what we came away with again tonight.  
  
Q. Jordan actually ended up leading the team in scoring. In the first
half, as he said, he started pretty slow. What did you see in the second half
from Jordan?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: He just going to keep shooting. We want him to shoot. If he's
open he has to shoot. And shooting is confidence. So if he loses confidence
then even when he's supposed to take it he won't and he won't make it. So we
want him to shoot every open look he gets and if he goes 0-7 we want him to
take the 8th shot, because that's what he does, he's an elite-level shooter.  
  
Q. I know it 's out of your control who you play next, and the players
were politically correct today, but they have been saying all week they really
want UNLV. How do you approach a game like that if indeed that's who you play,
knowing that they're going to have a lot of energy? Do you try to rein that in
a little bit or do you just let them go and have at it?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: This is the time of year you let them play, you know. So we'll
set a game plan, no matter who we play, but obviously either game's going to
be a challenge. It's the semi-finals. So if we play UNLV, we'll be on their
home floor, they're playing as good as anybody in the conference right now, I
think they have won five in a row, and they're playing at an elite level.  
  
Boise is very good. Leon always has his team ready to play. And I'm just
excited to watch these two teams go at it and I'm glad we get to play one of
them tomorrow.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, does the competitor in you want another shot at
them?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I want to play whatever team I think we can win. So if -- UNLV,
obviously, presents great challenge because they're on their home floor, they
sleep in their own beds and it's, not to take anything away from Boise, but
nobody wants to play a road game in a conference tournament. So if we play
UNLV we'll be basically playing a road game in our conference tournament. So
that is always a challenge.  
  
Q. Do you notice anything different about the collective mental makeup
of the team right now and these recent games as opposed to when there was so
much of that swagger in the Vegas tournament earlier with Creighton and Iowa
and that level of opponent. Is this team different mentally at all lately
recently?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: No, they don't get rattled, they don't overreact, they don't
worry about the score in the first half. They just go make a few adjustments,
go out and just play with great confidence. And that's what winning teams do,
they earn their confidence because they win games, but once you start gaining
that confidence you don't think you're ever going to lose. So obviously this
team doesn't think it's going to lose a game. Which is a good thing. So, but
the good news is they don't go out there and just take anything for granted,
they don't play hero ball, they don't come up and just cast shots up. They
play the right way. And again, we had 17 assists, Malachi has a unique ability
to know when it's time to get big baskets, but at the same time he gets all
his teammates involved. So that's an incredible skill to have and pretty rare
for a guy that leads you in scoring.  
  
Q. Adam Seiko has been a key role player all year. A lot of what he does
does not show up in the box score, but he still is an integral part to this
team. What you can you say about him?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: He guards at an elite level and at halftime he makes great
suggestions defensively, because he's a defensive specialist. Now he makes
open threes, they don't want to leave him open, but he came in and he said, We
got to be tighter on him on the wing, don't worry about the back cut, get up
closer on the wing so when they come for the hand off we can push them over.
And he makes great suggestions. So, like I said, the best thing about this
team is its chemistry and it's IQ. So it's not always the coaches that come up
with suggestions, the players see what's going on on the floor and they're
smart and they bring great advice to not only timeouts but to halftime
adjustments.  
  
Q. And Adam has been a winner for years now obviously he played at
Sierra Canyon, played in a lot of big championship games. How much more
confidence does that give you in him knowing his past and what he 's been
through on the basketball court?  
BRIAN DUTCHER: I have confidence in veteran players and Adam's third year in
the program. And we have a lot of third-year, fourth-year and fifth-year
players in our program. And you look up and there are no sophomores or
freshmen playing for the Aztecs and that's not to say that players like Keshad
Johnson aren't going to be outstanding players. But this is a junior and
senior and fifth-year senior laden team and that helps win.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Lindsey Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38901)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 75, Nevada - 80  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
STEVE ALFORD: Yeah, Wyoming just very deserving. I thought they got us in just
about every phase. They out-rebounded us, they took care of the ball better,
they got better shots, they were better defensively tonight. I thought they
were the tougher team tonight and that's kind of what happens in tournament
play. I thought it was a little fools' gold in the first half. I didn't like
how the first half went either. But we got us a 10-point lead. We defended
fairly well in the first half. And then we didn't defend very well in the
second half and we couldn't make a shot in the second half. Just a lot of
uncharacteristic -- I think we had maybe five left-handed shots that weren't
shot by Kane. Kane's the only lefty on my team. So we just, uncharacteristic
on the shots that we took and got, and a lot of credit goes to Wyoming's
defense. They did a great job of defending. And I do, I think in that
40-minute game they were the tougher team and they deserved that win. They did
a lot of good things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Lindsey, so at the end of the game when you guys were down by three
you made the smart play and you went for the easy two. Looking back at it do
you wish you went for the three?  
LINDSEY DREW: Not necessarily. There was only a couple seconds left, so I
figured just to stretch out the game as long as possible and we did get a good
look at the end.  
  
Q. Obviously, you 're the only player out here right now. Were the other
players, like Jazz or Jalen or other key players, are they just in a terrible
mood? Is that why they didn't come out right now?  
LINDSEY DREW: Honestly, I don't know.  
  
STEVE ALFORD: I'm the one that brought him. You want me to bring the whole
team out here?  
  
Q. Just a few. I mean --  
STEVE ALFORD: No, no. I decide who comes and I said Lindsey Drew came.  
  
Q. Okay. Just wondering what you 're feeling right now knowing that you
had that one in your hands and it just kind of slipped away.  
LINDSEY DREW: Definitely, definitely hurts a lot. Definitely one of the
toughest losses obviously because it's the end of my career here. So I know
it's -- I'm going to go home and think about it, and it's just going to hurt
more, so it is what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Jalen struggled a little bit tonight. Did you feel
like just one of those nights where his shot just wasn 't going down or did
you feel like maybe he was kind of forcing things a little bit?  
STEVE ALFORD: That's hard. We'll have to look at the film and see everything.
But I thought Marble did a great job. I thought he did a really good job of
defending him. This has been, I think, at least for us, it's been a hard team
for to us score on all year. We have had two games with them that were one
possession and here's another one that was one possession and a third one went
their way. Jalen's been terrific for us all year and it was just a game where
he did a great job of getting to the line, he assisted well, he rebounded
well, he did a lot of other things, but I thought Marble did a lot of good
things to him just to try to make things difficult on him.  
  
Q. Can you run us through the last 20 seconds of the game, the two
missed free throws, and then you get the turnover, obviously, which is great,
and you had the timeout. In that timeout did you guys say that you were going
to go for a quick shot and then settle down defensively after you take the
lead or was it to take the last-second shot?  
STEVE ALFORD: Yeah, I think -- so much happened in that time, I can't
remember. What were we down? Yeah, we were down one, so we just wanted to get
a good shot and get a score, so it wasn't necessarily a two or a three. Could
have got fouled as well, so we just wanted to do the best we could in that
possession of just trying to get the lead. And I'll have to look back. I
thought we got a couple good looks late and we just didn't make them. It seems
like we got a couple good attempts up in that last 20 seconds and didn't make
them. But we got the steal that we needed. We got a big three that we needed
to get it to one. Now, you just got to score from that possession. But we were
not holding it for one. We wanted the best available shot we could get inside
that 20 seconds we were trying to get.  
  
Q. Lindsey, you had the foul trouble there early in the second half. You
had to come out of the game. What type of impact did you think that had on
your squad as far as keeping up the momentum and sticking with this team?  
LINDSEY DREW: Yeah, just kind of threw my momentum off a little bit. But,
yeah, especially, you know, I played 30 minutes, so that first half didn't
really feel I could get as many rhythm. Obviously wanted to stay in the game
and play as much, but just due to the fouls I had to come out. They made the
calls. It is what it is.  
  
Q. I know you can 't really say, what if? But I got to ask: If Jalen
Harris didn't foul out, I mean, what, how much did that hurt you guys?  
STEVE ALFORD: Yeah, that's hard. I have no idea. I think he fouled out with
two and a half minutes to go. And obviously, he's a big big part of what we
are and who we have been all year, so that was tough. But again, I go back to
Marble more than anything else. I just thought Marble, we couldn't guard
Marble. He had 24 points and he drew eight fouls. I just thought he was the
key to the game. I thought for this 40 minutes Marble was the best player on
the floor tonight and that's a lot of credit to him. Sometimes you just got to
take your hat off to a player that does that. So he drew a lot of fouls, he
was a handful for us, but obviously, we would have liked to have had Jalen on
court but that's basketball. You only get five and the fouling out, then you
just got to make adjustments and go with somebody else.  
  
Q. To follow up on Jalen, he had one of the greatest seasons in Mountain
West history. He did not win Player of the Year. How much did that affect him
and what was his mindset after he heard he didn 't get it?  
STEVE ALFORD: I don't think that affected him. Malachi Flynn, they lost one
game all year, so Malachi Flynn's very deserving of Player of the Year. Jalen
had a fantastic year and he got honored by being First Team and he was honored
by Newcomer of the Year. So it was great honors for him to be First Team All
Mountain. And then to be Newcomer of the Year in this league, that's a great
year. I think all year Malachi and he were 1A, 1B all year. But when somebody
goes like 29-1, and you win the league two weeks early by five games, I mean,
that's a hard one to compete against. Malachi Flynn's very deserving.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you for coming down.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Paul Weir](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33103)

### [Makuach Maluach](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36722)

### [Vance Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32187)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 79, San Jose State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
  
COACH WEIR: I would just say that the margin, based on our turnovers, is
pretty impressive on our part to win a game by 13 with 21 turnovers. And to
lose the points off turnovers by 14 points and still win by 13 says a lot
about our defense and a lot about actually our offense outside of those
turnovers.  
  
So we've got to find a way to clean up heading into tomorrow. It's one of the
things that we stress quite a bit. It's probably the most disappointing thing
of tonight, but outside of that, like I told them before the game, we just
have to win by one -- survive and advance. It's not about all the numbers;
it's about getting to tomorrow. And right now we're getting to tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Vance, I talked to you before the game and asked if you liked the
nickname Vegas Vance. After the game, I 'll ask you again: What is it about
March and coming to Vegas to this tournament that's made your last three games
here in March just unlike the rest of your season?  
VANCE JACKSON: I don't want to lose. I don't like losing. I feel at this point
our back is against the wall as a team, and we want to just keep moving
forward and we've got a big one tomorrow against Utah State. And I do like
that name.  
  
Q. Makuach, you had a great start. They had that 8-4 lead, and I thought
your energy offensively and defensively and I thought there was a period in
the late first half you had a tip-in that slowed one of their roles. Your
thoughts on your role because I thought you had some big plays both sides of
the floor in pretty key moments?  
MAKUACH MALUACH: I wanted to come in with energy and just play hard and play
defense and rebound. I felt like I did that. People might say he scored all
the points, but came off the back of the defense that our team came in with.  
  
Q. Vance, you were getting the fans fired up and excited. How nice is it
when you have a crowd and a fan base that can travel and support you guys the
way they did today?  
VANCE JACKSON: It feels amazing. We have the best fans; it's like a home court
game for us. I think they call it the Pit West. It feels good. Just staying
positive and just keep going. They like winning, and they like shows. So,
we're going to do that for them.  
  
Q. Vance, at one point you had, I believe, 14 consecutive points for
your team. Can you sort of talk how that was going and how you felt in that
rhythm?  
VANCE JACKSON: Basically just making -- knocking down the shots. I feel like
everybody, like, believed in me and I just let it fly and it just went in.
That's really about it.  
  
Q. Vance, winning that game against Utah State, end of the regular
season, how important was that coming into this tournament, especially now you
're face them tomorrow?  
VANCE JACKSON: I feel like it was big. It gave us, like, a lot of confidence,
you know what I'm saying? A lot of momentum. And we know we're capable of
competing with anybody in our conference. I feel like that win was big.  
  
But then again, we've got to forgot about it and move on to the next. And we
face them tomorrow. I have a bitter taste. I'm pretty sure Makuach has a
bitter taste and some of our teammates from last year. So, hopefully we just
lock in on a game plan, you know what I'm saying? Cut the turnovers, so Coach
can be happy and get the dub.  
  
Q. Vance, since you have that nickname, does it feel different for you
to play postseason versus just the regular season? Like do you thrive under
pressure or what 's going on there?  
VANCE JACKSON: No, it's just a game, at the end of the day. And also I don't
want to lose. We don't want to lose, you know what I'm saying? If we lose our
season is over. So, I'm just trying to do whatever it takes -- rebounding, you
know what I'm saying -- playing defense and helping us win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Paul, obviously you saw what Vance did in his two games last year.
Did it again this year. And I know that you 've been asked about Vance all
season long, when he was having good games or bad games, is this the
breakthrough game? Is that the breakthrough game? What's going on with Vance?
And then he comes here and does it again. What is it about this week, this
setting that you think Vance breaks through and shines like he did last
year?  
COACH WEIR: Yeah, he's shooting the ball well. We kind of have these
competitions how many 3-pointers you can make in a row and different things.
And before we left, he won. I think he had 15, 16 in a row at one point. And
today during shoot-around he was up to 14 in a row. He's in a groove, shooting
the ball well.  
  
I thought he was there before he got hurt. I thought he was in a nice stretch
there, and was maybe going to be able to carry it into a really good
conference season. But the injuries set him back, set us back. But now he's
back and hopefully we'll continue to be able to shoot the ball the rest of the
way.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges of not only turning around and
playing again the next day, but playing a Utah State team that you just beat a
few days ago? What are some of the differences and different challenges that
you expect out of this team compared to when you beat them down at The Pit?  
COACH WEIR: Obviously they've had a lot of time to prepare. We haven't. All
we've spent time on preparing for was San Jose State. I'm assuming they've
obviously been kind of working towards this a little bit. So they might have
an advantage that way, but that's why they have the higher seed and they
earned that right.  
  
We have to now get back to the hotel and get back to it and put the best game
plan we can to try and give ourselves the best chance to win.  
  
Q. Before the Utah State game, did you sense your team was finally
starting to figure some things out going into that game?  
COACH WEIR: Gosh, if I had to say -- I thought we played well at Air Force. We
didn't win. But I thought we did some really good things. Had a chance to win.
And we've been practicing really well. We have one game all year, actually
thought it was at home against UNLV.  
  
And I thought our home game against UNLV was the one time I got a little
nervous. I said it after the game, I was worried that maybe all this losing
and all this stuff that had happened had gotten to us because we just didn't
have a lot of pop that game.  
  
But since then I've been watching it and kind of coaching as much optimism and
positive energy as I can and we've been good. Like, we've been practicing
well. We've been preparing well. We've been engaged. And even though we hadn't
really broke through, I still liked where our team was at. Even down 14
against Utah State, I still liked where we were at.  
  
I'm glad we're winning now. I'm glad the shots are going in and people think
we've turned the corner, but I never really felt like we were that far out to
begin with.  
  
Q. They do come out the second half, 7-0 run, and I want to walk you
through that moment. Did you have any of those moments in the timeout or on
the bench that we 've asked you about throughout the last month, really, those
tense moments, was it kind of a "here they come; what's going to happen" this
type of thing? Or was it calm, like you said other timeouts have been? And I
wanted to follow up, Vance, after their 7-0 run, scores 14 minutes in four
minutes, how much, when he gets hot like that, are you opening things up for
him or is just his shots are falling and that's all it is?  
COACH WEIR: Good point. I don't know what to do with that starting five. I
told them that many times. They did not start the first half well or the
second half. We bring in Kurt (indiscernible) and the game changes both
halves.  
  
I challenged those guys at halftime and said you guys are backing me into a
spot here; you're our oldest, most experienced guys, but they're not a good
group together. When Vance started making those shots is when Kurt subbed in
the game. And Kurt, both times he subbed in, was very impactful for he was
plus 22 tonight.  
  
So he helps. He brings defensive energy. He's a ball mover on offense. He's
just going out trying to make the right play. And we need more guys like that
sometimes in that lineup.  
  
As far as Vance goes, I think some of it is the flow of the game. And
obviously it's when he's making shots. The reality is at the beginning of the
year his shooting percentages were so low he didn't have a lot of driving
opportunities. He was just kind of dared into shooting.  
  
Now that he's making shots, it's opening up the ability for him to get to the
basket again. I think it's a combination of both. The guys start looking for
him because they know he's feeling it, but also he's a good basketball player
right now. And good basketball players make good plays.  
  
Q. During the first three minutes of that second period you guys didn 't
have any points but you had five turnovers. Was it something specific San Jose
State did?  
COACH WEIR: Again, I think that lineup -- I don't know. I gotta keep figuring
it out, how to get who I think are our five best players as a group are not
great starting either halves. They obviously didn't start the Utah State game.
I went back to them here today and I talked to them about it and maybe I'm
talking about it too much, because that group itself just has got to give us
more. That's the reality of it.  
  
I'm hopeful that if I do stick with it that they're going to find a way to
figure it out and play good basketball together at both ends of the court,
because you're right, it's not good enough.  
  
Q. Knowing that you guys are hot and you just played in Utah State, just
sitting and waiting on you guys, do you think that benefits you guys or
benefits them moving into this game tomorrow?  
COACH WEIR: You know, we'll probably know tomorrow after the game is the best
time to answer it. Obviously they've earned the right. They got the bye. They
had a great regular season. We didn't. So whatever advantages they get out of
it, they earn those. Whatever disadvantages we've inherited here, we have to
work through those and just give ourselves the best chance we can to win.  
  
The game time is good. We've got a little bit of time. We've got 24 hours now
to get ready for the game tomorrow night and just give it every single thing
we have to try and pull out a victory.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Jean Prioleau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34837)

### [Omari Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38839)

### [Seneca Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36732)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 79, San Jose State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State.  
  
COACH PRIOLEAU: First of all, I'd like to say hats off to Coach Weir and New
Mexico. They played really well tonight. They sped us up a little bit. They
went on like a 23-0 run. So hats off to them. And Vance Jackson played really
well.  
  
I thought we started out the game really well. We forced them into 21
turnovers, which I thought was outstanding. We didn't shoot the ball
relatively well, especially during that run. But I thought our guys competed.
I mean, I thought our team has competed all year long.  
  
And I'm playing a lot of freshmen and sophomores, so I'm really excited about
the future of San Jose State basketball. I thought we've taken some big steps
forward and the next step is to try to win the conference tournament game, for
sure.  
  
Q. Seneca, you made a big jump from your freshman year to this year.
What 's next for you?  
SENECA KNIGHT: Same thing, keep working day in, day out. The compliments I got
this year, they were kind of exciting. But at the same time that's in the
past. Just get stronger for next year, work on my IQ and work on handle, jump
shooting, just keep grinding.  
  
Q. For either of the players, obviously you guys watch films on all of
these teams. This Lobo team, from covering them and a lot of people around the
league know, has been two different teams. I 'm curious what you saw when
you're watching film, when it's working for them like it was tonight what
they're doing and maybe when they're struggling if you saw something
different.  
SENECA KNIGHT: I would say for them it just looks like they kept playing
throughout the whole game. If they struggled they still played hard. I know
you know they are a physical team. They try to pressure the ball and
everything. I think they just stick to their principles and that helped them
out. So they worked on consistency.  
  
Q. Seneca, aside from your personal game what do you do with your
overall team aspect moving into next season to wipe away what happened here
and start fresh?  
SENECA KNIGHT: Like Coach said, we're a young team, a lot of sophomores and
freshmen. Just encouraging them especially the freshmen, an then the next
year, incoming freshmen, knowing that we've been in that position as freshmen
last year. And just tell them to grind, don't get too high or too low. Stay
level headed and just keep working.  
  
Q. Omari, with Brae Ivey graduating that opens up a guard spot to be
filled in. Where do you think you could take your game to fill that spot that
's being vacated by Brae Ivey?  
OMARI MOORE: I feel like Brae was big for us this year. He taught me
personally a lot of things. He did a lot of things for the team. Stepping up
for him isn't going to be easy. But I definitely think over the next spring
and summer I can take my game to the next level, similar to how Seneca did
last year and I think I'll be able to try to fill his shoes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. During that 21-0 run in the first half was that more them? Was that
you missing shots? When you look back at that, is that what they did or what
you did?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Yeah, so if you guys didn't hear what he asked he said the 23-
or 21-0 run, was it more them or us. It was a little bit of both. I think we
missed some shots. I think we might have turned it over during that time. We
had 16 turnovers for the whole game, so I'm sure we turned it over a couple of
times in that moment.  
  
But missed shots and then them in to transition probably had something to do
with that. I tried to call timeout. Tried to switch up our defense a little
bit. But we just weren't able to capitalize on anything. And that's what
happened.  
  
Q. I 'm trying to figure out, as a lot of people in Albuquerque are the
good Lobos and the bad Lobos, they had their ups and downs this year. What
makes them so dangerous this time of year when they're playing well, like
Saturday, like much of tonight, as opposed to some of the struggles they were
having? Is it just a personnel matter, where they didn't have some players, or
was it something else when you're watching film?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: No, I think it's probably personnel. They've had guys in and
out. Coach Weir hasn't had his full allotment the whole year.  
  
When we first played them I think they were 15-2 or maybe 15-3. So I mean
that's high-level playing. So, I mean they're a very dangerous team. They have
a lot of talent. And I think Coach Weir's done a great job of keeping those
guys kind of focused. And they're in the moment right now when it's in March
when anything can happen. I think they're a very dangerous team. I think they
have a lot of talent.  
  
Q. Can you detail some of the improvements you saw from this year
compared to last year?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Improvements this year as opposed to last year. Well, we have
seven wins this year as opposed to four wins last year. I think our team is
competing a lot more this year. We defended the 3 a lot better this year. As
of a week ago I think we had, like, 300 less 3s taken against us or 30 or
something like that, some crazy, astronomical number. So obviously we tried to
defend the 3. I don't know about the percentages on that, but I thought we did
a pretty good job there.  
  
I think this year's team had a lot more fight in it than last year's team. I
think we were in a lot of games. We actually had the league champion, we had
them beat on their floor. I don't think last year's team would have been able
to do that.  
  
So I think we have a lot of positives. And I think this team has a lot of
young guys, freshmen and sophomores, that are playing. Last year we didn't.  
  
We have a freshman who was just sitting here who has had the best freshman
year that I've ever coached. Sky's the limit for Spartan basketball and our
athletic program.  
  
And to think outside of the box here and not just about men's basketball, I
mean our women's basketball team was phenomenal this year. Coach Craighead is
an unbelievable coach. He had 19 wins this year. Our football program is
moving. Our basketball program is moving.  
  
Marie Tuite is doing an unbelievable job moving our athletics program forward.
Our president, President Papazian, is right there step in step with us.  
  
So I know for many people, many people that might not be in the inner circle,
they may not see a fast shift in the progression of San Jose State, but I
think it's moving in the right direction. And we're doing it the right way,
more importantly. So sky's the limit for us, I think.  
  
Q. You guys came out in the second half 7-0 run, cut it to single
digits. And then Vance Jackson scores 14 points in four minutes and nine
seconds. He did it last year when he scored 25 and 25.  
COACH PRIOLEAU: I watched it.  
  
Q. What happened with Vance Jackson? They call him Vegas Vance in
Albuquerque. I 'm curious what you see in him as an opposing coach?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Vegas Vance? I like that. I don't think it's so much Vance
Jackson. I just think when you're playing at this level, when it's late in
March, there's probably someone that will probably step up and have a moment.
It could be two, three, five, seven, 10 minutes of a moment that can carry a
team. And it just happened to be Vance Jackson.  
  
We have guys on our team that have done it in spurts during the year. So I
just think when you're late in the season like this you're playing against
people and they can get hot at any time. And that's what happens when you're
playing tournament basketball.  
  
Q. During the season, since you have a young team, is it harder to coach
a team like that that doesn 't have that many seniors to lead, that have been
through it? And what do you do moving forward with the young guys that you
have? And who are you most excited about?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: I'm excited about what you just explained. No, we don't have a
lot of seniors or upper classmen that are playing -- we had one, which is our
captain, Brae Ivey, who did an unbelievable job for us this year.  
  
But what happens in these moments is that we have freshmen and sophomores that
are logging in a lot of minutes. So they're learning this experience.  
  
And as we continue to go, because we have a lot of, like, true freshmen, true
sophomores; we don't have a lot of guys that have transferred in. So when we
have that, those guys are learning and experienced. And hopefully going into
next year they'll be ready to go for next year, and then even the year after
that because we're playing freshmen and sophomores. Hopefully Seneca and Omari
are up here next year with another guy.  
  
So I think the future's bright for us. We're competing and we're going to
continue to get better.  
  
Q. For the next couple of weeks obviously Las Vegas is the epicenter of
basketball, for college basketball. Your general thoughts in getting an
opportunity to bring your team here to Las Vegas and play here in this
tournament?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: I don't think it's so much about Las Vegas. I mean, yeah, it's
being in the Mountain West Conference. And we play against top-level
competition. The teams are really good in this league. This conference
tournament just happens to be in Vegas, which is obviously a great town, great
city. There are a lot of other conferences that come play their conference
tournaments as well.  
  
I think postseason is an opportunity to show all your improvements and
hopefully get hot and have magical moments. That's what March is all about.
And our guys are taking all of that in. And hopefully we'll be ready to do
that next year.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [A.J. Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38837)

### [Lavelle Scottie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34821)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 77, Fresno State - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force.  
  
COACH PILIPOVICH: For an opening-round game, that was a heck of a game, I
believe. That was two teams that put it all on the floor and played and had
fun and, wow, I thought it was pretty good.  
  
The woman in the hallway, and you have great people who run the event, work
the event, and one of the volunteers in the hallway said, How do you feel? I
said, A lot better than I did 40 minutes ago.  
  
But what a great effort by our team. I thought the grit and determination and
the character -- and then I thought our seniors really, at the end --
Lavelle's putback off of two missed free throws for a score, a score inside --
Ryan Swan, our coaching staff jumped up when he turned, spun and shot it, and
they said some things I can't say right now. But when it went in, they were
the first four to jump up and cheer. And what a shot.  
  
And A.J. was just consistent throughout the game. And credit to Fresno State.
New Williams, wow. How many shots did he make? How good was he and their team
and their preparation? And Coach Hutson does a great job. And this time of
year it's hard because someone leaves and doesn't play again. And just all the
credit to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your defensive efforts tonight? Being able to
get eight steals, creating 15 turnovers and also making the most of that with
getting 14 points off of those turnovers.  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: Yes. I think the defensive effort came from just high energy,
leaving it all on the floor, us just playing for each other. We did a great
job focusing in on our defensive report. And that led to us giving it our all
on the defensive end.  
  
A.J. WALKER: Yeah, the activity on the defensive end really helped us, just
having fun out there. When we're getting steals, getting out on the run it was
like we were playing in high school. It was fun.  
  
Q. A.J., 5-of-7 from the 3-throw line. Can you tell us why you were so
hot tonight?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Coaching.  
  
A.J. WALKER: Yes, sir, coaching, practicing in the gym after practice. Before
practice, getting shots up. Tonight it was just falling, so it felt good.  
  
Q. What was the key to beating the press so consistently? I think you
had maybe one turnover and faced that the whole game?  
A.J. WALKER: Just patience and my teammates finding the right spots, helping
me out, good spacing. When they were open I got to them and they helped me
attack the press better.  
  
Q. Seemed like the key was every time Fresno would start to go on a run,
you guys would find an answer. Can you kind of explain the mindset that led to
that?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: The whole mindset going into that is let's get a stop, let's
get a stop, keep preaching to each other, we're good. Just because they go on
that run don't mean we have to let them keep going on the run, right?  
  
We were just talking with each other, communicating with each other, just
being very intense and just, like I said, leaving it all out there, and
focusing in, just helping over when we need to help over, taking charges when
we needed to take charges. When they went on their run, we made it an emphasis
to get a stop for us.  
  
Q. What did you think of Ryan Swan 's bucket, the turnaround jumper,
whatever you want to call it?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: I loved it. At certain times in games you've got to take big
shots. It was a big shot. I'm glad he took it.  
  
Q. Lavelle, talking about the scoring mark, you passed the two big guys.
Now you 're 10 points short of No. 3 all time. Having done it, what's it
mean?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: It just shows my hard work and dedication for this game. I
love this game. Without my teammates I wouldn't have got here. I want to
emphasize that. And I thank them because they helped me on my journey to get
where I am today. Ten points shy, I'm not worried about it. I'm ready to go
out and win the next game, prepare for that.  
  
Q. Speaking of the next game, what are your thoughts on San Diego
State?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: Well, they're a good team. They're definitely a good team.
But like I've told you this before, they put their shoes on like we put our
shoes on. If we keep that focus and intensity and effort that we had tonight
and learn from our mistakes, you never know. Anything could happen tomorrow.  
  
Q. Going back into this game, could you talk about how you guys were
able to really get inside and score a lot of points in the paint, and also
just taking that away really from Fresno?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: I think we talked about moving the ball around a lot, getting
the zone to move. Once we got the zone to move, the holes would start to open
up and we would flash in the high post and look opposite, kick opposite, stuff
like that.  
  
We kept moving the ball, setting screens for the top, allowing us to penetrate
the zone. And you saw some of those dump balls, some of those skip outs for
3s, things like that.  
  
Q. A.J., what do you remember from the last meeting with San Diego State
about a month ago?  
A.J. WALKER: The energy that we brought to the game. They went on their run,
we had our run. It's a game of runs. If we stay together, stay poised, I think
that will help us in this next game against them.  
  
Q. Lavelle, you guys were up 14-6 to start the game, you had seven of
those points. What did you tell yourself to get yourself off to such a hot
start today?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: I think it was just the preparation, just going in and
staying focused, not worrying if I missed a shot, not thinking about it --
just on to the next play. And having that on-to-the-next-play mentality
allowed me to keep going and have the start that I did. Once again, I wouldn't
have those seven points if my teammates wasn't hitting me when they should
have.  
  
Q. Do you think it helped to be able to play the first game right away
where -- I 've heard from some other teams they say it's kind of dragging
along that they have to play the night game and waiting around in the hotel?
What are your thoughts on that?  
A.J. WALKER: For sure, it does help, get the feel of the gym. I mean, that's
really the big thing, just being able to play together on the court here, so
we can carry on the energy that we had today, it will help us a lot.  
  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: For us, we're used to getting up really early. This is an
advantage to us. I don't know if other teams are used to getting up this early
and playing at 12:00. So it's in our favor, I guess.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Just looking at those two teams on the court size-wise, there 's not
a lot of comparison.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You noticed that too?  
  
Q. Outscored them 30-to-10 in the paint.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: But that's the way we are with most of the teams in this
league. We're a little bit shorter and smaller. But I thought our preparation,
as they said, we tried to attack inside/out. We try to move the ball quick. At
times we stuck it a little bit that we like to move it a little bit quicker.  
  
But we were able to get the ball side to side, get it inside. And you know,
you've seen us play more than I have probably, but when we make some shots
early, we're okay. And we made some shots early and our confidence built on
that. And we were able to play off that.  
  
And I thought defensively and taking care of the ball was really good today.
Only had eight turnovers. They had 15. And for us to outrebound them by two --
I should have brought my glasses -- Nate Grimes is so talented. He's a double-
double and a local Las Vegas man. He's represented himself and this program so
well through the years, in the Mountain West -- and New Williams.  
  
They beat us twice this year. I thought we played really effective at home. A
lot to do with them. When we were out there, we were able to manage the game
in the first half, took the lead in the second. And they were able to come
back and beat us.  
  
You're playing a team that's beat you twice. But we spent a lot of time
watching tape -- where were we wrong; what could we have done different; what
could we have tweaked? And we put those things mixed it up and when the horn
blew today we were a plus-7 which is pretty neat.  
  
Q. When you get this A.J. Walker, what does it mean to --  
COACH PILIPOVICH: I like this A.J. Walker. He's very talented with the ball.
He can create and score for himself, but he can also create and score for
others. A.J. is just an unbelievable young man. If there's any negative that I
would say about A.J., I'd like him to be a little more selfish sometimes. And
that's just from a basketball standpoint, to do some things.  
  
But he's such a good teammate. And that's a character to his family and how
they've raised him and where he's at. He's talented. He's quick. He can get by
people. He can get by and create for himself, and he can create for others.
And when he's making the long ball, he's pretty good.  
  
He got his first foul, I think, with two minutes into the game, and I'm
starting to think, oh, my, because we need him on the floor. Let's be honest,
we need him on the floor. But he was able to manage that and we were able to
manage some things.  
  
And we shortened our bench a little bit today. But we got great play from
Ameka Akaya and Chris Joyce and LeSean Brown off the bench that gave us
opportunities to contend and continue our lead and expand the lead at times.  
  
Q. And Sid Tomes, you keep looking at the stat sheet, and his plus-minus
is --  
COACH PILIPOVICH: In the minus.  
  
Q. It was plus. But the numbers don 't stand out other than that. But
what did he bring tonight?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Toughness, Sid's grit and his toughness. Now, he's 0-of-3
from the field, 2-of-2 from the free-throw, four rebounds, four assists, no
turnovers, but a plus-12. He's just leadership.  
  
And he was chasing New Williams all over the court. They ran double stagger
screens from the baseline, and I swear -- I don't swear -- but when I watched
that film I thought we were draped all over New Williams on a couple of those
shots. And he just makes them, but he does that.  
  
And Sid was very upset with himself after the foul and the four-point play.
And then he gained his composure again and came back.  
  
Lavelle being a senior and A.J. being a youngster -- but this was only the
sixth victory for Air Force in the Mountain West Conference tournament,
correct? Only the sixth time.  
  
That senior group has won three of them. Okay. That's something to be said
about those young men. They've won three of the six. Hopefully they've got a
fourth one. But they were -- we talked about it -- focused, aggressive, and
have more fun than anybody playing in this tournament. And I thought we did
all three today. And we're going to get some rest and hopefully come back
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What can you say about the high tempo and pace that your team played
today, being able to get 14 points on the fastbreak and also being efficient
on the inside and scoring 30 points in the paint?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: We want to push tempo. We set some records this year for
offensive efficiency for our team and probably maybe hurt ourselves
defensively because we gave up more possessions to our opponent and sometimes
we struggled guarding.  
  
But we wanted to create some tempo today, if we did. And the press bothered us
twice when we played them. We're able to break the press. And then once we
broke the press at times -- not always -- but at times we wanted to attack the
score and I thought we were able to find out when to go and when to whoa, as
they say. And I thought we did a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. Fresno State shot 10-for-21 from 3 in the second half. How were you
able to fight that off and calm your team down to hang on to the lead?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: The way I looked at it, I thought they made 21 of the 10
they shot, because they made some shots. As coaches know, there's sometimes
where you execute what you want defensively and the other team just makes a
play. They want to win, too. And they made some shots. But I thought we were
able to grit it out, especially late, and maybe got a little bit closer
without fouling and some shots bounced off the rim we were able to rebound it.  
  
There was nothing really we needed to change from a schematic theme
defensively. We were switching all four perimeter players keeping our five
locked to the five and eventually hopefully they would miss a few and we'd
rebound it.  
  
But credit to their execution offensively and how hard they cut the score, but
we were able to manage and get a few stops there when we needed to.  
  
Q. I 'm reading here that it says that Air Force has never won a
quarterfinal in the Mountain West Tournament.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: That's true.  
  
Q. You 're playing a team tomorrow that I think has won like 10 or 12
straight quarterfinals and is fifth in the country and 21 is rested, and you
talked about watching a lot of film for this game.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Really pumping me up right now.  
  
Q. My question is on paper doesn 't seem much of a game. But is it?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: I think it's a credit to our conference. You're talking
about -- I don't know what today's date is -- March something -- but you're
talking about we have one of the top five teams in the country playing in the
Mountain West Conference. I think that's a credit to our league and where
we're at.  
  
Now, for us to play that team, they've only tripped once this year. They're
very talented. Coach Dutcher has done a great job with them. Malachi Flynn was
Player of the Year in the conference. And they're talented. They can space you
and shoot it and score. They can score inside with Wetzell. They defend as one
of the best teams in the country. We only have one film to watch because we've
only played them once this year that was at our place. And probably for 32
minutes we were pretty good, as a lot of teams were with them this year.  
  
So we've got to go back and look at the film, what adjustments can we make and
what things can we do. And I know from our players, not just these two but the
other 13 in the locker room, we're going to come out play hard, have a lot of
grit and some toughness and maybe the basketball gods will be wearing blue
tomorrow. And when the buzzer sounds maybe we'll be up one.  
  
Q. UNLV was a double-digit underdog against San Diego State and beat
them outright. Aside from the Xs and Os that you get your guys ready for
tomorrow, what do you tell your guys to be motivated and hyped up for the game
so they can come out and have their best performance?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You know, that's a really good question. But I will flip
this. And it's not going to be this case. But if that group's not motivated
and excited about playing in the quarterfinal of the Mountain West, which
we've never advanced past, and playing the top five team in the country, then
we've got the wrong guys. And I know we don't have the wrong guys because our
institution doesn't have those type of people.  
  
So we're going to be ready to go. We're going to play extremely hard. We're
going to have a lot of fun. And hopefully we'll have some people cheering us
on. Maybe the people that come in who aren't wearing red or blue will decide
to wear blue because we're not fifth in the country. How about that? Thank
you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Niko Medved](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34734)

### [Isaiah Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38842)

### [Nico Carvacho](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34831)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 80, Colorado State - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State.  
  
COACH MEDVED: First of all, I think we should give a lot of credit to Wyoming.
You watch all these games and know them, and I think that first of all you've
got to give them a lot of credit. They've had a tough season but you watch it
and they've just continued is to play hard as the season's gone on.  
  
Obviously we were fortunate to win in Laramie. They had won at Air Force. They
had Fresno and Nevada on the ropes and just hadn't found a way to finish
games.  
  
So I thought they did a lot of good things. I thought they made a lot of
shots. They moved the ball well. And I thought they played very, very well.  
  
And we dug ourselves too big of a hole couldn't dig out of it. We cut it to
two a couple times, couldn't get over the hump. Too many key turnovers in
situations where we had a chance. So disappointing. Obviously there's a ton of
emotion right now with these guys, and I know they're gutted with this loss.
But we'll find a way to get through it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Kind of early both halves they were able to get loose, hit
3-pointers. Was there anything they were doing offensively to change things or
did you feel the defense wasn 't connected the way it should be?  
NICO CARVACHO: I think the defensive wasn't connected like it should have
been, like we've been practicing. That's on us. We need to be better. I think
we could have definitely played better, especially on the defensive end, and
not let them get hot in the beginning and let them -- you know,
miscommunications and let them get hot. And that kind of screwed us up at the
end.  
  
Q. Coming into this game you guys talked about not wanting to overlook
Wyoming or anything like that. Did you feel like they caught you by surprise
at all, especially the way they were able to hit those 3s early in the game
and really get the momentum rolling?  
ISAIAH STEVENS: I didn't feel like we overlooked them. I feel, like Coach and
Nico said, they just came out and played really well. We dug ourselves a hole.
And it was kind of hard to get ourselves out of it. Like we said, we were able
to go on runs, but it's college basketball and teams will try to find a way to
win. And we weren't able to get over the hump.  
  
COACH MEDVED: Can I make a comment, too? I know that's the mantra. That is the
last thing that happened today is this group overlooking Wyoming. I promise
you that is not what happened. I thought these guys practiced great. They
prepared. We have a ton of respect in the world for Wyoming.  
  
And we knew it was going to be a tough game. We expected that. I don't think
that was the case at all. I think our execution defensively on some of their
emotions, we lost guys. And they made us pay. They did. Hendricks got hot
early. Kwane Marble is a really good player, a guy who has not shot the ball
well from the perimeter. He made some huge shots tonight when they really
needed it. That wasn't the case here today. They just played better than us.  
  
Q. Did you guys just -- was it more, you feel like, a lack of defensive
consistency throughout the game is really what came back to haunt you at the
end?  
ISAIAH STEVENS: I would definitely say so. In order to win games you've got to
be able to string together possessions and just be consistent throughout the
whole game and throughout the whole 40 minutes. And we didn't get that done
here tonight.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) you erased a 19-point deficit in Laramie. Three times
tonight you got it down to two. Each time they hit a 3. Did it get frustrating
at any point to get so close and not make that hump?  
NICO CARVACHO: You know, one of those things, you've got to continue to keep
on playing. They're going to make their runs; we'll make our runs. We just
weren't able to execute the way we wanted to when we had those runs. And like
Coach said they made some great shots. They played their hats off and credit
to them.  
  
Q. Niko, seemed like early on when Wyoming was making its run you guys
were out of sorts offensively, forcing some jump shots. Was there anything
missing offensively tonight, especially early?  
COACH MEDVED: I think so. I think it took us a little while to get into
rhythm. They really pack it in. But I thought the issue was, in the first
half, it was our defense and the second half it was our offense. I thought we
really turned the ball over in a lot of really key situations here, when,
again, we tightened the game up. And I thought the turnovers and maybe some
poor decisions on shot selection that way I thought really hurt us.  
  
But early on I thought the issue was defense. And in the second half I thought
our offense was more the issue.  
  
Q. Nico, how surreal is it knowing that was your last game as a Ram?
Looked like it took you a while to leave the court. And Isaiah, how surreal is
it, you won 't have him next year?  
NICO CARVACHO: It's one of those things. We don't know if we're going to be in
the postseason. I hope we are. I hope I get to continue to play with this team
and go to battle with these guys. I love this team and love these guys.  
  
Yeah, it took a little while to walk off. Five years of being here and playing
in this time, the conference tournament, you've got to take it in a little
bit. Definitely hasn't hit me yet, but I think it's going to.  
  
ISAIAH STEVENS: I would definitely say that hopefully our season isn't over
yet. Hopefully we put together another nice resume to play in the postseason.
But for me I feel it was definitely a learning experience for the future going
forward, and just learning from guys like Nico and Kris and Hyron, who have
been around it a long time, and just picking up on little things is definitely
going to help us prepare for the future.  
  
Q. Isaiah, your first conference tournament. Did you feel any different?
Did that have anything to do with maybe slower start or --  
ISAIAH STEVENS: I wouldn't say so. Basketball is basketball regardless what
stage you play on, where you play. We just didn't come out and get the job
done. And that's really all there is to it.  
  
Q. You 've been on a lot of types of different teams. This was a group
that consistently they fought back whenever they got down. You guys won 20
games after being picked ninth. What are you most proud of with this season
and this group of guys, when you look back at it?  
NICO CARVACHO: Like you say, totally different type of teams and this one is
special from Isaiah to Roddy to A.T. to Kendle to DT and John, and they came
in every single day and practiced. And they let me, Kris and Hyron lead the
way we wanted to and needed to. And they responded the right way.  
  
And we never got in any arguments. Team together, we love each other. Just the
chemistry off the court is just crazy. We get in the locker room and talk for
hours and just continue to just have fun. And I just love this group.  
  
Q. When you look back at this group, especially with the way they
fought, and you won 20 games after being picked ninth, what stands out most to
you?  
COACH MEDVED: I think that's a great question. And I think it's difficult
right now to reflect when the emotions are what they are, right? You don't
have time to take a step back. But I know no matter what, when you take a deep
breath and you know it has been a good -- I love this team. I love this group
of guys. I've loved what they've done. They're connected like crazy.  
  
And you've got to take the good with the bad. And you know it's been a great
season. And today was a tough day. There's no question about that. But that
doesn't change anything about these guys and who they are as people and how
they performed this year.  
  
The career that this guy had next to me is just -- it's unbelievable. And I
know him even right now that's the last thing he wants to talk about right now
after today. But what a great group of guys. And it's been a great season.
Maybe we'll have a chance to continue playing. I don't know. But it's hard to
even reflect on that right now at this moment.  
  
Q. Nico, obviously not the result you guys wanted but you being a
senior, knowing the career you had and the impact you had at Colorado State,
what do you tell Isaiah knowing he 's a freshman and what he's accomplished,
moving forward the rest of his career?  
NICO CARVACHO: The most important thing is to stay humble. Success comes, but
that even-keeled mindset of it can go away any second. There are going to be
lots of ups and downs no matter what and stay with it. Him and all the
freshmen and sophomores, that's the most important I want them to take away.
Especially for me, I've been through ups and downs, and confidence. Stay
confident and be humble and just be a good person.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, there 's a new transfer rule that there's a chance could go
through in April and be implemented for next season to allow a free transfer
without sitting out a year. You have a team like Fresno State as well that has
a lot of freshmen and sophomores that will probably be pretty attractive to
some Power conference programs. What's your feeling on that rule and are you
concerned if it does go through your team could get gutted?  
COACH MEDVED: There's a lot of parts to that question. One, I do think it's
inevitable, something will happen. Am I concerned about it? No. I mean, I
think that what you do is you recruit guys who -- have a great fit for your
program. You have great relationships. They have roles. And that's what you
do. And I have all the faith in the world that these guys want to be a part of
it.  
  
Transfers are part of the deal. And I think that it's a changing time with the
NCAA right now. I think it's something that we'll all get through and it will
evolve the right way. But it's inevitable. I'm not worried about it. It's
something that I embrace, and it's something that's going to happen. And it's
our job as coaches and people to evolve with the changes that way. And I
believe that we will.  
  
I think we've got a great place. I think we've got a great culture in our
program. I think guys love playing for us. They love going to school at
Colorado State. And our job is to find guys who really want to be there. And I
think we've got a great group of guys who do.  
  
Q. It seemed like every single time you guys got close Wyoming was able
to hit those big shots to pull away. Did you see any kind of frustration set
in on your guys ' \--  
COACH MEDVED: I don't know. We've been through that. Again, fellows, if you
watch the film of Wyoming all year they've been in those situations a bunch.
They just haven't found a way to make those big shots. And today they did.  
  
So you've got to give them credit. And I think the game was frustrating in
general. I think it was frustrating. A lot of things we talked about going in,
and I thought we practiced well. We let Hendricks get loose right away and
made shots. And Taylor makes the first one. So we dug ourselves a hole right
away.  
  
Again, credit to them for making shots. But, boy, we made some runs. We cut it
to two and I kept thinking, boy, if we could take the lead here and get over
the hump the game's going to change. But it never did. They always held us off
and made a play when they needed to and we didn't.  
  
And just too many crucial turnovers I thought in key situations. And a lot of
fouls I thought in situations like late in the clock where we had them and
they're about to take a tough shot and we fouled at the end of the shot clock
and just not a lot of heady plays that way.  
  
Q. We 've talked about it a little bit, we talked about it a week or so
ago, but postseason opportunities is that something that the guys would want
to do if it's on the table. Do you think it will be on the table?  
COACH MEDVED: I mean, possibly. And I mean this -- I haven't really thought
about it. I haven't talked about it yet what we're going to do. I think there
probably could be some possibilities. But what those are and what those look
like and what the circumstances are behind those, we don't know.  
  
Obviously part of that will be kind of waiting through the week here as we get
through conference tournament week and then Selection Sunday and see how the
chips fall.  
  
But that's something, this is something that they want to do, and if we have
an opportunity I'm sure it's something that we'll look at. Gosh, it's so hard
to think about right now. You're just so gutted from what happened today. But,
Kevin, sounds to me like these guys, I know they love playing together and
practicing. If they have an opportunity maybe it's one that we'll take.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 77, Fresno State - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
  
COACH HUTSON: I thought it was a hard-fought game. I thought they handled our
pressure this game a lot better than they did the previous games before. And
we actually tried to pressure a little bit more. And they handled it. They
didn't rattle. Only had eight turnovers. And they broke it in and got it
inside and scored on us. Hats off to that coaching staff and those players.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Noah and New, just as you kind of look back on the season, why do you
think it was hard to get going and get in a rhythm?  
NOAH BLACKWELL: Just a lot of ups and downs. We had a lot of injuries, getting
used to everybody coming back and playing with each other. But we're a tough
team. And they just got the best of us today.  
  
NEW WILLIAMS: To piggyback off what Noah said, we had a lot of injuries early.
And when guys are coming in and out of playing, you have to get that chemistry
back with playing with certain guys on the floor, playing with certain
lineups. I think that's why early we struggled.  
  
But like Noah said, we were a tough team, and regardless of that we didn't
want to make that our excuse, and we wanted to go out every night and play as
hard as we could.  
  
Q. Do you guys agree with Coach that maybe the biggest issue tonight was
getting stops on defense? If yes, why do you think that was a problem
tonight?  
NEW WILLIAMS: Yeah, we pressured. The guys played hard out there. We got a
little bit sped up. And Air Force is a good team and they were able to take
advantage of some of our mistakes.  
  
Q. Can you explain the mindset when you 're hitting 3s and still facing
a deficit, and then you overcome it, you take the lead, and then they score
right back. Is that, when you've been fighting to overcome that hill and then
you lose it, what does that do?  
NEW WILLIAMS: That's really just part of the game. Basketball is a game of
runs. So you make your run, the other team makes their run. The key is just to
keep playing hard and focus on the next play because basketball is a game of
runs, and that's going to happen.  
  
Q. New, what do you think about where this program is at going forward
with the young guys? What do you think about the future of Bulldog hoops?  
NEW WILLIAMS: We have a lot of really good young players. And a lot of those
young players contributed to us heavily this year. So I think Bulldog
basketball is on an upward trend. We have a great coach in Coach Hut right
here. And the guys believe in his ability and he believes in the guys'
ability. So I think they have a great future ahead of them.  
  
Q. I know you guys aren 't going go on, but do you give Air Force much
of a chance against San Diego State? Do you think they can give them game
tomorrow?  
NOAH BLACKWELL: It's a game of basketball. Whatever happens, happens.  
  
NEW WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, this is a good league. And everybody's 0-0, Air
Force is 1-0. They're going to go out and play as hard as they can. And San
Diego State is going to do the same. So anybody can win. It's anybody's game;
it's just who goes out and plays the hardest.  
  
Q. New, I know it 's tough because your season is coming to an end, but
you kind of had it going tonight. Maybe in a few years when you look back on
it, maybe you can kind of look back on it say, oh, man, at least I had kind of
a fun game offensively in my last time putting on the Bulldog red?  
NEW WILLIAMS: Yeah, I had it going a little bit. But I felt like I didn't do
enough. I've got to do more. And moving forward, I'll look at this as an okay
game for me because we didn't come out with the win. And that's what's most
important.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of building on what I was asking the players, we 've talked
about it a little bit this year, but it just felt like it never really could
get into a rhythm from game to game -- a good game, maybe, and then a not-so-
good game. Why do you think it was such a struggle?  
COACH HUTSON: We weren't as good as we would like to be. The good teams are
consistent. They're consistent is what you're asking for. So there was a lot
of reasons early, which were not excuses; they were pretty much reasons why
you're not going to have inconsistency when you have so many injuries. We had
three or four concussions.  
  
Blackwell was out for three games, then out for 11 games. New was out for four
games. Nate had a wrist injury for a while. So that hurt us early.  
  
But once we got them back, we've been getting better. We showed more signs of
consistency. We just could never really get over the hump, losing a one-point
game to Vegas twice, a one-possession game at Nevada. Beat a good Air Force
team twice who had actually beat us last year at home.  
  
So there was a lot of good things going on. We were just trying to get over
the hump to be a little more consistent as you watch out there and have more
better possessions as a group. And tonight Air Force had better possessions.  
  
Q. What 's going to be the biggest challenge, you think, with this young
core that's coming back -- Nevin, Orlando, Jarred -- as far as where can they
improve the most going forward?  
COACH HUTSON: Everywhere. Each one of them have different things they need to
work on, whether it's IQ or whether it's getting strength, skill work. We've
got to add a few pieces in to go with them that are a little older so we're
not always young.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about those three seniors and maybe what they meant
to you and to the program?  
COACH HUTSON: Yeah, sad to see them go, really is. I knew those three seniors
when I got here and we spent a lot of time over the next two years, and they
were a big part of our successful season that we had last year. And I feel bad
for them that we came in with higher expectations than what we've handled this
year.  
  
But couldn't control some of the injuries and it happened to those three guys.
And couldn't control that we were playing that many freshmen early and they
started playing well. All we could control was our attitude and our effort.
And those three seniors brought that every day.  
  
So I'm going to be sad to see them leave. I want to make sure they finish up
their degree. Know that they're always Bulldogs. And we'll be sad so see them
leave. I wish we could have left on a little more positive note, but we
didn't.  
  
Q. The stat that jumps out is the 30-10 advantage Air Force had in the
paint. Given the size advantage, what do you make of that number?  
COACH HUTSON: That was the one thing we talked about in the locker room. When
we threw the ball inside, it didn't quite materialize. We went inside early
and often. We went inside early and often in the last game in Fresno. We kind
of got bumped off our lines. As we're making moves, we're bumped off, we're
not finishing quite well. We dropped it a little bit. And that was the story
of the game because if you look back at the film, previously Scottie and their
center was not scoring on us inside. And they made strong moves and finished
and scored inside and we did not.  
  
Q. What made it so hard for you guys to guard A.J. tonight, especially
from the 3-point line?  
COACH HUTSON: We were in a zone. It's a matchup zone. We didn't want to guard
their Princeton offense with so many freshmen on the floor. And they have so
many shooters out on the floor, you kind of go with the flow on who you're
going to have attention to.  
  
And once he got going, those first three, we gave him a lot of attention after
that. But then you have some breakdowns.  
  
Q. Even though you guys didn 't play as well as you had hoped to, what
can you say about this team's resilience coming back from 11, because there's
some teams perhaps that would have folded at that point, but you guys got back
into the ballgame and were in it until the very end?  
COACH HUTSON: That's part of our culture. We don't want that to be the, we're
a team that comes back all the time because we had quite a few comebacks last
year. But that's a part of our culture. We're going to keep playing, keep
fighting. We're going to stick together. And we're going to keep believing
that we can win.  
  
So, I think we came back and took a lead and we needed a big stop and couldn't
get it. And hat's off to Air Force. They made nice plays through the pressure
and through the zone and got the ball where they wanted to get it and finished
it.  
  
Q. As you prepare to build a team for next season you mentioned getting
some older pieces. There 's a chance that the NCAA transfer rule could be
changed in April effective next season and players wouldn't have to sit out a
year. How do you look that from both sides, from going to get players and also
teams looking at your real good freshmen core and try to get them from you?  
COACH HUTSON: I try not to be emotional about it because you know the ins and
outs. Most of those rules seem like they're based on the Power 5 rule, and
it's going to trickle down here. But it's going to be inevitable that there's
going to be different people leaving every year on your team, whether it's
trying to go higher, trying to go lower.  
  
So recruiting is probably going to change. It really will. If you get one-time
transfer and you don't have to sit, that's different. So we'll see how it
plays out. You have to roll with the punches and adapt. Like in this business,
you're going to have to adapt and figure things out.  
  
We always are going to love our kids that are here and let them know that we
want them here and they're worthy and treat them right, push them the right
way. But that's not going to have a lot to do with transferring sometimes, if
they can transfer to a higher level and get nicer stuff. It's just going to
happen. That's just the way of the world right now. They already do it and
they have to sit out a year. Now if they don't have to sit out a year, it's
going to be wild.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Jake Hendricks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38843)

### [Kwane Marble II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38844)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 80, Colorado State - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
  
COACH EDWARDS: I thought this was one of our better games. Obviously having, I
want to say, five guys in double figures, I thought we did a great job sharing
the basketball on the offensive end of the floor.  
  
I thought we were connected defensively. Thought we did a good job rebounding,
but the stat sheets don't say that. But I just thought our guys went out there
and competed. The last time we played them at our place we had a 19-point lead
that we let get away. But our thing to our guys was it's tournament time and
let's leave it all out on the floor.  
  
And I thought our guys did a great job of just staying the course. And this
time around, even though I thought CSU continued to fight, like us three were
talking back stage, those were the longest two minutes in the history of
college basketball, it felt like. But our guys found a way to pull it off in
advance.  
  
Q. We 've talked about this before that you guys have been in these
situations earlier this year and you guys came up on the wrong end. Today it
seemed like every time they made a big shot to cut it down to two or three you
guys were able to respond. You guys made all your free throws late today for
the most part. What made today different?  
JAKE HENDRICKS: I would say all the hard work we've put in. Every day in
practice, we come in and we want to get better and we work hard every day. And
the other times we've talked and we've come on the wrong end, we've had
something -- every time it's been something that's gone wrong.  
  
And tonight I thought we fixed all of those things and put a complete game
together and it just comes with all the hard work we've put in.  
  
Q. [Inaudible] was very adamant to say they never overlooked you. Did
you feel overlooked by the rest of the conference and CSU?  
JAKE HENDRICKS: I would say so. I think people would doubt a 2-16 team, an 11
seed. We've had a lot of close games, maybe a lot of people within the
conference, other teams might not have because they know we can play a close
game. But I would say for the most part we were probably pretty doubted.  
  
Q. I think you guys got it, it was like five at halftime, went back up
to 13, then went back down to two or three, and obviously the way the last
game against Colorado State went with you guys being up 19, was there ever a
moment when you had to kind of regroup and say, we 're not going to let this
happen again? What were those huddles like when you kind of had to call those
timeouts and break up their momentum?  
JAKE HENDRICKS: What Coach Edwards has preached all year is just to continue
to defend and rebound. And if we get stops, they don't score. So they can't
come back. And I thought we did a really good job of defending and we always
preach about getting kills, which is three stops in a row.  
  
And I don't know how many we got, but we were on the verge of a lot. And we
got two quite a bit. And when we don't let them score it, it stops their run.
And then we've just got to finish with a rebound because they're a good
offensive rebounding team.  
  
Q. First big upset of the tournament technically. What do you do to stay
focused and be ready for Nevada coming up?  
JAKE HENDRICKS: We've got to get a lot of this, a lot of Gatorade, a lot of
water, get a good night's rest and wake up in the morning and be ready for our
preparation for Nevada.  
  
KWANE MARBLE II: We've just got to listen to the coaches, stay the course.
Coach Edwards always preaches just stay the course. Stay the course. Like Jake
said get good liquids and good night's rest. Get some good food in our body
and have a good night to recover.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You 've talked all year about them trusting the process and staying
the course and it hasn't always worked out this year. And today it hasn't
happened a lot this year but it all kind of fell into place. To have it fall
into place, especially here against Colorado State, what does that just mean
for you personally?  
COACH EDWARDS: Well, one of the biggest things we talked about even before the
game was clearing out the outside noise. And we've had to say that to our guys
quite a bit, because when you're on a course, and at the end of the day the
winds don't show up, it's hard to doubt what you're doing.  
  
And we're consistently telling our guys, you can hear them talk, we're
consistently telling them about the process -- just stay true to the process,
and understand that there's a reason why you work the way you work.  
  
And, again, it doesn't guarantee you a win at the end of the day. But it puts
you in the best position to win. And even with this group, we are young with
11 freshmen and sophomores, and we had three of them not even suited up.
Thompson got back today. But these guys, whether after a tough loss, a bad
loss, when we come back and get prepared for our next team, they're focused
and they come in and they work hard.  
  
This has been a good group. Like, there's no talk back. I just gotta
understand who I can yell at and who I can't. I've gotten better at that with
guys. But again you can hear them talk.  
  
We consistently talk about the process and defending and rebounding.
Offensively I just care about you sharing the basketball. And I thought
tonight was one of our better performances in the sense of sharing -- 19
assists and seven turnovers. That's pretty impressive with a group -- and
you're looking at, again, T.J. being a young guy, Maldo being a young guy. And
I thought Jake and A.J. were really solid for our guys tonight.  
  
I mean, this group still believes. Like they said, we've been in so many close
games and we could have been on the other side of them. No different than
playing Nevada. Both of them came down to the last possession, per se, but
they found a way to just keep coming. Tonight it was good and it's a good
feeling.  
  
Q. You mentioned close games. Two of them were against Nevada, who you
'll play now in the next round. What do you feel like you learned or your team
maybe learned in those games that you can apply and maybe come out with a
better result this time?  
COACH EDWARDS: In both of those games -- a lot of our games, I thought we made
a lot of youthful mistakes down the stretch, and we also haven't done a great
job of putting in free throws down the stretch, which today we did a better
job of not make youthful mistakes. And for the most part we're able to put in
free throws.  
  
So looking back at both games at their place, our ball, 50 seconds left, our
freshmen gets picked by their fifth-year senior and gets a layup. Changes the
course of the game. At our place they had a big stop down the stretch. It was
a veteran group.  
  
So we have to understand that it's capable to be done because we've been right
there with them. And, again, we just kept making youthful mistakes and we've
got to be able to -- front end of one-on-ones, we have to be able to make free
throws.  
  
But respect Coach Alford and their staff and the players that he has. But,
like I tell our guys, it's tournament time and you get out there and you play.  
  
Q. You pretty much led wire to wire. Jake came out, made his first three
3-pointers. What did you tell the guys that had them so hyped up?  
COACH EDWARDS: I don't know if I could tell you that. That's something I have
to carry on within my coaching profession. But I gave them a speech that I had
heard when I was an assistant under Anthony Grant at VCU that always just
stayed with me.  
  
And I thought the message fit well for today. Now, I've got to come up with
something for tomorrow. But I thought they were very locked in. Like you said,
they came out and everybody would look at the process of making the shots. But
I thought we were defending as well. So when you have that combination, that's
a good recipe to put yourself in position to win the basketball game.  
  
Q. What 's the biggest challenge of facing Nevada and playing a guy like
Jalen Harris?  
COACH EDWARDS: Gosh, I know Malachi Flynn won Player of the Year and he
deserves it because of what San Diego State has done as a team.  
  
He is 1-A, Jalen Harris, in the sense of if San Diego State is not having that
type of year you're probably talking about him as being the best player in our
league. It's one of those things you just do your best. Cuz it's not like
you're not going to shut him down. He's going to have the ball in his hands
too many times and he's going to get too many opportunities.  
  
Our job is to just make him take as many shots as possible to have whatever
number he has in the sense of scoring. But that's not a one-man job. It's a
team job in the sense of understanding positioning, but at the same time the
pieces around him help.  
  
You obviously have got to keep your eyes on Jazz. Zouzoua has been shooting
the ball really well. Drew, he's really come back and become a really good
3-pointer shooter himself. So they're more than just Jalen, but he's a very
good piece to have for that group.

# [NCAA 2020 BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=NCAA+2020+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## February 8, 2020

  

### [David Worlock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38721)

### [Mitch Barnhart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19714)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
DAVID WORLOCK: Hi, everyone, and welcome to this afternoon's call with the
committee chair, first media teleconference of the season after today's
unveiling of the top 16 earlier this afternoon on CBS. I am with Mitch
Barnhart, the director of athletics at the University of Kentucky and vice-
chair of the Division I men's basketball committee this year. Mitch is so
graciously pinch-hitting for Kevin White, the chair of the committee, who had
to leave to attend a funeral today, and so Mitch will be taking questions.  
  
We just want to remind everyone that a transcript of today's call will be
available soon after the call concludes. You can find the transcript at
www.ncaa.com/transcripts.  
  
Q. Kevin spoke a little bit about the difference between Gonzaga and San
Diego State in the committee 's mind. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on
that. I know they're very close resumes, but what did you feel put Gonzaga
ahead of San Diego State?  
MITCH BARNHART: Well, there was no question that San Diego State was a No. 1
seed. They've had a remarkable year, and we had an opportunity, a couple of
us, to watch San Diego State in person when we were on the West Coast for the
NCAA convention, and they were incredibly impressive, and they have obviously
had a wonderful, wonderful start to their season.  
  
It was razor close between Gonzaga and San Diego State. Gonzaga had a couple
of wins just slightly better than San Diego State's with a win over Oregon and
Arizona, and that was just the razor's edge difference between the two.  
  
Q. I was just wondering with Arizona, I know the NET is primarily a
sorting tool, but they 're like eighth on the NET and probably projected as a
5 or 6 or 7 at this point. Does that make them tricky to evaluate, or what do
you do with a team like that?  
MITCH BARNHART: Yeah, the NET is just one of many tools that we use to
evaluate our teams, and obviously you've got metrics, you've got head-to-head
competitions. We take all of those things into consideration. Non-conference
performances are important to what we're trying to get done.  
  
So there's a lot of pieces to the puzzle. There again, they're beginning to
trend the right way and do some really nice things with their team. Had a
chance to watch them Thursday night in their game against USC, and so clearly
it's a very competitive race in the Pac-12, and with 1,500 games left to play
in the season as a college basketball season and tournaments to play, they've
certainly got room to make their impact on the brackets.  
  
Q. Does the margin -- they 've played Gonzaga and Oregon and Baylor all
really close. Does the margin factor in that, and is that maybe why their NET
rating is so high and yet they're probably not worthy of a seed that high?  
MITCH BARNHART: They've had a lot of wins where their margin of victory has
been large and their losses have been very close, so that combination does
feed into the metrics. So yes, that is a factor in all of that. And then
again, many of the other tools that we use to evaluate teams.  
  
Their road record is 2-4, so that is a factor, so hopefully for their -- they
would like to probably win some more games on the road, and that would be of
help to them, as well.  
  
Q. I have a question on the Dayton Flyers. They came in today at the No.
6 position as a safe 2 seed, but without having a tier 1A victory to speak of.
Of course their two losses are both in overtime. I was curious how you
evaluated Dayton in particular, and what was the difference between a team
like them and Arizona?  
MITCH BARNHART: They're 5-0 on the road and their only two losses are neutral
losses in overtime, as you said earlier. Incredible player in Obi Toppin, and
just a remarkably efficient basketball team. They have performed at a high
level, and obviously doing a remarkable job in the A-10.  
  
I think all of those pieces just give us great confidence to put them on the 2
line, and they've got plenty of opportunities ahead of them to make a great
run in the tournament if they continue to play the way they are.  
  
Q. Curious about Oregon. I was wondering if they 're kind of tough to go
through because they beat some teams that were ranked pretty highly early in
the year in terms of Michigan and North Carolina and Memphis who have fallen
off a little bit. Curious what the overview was with the Ducks.  
MITCH BARNHART: Well, Payton Pritchard is obviously a dynamic player, in many
conversations for the National Player of the Year award, obviously in a league
that has really made some progress this year in the Pac-12. They're 18-5, and
with a really challenging schedule. They've challenged themselves in the non-
conference, so they've showcased themselves remarkably well.  
  
Seton Hall, they beat Seton Hall on a neutral floor, the Michigan win, all
those things give the committee some reasons to place them where we did. We
thought they have really got a tremendous basketball team, and so that's why
we placed them where we did.  
  
Q. You had mentioned Arizona up there. Does the Pac-12 have a few that
were in the discussion for the top 16 but didn 't get in?  
MITCH BARNHART: Yeah, there were several teams that were in -- the committee
met on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We concluded our meetings on Thursday,
and since then 74 games have been played just before today's Saturday games.
Obviously Arizona was in that conversation, Colorado was discussed. But
eventually we had to pick 16 teams, and so the top four seed lines, if we
started the tournament today, that's where we would sort of land, and then
there were some other teams that they mentioned on the bracket reveal show of
Iowa and Kentucky and LSU that were in the conversations probably more closely
to that 4 line, but the conversation was deep. The balance in the field is
remarkable, and so -- people are saying that it's one of the more balanced,
competitive brackets in history, and I would tend to agree with that. With
1,500 games to go, it's an exciting way to look ahead to Selection Sunday.  
  
Q. San Diego State is kind of in this unenviable position if the
seedings stay the way they do right now where as a 1 seed they 'd go to New
York. If they dropped to the 2 seed line, they'll likely end up in Los Angeles
and that's a bus ride from campus and they'd have an arena full of fans. Does
the committee take that into consideration knowing what a school might prefer
or might be better suited for it when you might have this kind of enormous
travel or if they end up in the east they end up in the east and that's tough
luck?  
MITCH BARNHART: Well, I think the top four seeds, if you're one of the best
four, then you're a 1 seed. And we have to evaluate that as it is.  
  
If you look over the history, we've had multiple east teams that have gone --
had to go west. At times that has happened. You've had a couple of teams from
the east where they've had to go to the West Coast, and this is only the
second time since 2000 we've had two teams that are West Coast teams that are
No. 1 seeds if this process were to hold where one would have to go somewhere
else, go east.  
  
In that time there was two teams that went, Arizona and Stanford, and they did
not have to go all the way east, but at the end of the day, that's where the
brackets and that's where the regions are mapped out at this point in time.  
  
In the history of the seeded tournament, top-seeded teams were assigned to a
regional three time zones away nine times. All of them were teams from the
eastern time zone going to the west and two won a National Championship and
three more advanced to the Final Four. That's part of that process.  
  
But you cannot -- if someone is legitimately a top-four team they must be a 1
seed and then you work your way down. You don't artificially break up the
bracket.  
  
Q. Kevin White mentioned in the show and you 've spoken about some of
the teams that were considered as a 4 seed that just missed out, and Kentucky
was one of them. Can you give us a sense of what it was maybe that kept
Kentucky out of one of those four seeds?  
MITCH BARNHART: Well, first, let me be really clear. During those
conversations I am not in the room when it is discussed, so I'm recused from
the room, and so as athletic director at Kentucky, I am not in the room, I'm
just given the result of the conversation and how it played out.  
  
I think, Josh, at that point I would have to say about that's all -- I could
refer to David Worlock and let him chime in.  
  
DAVID WORLOCK: From a positive standpoint, from Kentucky, were some of the
performance in the non-conference, specifically a road win at Texas Tech and a
neutral court win over Michigan State, to go with the home win over
Louisville, so they have three high-quality non-conference wins that certainly
helped Kentucky. And as far as the negative were some of the losses, the loss
to Evansville specifically, was probably enough to keep them on the outside of
the first four lines, but again, along with some of the other teams that have
been mentioned, Iowa and LSU and a couple of the Pac-12 schools that were
mentioned previously. They certainly received consideration, as Mitch alluded
to. There's plenty of opportunities for all those teams to get quality wins
before the end of the season and potentially move up into that top four lines.  
  
Q. I 'm just curious looking at the 2 line with Duke and Louisville so
closely matched up, obviously there's the head-to-head result there, I'm just
wondering how much weight that does have in ultimately seeding those two.
Obviously Duke lost that match-up but is still ahead of Louisville.  
MITCH BARNHART: They did. It is a full body of work, and we also must take
into account that Duke had the win against Kansas and had better metrics
overall in terms of how that played out. Slight edge in the metrics in terms
of I just mentioned that, and I think that's sort of where we are. Again, it's
not just one thing. I think what people want to do is look at one thing and
say that's all it is, and it's the quality of the wins in the first quadrant,
so I think if you match up those two or three things, that would be the
difference.  
  
Q. I was curious, I 'm kind of the opposite side of the coin from an
earlier question about San Diego State, but I'm looking at it from Duke being
a No. 2 seed and possibly in the east. Is there any consideration given to an
advantage or disadvantage, because it kind of seems like based on Duke's --
their history and everything in New York City, that that would be a favorable
-- it would almost be unfavorable for San Diego State to have to play Duke in
the east in New York City. So I was curious if there is -- you wouldn't change
a No. 1 seed if they're a top four and they're qualified as a No. 1, but would
you change a No. 2 to make it -- to kind of go for any kind of balance in that
respect?  
MITCH BARNHART: Well, first thing, history really, we don't look at the
history of what they had to do with it in terms of where they're placed. Both
teams would have to win three games to get to that match-up, number one. And
then at the end of the day, there's also the geography piece and the way we
place our teams to stay within the next available place for them to play,
closest place, unless it throws off the balance of the brackets, and we want
to make sure that we get that right.  
  
And we want to make sure that we stay true to the seed list in all of that.
That's how we drive to the bracket decisions that we get to.  
  
Q. I was wondering if Butler would have not been in the top 16, if it
had lost to Villanova on Wednesday, and also if there is -- if Butler is
eligible to be routed through the Midwest regional in Indiana even though that
's its home city?  
MITCH BARNHART: So there were several teams that were in the conversation for
the 4 seed line. Clearly the win that they had on Wednesday night when the
committee was convening was a factor in them moving into the 4 seed line. It
was a heck of a win. So that was a factor, because there were several people
in that conversation.  
  
But having said that, they are eligible to be in Indianapolis because they
don't play -- they're eligible to play, they're not hosts, and they don't play
three games in that arena, and they're allowed to participate -- Horizon
League and IUPUI are hosting that event, so they would be able to, if
eligible, and if all the brackets, decisions on the bracketing worked out,
they would be eligible to participate in Indianapolis.  
  
Q. I have a question on Penn State. I hadn 't heard their name mentioned
on the call here or on the show today, but they seem to have a very impressive
resume with three quad 1-A wins, a win at Michigan State, who was selected No.
16, the final team in today, and just from a glance at things across the body
of work, just a much more impressive body of work but a little bit better
metrics from Michigan State. Can you tell me a little bit about how
scrutinized Penn State was, first, and then second, how far off they might be
in your eyes?  
MITCH BARNHART: Great season they're having so far, and clearly trending in
the right direction. They're having -- they've won five in a row and their
metrics are all in the top 20. We discussed a lot of teams. They were just not
discussed in the 16 at this time. That doesn't mean that's not possible going
forward. They've got an awful lot left to their season.  
  
Their non-conference results is also a part of that factor, and so we looked
at a lot of those pieces. That wasn't one deciding factor, but I will say
this: They're obviously trending well. They've won five in a row, and
remarkably tough ballclub and playing well.  
  
DAVID WORLOCK: We definitely want to thank everyone for their time and
attention today. Lots of good questions, and lots of outstanding basketball
going on today and through the remainder of the season leading up to Selection
Sunday on March 15. Again, thanks, everyone, and one final reminder that a
transcript will be available soon by going to NCAA.com/transcripts. Thanks
again, everyone.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon State - 71, Utah - 69  
  
WAYNE TINKLE: What can you say? What a way to particular off the Pac-12
Tournament. 8-9 matchup. We got off to a really good start, and they really
got into a rhythm. We couldn't score forever, and individual performance by
the Plummer kid, unbelievable. Only time I've ever seen something like that
was my daughter was in city league, but that doesn't really matter. That's a
joke.  
  
And I am just really, really proud of the resiliency our guys showed. I don't
know what their biggest lead was. We called a timeout, our guys responded.
What we needed to do was find a group of tough guys. And we identified that
group, Gianni Hunt was big for us in that stretch off the bench. We were
wanting to go to our 1-3-1 in the first half, but with Plummer hitting shots
with blindfolds on, we were worried.  
  
The coaches did a great job of saying he's hitting them against man, against
our 2-3, let's give it a shot. Credit to the staff for selling that to me. And
then the guys, we put them on their heels and we got some momentum going. They
stretched it out a little bit again. And our seniors in the last couple of
timeouts said: We're winning this game. Keep believing it, we're winning this
game. And what a finish, just incredible.  
  
JAROD LUCAS: My teammates did a great job setting me up, especially on the
last two shots, most especially the last one. Tres hit me and trusted me.
Previously there was a game where he trusted me and I missed it. I remember
telling him I'm sorry, it's never going to happen again. Tres trusted me
again, and I was able to knock it down.  
  
Q. You had the ball, the senior driver, you might have had a look, what
was going through your head, thinking can I get this up or pitch it out and
give Jarod an open look?  
TRES TINKLE: Yeah, I felt like originally, supposed to be in E's hands. But
one of the guys was on him. Did a good job denying. And so it was tough.  
  
Six seconds left, I tried to make a play, whether it was going to be for me. I
know when I drive, teams load the paint, and I saw Jarod step over, jump stop.
And told him I trust him taking that shot every single time. I made the right
play, and he came through.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TRES TINKLE: It was tough. Credit to him. But I think we let him get off too
early. And then we kept the rhythm like that, the hoop looks way bigger. He's
hitting man zone, try to get him to good off the three-point line, but we were
short closing, he was confident.  
  
We kept battling. Tried to make adjustments, and slowed him down a little bit
in the second half. And again we were just rallying. Made an assist to
rebound, and then offensively we were playing with a lot more energy, guys
were knocking shots, and that's when the tempo stepped up.  
  
Q. During the game, it was announced that the NCAA Tournament will be
played without fans. And that struck me, especially with a great ending like
that where you 've got your fans going crazy, the band blaring, what would it
be like to imagine having that game being played in front of an empty stadium,
and what are your thoughts on this is actually happening now?  
WAYNE TINKLE: We just kind of caught wind of that. We've got to stay focused
in the Pac-12 Tournament right now. If it gets to that point, we'll deal with
it. But really we can't comment on that, we've got so much right in front of
us, we have to handle our business and move forward day-to-day. Thanks.  
  
Q. I believe the shot Jarod was talking about earlier in the season was
the Arizona State game. And you mentioned to us back in Corvallis, you told
him we 're going to give you that shot again. How much trust do you have in
him and seeing it replayed tonight?  
WAYNE TINKLE: Tremendous amount of trust because he's such a confident
shooter. He got down, missed two in the first half, and his dumb coach yanked
him out. But when we pulled him out, we said: Hang in there. Just hang in
there we're going to go to you again.  
  
But he's a great shooter. And we told him early in the year that he's the one
guy that we have the most confidence in shooting that shot. Part of that was
just to make a freshman feel good about himself during some dog days. It's
true, we have a few guys we have a lot of trust in at any time taking those
big shots, and he's certainly one.  
  
He learned from that Arizona State game. He hit it on the head. One of our
seniors trusted him in that game for the game-winning shot. That's the game.
It just was in and out. And it came back to him when it was crucial in the
postseason. What that says is what we talked about the life lessons we teach
the guys from the start to the finish of the season, how you deal with
adversity, how you handle things, you don't try to cut corners to get instant
gratification, stay true to the process.  
  
We've been through a lot. And that's just in a nutshell. We trusted him. He
did things the right way. He handles his business on and off the court. One of
our senior leaders trusts him to make that play in the postseason when it's
the pinnacle, and he knocks it down.  
  
Big credit to our guys, just for their wherewithal and sticktoitiveness, I'm
proud because of the group of guys we have and how we've handled adversity.  
  
Q. Ethan and Tres, when you have historic performance on the other side
going with Plummer knocking down these threes, how difficult is it for you on
offense to not get ahead of yourself and feel like you have to match what he
's doing to stay with him?  
ETHAN THOMPSON: I feel like we've just got to stay in the team. They're going
to be able to hit shots, and credit to him. He hit a lot of tough shots. We
also gave him some open looks. But that's behind us now. But when we're on the
offensive end, just stick to our game plan and just stay with it.  
  
TRES TINKLE: Same thing. When a player is hitting shots, you can't worry about
that. You have to worry about yourself. Stay focused to our game plan, our
principles. If we get that get ahead, that's going to take us out of our
rhythm offensively, and we'll press, and that's a snowball effect.  
  
Try to make adjustments with him and worry about ourselves. We amped up the
effort defensively, and we came out on top, fortunately.  
  
Q. Tres, you kind of talked about your trust in Jarod. In a moment what
could be your final -- could have been your final moment playing a college
basketball game, to trust a freshman to hit that shot, what was going through
your mind in that moment?  
TRES TINKLE: We talked about he hit two threes last minute, I think his fourth
in a row, I believe, in the second half. So he was feeling it. I know Jarod,
he's passionate, he loves the game. Again, as he mentioned, the ASU game, he
felt terrible about it. He texted me. I told him I trust you taking that shot
every single time.  
  
So game on the line, I'm going to make the right play. Sure enough, he was
wide open. I know how he shoots it. I know his confidence, and he followed
through.  
  
Q. With the format, there 's talk if you win that first one sometimes
that can help you in the second one. You saw that last year what Colorado did.
Thoughts about the matchup? This would be something to keep you guys --  
WAYNE TINKLE: I just think the more important part is we've gotten a lot of
momentum in the last few weeks, even that road trip to Arizona, you know, we
had a tough deal at Arizona, our guys bounced back, we came up short to
Arizona State, we had a lot of good moments, especially defensively at Oregon.  
  
Then we took care of business this past weekend. We've got some momentum.
We're playing our best basketball. That's going to be the message going into
tomorrow. Not hope that our opponent is going to be sluggish because it's
their first game. There is something to be said, we ironed some kinks out
today. Luckily it didn't cost us like it did a year ago.  
  
Let's just keep doing what we're doing and take them as they come. We know
what we're facing tomorrow, a heck of a team, great coach. And we've got now a
short window to prepare to get ready for them.  
  
Q. When he grabbed you after those first two misses, and hearing it from
the press row, it sounded like a lot is mental. Can you walk me through how
you got more comfortable in your first ever Pac-12 Tournament game and what
you had there at the front that was able to contribute to the success on the
back?  
JAROD LUCAS: I think in the first half I kind of got in low and had a couple
of shots that I missed, but this isn't the first time Coach Tinkle has been
the first guy that told me to stay locked in. It wasn't just the Coach Tinkle,
it was a lot of my teammates, just telling me I need to stay locked in. He
told me I need to be ready for my next opportunity. He gave me another
opportunity in the second half, and I made the most of it. I couldn't be more
happy or more thankful.

### [CJ Elleby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39027)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington State - 82, Colorado - 68  
  
KYLE SMITH: It's good to get one. We haven't had one of these since 2009. Our
guys knew that going in, and they've got some pride. I thought we played
really well tonight, and our defense was excellent. And just stayed with it
the whole time. We had a couple of ups and downs, but stayed the course and
played one of the better games of the year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: How did you do? You led for 36 minutes?  
  
KYLE SMITH: I thought we did an awesome job on McKinley Wright, 6-for-17. He
still had 21 points, but on 17 shots, that's great. And I think we got a
couple of threes late when we were in pretty good shape there.  
  
But I just thought we did a good job there. And did a good job on the glass.
We're a little bigger now when we've got Bobe (phonetic) out there and Tony
Miller, and we're just a little different team. And playing CJ more at the
three I think helps us.  
  
Q. So craps later, Coach?  
KYLE SMITH: You never ask for a 7. You don't root for the 7. You need to know
that. I'll put the lesson out there. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Just explain, or explain your feelings right now. We talked about the
special moments yesterday that you 've had. This is definitely a special
moment for you guys in your first season. Can you describe the feeling that's
going through you right now?  
KYLE SMITH: Pretty calm. Trying to get ready for tomorrow with Arizona State.
You have to stay in the moment. You have to flip the page to the next one.  
  
I'm really proud of these guys. They've really bought into what we're trying
to do. We're not going to be perfect by any stretch. The idea is we're going
to improve every day. We don't set team goals. But we found a few things along
the way where we could make a mark.  
  
And tonight was where we had one. Haven't had one since 2009. I think Colorado
is a program we want to be like. They have nine or ten guys that are good
players. They're solid. They're sound. They're old. And I think they let our
guys know they were that, and we can be something like that, too, if not
better.  
  
Q. For the players, any of you guys, what was the difference between
this game and the game two months ago in Boulder?  
ISAAC BONTON: I don't think it was too much of a difference. I think just we
put 40 minutes together. In the first half, we didn't play bad against them in
Boulder, but the second half we let it slip a little bit, got kind of
complacent and sped up a little bit.  
  
This time we stayed focused, stuck with our game plan and really slowed it
down, and just keep playing defense, keep playing hard defense on McKinley.
Making sure we're rebounding, doing little things that we work on in practice
every day for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. You hit your first two or three pointers of the game. After the
second or third one, did it have a feeling this might have been your shooting
night tonight?  
CJ ELLEBY: You know, maybe. But what's more important is just I feel like it
got my team going, it opened up things, you know. And once I saw those go in,
it was going to be a good night, for sure.  
  
Q. Jeff, congratulations on getting engaged Sunday. Can you talk about
the historical significance of winning for the first time since 2009 in your
senior season, then also the last week getting healthy and playing with a
broken finger tonight?  
JEFF POLLARD: Yeah, getting the first win in the tournament since 2009 is a
big deal. Obviously first time since I've been here that we've gotten past the
first round. It's a big moment for all of us.  
  
But at the same time we know tomorrow is another day, and we're all kind of on
the same page, looking forward to that. And getting ready for that.  
  
And then the broken finger, it's just another thing. Senior season, going into
my last Pac-12 Tournament, I was like there's no way that I'm not playing if I
can walk and run.  
  
Q. Jervae Robinson is from Colorado, from the Denver area, I don 't know
if you have any insight on this, is this win particularly meaningful for him?
It looked like he had a big part of the defense on McKinley tonight.  
KYLE SMITH: Yeah, I think the a little bit. Jervae has been like that. I don't
know if I've coached a guy that's improved as much as him over the course of
the year. I was really excited. We knew it and our locker room knows it, that
he takes the toughest guy every night, whether it's Payton Pritchard, McKinley
Wright, you name them, he's taking them.  
  
And he's been great. It's really nice that the coaches recognize him. He was
Honorable Mention All-Defensive Team. I'd love to have him up here, too, just
because he's been a rock solid senior, just keeps getting better. And it would
be hard to replace. Played 36 minutes. I didn't want to take him out of the
game.  
  
Q. For the players, that last tournament win came with guys like last
names Baynes, Klay Thompson. They 've been a little more involved in the
program this year. They've spoke to you. What's it been like to be able to
speak with them and relate to them and get that first win since then?  
CJ ELLEBY: I think that just comes with building the Coug culture back up. And
Coach Smith has done a great job bringing people who have been there and have
importance in the Coug community.  
  
It motivates us and inspire us to chase those things. They're really good
basketball players, but even better people. To listen to them, spend time with
them, I think it helped us, bring us together a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach and players, too, now you get Arizona State. You just played
them. Is that a good or a bad situation that you 're playing a team that you
literally just played, and what do you look to get out from that game?  
KYLE SMITH: I'm not sure how that goes. We think it's pretty fresh on us. I
don't think there will be any major adjustments. But I thought we played about
a ten-minute stretch we played really well against them and got ourselves back
in the game. They're a really good team. And we're 1-1. It's the rubber match,
it will be a great opportunity for us.  
  
Q. You guys are going to be playing in a pretty empty arena tomorrow,
what do you think that will be like, it 's a pretty unprecedented thing?  
KYLE SMITH: It will be like our scrimmage we saw in Washington or Montana.  
  
CJ ELLEBY: We'll have to bring the energy there. We'll have family and close
friends. But the energy comes from within the locker room, and we'll have to
rely on each other for that.  
  
Q. Isaac, what does this mean to you, your first year in this program,
to make such an impact, to be going through these moments with those guys up
there?  
ISAAC BONTON: I think it's special. The journey I've been through and
everything, it's been a tough journey. But I feel like I'm in the right place.
And I just give all the credit to my teammates and my coaches. They've done
such a good job welcoming me here and acclimating me back to the Division I
level.  
  
Moments like these, winning a tournament game for the first time in quite a
while, I just want to share it with my brothers and come back tomorrow and get
the win.  
  
Q. Coach Smith, you don 't know what it's like to lose at the Pac-12
Tournament. But a lot of these players do. What does it mean to you to get a
win for them tonight?  
KYLE SMITH: It's great for our program. I think CJ hit it on the head. I think
it means more to guys like Aaron Baynes, Taylor Rochestie, Klay Thompson,
George Raveling. Those people have come through this place have a lot of love
for their time spent in Pullman. I know when I get to my phone I'll get a
crazy text from those guys. They have a lot of pride and it makes it special.  
  
These guys think I brought them back, Pat's the one that organized it and did
the thing for Klay and George and his staff. Those go a long ways with just --
the place is special. Pullman is special. People, they really -- they're proud
of their Cougs, and it's good to show them how -- reward them with a win.  
  
ISAAC BONTON: Pat Chun is one of the most professional people I've met in my
life.  
  
Q. The routine for you going pregame, did it change up for you with the
hand? Can you go into detail on that? You 've got quite the wrap on it.  
JEFF POLLARD: Yeah, I tried to keep it as normal as possible and just try to
get it as functional as possible. Definitely wrapped up a lot right now. But,
I mean --  
  
KYLE SMITH: Shout out to Dr. Henry.  
  
JEFF POLLARD: She helped get it all ready to go. But like I said, as long as
I've got a hand and I can run, I'm playing.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Nico Mannion](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38991)

### [Dylan Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38992)

### [Josh Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38993)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 77, Washington - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Josh, what can you say about hanging on for a good win?  
  
JOSH GREEN: We lost last week to Washington, so our biggest thing was coming
back to practice, working on what we've got to work on, come to the tournament
all guns going.  
  
I think our team did a great job. We really locked in last week at practice.
And I think we're going to keep it going.  
  
Q. Looks like you got started off early offensively. How were you
feeling at the start of the game?  
JOSH GREEN: I felt great. I think the biggest thing was coming to the game
with energy, whether it's on the offensive end or defensive end. My biggest
goal was trying to get the team pumped and ready to go. It's March, and we're
ready to go.  
  
Q. If they decide to close this tournament off to fans, what do you
think about them doing that?  
DYLAN SMITH: It's crazy, March Madness, you always see big games, big arenas.
But it's a safety precaution. The coronavirus is a serious thing. You've got
to wash your hands and bathe and hope not to get it.  
  
Q. One of the aspects of this is that with no fans, no players '
families and friends will be able to come and watch you play. What does that
mean?  
DYLAN SMITH: A little bit of the same thing. Everybody dreams of fair family
coming to those games. I know my family was looking forward to it. I'm sure
these two families were looking forward to coming.  
  
It's a big blow. It's going to be awkward playing in a silent gym without the
crowds. It comes with it, we'll just have to work through it.  
  
SEAN MILLER: It was a very good win for our team. Kind of unique situation in
that we just played Washington on Saturday at home. And they beat us. They
outplayed us. I think it speaks to the depth of our conference, being that
they were a 12 seed. I don't think there's a lot of 12 seeds in college
basketball that are better.  
  
Mike Hopkins and his staff, they did a great job of playing their best here at
the end. And we knew that it was going to be a tough, tough fight here
tonight. If we played Washington seven times, every one of those games would
be very, very difficult.  
  
So we're thrilled to win. We had three turnovers in the second half versus ten
in the first half. That was a big deal. And I really think all three of these
guys played well here today.  
  
So we're excited to advance and have a chance to play USC tomorrow, and
they're also a very good team. It's one of the exciting parts of this year's
tournament. It's always a great tournament, but the quality from top to bottom
has never been better.  
  
Q. Sean, Washington really struggled from the perimeter. Can you just
talk about the way you guys defended them from the arc and kind of forced them
to run their clock and take some shots they probably didn 't want to take.  
SEAN MILLER: You know, our defense has quietly grown this season. These guys
know it. We've been hard at work. If you watched our team around the
Thanksgiving period of time, we were much further along on offense.  
  
But to these guys' credit, our defense has really, really improved.
Statistically, if you look closely at our team, we probably have won more
games with our defensive effort than even our offense.  
  
And these three guys have a lot to do with it. They're our heart and soul here
on our perimeter. And they did a very, very good job of defending a very good
team.  
  
Isaiah Stewart was fantastic today. When he makes those turnaround jump shots
and 15 footers, made a three, he's really difficult to defend. But he had a
great game. It wasn't lack of effort for us, but we defended him well. But
he's one heck of a basketball player.  
  
Q. Nico, is there a concerted effort early in the game to focus on the
jump shots to pull the defense out since last game inside wasn 't working as
well?  
NICO MANNION: I think the big thing for us was using ball fakes, whether you
shoot it or not, but just trying to draw the defense out so we can hit the
same passes, get it to the high post. We know they guard an area, not a man.
So using our ball fakes to get them out of position and get the ball where we
needed to get it.  
  
Q. Sean, can you talk about the youth of this team? With so many
freshmen in big roles, it 's the first time on this stage and the way they
responded to a loss to Washington and came back and were able to get the win
today?  
SEAN MILLER: Yes, we have a really unique mix on our team. We have Dylan, who
is in his last go-around in his fourth year. He's clearly the old man of the
group.  
  
To these other guys' credit, I think Dylan would also echo what I'm about to
say, I don't think we've ever had a group of three freshmen we've been so
dependent on every game.  
  
We've had really talented freshmen, but as they grew and learned the game,
there were times when they didn't play well, yet we were still able to win
because maybe they were surrounded by more guys like Dylan.  
  
On this year's team, these three, Zeke, Josh, and Nico, and then Christian as
the year has gone on, they have to play well for us to win. To their credit,
they show up every day.  
  
But Josh, this might have been his overall best game of his year today, and
it's great to see him play well in March, especially because we missed him
when he didn't go with us to LA. You could see how much we missed him. So it's
great to have him back.  
  
Q. Josh, speaking of that, I was wondering if you could walk us through
the last few weeks for you, missing that trip, and was your confidence
lacking, and what did it feel like to get on track out there today?  
JOSH GREEN: As far as that goes, it's bad whenever you don't travel with your
team to give the support, it sucks, just being with them for the moral
support. It was bad. But at the same time I think we have a great training
staff, Justin, and the rest of the medical team at Arizona. I was able to
rehab back at home. I feel a lot better.  
  
As far as confidence goes, it was all good. I think the biggest thing was
coming into March and being confident and coming out with a win, just giving
it your all.  
  
Q. Sean, your reaction to the NCAA 's decision is to not admit
spectators to the tournament? Arizona travels very well, traditionally. What
would it mean if you get into the tournament to play in an empty gym?  
SEAN MILLER: No, it will be definitely different. And obviously it's not going
to be just different for us, anybody that's ever watched the tournament or
participated, it would be different.  
  
But obviously there's some brilliant people in our world. If that's the
decision, I'm sure it's very well thought out and it's in the best interests
of these guys.  
  
And at the end of the day, that's what counts the most, to protect our players
and student-athletes to the best of our ability.  
  
And I'm sure that decision was one that was hard to make, but we'll show up.
And if we're part of that tournament, I don't think it will affect our effort.
Clearly it will be different for everybody that's a part of it.

# [PAC-12 MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

### [Timmy Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38988)

### [Alfonso Plummer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38989)

### [Both Gach](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38990)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon State - 71, Utah - 69  
  
LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: The end, they made two big threes in the last 30 seconds.
And I thought we lacked a little discipline on the second to the last one, and
then we tried to step in on penetration for the last one and weren't fortunate
enough to get the call. But they hit two big threes, and obviously two really
nice passes that led to that.  
  
Proud of the resolve and the fight with our guys. We obviously had an
unbelievable shooting performance by Alfonso. And out-rebounded them, which I
thought was a positive. But 17 turnovers, you're not going to win very many
ballgames at the 1-3-1, half court disrupted us, as it has a few teams this
year. We spent some time preparing on it, but thought those were some of the
keys to the game.  
  
Q. Just given the way that Alfonso shot the ball and the fact you guys
were up 13 in the second half, how tough is this loss to take?  
LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Thanks for reminding me. They're always hard to take,
regardless. And there really aren't any little things in the game, and come
out on the losing -- it's really tough. I wasn't ready to speak to our team at
the end of the conference tournament. I didn't think it was going to happen
quite yet.  
  
But it's kind of the harsh reality, being 80 or 100 feet away from Oregon
State at one end of the spectrum celebrating in their locker room, and then
it's kind of the epitome of sports, we all ride the highs and lows of it.  
  
Our guys played really well in the first half, had an eight-point lead and
came in and extended that, and then we got stagnant with turnovers. We still
had open looks, a bunch of really nice open looks. They didn't go in for us,
and give credit to Oregon State for rallying behind that 1-3-1.  
  
Q. Is there any way you can celebrate this personally?  
ALFONSO PLUMMER: Just trying to help the team to win this one. So I'm just
going to go back to the gym, try to get better for the next year.  
  
Q. It 's been an up-and-down kind of year for you guys, but you've
always been competitive. Can you sum up this team and the season to this point
right now?  
TIMMY ALLEN: We stayed the course. Never gave in. Never gave up. Just
together.  
  
Q. The NIT would still appear to be an option for you guys. My question
is how will you guys spend the next few days, and would you welcome an NIT bid
if one were to come down Sunday night?  
LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: Oh, for sure. This group, as Timmy said, is connected. It's
as positive of a culture that we've had at Utah, and we've got a number of
young kids. We've been talking about it all year. It's been a little bit of
the story line. I don't think anybody wanted to talk about our youth, but the
reality is when you look at the team that we just played, and you've got a
couple of seniors in Kelley and Tinkle and Ethan, a lot of reps.  
  
And there's a number of times where we've got four or five guys on the floor,
oftentimes four freshmen. And this is about a process. That's in our practice
facility all over the place, trust the process. You're judged by wins and
losses, obviously. But what we need is experience. If we can garner some
experience from being in an NIT tournament because we weren't qualified for
the NCAA Tournament, then we'd love it.  
  
We can keep growing. It was one of the best experiences I had. I know this
isn't the time of year to talk about the NIT in light of our tournament and
everybody's aspirations to be in the NCAA.  
  
But when we got to the championship game of that thing a few years ago, that
was one of the best basketball experiences I had. And so that would be our
goal is to try to get back there, and we'd be committed to doing that.  
  
Q. Alfonso, at one point during the game you hit seven straight threes.
What was going through your mind at that time?  
ALFONSO PLUMMER: Just playing with confidence. My teammates trust me. They
give me the ball to shoot open shots.  
  
Q. Coach just touched upon what a young group this is, but also a group
that has an incredibly special bond. If this group stays together, what are
some things that are possible in the long run?  
BOTH GACH: I feel like we can do something special. Our coach keeps saying
we've got a young team, we stay the course, continue to get better, and I just
feel like we make something happen in the long run.  
  
Q. You got the ball back with 50 seconds to go. Was there any
consideration or maybe you did try to get maybe a two-for-one so you might
have the last shot? You were up by one point?  
LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: No, not in that environment with the trap, in particular.
It's really hard to manufacture a shot. If you can run some man stuff, maybe
you have a quick hitter.  
  
But it's really not as much of a play against the 1-3-1. We put our guys in
positions to make plays. If something presented itself. We were all for it,
but we weren't going to try to force anything.  
  
Q. Just from your vantage point, how did the complexion of that game
change? They threw a man at you, a 2-3 at you. How did things change when they
went to a 1-3-1?  
LARRY KRYSTKOWIAK: If you watch the Colorado game, Oregon State was down big
at Colorado, gets you standing a little bit, more than anything. And, again,
against the 1-3-1, we had a pretty good plan against man, I thought we did a
nice job executing the 2-3 zone, it got a little bit more complicated.  
  
If we look back on it, I know there was a number of open threes. It wasn't the
matter of the defense being stifling. It gets you standing around, and when
you get an open look against the 1-3-1, it's the unique pressure you don't
feel at other points in the game.  
  
Those shots didn't go in. I thought we had some really good looks. Credit the
defense. We knew it was coming. They played a number of different defenses all
year. And we missed some open looks.  
  
Q. Alfonso, I was wondering, you ended the season really well. You
started shooting better than you had the rest of the season. How are you going
to keep that going possibly in the NIT or also next season?  
ALFONSO PLUMMER: Just go to the gym. Keep shooting. Just keep the confidence I
played today. So, yeah, just stay in the gym, keep shooting.

# [PAC-12 MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Mike Hopkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34214)

### [Isaiah Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38994)

### [Marcus Tsohonis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38995)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 77, Washington - 70  
  
MIKE HOPKINS: Yeah, I think the game started off, they made a couple early
threes. I thought Arizona was really aggressive defensively. Isaiah got going,
as good as I've seen a player play.  
  
They were packing the paint so much that we were able to get some shots. And
unfortunately we had a game where we shot 3 for 23, a little bit of us and a
little bit of Arizona. But in a game like this, you've got to be able to make
some of those.  
  
We kept fighting when we got down the second half. We pressed them. Had a
good, valiant effort and just came up a little bit short. I've got to credit
Arizona for a really good game plan and a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Miller mentioned it was a little strange, just with
Saturday and then now. Did you feel any sense of that?  
  
MIKE HOPKINS: I didn't. We flew from Arizona straight to here. That was the
only difference. We had a good practice just like we would in Seattle.  
  
Arizona is a great program. Sean Miller is a great coach. They made shots
tonight, and we struggled. So hats off to Arizona.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Arizona played with more energy and enthusiasm this
time around compared to last week?  
ISAIAH STEWART: I definitely felt like they were more aggressive defensively.
I felt like their goal was to get up on us and basically just make it more
tough for us, since we just played them and beat them.  
  
Q. Marcus, it felt like, again, in the last game against Arizona, you
guys were really able to push the pace and score in transition. Was that just
not working today, or what were you doing differently?  
MARCUS TSOHONIS: Honestly, we emphasized to push the ball and swing the ball
more. I felt like it was kind of stagnant this game. We weren't able to --
they were playing aggressive defense this one. But their overall defense on
both ends was just -- they were everywhere. It was kind of hard. We didn't get
into our stuff, really.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys came out more in a 3-2 than a 2-3 that you typically
have run. What went into that decision? Was it a different look or something
like that?  
MIKE HOPKINS: No, just sometimes based on how they're playing, based on their
alignment, our alignment, shift to 2-3.  
  
Q. Coach, Isaiah really had it going in the first half, 18 points.
Everyone else had 12. Was it just one of those games for everyone else, or
what were you noticing in the first half?  
MIKE HOPKINS: Isaiah, like I said before, that first-half performance, he's
been Mr. Consistency every night, dominant in the paint, faced up. You saw all
the hard work everywhere, every night.  
  
And when they pack the paint the way that they do on him, you're going to have
opportunities to be able to score. And tonight we just didn't make a lot of
shots.  
  
You asked that question earlier about transition, I felt like in the first
half we had four or five, six opportunities where we threw it away or turned
it over where we should have scored. I think those are big plays that have to
happen in a game and a caliber of a team like Arizona. Those things have to
happen.  
  
And sometimes you just didn't have it, and a couple of those plays here and
there, they add up, for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, the play with Isaiah, it looked like it was going to be an and
one, and it was an offensive call. It seemed to turn the tide. How big was
that?  
MIKE HOPKINS: It's hard to referee. It's a tough call. It's going fast. Great
elite athletes, it could go either way. If it goes for us, it's a game changer
because you take the lead and you get the momentum; and it goes against you,
it's like a kidney punch.  
  
Those things happen. We still had our opportunities. We just -- like I said,
you've got to -- we have to be able to make some more shots than 3 for 23 from
three.  
  
Q. Sometimes shots just don 't go in. Was there anything Arizona did, or
was it just shots --  
MIKE HOPKINS: I thought we had a good rhythm. I think what Marcus said
earlier, this is a little 50/50, a little bit of Arizona, a little bit us,
where the ball was sticking too much. In the past two games, we were moving
the ball, sharing the ball. When two guys came, we were able to get more
rhythm. And that's when you make more shots, when there's better ball movement
and rhythm.  
  
And tonight it just -- it just didn't have the same pop. But I also think that
has a little bit to do with Arizona's pressure. They weren't allowing the ball
to move like that, overplaying, denying, those types of things. So you've got
to credit them, for sure.  
  
Q. Nahz just didn 't seem like he could get it going offensively
tonight. What was it about his game that you felt could have been better
executed?  
MIKE HOPKINS: I think the biggest thing with Nahz, is he's such a talented
player. He's had a great year. I think sometimes, he's such a scorer's
mentality, when two guys come, he just has to make the simple play.  
  
I think sometimes he gets into his scoring mode. But it's just one of those
games he didn't make a lot of shots tonight. He's been a really good player
for us all year. And he's going to be a great player for us next year. And
just had a bad game, bad shooting game.  
  
Q. Coach, the guy to your left may be one of the biggest warriors ever
to play at the University of Washington. How much thought have you given that
this might be the last game you get to coach him?  
MIKE HOPKINS: I don't like to think about that. I know it is. But we'll have a
time and place to talk about those things. This isn't the time.  
  
You love your team. And the thing that I love more about coaching is how this
team handled their adversity. They kept getting better. They kept fighting.
And we played our best basketball at the end of the year, that shows the
character of the players, and it shows the credit to our staff and we're
family.  
  
I've known this kid since he's been young. And he's going to have a great
career. You never want to lose your guys, same with Timmins, Quin Barnard and
Jason Crandall. It's hard in coaching, in college they're always flipping. But
I've never been around a kid like this, ever. And just honored to have that 12
months that I've had. And we'll be buying tickets to go watch him play. Well,
he better give me tickets (laughter.)  
  
Also, another thing, too, this kid, we go through it, you lose Quade, he's red
shirt. And this kid comes out, I didn't even know, and has an incredible year.
An incredible year. Elijah had to step up, but Marcus, I'm so proud of these
guys, I can't even stand it. And I just wanted to say that, because imagine
red shirting, and not knowing, next thing you know do you want to play? Want
to get out of your red shirt? And he said, yeah. And that kid is out there
busting his tail and getting better, and had a hell of a year, and was playing
his best basketball at the end of the year. Anyway, Go Dawgs.

# [PAC-12 MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Jerod Haase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28680)

### [Bryce Wills](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39014)

### [Oscar da Silva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39015)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
California - 63, Stanford - 51  
  
JEROD HAASE: This one is certainly a gut check for us. I believe there's 19
teams younger than us in college basketball this year. And I don't know that
there's been 19 teams that have been more consistent with their effort, with
the consistency of play. And for that I'm really, really proud.  
  
I did not think tonight was indicative of that team. I thought this would be
the one game where I didn't think we had the edge we've had throughout the
year. The reason for that I'll obviously figure out in time. I'm not sure if
the moment was big or there was just the desire of everybody to do it on their
own.  
  
I know there was a great, great desire to play great and put our best foot
forward, but we did not do that tonight. The physicality was a big piece of
it. Our turnovers were down, which means we usually do pretty well. Our
turnover shots were up.  
  
As we got to the paint and attacked, which was the game plan, we got in too
deep and didn't find others. So the turnover shots were a problem for us.  
  
Certainly not our best effort. Certainly a gut check, extremely disappointed.
And I'll let you guys ask questions.  
  
Q. For Oscar and/or Bryce, would you guys agree that this is one of the
more passive or nonaggressive efforts you guys have put considering how hard
you guys played all season long?  
BRYCE WILLS: I think today we just -- the intent was there and the care
factor, as Coach said, was there. But I think we laid a little bit of an egg
today. And I don't really have an answer for you as to why that happened. I
have to like sort of put my thoughts together.  
  
But just looking back on the game, I feel that there is just a lot of lessons
that can learned just outside of basketball that can be applied to life. And
just our basketball lives are on the line right now. And if we really want
something, we have to go get that. And we failed to do that today.  
  
OSCAR DA SILVA: I don't think we came out ready to handle what Cal showed us
today. We started slow. Continued slow. Continued slow. Finished slow. A few
bright moments, a few sparks that we had, clearly weren't enough for us to get
it done. Consistency is something that we've been talking about all year, and
today it didn't show.  
  
Q. Jaiden 's first start of the year today. Can you talk about the
decision process behind that?  
JEROD HAASE: Just a coach's decision. That's one of the fun parts about being
the head coach is I can make some of those decisions. Jaiden has done a nice
job and wanted to insert him into that lineup. I thought he played hard and
did some nice things. Just a coach's decision.  
  
Q. You broke every standard in national defense this year. How far away
are you guys on the other side of the ball from getting to that place or at
least closing the gap between where you guys are as a defensive team?  
JEROD HAASE: We're actually not that far. Looking back, I think it's -- with
just little bumps and bruising injuries, our practice time has been a little
limited over the last few weeks, and I think that's been a little impactful
with what's going on.  
  
I think offensively we're not that far away. Tonight I felt like there was a
great desire to execute the game plan, which is get to the rim, go attack
inside first. But there was also, I think, a great deal of individual
confidence and desire to -- and not driven from selfishness, but driven from I
can do this for the team. And those were some of the shots that I think didn't
produce well.  
  
So to answer your question, to be able to be a lead offensive team, it has to
be a team that shares the basketball, that makes plays for others first.  
  
That did not happen tonight. It was not driven by selfishness, but it was a
desire to do -- kind of put the team on their shoulders and that was not
there.  
  
Our ability to be an elite offensive team is not that far away, even though at
times it does look like it.  
  
Q. Coach, Sunday is a long way away from now. I assume you believe you
belong in the tournament. Do you think you 've built enough of a r�sum�?  
JEROD HAASE: In terms of r�sum�, everybody can discuss that. When you look at
No. 6 defense in the country, you look at the consistency with which we've
played, really a big-time schedule, the quad 1 wins, our net ranking will be
fantastic.  
  
We'll have a r�sum�, if you look at a piece of paper, I think we would be in.
But on the flip side of that, it's the eye test. If you take tonight out of
the equation, I think our eye test looks pretty good. We have a team that
competes defensively, for the most part have been elite consistently this
year.  
  
Offensively we turned the ball over a little too much, but we have a group
that wants to play together. We have involvement, we have player movement. And
so I think from the eye test, and from -- I guess I can speak firsthand on
that because I've seen this team a lot, I do think that we have the ability to
be an NCAA team and do something if we end up getting there.

# [PAC-12 MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Mark Fox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20598)

### [Kareem South](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39016)

### [Matt Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36725)

### [Paris Austin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32927)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
California - 63, Stanford - 51  
  
MARK FOX: First of all, we beat a terrific team. This league deserves to have
seven teams in the NCAA Tournament. Stanford had some great wins. If you look
at our league, the 12th seed in our conference, we beat Baylor, Colorado beat
Dayton. Utah beat Kentucky. We have some unbelievable wins in the nonleague.
For us to beat up on each other is to be expected.  
  
Our team is way better today than we were at the start of the year because we
have a new system, new coach and everything else. And so I don't think this is
a bad loss for Stanford. I think they deserve to be in the postseason. We're
very proud of our team today. We defended at an extremely high level, and we
were able to sustain that and advance until tomorrow.  
  
Tomorrow, if we're -- if health and the safety is the No. 1 priority that we
say it is, then fully support keeping just those that are necessary to compete
in the game tomorrow. And hopefully we can regroup and play well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Paris, talk about your game.  
  
PARIS AUSTIN: Tonight me and my teammates, we did a good job offensively. But
most importantly we defended. Myself, I just wanted to go out there and make
plays that led to winning tonight. And that's just what I wanted to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mr. Bradley.  
  
MATT BRADLEY: Yeah, so I felt like my teammates kept me composed throughout
the game, our coach, as well. I felt like I competed well. Stuff wasn't going
for me here and there but we stuck with it and kept defending, and I'm proud
of my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kareem?  
  
KAREEM SOUTH: Our main objective was to win a game. So my job was to do
whatever it took to win. And whether that was making shots, getting stops
defensively, leading by example, I just wanted to do whatever it took. And our
teammates did a really good job following that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask the players, obviously playing in front of a crowd is
part of the fun of a tournament. What do you guys think about coming out
tomorrow and not having anybody else in the arena?  
PARIS AUSTIN: I think the players and everyone's safety is the most important
thing. We love to play in front of fans, but right now safety is the most
important thing.  
  
MATT BRADLEY: I agree with that.  
  
Q. For any of the players, speaking of defense, you guys limited da
Silva to four points on 2-of-11 shooting. That might be a season low for him.
What were you able to do so effectively in terms of help defense or doubling
or tripling him real quickly to force him into such a tough shooting night?  
MATT BRADLEY: Our bigs aren't in here with us. It really goes out to Andre
Kelly and Grant Anticevich and D.J. and Lars. They stuck to the game plan, and
they stayed aggressive on him. Da Silva is a really good player. Coach knew
his tendencies, and we just stuck with it. We competed the whole 40 minutes.
And that's the result.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Can you add more about defense and rebounding?  
  
MARK FOX: Well, we lost the first game to Stanford, and we scored 52 points
and our defense failed us because they have a good offensive team. In the
second game against Stanford, we scored 52 points, but we won because our
defense was terrific. We knew that tonight, coming into the game, that the
only chance we had to win the game was to be great defensively. And I thought
for the most part, outside of one little spurt in the first half, our defense
was terrific.  
  
Q. Coach, win 300 in your career. Any thoughts about the significance of
that milestone?  
MARK FOX: Not really. I've been blessed. I coached some unbelievable players
at Nevada, and I coached some unbelievable competitors when I was in the SEC.
One of them was here tonight, and -- little guy named J.J. Frazier.  
  
I've been blessed to have good players and coaches. I haven't thought about
the number, to be honest with you, but feel really fortunate.  
  
Q. Congratulations. And, guys, congratulations. It 's survive and
advance, though. March, you win, but you don't have much time. You have to get
ready for tomorrow. Can you talk about what you have to do against the Bruins
tomorrow?  
MARK FOX: It's been a long time since we played UCLA. They're a completely
different team. When we played them, I told our staff, I said: They're getting
ready to get hot. I could tell that their team -- that they made a transition,
either the day before we played them or during that game. We couldn't score,
their defense was elite. And it's remained that way.  
  
We'll have to study them late tonight and figure out how we can make a basket
or two. Our team is different now, too. And so hopefully we'll be able to
regroup and come back tomorrow and compete.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. The year before you started at Georgia, they
won the SEC Tournament in front of an empty arena there. How does that change
the dynamic for the defense in terms of calling out screens and switching on D
when there 's not 20,000 fans in the arena like that?  
MARK FOX: That was two years before I got there, I believe. And I don't
believe the arena was empty, I believe each school had a number of tickets
that they were allowed to come to the game. And that was a unique situation,
which I don't have a lot of information about because it was before my time.
Dennis Felton, the coach at the time, did a great job to win two games in one
day and to win in that situation.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

### [McKinley Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34825)

### [Tyler Bey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36844)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington State - 82, Colorado - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, looked like it never got going.  
  
TAD BOYLE: Credit to Washington State. They were the better team tonight. And
CJ Elleby had a heck of a game. Came out on fire, and got himself going and
ended up with 30.  
  
We've been talking now for the last five games how our defense is not been
good enough to win games, whether it's first half, second half, full ballgame,
it doesn't matter.  
  
Tonight they shot 70 percent in the second half, and we couldn't get back in
the game. We couldn't get a stop, we couldn't claw back.  
  
We've got some guys on the team struggling offensively to shoot the ball and
make shots. Tonight we did a great job I thought of getting to the free-throw
line tonight, we shot 32 free throws and we haven't done that in a long time.
We attacked, but we didn't make enough of those.  
  
But the bottom line is we couldn't get stops when we had to get stops. Our
ball screen defense, we tried three different coverages all night, and none of
them were really effective.  
  
Switching a little bit late was better, but too little, too late. I've got to
do a better job at these guys coach. Tyler and McKinley played their hearts
out, and they're two All-Conference guys, and deservedly so.  
  
Our team right now has lost its identity. We've lost a fight. We've lost a
toughness that we've got to get back. And thank goodness we played really,
really well the first 27 games of the season to put ourselves in a position, I
think, to be in the postseason.  
  
But nothing is guaranteed until we see our name pop up on Sunday. And
certainly our seed probably has dropped. And we're going to be in for a
really, really difficult game probably in the first round.  
  
But if we can find who we were that first 27 games we'll be okay. If we can't,
it will be one and done. We certainly don't want that. We're going to use the
next five or six days to get ourselves back to where we were. I thought we
were coming into Vegas. I thought your practices were good, our mojo was good,
I thought our body language was good.  
  
Boy, when things started going bad for us on the floor, we don't come together
as a group right now, we kind of splinter, and that's not a good sign.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Are there nights when you feel like it's not the night?  
  
TAD BOYLE: No, I mean, look, you've got to figure out a way to win when you
don't play your best. And we haven't figured that out. We've done that in
November and December a little bit. It's a long season, but we haven't been
able to do that as late. It's hard to do late in the season because other
teams are better.  
  
Washington State wants to win just like we do. They don't want their season to
end. We talk all the time about it's not going to be given to us. You have to
earn what you get. Especially in March. And harder to win late in the year.  
  
You've got to have better fight and better toughness than we had tonight. I
thought offensively in the first half we just got pumped at times. We turned
the ball over. They were the aggressors, and that's why they were up ten.  
  
I still thought we could get back and win that game. I really felt like that
at halftime. I felt like that midway through the second half. We cut it to ten
in the second half, but we could never cut it to less than that, we kept
giving up a three or fouled a jump shooter or we didn't box out on a free
throw.  
  
You can point to a lot of different plays that game defensively where it's
like, okay, we're switching our ball screen, we fall down, the guy goes in and
gets an and one. Unless you get stops, you can't get back in games, and we
weren't able to do that this game.  
  
Q. All year long this team has had a habit of fouling three-point
shooters. We saw it even against Northern Iowa. Why has this team been unable
to correct that?  
TAD BOYLE: I've got to do a better job as their coach. Maybe we've got to
drill it more. We talk about it a lot, we show it on film a lot. We fouled two
three-point shooters, fouled a two-point shooter, too. I'm not sure it was a
foul, but it was called a foul. 18 jump shooters we fouled this year, at least
that's to my count.  
  
And that's something when the season is over with I'll look at. Something we
have to get better at because this team, for some reason, it just happens. I
think we gave up two four-point plays tonight. I have to do a better job.  
  
Q. McKinley, can you tell me what 's going on with the squad right now
emotionally and trying to get back to where you were? It's been a struggle the
last couple of games.  
MCKINLEY WRIGHT: Obviously it sucks right now on the losing side. Came here to
win a Pac-12 Championship and fell short. It's not how we wanted it to be.  
  
But I love my team. I'll never give up on these guys. And especially these
two, Tyler to my left and Coach Boyle, they believed in me since I stepped on
campus. They've got my trust and I've got theirs.  
  
Q. You know how tough a rebuild is, and you take a look at the other
sideline, what Kyle Smith has been able to do, first year in Pullman, how
tough is it in what he 's going through and what he's built so far?  
TAD BOYLE: I think Kyle Smith, Washington, State, Mark Fox, Cal, and they won
a big game tonight before us, beat Stanford, and obviously Mick Cronin at
UCLA, all three coaches that came into this league are good coaches. And
they've made our league better. And that's a good thing. Kyle is a good coach.
They've got some talented guys. CJ Elleby is a good player. And Bonton is a
really capable scorer. Jervae Robinson can shoot the ball. He's done a nice
job with that team. And they just try to find a way to stay in games.  
  
And I wish I could honestly say that I feel like Washington State beat us
tonight. And the credit goes to them, don't get me wrong, I don't want to take
anything away from Washington State. As the coach from Colorado, I felt like
we beat ourselves with our lack of ability to execute offensively and to get
any stops defensively in the second half. But Kyle has done a great job, he's
got a good team. And I wish him the best.  
  
Q. For the players, Coach just alluded to this, when things start to go
wrong for this bunch right now, it just seems to snowball and you can 't snap
out of it. Do you sense that on the floor? Do you feel like that happens when
things start going against you?  
TYLER BEY: I don't know. I feel like when we miss shots, we put our heads down
and it affects our defense. But we can't have that. We've got to just keep our
composure and just move on from it. That's something we've got to work on.  
  
Q. Tyler, a follow-up real quick. You guys are at your low point,
probably playing some of your worst basketball of the year, if not the worst.
How do you guys put this in the rearview, sleep on it tonight with that bad
feeling and go into probably a tournament game and have to get back to that
team that was 21-6?  
TYLER BEY: I feel like we're going to figure it out. We've got one more chance
to make it in a tournament. And we've got to come together as a team and just
figure it out. We've got to go practice hard and keep watching film to learn
from our mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, can you put your finger on or have any explanation for what
has happened to D 'Shawn Schwartz in the last few weeks? He looks like a
player that's completely lost his confidence.  
TAD BOYLE: He's not the only one. I'm not going to call a kid out. Because
D'Shawn is a good player, and he's a great young man. And he works as hard on
his game as anyone we have, especially shooting the basketball. Confidence is
a real delicate thing as a coach. I've really tried to be positive with
D'Shawn. He's got to believe in himself. I think self-belief -- the one thing
I know about McKinley and Tyler, these two guys really believe in themselves.
I said this after the Cal game, I said if the rest of our guys believed in
themselves as much as they believe in McKinley and I would put Tyler in there,
too, because they've got a lot of belief in these two guys, they are our
horses. But these guys need some help. It's not just D'Shawn, it's a multitude
of guys. You look at the stat sheet tonight and thank god Tyler and McKinley
were on our team. It would have been really, really ugly. It was ugly, but it
would have been really ugly. We've got to have some guys step up.  
  
And that's the challenge I have as a coach. It's so much more of a
psychological thing right now than it is a physical thing. And I said this
facetiously a few years ago, but I said if I knew I was going to coach, I
didn't know I was going to coach when I went to college, but if I did know I
would have majored in psychology not in business, and it would serve me well
right now. Right now I'm trying to find a way to be positive with these guys
and get them to believe in themselves. And that's a tricky thing to do.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Jerry Stackhouse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14587)

### [Dylan Disu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39021)

### [Saben Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36742)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
Arkansas 86, Vanderbilt 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
We'll ask Coach for a couple thoughts on the game.  
  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: Not the ending that we were looking for. Thought we were
really excited to play this game. Guys were in a good spirit, a lot of
confidence, a lot of momentum coming into this game.  
  
I think it just didn't work out for us. We got a lot of good looks that we
were happy to get and didn't go down for us early in the game. Arkansas on the
other hand came out and got off to a pretty good start. Some of it was our own
doing, again just not being able to have the disposition and urgency that we
needed to start the game. We eventually got it, but it was just a little too
late.  
  
I thought our guys fought hard till the end. Still disappointing because we
had other plans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Saben, you certainly were playing your best basketball down the
stretch. How different do you think the outlook of this team is going into
next season?  
SABEN LEE: I think it looks really well. I feel like over time you saw us
continue to make strides in various ways, so I feel like it's going to go in
the right direction going into next season.  
  
Q. Dylan, how excited are you to look forward to next year with all
these guys coming back?  
DYLAN DISU: Yeah, I'm real excited. I feel like we played very well at the end
of the season. Obviously tonight wasn't what we were looking for, like Coach
Stack said. Guys improved throughout the season, myself included, improved on
our games. Going into the summer we want to continue to improve our games and
have a much better season next season.  
  
Q. Saben, you 're barely coming out of games. You've had 30-point nights
4 of your last 11 games, you're handling the ball, defenses key on you. How
did you hold up and do the things you did over the last two months of the
season?  
SABEN LEE: I would say just trusting my teammates, just making the right
reads. I mean, don't get frustrated if you're receiving a lot of defensive
attention. Just making the right reads and the right plays.  
  
Coach Stackhouse, he does a great job trying to get me in the right spots. He
just provides a lot of things for me out there on the floor.  
  
Q. Dylan, what do you think is the next step for you going into your
sophomore season?  
DYLAN DISU: I feel like I have to get stronger, get in the weight room with
Coach Lewis this summer and definitely work on my body. Being able to get to
the rim easier and staying on balance.  
  
Q. Saben, you obviously had an outstanding year. What is next for you?
The NBA waters are possibly something you may want to test. Is that something
you 'd consider?  
SABEN LEE: I mean, I'm not really thinking about that too much right now. It's
a little early. We just got out of the game. Just trying to be here for my
team right now.  
  
Q. Dylan, we saw a little bit at the five today, a little bit at the top
of the zone. Do you think being shorthanded at times in this season has made
your game more versatile?  
DYLAN DISU: I think you could say that. Myself, I'm a guy who is going to do
whatever it takes to win. I'll play whatever position Coach Stack asks me to
play. This season I guess I had to be more versatile, so yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Three of your four double-digit scorers tonight were freshmen. What
does that tell you about the long-term outlook of this team?  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: Well, I think our guys had real valuable reps this year, in
practice and in games. They were able to make mistakes and play through their
mistakes.  
  
I don't know going forward, the young guys coming in as a group will have that
opportunity because we're going to be an older group that really understands
how we want to play and how we want to do things. Their learning curve is
going to have to be a little bit shorter to be able to get on the floor as
much as these guys have.  
  
I'm proud of this group, man. Proud of how they came every day and brought it.
They stuck together. They had some tough times, some adversity. We dealt with
it. Even today adversity coming here with all the situation that's
surrounding, all the things we're hearing on the news. Now we're expected to
play a basketball game at a high level.  
  
Sometimes we forget, a lot of these guys' first experience of playing in a big
tournament like this. For the most part I thought we handled it better as the
game went on. We didn't handle it very well from the very beginning. We were
in the wrong places doing some things out of character. Sometimes I think the
moment got the most of us today.  
  
Again, I think just like earlier part of the season, this experience of being
here is going to help us next time. All the fanfare, the limelight, the SEC
does a great job of putting on an event. Sometimes it can be overwhelming.
Maybe that was the case tonight that won't be the case next time we're here.  
  
Q. The NBA announced they were suspending the season for now. The move
here with fans tomorrow. What is your take on a concerning situation?  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: The NBA is a real brotherhood. First and foremost, my
prayers go out to Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz. I know they were one of the
first teams that this decision probably came down to cancel the season was
because of what happened there. So hopefully he's okay.  
  
It's really a scary time because we don't really know. There have been some
cases here, talked about here. We don't know. We're going to try to do
whatever we can. Supposed to be meeting with our administration, going to meet
as a staff tomorrow, just try to get some guidance on what we need to do,
making sure the best things we need to do to try to deep our guys safe.  
  
Kind of wait and see right now.  
  
Q. What Saben has done the last 11 games, schematically how do you go
from where you were to where you got him?  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: I don't quite remember five people being on him, but it's
part of the game. He's going to be a guy that commands a lot of attention. We
try to share the ball and move the ball. There were some opportunities today
when there were some guys open where he probably could have made an extra
pass, made something.  
  
We just got to continue to be aggressive but at the same time be smart, play
with poise, give ourselves a little better chance.  
  
It's not about these guys, their effort level or wanting to compete. They want
to do it. Sometimes it gets to a situation when guys aren't making a shot, we
feel like I have to do it myself. We have to get out of that mode and make
sure we continue to include our teammates. We're the type of team, the way we
want to play, we need everybody. Hopefully the shots start to fall, start to
come around.  
  
For me it's getting the right shots. Saben's game has changed over the course
of the year. He had a different role coming into the season. He was asked to
be a six man coming off the bench because that was what I thought was best for
our team in the beginning when Aaron went down, Clevon went down, we needed
him to be more of a primary scorer for us. He stepped up and did that. My hat
goes off to the kid. Over the last two years, probably nobody had more things
change during the course of a season than I did for him. Every time he stepped
up and responded.  
  
He's a real coachable kid, a real likable kid. I think he really helped
himself. He helped himself as far as probably some opportunities at the next
level. Is he completely ready to take that step? That's something that we'll
talk about him and his family and we'll go from there.  
  
Q. Back to the Coronavirus situation. Students have to be out of the
dorms Friday. Do you have a plan yet? How do things look moving forward?  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: I mean, it just all happened. A lot of that stuff came out
today when we were really trying to focus on the game. Even though I know
about it, it's like, Okay, let's try to get through tonight, then we'll spend
a little more time with that over this evening and in the morning, meeting
with our staff, trying to figure out the best way we can help these kids, help
expedite what needs to happen from here.  
  
We need to figure out storage, all those different types of things. We got
some work to do over the next couple days. Whatever it is that we need to do
to help facilitate that, we will.  
  
Q. You 've had a lot of changes this year. Going into next season
knowing you have a lot of young guys, stability, how does that make you feel,
your second year on the job?  
JERRY STACKHOUSE: I'm excited about it. I'm excited about the pieces we
already have, that they haven't been able to see. I have to look at every day
in practice and watch them have really good practices. D.J. and Quentin,
they're going to be big additions for us because Quentin, just his ability to
give us more of a post presence, not just to create his own, but be a
facilitator in the post, that's something we didn't have all year this year.  
  
Even with Clevon, he's not a guy we really throw the ball into the post to.
His strength was his ability to space out on the floor, being a big-time
offensive rebounder for us.  
  
I think next year I'm going to have a lot of little toys in my toy chest. I
can't wait to play with them. It's exciting to see the possibility of who we
could be and having a few more options next year.  
  
You never know, it's not a foregone conclusion that Aaron is gone. I think the
way things are trending for him, some of the things we've been seeing in the
mock draft, it's exciting. I'm excited for him, to possibly be a first-round
pick. If that's the case, he can't stay, I'm going to push him out the door.  
  
If that's not the case, man, we really have a cupboard that's full, something
I'd be extremely excited about as the summer goes on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Greg Sankey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28587)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, everyone, for coming. As you can tell, things have been
changing by the minute, and we appreciate Commissioner Sankey coming in to
provide some updates and answer some of your questions. Commissioner?  
  
GREG SANKEY: Thanks. I did not expect to be back this quickly, but some people
asked, and I knew that potential was present. It was five years ago literally
at this moment that I walked into a meeting of our presidents and chancellors
to be told that I was going to be the eighth commissioner of the Southeastern
Conference, and we've had a lot that's happened in those five years, a lot
that's great, a lot that's difficult. That's the role when you step into a
leadership position.  
  
But I've not had a situation as difficult and emotional as this one to make a
recommendation to our presidents and chancellors that we cancel the remainder
of our men's basketball tournament. It was a moment where I had to stop and
actually catch myself and recompose myself.  
  
I tell you that simply to say there's no one in this conference who's taken
these decisions lightly, and I would not want to work with another set of
presidents, chancellors, and athletic directors in the world. I have the
utmost respect for each of the campus leaders and thank them for their
engagement, their work, their consideration, their discussion, and support
during the past 24 hours.  
  
I also want to say to our coaches I've not been able to reach each of our 14
men's basketball coaches. When we made the decision, we had some succeeding
decisions to be made. So first was the cancellation of the remainder of the
SEC Men's Basketball Tournament, which then raises the question what do you do
with regular season competition? All regular season competition involving SEC
teams with one exception I'll speak of has been suspended through March 30.
That one exception is NCAA Championship events that may be conducted, which
will be subject to NCAA authority from a participation standpoint and
institutional decision-making.  
  
Practically, we have teams in Albuquerque at the Indoor Track and Field
National Championship. The NCAA has adjusted their format or their support.
The access around that created what I've learned is called community space
among people. We're not going to interfere with those out there. There's a
Swimming and Diving National Championship coming, Gymnastics nationally, we'll
see the status of those, in addition to the Men's and Women's Basketball
Tournaments that the NCAA sponsors.  
  
For us it means we're not playing basketball in Nashville the remainder of the
week. Part of the hurt here is the city's been through a lot in the last
couple of weeks. I don't have a Nashville Strong T-shirt, I will, because
we're a part of this community through our events, through our annual
presence, our media days that are coming, our basketball tournaments that are
here annually well into the 30s.  
  
We have a special relationship here, and I want to say to the mayor, to the
people of this great city, to the Predators, the Sports Foundation, the
Convention and Visitors Bureau, how much we appreciate them, and there is
sorrow in our heart too for having to adjust.  
  
To our fans, I know there will be a great deal of frustration. There was last
night a lot of bewilderment. We have a public health situation in this country
and across the globe that is emerging. I'm not an epidemiologist. I'm not a
researcher in immunology or infectious disease, but those who are engaged at
the NCAA level provided some stark information yesterday that guided the NCAA
to close its tournament to public attendance. That then guided us.  
  
Literally as I walked up here last night, the NBA stopped the game and had a
player diagnosed with coronavirus. I had a text exchange a few moments ago
with Billy Donovan, who's the first face I saw in that story and is a friend.
As you were asking me, going through my mind is I have a responsibility to
care for people, both our staff, our student-athletes, our coaches, and our
fans, and we made the best decisions possible at the time, but information has
developed.  
  
We also had questions from people this morning about, wow, I have to get on a
bus. I'm a tennis student-athlete. I'm not comfortable doing that. I think our
student-athletes in men's basketball saw what happened in the NBA, and they
look to that, many of them, as the next step in our basketball opportunity,
and it just creates questions. So this was the appropriate decision made at
the best possible time, even though a difficult time, and it affects our
basketball tournament here and, as I said, other spring sports through March
30th.  
  
A number of you will ask about return to play. We have work to do there. I
don't have all of the answers. I told my staff I don't know is a perfectly
good answer from time to time. It can't just be I don't know. You're going to
have to do the work to engage and learn how to answer the question eventually.
So we've created an interim period where we will work with our campuses to
determine how we return to our normal operation. It may not be March 30. It
may be beyond. But that remains to be seen. We've identified a time frame
where we can engage in conversation and in decision-making.  
  
Pretty quickly, we've talked about recruiting issues, spring practice,
practice. I don't have all the answers. There's a rather famous practice --
we're talking about practice press conference. I don't want that necessarily
to be me. So what we said is at the president's and chancellor's level we'll
delegate authority to our athletics directors to make some of these
operational decisions, and that conversation has continued since I departed
the room. We're not all at destinations at this time.  
  
We may not govern every one of those elements. In fact, the NCAA may need to
engage and quickly govern some of those elements. I've sent a text to Mark
Emmert saying the NCAA should engage in on and off campus recruiting policies
and changes and, candidly, restrictions for a period of time while we're all
dealing with this. That would set everyone on an even plane rather quickly.  
  
With that set of introductory comments, I'll do my best to answer questions.  
  
Q. Commissioner, I 'm sure this will be part of the review between now
and March 30th, but some of the spring sport championships that are fixed
date, fixed location championships, would there be any possibility of those
dates pushing back at all, or will it just be a truncated season?  
GREG SANKEY: Our gymnastics championships and equestrian championships will
not happen. Those two are cancelled. Again, those are difficult decisions and
were part of the decision here. We have a March 30th date. The remainder of
spring sports championships are after that date. So when we go to golf,
tennis, which are the next sets of sports that are up, we'll have an
opportunity to evaluate and answer that question later, the same for baseball,
outdoor track -- excuse me. Softball, outdoor track, and baseball in that
sequence.  
  
I had a question about Destin already too. I haven't altered that plan right
now.  
  
Q. Greg, you said there was stark information that you were given by the
NCAA. Can you expound on that? Was that just medical information? What exactly
was that information?  
GREG SANKEY: I don't have all of that detail, Adam. We have a representative
on the NCAA board of Governors, Dr. Eli Capilouto. They had a call that was
called suddenly yesterday afternoon, as I understand, and in my debrief with
him, just the overview of that information, what was being shared, there are
six medical doctors on the COVID-19 advisory panel. There's another individual
who works in international events, security and management, and a set of
former and current student-athletes. They shared information. I don't have all
of those details, but it was about spread, about the need to interrupt the
potential spread, and the role of college athletics and big events in engaging
in stopping that potential spread.  
  
Q. Greg, have you given any thought to extending eligibility for seniors
who have been affected by this, whether it 's winter sports or spring sports
or whatever?  
GREG SANKEY: Not at this point. That would be one of those issues on a long
list of additional items to consider, and I don't think we have to come to
that conclusion right now.  
  
Q. Greg, I know that a lot 's been going on, but what kind of
discussions have you had with your football coaches about their spring
practices? What discussions have happened there?  
GREG SANKEY: I was on a conference call with one of our athletic departments
where that was asked. Our athletic director talked about that afterwards.
We've limited the size clearly of on campus events, and campuses are doing
that individually, but I don't have a prescriptive list right now around
what's going to happen with spring practice, spring football.  
  
Q. Greg, you sort of already answered this, but how much was it a factor
of a player possibly infecting another player here in the tournament?  
GREG SANKEY: That had been on our mind for a number of days and weeks. We felt
with what we knew at that time that we could still move forward. When you're
about to walk up here, you look at your phone, and you have a text message,
and then you see a story with an NBA coach, Billy, who we all know from his
work here, and the decision in that story that the NBA has suspended play
after a test. Are you going to be proactive or reactive? We felt right now,
given what's happening, we needed to be proactive at this point.  
  
Q. Commissioner, the SEC Baseball Tournament is going to be in a couple
of months. Any changes or updates to mention about that?  
GREG SANKEY: We don't have any changes right now. That March 30th date gives
us an opportunity to take a step back from a rather intense 24, 36 hours and
consider the direction with the remainder of the spring as scheduled or any
adjustments. Right now that March 30 date has the most importance, I think, as
a milestone.  
  
Q. Is there going to be a later date?  
GREG SANKEY: We'll see.  
  
Q. Pending whatever decision the NCAA makes about its tournament, would
you allow your schools to go to the tournament in light of the information
that you have?  
GREG SANKEY: Part of what we've discussed is that subject to NCAA authority
and institutional decision-making, if the NCAA continues with events, our
teams will be able to participate in those championships. Knowing that the
NCAA is digging deeply into these issues, should those events continue, we
think that's the appropriate approach. Very different than on campus or
neutral site or traveling under regular season competition.  
  
But I think that our national office has some work to do on each of those
elements.  
  
Q. Greg, did you get a sense this morning that coaches, players, those
who are in Nashville maybe didn 't want to play even with playing for the
automatic bid and that sort of thing?  
GREG SANKEY: Not that directly. I was here on Tuesday evening before a dinner
I needed to attend to see the teams practicing, and it was Ole Miss with
Kermit and Tom and his team with Georgia. I asked both coaches, are your teams
focused and ready to play? Absolutely was the answer. I took that as what we'd
expect.  
  
Yesterday I think people were focused. I had a question a week ago from a
coach about should we do this, but not necessarily predicting this outcome.  
  
If you'll allow me a moment, I'm going to tell you a story about 2008 that is
one of my favorite images.  
  
We had a tornado hit the Georgia Dome. Many of you were there and can probably
recall where you were sitting. None of us slept the night. Mark Womack was
leading. Mike Slive was on the basketball committee. So he was sequestered in
Indianapolis at that time. I was doing what I did at that point. We moved to
Georgia Tech. We had a doubleheader for one team. Georgia-Kentucky played.
Georgia won. Georgia won again, and then Georgia won the Championship.  
  
There was a student-athlete on that team walking down the hallway carrying our
championship trophy saying, this is the best day of my life. I have felt the
responsibility to give that team another opportunity, but the greater
responsibility is the health and the information that's come about. That's to
say this is important, and I think our teams are focused on accessing that
opportunity.  
  
In talking quickly now with our coaches, what I've heard is those guys look at
the NBA. When that happens at the NBA level, they're saying you want me to
post up and guard closely and do these sorts of things. So I think that that
thought, that kind of question in their minds was developing. That's my sense
from some of the coaches with whom I've spoken, and I've not even talked to
half. That's now been there in a different way.  
  
Thank you for indulging me with my story, but you do a lot of work. A lot of
it's never seen. A lot of it's questioned. We have staff over there who are
filled with questions like you, and those types of moments are motivation.  
  
Q. Speaking of being proactive rather than reactive, there 's a lot of
momentum with events being cancelled, and I wonder what sense you have about
the NCAA Tournament, whether it's going to be played?  
GREG SANKEY: They have a tough road ahead in decision-making. I think any of
you can judge reactively or proactively. We played last night, and then we
reacted. You make the best decisions possible with the best available
information. The NCAA leadership is going to have to make that. I won't judge
right now what the outcome may be. There's a pause. They've got some time,
candidly, that I did not have today, and I would encourage them to use time to
fully evaluate, be thoughtful, and determine whether or not we might be able
to go forward with any of the NCAA Championships in this relatively short
window.  
  
So you have wrestling, Missouri has the sport of wrestling. I haven't checked
the qualifiers. I mentioned indoor track and field, obviously basketball.
That's why we're here, both men's and women's. Gymnastics. I hurt for all
those student-athletes. It just means more. You saw a little bit of that
emotion, but I know the pride that exists in this conference for having the
access to National Championships is meaningful to young people.  
  
Q. Greg, you mentioned there 's no prescriptive list for football, but
would you as an office recommend coaches be pulled back, or would there be any
sort of discussion about recruiting, avoiding just being out on the road right
now?  
GREG SANKEY: I'll go larger. There's no list for any of this. I have an
undergraduate degree, a Masters degree from Syracuse. This was never in one of
my Masters classes. We have a few law degrees in their offices. I checked with
each of them. No, they never had this one in our law school classes. So that's
reality. We're learning. We're making the best decisions on the best available
information.  
  
We did have conversations about recruiting I referenced and have stopped off
campus and on campus recruiting for a period of time. That could be extended.
I've identified the NCAA needs to fully engage on this issue as well. The
practice issue may be for them nationally. I think we had some conversations.
I don't know that we came to a destination, so that means it's still on that
list that we're creating.  
  
Q. Greg, we saw last night with the decision to keep fans out and then
this morning with cancellations around the country, it 's kind of a chain
reaction from conference to conference. How much were the decisions here at
the SEC done in consultation with other commissioners like yourself from other
leagues and the NCAA?  
GREG SANKEY: I'll give just a commendation to my colleagues in what are called
the autonomy conferences, to Larry, to Bob -- Kevin's brand new. He walked
into this. Jim lives down the street. He picked the perfect time to retire, it
appears, for this one, and to John as well. We do talk. We obviously have
common issues to talk about on a regular basis, but our communication has
accelerated.  
  
We've all made independent decisions, but as I talk about best available
decision based on best available information, that collaboration helps provide
better and best available information. We all had to go back to our own boards
and act independently. We did that. We could have made a different decision,
but I think somebody asked me the timing last night. We knew at 5:45 Central
that they were going to adjust our attendance for the following day, and today
I think we had a call at 10:30 this morning knowing that we had a noon tip-off
and we needed to move quickly to make this decision today.  
  
That was our independent decision, but the ability to collaborate is the kind
of work that leaders should do at this level.  
  
Thank you everyone. Appreciate your interest and your coverage. I know you
have a job to do, and you've got some space to fill that you didn't expect to
have to fill in different ways the next couple of days. So thank you for your
work.

## March 12, 2020

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Mason Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39019)

### [Isaiah Joe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36759)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
Arkansas 86, Vanderbilt 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas.  
  
We will begin with an opening comment from coach.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought we did a really good job defensively, in the first
half especially, defending Vanderbilt, taking away the three ball. Our three-
ball defense for the entire game has been kind of what it's been all year,
which is really good. We did a good job on the backboards tonight. It's been
kind of a problem for us, rebounding the ball.  
  
Again, the ball movement tonight was as good as we've seen in a really, really
long time, sharing the basketball, having 17 assists.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You got off to such a good start. I think you were up 25-9. I don 't
think Vanderbilt ever made it closer than 10. How big was that to get off to
that kind of start?  
MASON JONES: It was good to get on a good run. We was eager to play today. We
wanted to set the tone early for people that want to watch us play. We came
out ready to go. We was really ready to play. We had one practice earlier,
everybody was eager to play. I knew that was going to carry over to the game
and you saw it. We was on a big lead and we were just able to maintain the
lead the whole game.  
  
ISAIAH JOE: That early lead was good for us. We knew we had to come out with
the energy that we did. We knew we had to get off to a good start so we
wouldn't have to play behind the whole game. So once we got that lead, we just
knew we had to execute our offense and get defensive stops to hold it.  
  
Q. The SEC announced they 're not going to have fans at any more games,
maybe family members. How odd do you think that's going to be playing South
Carolina tomorrow with an empty arena?  
MASON JONES: It don't mean nothing. We just going to get out there and go play
just like we in the park or something, we just going to play hard. It's still
going to show a W or L at the end of the day. We want to come out with a W, so
we going to bring the same energy we brought today and we just going to get
prepared for tomorrow's game just like it's another game.  
  
ISAIAH JOE: We can't worry about the fans. It's unfortunate they can't be
there. We just have to go out there and play our game. Everything is happening
on the court so we can't worry about anything on the outside. We just have to
play our game.  
  
Q. Desi, contributions from him.  
ISAIAH JOE: We know his game. We know what he's capable of doing. He's a great
player. He's had a lot of big games late in the year. So we knew coming into
this game, I mean, if he's open, he's going to knock down the shot. He knows
the correct plays to make and he's a dog on defense. Desi is overall a great
player and we know what he's capable of.  
  
MASON JONES: Desi is just doing Desi things. We know what to expect from Desi,
but a lot of people from the fans still don't know what to expect from Desi
game in and game out.  
  
But today's game was incredible. You saw when he came out already aggressive
and he was ready to play. You saw it in his face that he was ready to play.
You saw it on the court, it all showed through the stats and just how well he
played today. 5-5 from the three-point line. Just shooting incredible right
now.  
  
Q. Isaiah, that was the first time you 've ever fouled out. Thoughts on
that.  
ISAIAH JOE: No, just got to play better defense next time. The refs, you can't
complain about the calls they make, they can't take them back. Just have to
watch the film, see what I did wrong, correct it for next game.  
  
Q. What are your feelings about playing South Carolina? Do you feel like
you have a little bit of an advantage because you played and won or they have
an advantage because they 're rested?  
MASON JONES: There's no advantage to be honest. Everybody just has to come
ready to play. I feel like we're going to go back to the hotel, get some rest,
get up in the morning and prepare like South Carolina. I know we're going to
come ready to play tomorrow.  
  
It's a bounceback game. We know we want to beat them this time. They beat us
at the crib. We going to have that on our mind the whole night.  
  
ISAIAH JOE: We just got to come out and play our game, play hard, harder than
them. They're an aggressive team. We have to play harder than them and smarter
than them, both ends of the floor. This game was a good win, but now we have
to put it in the past and focus on South Carolina.  
  
Q. Mason, defensively from Ethan Henderson or Reggie Chaney, what did
you see from them tonight that gave you a spark?  
MASON JONES: They blocked everything. Saben Lee and the other guards was
trying to go to the paint. You saw Ethan and Reggie come out with blocks out
of nowhere. They made a lot of blocks tonight and it really helped us get
fast-break points and transition points. Their play today was incredible.
We're going to need that tomorrow. We need them to get rest, we need the whole
team to get rest.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes. We'll continue with
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Isaiah looked like he drew a charge, Mason was blocking out. Is that
what the technical was about?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: No thoughts. There was a lot of good shopping here in
Nashville. I'm going to let my wife spend the money, not give it to anybody
else. I refrain from saying anything.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about playing without the fans here?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, I mean, I think we go play basketball the way that they
tell us to. I'm not an expert on anything really going on other than what I
read on social media and stuff.  
  
It kind of is what it is. Again, I'm not educated in the medical field. I
mean, both teams are going to play in that environment tomorrow and for the
rest of the tournament.  
  
One thing, I am glad, I'm really glad that our guys got to play tonight in
front of fans. I think it's probably one of the last times this year where
there will be fans. They got an opportunity to experience that in a great
environment.  
  
For a first game on the first night of a tournament, it was a great turnout.
Obviously the severity and the seriousness of this is well beyond anything
that a coach or a player or whatever.  
  
On the flip side of it or whatever, for me, I just told the guys in the locker
room, if you spend a lot of years in the Minor Leagues, you play in front of a
lot of empty arenas. It comes down to being a competitor. There's not going to
be momentum swings based on a crowd or the noise in the building. There's
going to be momentum swings like there are in the park when you play on a
Saturday or Sunday.  
  
I mean, I told them, some of them before the game even, because we knew
something could possibly happen as we were reading stuff on social media, and
then I brought it up just now. What would Kobe Bryant do? How hard would he
play tomorrow? Would he worry about crowd or no crowd or would he go compete
because there's a scoreboard up?  
  
Q. You 've had some slow starts this season. Feeding off that point, to
miss your first four shots tonight, then to have Mason create, get to the
free-throw line and kind of kick-start, then three different runs of 7-0.  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Like what we talked about coming into the game, we prepared
hard. We went twice yesterday on two different basketball courts. We didn't do
a hotel ballroom stuff. We went yesterday.  
  
We felt like the way to win this game was going to have to be based on our
defense more so than our offense. Although we did get off to a little bit of
0-for-4, took two or three shots that didn't fall, defensively I thought we
were really, really good to start the game. I really did.  
  
It's hard in a college basketball game to hold a lead for 37 minutes. We were
able to do that this evening.  
  
Q. You mentioned the sacrifice Desi made earlier in the season coming
off the bench. How important is it for him to keep giving you that spark?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Obviously we changed our starting lineup tonight based on
matchups and so forth. We went with a pretty significant different rotation
than we have for most of the year.  
  
I talked to Desi yesterday individually, away from the other guys, about
coming off the bench or starting. He really wanted to come off the bench again
and give us some pop.  
  
I kind of left it in his decision because we felt like -- I felt like we could
use him as a starter today. He felt comfortable coming off the bench. I think
it's always important to communicate with your players and get a feel for
where they are mentally. If that makes him feel more comfortable to watch the
flow of the game, come off and give us a scoring spurt, that's awesome.  
  
Q. You talk about Desi, but twice Vandy pulled within 11 or 12. Desi hit
a three. How big were those? After that what are your thoughts on a Carolina
rematch?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't think there's any doubt that Desi's shots, they were
momentum swings because Vandy would kind of be knocking on the door, we might
have an empty possession, and his shots were really crucial.  
  
The thing is, he didn't force anything either. I mean, out of his threes that
he hit tonight, his feet were set, his shoulders were squared, he caught the
ball with time and space, mixed in some dribble drives with his three ball.
Certainly his shots were big-time momentum shots for us.  
  
I told everybody in Fayetteville, the only thing I've been worried about is
how to win this game. We'll go back now tonight and as a staff watch a bunch
of film, won't get much sleep tonight, we know that in preparation for
tomorrow because it's already late. We'll do a bunch of different things
throughout the course of the day with our guys to try to prepare them the best
we can because probably right now South Carolina has probably already started
on one part of their prep while we've been all doing this.  
  
Q. With all your NBA experience, hearing the NBA has canceled its
season, how serious does that bring this situation to your mind?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: A lot. Obviously when Golden State made the decision
yesterday, it kind of started it. I mean, I'm aware of at least whatever was
going on in the Utah game, you know, pregame. Texted with a couple of my
buddies that are with some teams.  
  
There's just kind of shock throughout not just the basketball world but kind
of shock with everybody. Again, I think these decisions are made by people
that are way smarter than a basketball coach. I don't really have much more to
say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Commissioner Greg
Sankey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=39006)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Commissioner Sankey to the podium. We'll ask the
Commissioner for any general thoughts he might want to begin with, then we'll
take your questions.  
  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: When I woke up this morning, I did not anticipate
being here with you at this moment in this fashion today with this news.  
  
I am going to take a moment. I just walked into the holding area. Breein has
been someone we've watched in our Basketball Leadership Council since his
freshman year. He is the chair. That's what we do, we build young people up.  
  
That said, I'm here because we had to make some difficult decisions through
the day. We're going to continue with our tournament. I continue to believe
it's important that we give all 14 teams who arrived here in Nashville the
opportunity to play for a conference tournament championship, our automatic
bid. We're going to continue to do that.  
  
As the day progressed, we received some news, some information, from the NCAA,
particularly the Board of Governors, information from what is called the
COVID-19 Advisory group, a group of 11 or 12 people, 6 are medical doctors,
experts in their field. I'm certainly not an immunologist or infectious
disease specialist.  
  
After the news broke from the NCAA, we were with our athletics directors, we
convened a conference call of our presidents and chancellors and advanced the
recommendation that we alter our fan access, which we've done. We sent a press
release that communicates that.  
  
We've also altered access to our regular season events on campus, both
conference versus conference and conference teams versus non-conference teams
between tomorrow, March 12th, and Monday, March 30th. We'll obviously be
reviewing circumstances during that time to see if that may be extended or we
can conclude our approach on March 30th and return to operations as usual.  
  
Disappointing news for everyone involved. It is important to give our student-
athletes this opportunity. We've prepared to do that in a healthy environment.
The Nashville Predators have been phenomenal partners both in dealing with
this news and preparing the arena so that we can meet those health
expectations.  
  
The news for the city is not what I wanted to provide given, what, over a week
ago, a tornado hit. We were planning to raise relief funds here. That's
obviously been altered. We'll need to recalibrate. This city is one of the
many that's the heartbeat of the SEC, we want to be supportive given our long-
term relationship.  
  
With that, I'll do my best to answer the questions you may have.  
  
Q. How will the refund process work for fans?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: We have said in our release, just so that I use
words, it's a later paragraph: Fans who are the original purchaser of the
tickets from the SEC office and SEC university, a verified purchaser on the
SEC ticket exchange through Ticketmaster, will receive automatic refunds of
those ticket purchases.  
  
We obviously don't control what's happened on the secondary market, but we'll
take the approach as I described with those through official outlets.  
  
Q. Were you advised of the NBA 's decision tonight? Was there any
discussion about shutting down altogether?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: I learned of the NBA's decision 15 minutes ago,
probably right before it broke publicly. We have not discussed with intent not
holding the event. As you can imagine, when you go through contingency
planning at the conference office, we have considered that, but we don't
believe we're there.  
  
The public health officials in Nashville have been our source of information.
That's why we've continued as we did tonight. The change at the national level
has altered our approach but hasn't put us at this point into cancellation.  
  
I was at dinner saying I'm excited to have fans and play last night, so this
is a fluid situation and we're mindful of the fluidity.  
  
Q. What assurances can you give, what precautions are you taking to
protect players from each other? How do you know you don 't have an infected
player?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: We convened a call last Friday of our sports
medicine professionals on campus. Each of our universities and their teams are
fully attentive to their condition.  
  
Sitting here today, that's a responsibility they undertake on a daily basis
for their student-athletes, not the commissioner or conference office. We're
confident in the work they do with their student-athletes.  
  
Q. The NCAA advised against allowing fans in around 3:30. Obviously you
made the decision to allow fans in. What went into that decision?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: First of all, the local information was that we
could conduct our tournament safely with fans through the weekend. What has
happened is the national recommendation has changed the dynamics for us. Given
that people have traveled, given that we were prepared from a public safety
standpoint, and on a Wednesday evening you can find enough space to separate
yourselves, I felt confident in making the recommendation that we move
forward.  
  
I might also add, we needed time to convene our folks to make a decision. With
that in mind, that's why I recommended we move forward as I described.  
  
Q. As someone who works in college athletics, when you found out that
the NCAA was going to do what it did, were you surprised, shocked, or were you
thinking this is part of the time in which we 're living?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: Surprise, shock, probably a few other words that
came to mind. Disappointment. We have a national association for which I have
great respect, but there are those frustrating times. The ability to have
information to make decisions in the best manner possible is important to all
of us.  
  
With full knowledge, we had a conference tournament at this level in the ACC
start yesterday, so you can imagine the enormous difficulty that we're faced
with in making these decisions, making these adjustments, informing people,
some of who have probably traveled here, others who were ready to go.  
  
But respect that medical leaders, experts, have provided a recommendation. I
wish it may have been earlier or perhaps later, it's the best information
available now, and we have to respect that.  
  
As I walk through the day, from the initial analysis, you clear your mind and
you start working through decisions that have to be made. That's the
responsibility that I have as the commissioner of this conference.  
  
Then I'm sure that the emotions will return at some point after I unwind, and
we'll refocus pretty quickly to get back to work. But I understand the
disappointment for everybody. Perhaps I don't understand it in the same way,
but I have my own disappointment because I've come to love this event, love
having it in this city.  
  
'Disappointing' is a good word, but we also have a reality around public
health which we're managing.  
  
Q. The decision to also have no fans on the on-campus events, whatever
it may be, was there additional information that went into that? It 's a
different set of circumstances than having 20,000 people in one place.  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: Several pieces of information. One was there were
actual releases from the NCAA national office, one from the COVID-19 Advisory
Panel, as I recall, that spoke to the concerns with having large gatherings
around sporting events. So that was a moment.  
  
We also have two universities this week who after spring break, one has
canceled its classes and will move to online content delivery next week.
Another has identified the need for online delivery where it's possible, that
being Vanderbilt and the University of Florida.  
  
We have, I don't know, five or six on spring break now. We have contingency
planning taking place, we have other announcements of delays of return to
classes. We're managing an environment on campus to which we're all learning
and adapting.  
  
Part of it was the messaging added on top of all that today from this advisory
panel.  
  
Q. Can you take us through a timeline of today, who you spoke with, how
you came to that final conclusion.  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: I won't hit all of it. We had a working group
meeting of something unrelated. We began an athletic directors meeting at 9:30
and had already revised an agenda for a previously-scheduled meeting to focus
on the COVID-19 Coronavirus up front. We talked about options. One of the
things on our minds was allowing fans to just return tickets, kind of self-
selecting not to attend, lessen attendance and provide refund information. We
held that. We went through a lot.  
  
About an hour and a half, took a break. We were talking about issues that are
also on our agenda. Information started to come from a Congressional hearing
that was very specific. The World Health Organization issued a declaration of
a pandemic. You could tell that our room changed as we saw that information.  
  
So the focus on the agenda, we took a break, started in conversation with some
of my leadership at the presidential level, with some of our local hosts, then
that played out.  
  
I think we had probably a conference call among the autonomy commissioners
early afternoon, right around 3:00 I'm guessing a note from the NCAA about
impending news, then the news, then we reengaged at 3:30. I think we were able
to connect with our presidents, chancellors, athletic directors in person and
via conference calls about 5:30.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: In a meeting that began at 5:30. That was limited by
travel and availability issues.  
  
Q. What would it take to at some point cancel this tournament? Would it
have to be a more serious situation in the community here in Nashville?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: Our preceding conversations were about local public
health advice, and that would remain.  
  
Q. Obviously we 're sitting at the basketball tournament. How much
discussion was there about other SEC tournaments coming up, gymnastics?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: We've been mindful because this is our fourth
consecutive week of conference championships swimming and diving, indoor track
and field, women's basketball, men's basketball. Gymnastics next week will
have the same approach, limited attendance, limited to family of student-
athletes and official party and media members who are credentialed.  
  
Equestrian is the following week in Athens, Georgia. We'll have the same
approach there. It's campus based. The nature of that sport is just a little
bit different than some that are contained in this way. But we'll take the
same approach to that event.  
  
We have a break for about four weeks. We'll be on the other side of March 30.
We'll be in conversation to see what that means. Tennis and golf are up next
in mid, late April. Then we go into softball, outdoor track and field,
baseball in May.  
  
We have some time to assess, which we certainly will be doing. But we spent
time up front knowing we had men's basketball now, we had gymnastics that
would be affected by this decision, and even the equestrian championship in a
few weeks.  
  
Q. Spring football is underway. What kind of conversation have you had
with different coaches as far as the spring games?  
COMMISSIONER GREG SANKEY: We had very brief conversations about spring games
and various activities. We'll be reconnecting. I think most of those are
outside of our March 30 window. I'm not exactly certain that I track on that.  
  
We're proceeding with other things. We have I think a video review session
this weekend for football preparation. Some elements will continue. We
obviously have been in a crisis consideration, a crisis management situation,
so that's kept our attention on the immediate issues I've described. We'll be
reconnecting both as a staff tonight and in the future days and weeks, then
with our athletics directors.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Kermit Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25105)

### [Breein Tyree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34850)

### [Devontae Shuler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36788)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
Georgia 81, Ole Miss 63.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Ole Miss.  
  
We'll ask Coach Davis for some general thoughts on the game.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: I give Georgia a lot of credit. They dominated us right from the
tip. Couldn't get back in transition. They just had more energy, more
physical. Tried to make a run, we just couldn't guard for any length of time.
We'd done a great job on Edwards in the win at Athens. He was I think 3-10
today, 3-12. Thought if you did that, you'd have a chance to win.  
  
We couldn't stop Hammonds and Tou. They were just too good for us. Gave up
55%, so Georgia deserved to win the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Devontae, I know it 's early, right after a game, but you have a big
decision coming up. You waived the NBA Draft or the draft process last year.
How do you plan to handle it this time around?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I'm going to try to focus on myself, do things to try to make
myself better as a player. Of course I'm going to make a decision. But other
than that, I'm just going to work on myself, try to make myself better.  
  
Q. There was a stretch where y 'all didn't score for six minutes. Coach
was talking about energy. Were y'all motivated to be here? Did you want to
play in this game today?  
BREEIN TYREE: I feel like, yes, we wanted to play in the game. We were
struggling to score. This guy right here to the right of me always competes
and always gives his all whenever he's on the court. Sometimes it just doesn't
go your way. Like Coach said, you got to credit Georgia and how they came out
to play.  
  
DEVONTAE SHULER: They definitely outplayed us and out-toughed us on a lot of
possessions. We tried to make a comeback. We didn't make a couple right
decisions on the offensive end, yeah.  
  
Q. Breein, now that you have a chance to look back at the whole season,
what didn 't go right?  
BREEIN TYREE: Just finishing games. A lot of times we had opportunities to win
at home, and away. We just didn't make the plays to finish the game.  
  
Q. Breein, you were 6-5 on the road last year. What was different about
this team when y 'all got away from Oxford?  
BREEIN TYREE: Toughness, being able to go into another crowd and still play
the same way that we played at home. Coming out, being aggressive on the ball,
not letting the game get too fast for us.  
  
That's definitely something I know Coach is going to definitely want to change
next year. This team is definitely capable of winning on the road.  
  
Q. Breein, right after a game, this past month have you taken time to
reflect on your time at Ole Miss now that it 's over? What are some things
you'll have with you forever?  
BREEIN TYREE: Yeah, man, I have taken a lot of time to reflect on my time at
Ole Miss. It's sad that it kind of ended this way. I met a lot of great people
at the university. I learned a lot about myself, grew as a man, as a student-
athlete. I'm thankful for every opportunity that I've gotten there.  
  
Sad that my career is over, man. It kind of feels weird. I feel like I did
leave a mark on the university.  
  
Q. I know this doesn 't affect you right now, but I'm sure y'all are
hearing the news. What do you think it would be like to play in a tournament
with no fans?  
BREEIN TYREE: Yeah, I feel like it would be a weird situation. Obviously the
goal is to win the tournament, get to the NCAA tournament. It would definitely
be weird for me.  
  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Of course, like Breein said, it would be weird. That's what
we play for. We play for the fans. To see that they make that happen, it's
really tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Davis.  
  
Q. You 've talked all year about more toughness and physicality. Where
specifically do you want to improve there on your roster?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Depth, for one thing. We couldn't guard the dribble late in
games. Some of these games we couldn't close out. Not a lot of presence around
the goal. We had our chances about four times on the road and couldn't do it.
Then we throw a game out like this, we weren't very competitive.  
  
We got to go back and address it. In recruiting we've talked about that. We've
got to address it with our team, guys coming back, try to develop toughness.
We have a lot of work.  
  
We got some guys sitting out that have toughness. The kid we signed from IMG
has great toughness, athletic. We have to add some pieces and get these guys
coming back a lot better.  
  
Q. Do you think they were motivated and into it there in the first
half?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we came back after the tough loss at State.
Watched tape that morning, came back, played hard in practice, played hard
Monday, great preparation. Lively shootaround today.  
  
I can't put my finger on it. Those guys, great attitudes. We tried to get them
uplifted, playing. Like I said, we just came out and we were affected by shot-
making. Blake is either on or off. We missed some early opportunities. Some
balls around the goal, that affected us defensively.  
  
The one thing we've always done for the most part is get back defensively.
They got in transition. You saw, it was kind of lackluster defense. They were
a really good group to come to the gym with every day. I've said that all year
long. We have to address some areas in the talent and the toughness.  
  
These two guys did some great things. So Georgia was just better tonight.
We've been better than Georgia three times. But Tom had his team ready to go
and they played well.  
  
Q. Got it down to 8 after a slow start in the first half. Georgia hits
the buzzer-beater. Did you feel like the air kind of came out of the sail?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We had it to 5 I think. They hit two threes at the end of the
half. We ran a play for Breein. The ball just came out of his hands with about
five or six seconds. That's not bad, give yourself a chance to offensive
rebound. Nobody stopped the ball. He made a shot. It did.  
  
But still the game was 11, workable. The critical time was when we got it to
9, got a stop. All we talked about was driving the ball, driving the ball.
Breein pulled up, shot one from 28. Next trip down, Blake shot one. Could have
maybe had it to 5 and made it a game. From there they took it out, it was 13
or 14 again.  
  
Q. Since there are no longer games to prepare for, what are the next
couple weeks like for you?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It's just recruiting. I'm going to give our team a week.
Obviously you have to give a team a week after a season. We'll meet with
everybody individually, staff, everybody, players, kind of assess exactly
where everybody is.  
  
Obviously recruiting is a premium. We'll get back, me as a staff, I'll be gone
on Saturday. Just kind of start addressing some needs that you see. With
what's coming onboard, I don't know what this spring is going to look like
even being able to get your team together in gyms and practice with what's
going on, the lay of the land of college basketball.  
  
Those decisions will kind of be made by the presidents, ADs, NCAA over the
next probably two to three weeks.  
  
Q. Tom said he was really pleased with how his team moved the ball
against the zone. What did you see there?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Yeah, I thought we affected them in our 1-3. I thought we got
our hands on balls. When we got in our 2-3 zone, we couldn't get matched up.
They got to the high post, made some plays, got some easy plays there.  
  
I thought their team moved the ball a lot better than the first time we played
them. They had 19 assists. I think it was 19, yeah. That's a good number.
Baskets made, I know Tom has to be pleased with that. Our ball stuck a little
bit.  
  
I just thought they were more willing passers tonight.  
  
Q. Have you had time to reflect on the past two years getting to coach
Breein? What do you see in his future, where he goes from here?  
KERMIT DAVIS: He's got a great future. What people don't really know about
Breein, he was voted in the top 30 seniors nominated for like the
distinguished award for college athletes, that's character and classroom,
community service and talent. Obviously he's been head of the SAC, our
leadership committee in the SEC, the last two years.  
  
Student-athlete is really important to him. I think he's going to have an
outstanding chance. He'll go to different invitationals, all the different
things. Just like TD this year, he improved, had a great senior year, but he
kept improving. Breein has to do the same thing, keep improving.  
  
He loves basketball. It's really important to him. I think he'll have a really
good future in pro basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: Thanks, guys.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2020

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Jordan Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36736)

### [Rayshaun Hammonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34835)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri_  
  
Georgia 81, Ole Miss 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Georgia.  
  
We'll ask Coach Crean for some general comments on the game.  
  
TOM CREAN: Proud of the way we competed. I'm proud of the way we really
understood the game plan that needed to work against Ole Miss. We knew it was
only a matter of time before they went to the zone. Our guys did a real good
job of adjusting, figuring out how we wanted to attack it, whether in the
middle or in the corner.  
  
While we were figuring out how to attack it in the middle of the game, the
ball kept moving. The ball moved, our cutting was very good, got on the
offensive glass early. These two here played excellent from start to finish. A
lot of it's because they were ready to roll. They were ready to play against a
team that we have had trouble with, that we have a lot of respect for because
of how tough and physical they are, what they're capable of with Breein Tyree
and Shuler in the back court. Proud of the way they kept going.  
  
There was no doubt, no panic, no anything but continuing to work to execute,
judged by the 19 assists, and continue to figure out ways to get stops. Proud
of how they played.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rayshaun, when you talked yesterday you spoke about the team wanting
to have fun. Kind of address that. Also they cut it to 9 points, you guys did
not lose your composure.  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: We just stayed together, stayed composed, had faith in each
other. Coach Crean telling us every time we come to the huddle, We got it. Me
and Jordan told the team, We've been here before a lot of times. We just stay
focused the whole time.  
  
Q. Obviously it was an off night for Ant. Did you feel like you needed
to have the type of night you ended up having because that was going on or the
scoring and the shots coming to you naturally?  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: Team played well. Everybody looking for each other. We just
tried to stay together. It don't matter who is scoring on our team, we're just
trying to win, stay with each other the whole time. That's the main focus.  
  
JORDAN HARRIS: Ole Miss did a great job of defending. They did a real good
job. You look at the stat sheet, plus 18 with him on the court. I think he
still played great. He just didn't hit a lot of shots. He still played great,
was a great teammate. He still made a lot of good plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Aside from this game that y 'all just played, news just broke there
won't be any fans allowed in the arena for the rest of the week. What does
that mean for you?  
TOM CREAN: We're just learning that. No fans?  
  
Q. Yes.  
TOM CREAN: We didn't know that. They're probably not in a position to answer
that unless you want to. We're just finding that out.  
  
Q. The fans have always brought the atmosphere a lot of the season. Do
you have initial reactions on what that might mean with no fans in the
building?  
JORDAN HARRIS: We got to bring it.  
  
TOM CREAN: Who is allowed in?  
  
Q. Limited access, some friends and family, credentialed members of the
media.  
TOM CREAN: I'll answer for him. We'll adjust. Same for the other team. We'll
do everything we have to do to adjust. In this world now, it's the new normal.
The new normal that's come quickly, right? We'll be some of the first to
figure it out.  
  
Q. Jordan, if I 'm not mistaken, last year's SEC tournament you had 26
points. What is it about your comfort level playing here?  
JORDAN HARRIS: Just experience, man. Obviously I know what to expect. But my
teammates just put me in a lot of great positions, my coaches put me in a lot
of good positions to be successful.  
  
I just went out there and just gave it everything I got. Everything was just
falling in place. But I feel like I needed to play like this for us to win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting another shot at Florida. Obviously a team
you played really well against and couldn 't hold on against them.  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: We just got to prepare and stay focused. Just be ready for
the game.  
  
JORDAN HARRIS: Florida, they're a great team. It will be our third time
playing them. We excited. We're looking forward to the matchup.  
  
Q. Rayshaun, putting it together like that, your sixth double-double.
When did you know it was going to be your night? Feel it in warmups?  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: No, my teammates put me in a great position to score. Just
playing hard. I was just keeping my motor up the whole game. My teammates
encouraging me every time. I did the same thing for them. That was the main
focus.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The quick start really kind of got you all going. How much did you
try to keep that intensity up, really making sure guys like Rayshaun got the
shots to take?  
TOM CREAN: It's a tough situation because you're trying to keep the intensity
up, you're trying to keep the aggressiveness up, you're trying to keep the
pace up. At the same time we're not subbing very much tonight.  
  
As I tried to tell the team after the game, tomorrow is a whole new deal.
We'll be back here. We could spend the night, it would probably be better than
driving back to the hotel (smiling). Bottom line is we're going to play at
2:00 tomorrow. We may need some of those guys that didn't play as much tonight
to be at a high level tomorrow.  
  
It really is about reading the game, seeing how it's going, keeping your foot
on the pedal as much as you can. You don't want to become reckless, careless
or a settling shooting type of team when you get a lead like that.  
  
There were a couple exceptions to everything that I just said. For the bottom
line, not too many. I think that's why we were able to win, we were able to
keep going.  
  
Q. Tom, I think Anthony 's plus-18 on the floor answered this. He played
every minute. Obviously struggling offensively.  
TOM CREAN: He was and he wasn't. We need to win the game, right? It's March.
The timeouts are there. I'm watching him. There were probably five or six
times I thought about taking him out, then I overruled myself.  
  
Bottom line is he knew it was tough for him. But the four assists, the
plus-18, not hunting, a couple tough ones. For the most part moving, looking
for it there, not there, kicking it. We asked a lot of him. He had the Breein
Tyree matchup. That's not an easy matchup. The whole plan was to have
different people guard him so we could bring pressure to him because he's so
good.  
  
Anthony did a lot in the game that impacted the game and the win certainly.
The offensive misses and those type of things, they're just part of it. There
are so many positives that he had in the game, we don't win the game without
him. I think the plus-18, that does bring that to life.  
  
Q. You 've been around college basketball a while. You've been part of a
lot of NCAA tournaments. As a coach, what is your reaction to all that's
happened today?  
TOM CREAN: Well, it really doesn't matter in the sense of how disappointed you
would be for people being able to see it, to travel. I cannot begin to
describe what's going on in our world right now with this Coronavirus. There's
a lot of people making decisions that can. That's what you have to do. You
have to trust the people that have the knowledge and are getting all the
information that they have.  
  
I read a great story, a great interview, with Mr. Gottlieb today in the USA
Today. I never met the man. I learned a lot just reading the story. There's so
much information that we have to try to decipher as people out here in the
public, and it's not even close to what the people behind closed doors have to
be able to determine.  
  
There's no way that you can do anything but trust the judgment of those
people, participate the way they want you to participate, be thankful that you
have a chance, and continue to trust that they know what's best. That's
exactly how I look at it. That's exactly what I would say to my team. We just
didn't know when we walked in here that they have stopped it for tomorrow.  
  
Q. You have a really young team. You had to educate these guys. That 's
part of your job. What did you tell them as far as trying to put them at ease,
trying to keep them comfortable amid --  
TOM CREAN: With the Coronavirus?  
  
Q. Yes.  
TOM CREAN: Like coaching, you have to keep giving them reminders. You have to
remind them about cleanliness, the hand wipes. We had all those things in our
locker room long before this Coronavirus has jumped into where it's at. Now we
try to intensify it even more.  
  
I think it's just an educational process. You give them every bit of working
knowledge that you can give them. You don't inundate them with things that
aren't really going to register.  
  
But the bottom line is, I think when the level of seriousness of this, you've
got to have a maturity level in you that says, I better listen to everything
that's being said because this obviously is for real. It's the new normal
right now. We've got to be able to deal with it.  
  
That's exactly what I will tell them again tonight, right? All we can do is
keep taking care of ourselves and each other in the best possible way, trust
what people are doing to make these decisions.  
  
Q. You addressed this, but you played in Gainesville, crazy crowd. You
play tomorrow almost no crowd.  
TOM CREAN: Does my wife get to come (smiling)?  
  
Q. Yes, she 's allowed.  
TOM CREAN: Families are going to have to bring it, right?  
  
It is what it is. We're at a disadvantage because we haven't done a closed
scrimmage since I've been at Georgia. We've been playing exhibitions either at
UAB or at Charlotte. If Florida did a closed scrimmage, they'll have the
advantage tomorrow. That's one of the coaches said today is, all it is is the
closed scrimmage in the preseason.  
  
But, no, this is such a serious situation, whatever gets canceled and whatever
gets postponed, whatever gets put away, the people that are making these
decisions, they know what they're doing. We just have to trust it. You take
the hand that's dealt.  
  
We'll come out here tomorrow, we're very thankful that we're playing. We're
grateful we're in an environment like this. It's such a first-class operation,
it's Bridgestone, the people here, certainly what Commissioner Sankey does
with his entire staff, it's completely first class, completely.  
  
That's the focus. We earned the win tonight. Let's go play Florida. Let's not
focus on what's not there, let's focus on what we have to do because that's
what we can control anyway.  
  
Q. Are you familiar with Georgia 's history in the 2008 tournament?  
TOM CREAN: Yes, President Morehead reminded me of that just a little bit ago.  
  
Q. It feels like that to me.  
TOM CREAN: Feels like what? We have to win four games for that to happen right
now, four more. We're going to worry about Florida. Jumping ahead is getting
back into that film room right now, making sure they eat, understand some
things about Florida before they go to bed. That's the extent of how far I'm
looking ahead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 80, Valparaiso - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Champion Bradley Braves are here. They're champions in the
tournament for the second straight year. From my left to my right, it's Nate
Kennell, Darrell Brown, Jr., the head coach, Brian Wardle, Elijah Childs, Koch
Bar, Ja'Shon Henry, and Danya Kingsby.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: What a great memory to have. A lot of hard work. A lot of
adversity we've been through this year to be in this position. The belief was
always there in that locker room. I'm so happy for our seniors that they were
able to do this again and repeat it. A lot of people thought we got lucky last
year, and we knew that wasn't the case. We knew our high level of play can
play with anyone. They were on a mission to come out this weekend to prove
that, and we were able to do that.  
  
I want to give Valpo a lot of credit. They had a great weekend. They're a well
coached team. Matt did a great job with his group to get them to the
championship game. They're a competitive team. Obviously, the future is bright
there. Just very proud how we were able to pull out the game and finish the
game in the last 15, 14 minutes. I thought we played very well and played
smart. Obviously, defense wins, and we buckled down and got a lot of stops at
the end of the game.  
  
Q. Darrell, you 're going to the line there toward the end of the game,
amid the chance of MVP. How difficult was it for you to keep your
concentration during that time? Obviously, you knocked down the free throws,
but take us through your mind during those moments.  
DARRELL BROWN: It was special, man. It's something you see on 2K. I don't know
if you play 2K or not. When your player going off, you get the MVP chants.
It's something special you see on TV growing up. The fan base at Bradley and
Peoria had supported me from day one. Me and my teammates, through the good
and the bad times. It was just special seeing where the hard work has brought
us. So I appreciate that.  
  
Q. For all three seniors, can you all talk about what this means for the
program to be from where you came in to where it is now, winning back to back
championships.  
THE MODERATOR: Nate, you're first. Koch is second. Darrell is third.  
  
NATE KENNELL: It means a lot, especially to do it with these guys. These are
some of my best friends right here, just making memories like this. We've been
through the hard and the good and the bad. Being able to do it with these two
other seniors, it's special. It's something I'll never forget.  
  
KOCH BAR: It means a lot to us as a team. And also to the new group that's
behind us, like Eli, that's going to, you know, continue carrying the torch
and to be able to do this again hopefully again. Overall, it just means a lot
for us to win a game and also set a good example for the youngest freshmen in
our team, just give them that experience to take home the trophy.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I think they said everything. It's been special, man. It took
many bad losses, had some great wins, and it's just nice seeing the hard work
pay off and the new guys following along. Eli's been special, Ja'Shon's been
special, Danya. It's just a great thing to see come true. Dreams come true day
in and day out. Coaching staff has been great for us.  
  
Hopefully, this program just keeps going up each year.  
  
Q. Coach, I know Darrell is sitting right next to you, but I wanted to
awkwardly ask you about Darrell. Can you just put into words the engine that
he is for your team, notably tonight from the point guard position?  
BRIAN WARDLE: He's been -- just know this; Darrell and I have been through
some ups and downs, but our relationship got stronger and stronger and
stronger, and we have a real true relationship. A lot of coaches, they just
talk to their players once in a while, and they go to practice. Me and him, we
know each other inside and out, and I think to see where he's come, he's put
so much hard work in. He's so consistent. He's so durable. These three seniors
are winners. They don't miss practice. They don't miss games.  
  
I don't take that for granted. I understand how important that is to set an
example and have the expectations every day of we practice hard and we get
after it every day. These three guys led by Darrell are there every day doing
it and putting the work in. I just think his leadership -- I told him the
other day. His leadership the last month has been unbelievable. It's the best
of his career, and he's kind of really took it under his wing, and these three
seniors, with Elijah and those other guys, and just kind of rolled with it.  
  
We were a very tight knit group coming into this tournament, and the
expectation was there. We were on a mission, and we were all on the same page.  
  
Q. Brian, it obviously worked. Switching to the zone, just what was your
thinking about that? And why did you turn your hat back around frontwards?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I'm not sure, but the zone -- I wanted to get one or two
possessions of zone in the first half. We did it the very last possession of
the half, got a stop. I liked what I saw, how they were trying to attack it.
We talked about it at halftime. My staff said we definitely had to go back to
it. I agreed. It was just the right time and the right lineup to do it.  
  
I thought we put it on them at the exact right time. I think it was around the
12-minute mark or 11-minute mark maybe. We could tell they were a little
frustrated, slowed them down. We didn't have to chase them through their
motions so our guys could stay in zones and areas and save their legs a little
bit, to be honest.  
  
From there, we went out and started a run again, and we started to get out in
transition and get some baskets. We're a 95, 98 percent man team, but you've
got to have a zone in your back pocket for these types of situations, and it
definitely helped us win.  
  
Q. Harry stole my question, but I just wanted to ask you a little bit
more about going to the zone. They had made half of their threes to that
point, and then I think they missed their next eight in a row. What -- I mean,
can you describe a little more intricately, just in terms of how -- what you
did defensively that flummoxed them during that period?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Their motion is good, and Valpo can score the ball. They curl
you, pop backs, do all different kinds of actions in their motions to get
threes. They've got five guys on the floor at times that can shoot it. So
They're hard to guard, and you're chasing them around a lot. Third game in
three days, it's hard to guard.  
  
Our zone, we know where they're going to get threes. We know specifically the
spots where they have to attack us from three, so we can shade towards those
areas a little bit. I thought we did a great job of communicating, the players
did, on the court of where their shooters are, and we just contested. Deep
corner threes with Elijah and Ja'Shon and Koch flying at you are really hard
shots. The guards did a great job of picking up the rebounds, and we got out
and ran.  
  
Q. For the seniors, what does it mean, when you came in, you 're coming
off a 5-23 season, and last year the seniors, D. Lo, Van Bree, Luqman led you
there, and now you're following in their footsteps. In fact, I heard coach
worked it out that if you guys got down, Luqman was going to come down out of
the stands and give you another pep talk. But to follow up on what D. Lo and
Van Bree and Luqman did and to carry it over, how much does that mean to
you?  
THE MODERATOR: Koch first, Darrell second, Nate is third.  
  
KOCH BAR: It means a lot. It means we bought into what Coach Wardle put in
front of us. It was like the recruiting process. He got that vision for this
program, what he want to do with it, and we just came in and just bought into
the culture, and we just took from there. Especially see like the group in
front of us, like D. Lo and Luuk, and then bought in also. We just followed
their footsteps.  
  
When they're gone, we just took from there also, and we knew exactly what we
needed to do. I think it means a lot for us, and it also means a lot for the
group behind us to set an example of what exactly it takes to win.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, it's been special, man. The seniors last year were a
special group of guys. They lead in different ways. They were different
players than us definitely, but at the same time, we all had the same vision
in our eyes and as the coaching staff. Just showing the younger guys the way
like they showed us the way. Just putting in the work consistently, coming
ready to go every day to practice and stuff like that. All the days you don't
see behind closed doors are the days that lead to moments like this.  
  
Just carrying the legacy and passing it down to guys like Eli and Ja'Shon and
showing the next group of guys the way, that's how you build something special
and build a program.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, especially just from the seniors, just learned a lot of
things from them. Their vocalness, vocal leadership was huge, and I think
that's something we were able to take care of that -- or take after that,
especially down the stretch, just continuing to be local leaders and helping
in these moments when other guys haven't been here before. So just continue to
lead with our voice and by example.  
  
Q. For Elijah and maybe Darrell, you obviously had a lot of pieces here
today that were part of it last year. I 'm just wondering, did you feel like
in the second half everyone was really at ease, calm, confident, even when you
were down two, maybe halfway through the second half?  
THE MODERATOR: Elijah first, Darrell second.  
  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Oh, yeah, most definitely. Once we got comfortable into the
game, I feel like everybody stepped up, you know, everybody be the star in
their role. From the first game, we knew once we got our feet wet a little
bit, our newcomers got the feeling and the people that's been here before,
they got their feeling back, we knew we could do something special, and we
knew we could lock in and win this.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: Yeah, what Eli said, man. After the first game, I think, after
we got our feet wet and just got ready to play and got a feel for the arena
and stuff like that, we were good to go. We just kind of took it one
possession at a time, one stop, one possession on offense at a time. Each
game, man, I think, as long as we did that and stayed together throughout the
adversity and stuff like that and as long as the guys that have been here
stayed calm throughout whatever, the new guys would follow along, and they did
a great job, man. They made big plays, play in and play out.  
  
Q. For Darrell, since last year 's NCAA Tournament game, have you
thought about that game at all? Like over the past year, do you think about it
and how close you guys were at some point?  
DARRELL BROWN: I think that's been a common topic between all us returners,
man. We talk about, if one play would have went this way, how different things
would have been. I think we definitely would have made it to the Sweet 16 if
we'd have won that game.  
  
We talk about it a lot. We've been itching to get back there, and we're here
now, so it's time to make some noise.  
  
Q. I asked the same question yesterday, but you guys just made more
school history. You guys did something that nobody else in the storied school
has ever done before. This could go for any of you. What does that feel like?
What does that mean to you?  
THE MODERATOR: Danya, you're first. Ja'Shon, you're second.  
  
DANYA KINGSBY: It's a great feeling. I've been waiting on this moment all my
life. Playing on this stage, winning a tournament championship, and playing in
a March Madness tournament. So it feels good. It's special. I'm just proud of
my teammates and the coaches, and we're ready.  
  
JA'SHON HENRY: First off, let's start by saying that I'm so happy to be
playing alongside these guys. Especially these seniors, their leadership,
their hard work, it's just a good example for all our young guys, like me,
Eli, and all the freshmen. Just being able to do this two years in a row, it's
a great feeling. Super proud of these guys.  
  
Q. This is for Elijah, Brian, and Nate. After that regular season finale
loss to Loyola, your guys ' message, all three, basically, was that you're
still hungry, and you're not done yet. So how much of that was like a
motivating factor for this tournament?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think that's definitely a motivator. We felt like we should
have pulled that game -- we should have pulled that "W" out, but then again, I
feel like the seniors got disrespected with the awards and all that. We really
followed Darrell's lead. He tweeted out something, be there on the weekend,
and here we are now. Everybody followed that lead. Everybody had that hunger.
He's really a sign of a leader, a sign of success, and we just followed his
lead, and he brought us home.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Could you repeat the question again?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Motivation after losing to Loyola.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Oh, yeah. I think we played well that game. We did a lot of good
things. I mean, it really carried us into this tournament. I think, as long as
we keep going -- we still haven't peaked. We still haven't played our best
basketball. Those games and these games here are just leading us to even
better basketball. I think we have a lot more to do here in March. This is the
best time to be playing your best ball and be peaking as a team.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: We were motivated. We were very motivated, led by these seniors.
Like I said, we were all on the same page on what we wanted to prove to
everybody and accomplish. We went through a lot this year, a lot more than I
think most teams in our league did when it comes to injuries, and we sustained
it. We kept winning. We kept finding new ways to win.  
  
Guys like Ya and Ja'Shon stepped up big time. Darrell missed a couple of games
for like the first time in his career. Elijah was out for a while. Koch had
huge games. Ari Boya had big games. Antonio Thomas had big games. We had a lot
of guys -- Sean had big games. We had a lot of guys step up.  
  
When you go through that as a group and you all get healthy at the right time,
which is what I was hoping for, anything can happen with this group, and we've
just got to keep building off that.  
  
Q. Brian, I 'm sure you haven't thought about where your team might go,
but would it be fun to come right back here in two weeks?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Absolutely. We love this arena. I'll tell you what, the
hospitality, the professionalism of everybody here at this tournament is first
class. I've said it before as a coach and player, I've been to a lot of
different tournaments, but the security guards are the best. Three of them
say, we've got you winning this, Coach, on Friday. They're making predictions,
and we're having a lot of fun talking. They've been wonderful to us, and we
love this arena, we love being in St. Louis.  
  
Q. Coach, I feel like I have to ask, will the red shoes be making an
appearance in the NCAA Tournament?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Yes, they will, and they're comfortable this year. Last year,
not very comfortable. They're comfortable this year.  
  
Q. Darrell, this might have been asked already, but near the end of the
game, you 're at the free-throw line. The whole arena is chanting MVP. What's
going into your mind at that time?  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, it was special. The city of Peoria and the Bradley fans
have supported me from day one, supported my teammates from day one, and I
mean, just seeing where we've come from, what we've come from, and all the
things we've been through, it's just a blessing hearing that while you're
shooting free throws and really just winning the championship over. That was
the best thing and the best feeling.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Congratulations.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 80, Valparaiso - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach Matt Lottich is here with his student athletes, John
Kiser and Javon Freeman-Liberty, Ryan Fazekas. We're going to have an opening
statement from Matt and then we'll have questions for all four participants
here from Valparaiso. Matt, please.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Obviously, this is -- it's not easy. It's not easy because you
lose, but it's not easy because you want it so bad for your team. The heart
and the determination that they showed, it's something that we ask of them,
and very few people are able to do it on a consistent basis. We've got a
locker room full of guys that just laid it out on the line. Anytime you lay it
out on the line like they did, you give your hearts into something and it
doesn't work out, it hurts.  
  
Some of the adversity that we had to face to make this run, obviously, the
four in four. That's difficult. Javon coming off of mono to have a performance
like that. Ryan really playing with one hand. John Kiser -- I mean, there was
a couple weeks ago we thought he might be done for the year with an ankle
injury. I guess that's just how our group is made, and this group fights and
battles, and it didn't come out our way today. But the future looks pretty
bright, and I think John and Ryan really put their stamp on our program, and
they should be very proud of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let me say that Javon Freeman-Liberty and John Kiser were both
All Tournament selections, two of the five. First question is right here.  
  
Q. Matt and then for the players. Obviously, there was an 11, 10-minute
mark in this game where it looked like the shot looks were there but they were
a little short. Obviously, fatigue was a thing. How did you have to fight
through that, and how much did it impact?  
THE MODERATOR: John, Javon, Ryan, in that order, finish with Matt.  
  
JOHN KISER: I definitely think it impacted us a little bit. I'm not going to
blame it all on that though because we made mistakes on the defensive end that
they capitalized on, and in the end, it was our downfall.  
  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: Like you said, I wouldn't blame it all on fatigue. We
definitely messed up a lot of defensive assignments that led them to have the
lead that they had.  
  
RYAN FAZEKAS: I'm probably just going to repeat what they said. Like they
said, fatigue is always a factor when you play four games in four days. It may
have affected us a little bit, but we played our hearts out. We made mistakes
that they scored on. They executed. So --  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Yeah, I mean, maybe. Again, we got the looks that we wanted. Who
knows? I will tell you that a lot of those shots, I thought were going in, and
they just didn't. It probably took us a little bit, got a little tentative
against the zone, had a couple of turnovers, and I think that got us maybe a
little bit tentative.  
  
Overall, I thought we executed for the most part on the offensive end.
Defensively, maybe that's where your legs go a little bit and you're not able
to close out as good, but credit them. They made some tough shots in that
stretch. Yeah, I mean, fatigue is a factor. We played guys. We rode guys a lot
of minutes, and I'm just looking at this. Javon plays 32. Ryan plays 32. Kiser
plays 33. Donovan plays 36. A lot of these guys, like I said, were dealing
with injuries. Javon was dealing with a sickness.  
  
So it might be understandable with a little bit of fatigue, but we can't make
excuses. We've just got to go from there.  
  
Q. This is for Javon and Matt. They went to that zone. How difficult was
it to kind of try to break that down?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: We couldn't get on like a click. Like it was a
surprise, but it was like they were backing up off of us, so it was like kind
of hard for us to throw it to the middle to spread our guys out.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Again, I thought we got -- I thought it was a good coaching
adjustment for them. They were having a hard time stopping us in man. Again,
like Javon said, it was harder for us to get into the middle, but, again, you
say that. It might have looked that way, but I thought we got the shots that
we needed to get. We got a couple corner threes.  
  
I think early they went to it in the second half and Donovan drove and got Ben
a foul. It threw us off our rhythm for sure, but I did think we got shots that
we could make.  
  
Q. I guess I want to ask this one to find out if I 've got to ask other
ones. Matt, have you thought about the postseason, CIT, CBI, anything like
that? You think you guys want to move forward, or is this gutting enough to
want to lay it at this right now?  
MATT LOTTICH: You ask me right now, when you're a little bit heartbroken, it's
difficult to say. I will tell you that there's not been one day that I have
dreaded going to work, not one day that I haven't enjoyed coaching my team. I
think our players would share that sentiment. And when I say that, I think
they would enjoy continuing to play. If you ask them right now, probably not,
but as we can regroup and rest and kind of get off our legs a little bit, my
guess is they'll want to play.  
  
One of the things that the benefit of it is I do think we have a very special
group. When we kind of hug and cry there in the locker room afterwards, the
seniors both spoke, and their sentiment was this: Guys, this is a special
group. Keep it going. They left their impact on it, and they left the program
better than when they had it, but they also understand that the group's -- the
players are returning, it's a special group.  
  
I want them to get used to playing late into March because I think that this
group could have that type of a run in the future.  
  
Q. John, can you just take me through what this weekend has been like?
Really, we talked about your journey before, but you really capped it off this
weekend. Just talk about this.  
JOHN KISER: It's just been fun. Playing with these guys has been fun. I just
gave everything I could and yeah. I'm just going to leave it at it's just been
fun.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you touch on this journey for what you 've gone through
this last couple weeks and into this weekend?  
RYAN FAZEKAS: I mean, it's just been an amazing journey with these guys,
especially this last weekend of the tournament. We surprised a lot of people.
We -- like, we tried to make a positive impact to get this team going in the
right direction, and I think we left some good footprints for them to build
on. The young guys got a lot of great experience this weekend. Yeah, it's just
been an amazing journey.  
  
To be the first team ever to play on a Thursday and make it to the
championship, that's awesome. I think it's a great statement for this program.  
  
Q. Javon, I don 't know if there's ever the right time to ask a question
like this, but you built something here that can continue. Your thoughts on
playing with Valpo and what this year has meant to you?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: If your question is am I staying? Yeah, I am. I just
feel like, after this game, we're going to just keep building and building.
We're a young group of guys, and it's a long time before we actually all split
up. So like I said, we're going to just keep building on it.  
  
Q. Donovan and Ben played so good in this tournament. What do you see
from this core that you have that 's coming back?  
MATT LOTTICH: Well, as you -- it's hard. As you look forward, I think Javon
has proven that he's a pretty special point guard, and kind of that new age
point guard, able to get in the lane, able to score. He's got that knack for
knowing where to pass the ball. So it's a great foundation. You have Donovan,
Ben, who got valuable experience. Their talent is undeniable. There's no doubt
about it. You've got Mileek McMillan coming back, who was on the most improved
team in the league. We've got Nick Robinson. We can get him back from injury.
Zion Morgan coming back. Freshman Emil, never disappointed when got in the
game. There were plenty of times where I actually wanted to put him in, was
just riding with the guys.  
  
So the foundation is there. It's no secret that this group had success, and I
said this in the locker room, you know, Paul, you follow us, but about this
time last year, it looked like the program was in a bad spot. It looked like
it was falling apart, but it was really just coming together. So we're going
to continue to build on it. This group put in a great off-season. They were
fantastic. And they had a lot of success this year. They got better throughout
the year, can't deny that. We've just got to build on that momentum.  
  
Q. Coach, you said there wasn 't an excuse, but what your fans are going
to say is that there's a difference between an excuse and a reason, and nobody
plays four games in four days. You played 3 1/2 games very well, and the last,
it just ran out. That's what fans are going to say.  
MATT LOTTICH: Well, Dot, love ya, and I appreciate that. It's just a hard time
right now. It's just a hard time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you gentlemen. Best of luck in the future.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Brian Wardle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30352)

### [Darrell Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32700)

### [Nate Kennell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34765)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 76, Drake - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Bradley Braves are here. They are set to defend
their tournament title tomorrow against the winner of Valparaiso and Missouri
State. That game is 1:00 CBS. We have Nate Kennell and Darrell Brown
representing the Bradley student body. Head coach Brian Wardle is in the
middle.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: Just a hard fought win. Drake's very well -- Darian's a really
good coach. It's a good program. The best 8 seed, like I said yesterday, I've
ever seen, and that's a lot of respect for our league and the coaches and the
programs in our league. There's a lot of good teams, and they're one of them.  
  
I'm proud of our guys. I liked how we built a little lead. We sustained it. We
held the lead. We kind of never gave them, I don't think, the hope that they
were looking for. I think they cut it to three, and we called time-out, and
then we responded from there. So a lot of good composure from these guys and
great balance offensively for us, obviously led by Darrell in the first half
with the big plays, and then Nate came up big in the second half for us. And
Koch Bar also played really well for us too.  
  
So just it takes a team. Everybody's got to step up and make plays, and we had
that today, and we were fortunate enough to come out with a win.  
  
Q. Big pivotal moment in the game, 11:32 to go. You take that time-out
after that Drake 10-0 run. What was the message in the huddle, and what was
said?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think that's when we were the calmest probably of the game,
right? We knew we had to come out and execute that next possession, buckle
down defensively. We just made some mistakes during that swing. They made some
tough shots, I thought, too, and we knew they were going to fight. I mean,
Drake's hot. They played very well for two straight nights. They're going to
have that push in them. We just had to buckle down defensively, get out
offensively, get the ball moving a little bit more. I thought we took some bad
shots in that run that led to their transition or to their baskets.  
  
Just about keeping the ball moving, keep spacing, and defensively, we've got
to buckle down on a few things, and we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Darrell, for the third game against Drake this year, you played
really well against them. Is there something about playing Drake stylistically
that fits well with your game?  
DARRELL BROWN: No. I'd say the first game, I played okay. The second game, you
could throw that out. We lost by 20. So that really don't count. Today my
teammates set some great screens, and the bigs played phenomenal. They set
some great screens for me. And Nate and the other guys found me, and they also
got open and made some big shots today. So it was a great team win.  
  
Q. Coach, tell us a little bit more about how Koch played today. I heard
that the TV broadcast was saying it was the best game he 's had in his career
at Bradley. I just want to know if you agree with that, and your thoughts on
how he played tonight.  
BRIAN WARDLE: He's had a lot of good games for us. Koch Bar, in his career,
hasn't missed a practice or a game at 6'10", 6'11". One of the most durable,
consistent guys I've ever been around. He's had some really good games for us,
but tonight, and then this moment, hit some of the finishes he had at the rim,
the and ones. The defense, too, on Robbins in the second half was tremendous.
That's where you can catch a team in the third game in three days.  
  
I thought Ari and Koch, and we could just keep throwing bodies at Robbins.
Robbins is a very talented player, a great player, but his defense and his
finishing for us was just tremendous. It was definitely up there, I would say,
in one of his best games ever.  
  
Q. Obviously, school history now with making back-to-back title games.
For Darrell and Nate, has that sunk in? You guys have done something that
nobody else has ever done before.  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, it's pretty awesome. It's just a credit to our hard work,
all the preparation and the years, the off-seasons. It's what we've been
working for. I'm just happy we're back. It's another great opportunity for us
to showcase our team and Bradley.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I think it's no surprise to us. We prepared for this moment and
a lot of long days in the summer, a lot of long fall days. I think we've been
preparing to get back here. We want to make this run special this year, and
we've got one more game to win.  
  
Q. Darrell, your coach said that the time-out was the calmest you guys
were. Can you describe just what the feeling was and maybe what it says about
this team that there wasn 't a moment of panic?  
DARRELL BROWN: I think it's the same thing I said yesterday. All good teams
make their runs, and they did. They made a 10-0 run. So I think we expected
that at some point. I mean, credit to our guys in our locker room, we've got a
great group of guys. I keep saying that over and over again. We stayed calm.
Seniors like Nate and Koch showed leadership, stayed calm, and I think the
younger guys followed, and it led to a big win today.  
  
Q. Darrell, first half you were scoring almost at will, it seemed. I
know it 's harder than that. But second half, you were distributing more. Was
that more by intent, or was that because of something that Drake did or just
the way things unfolded?  
DARRELL BROWN: I think it's just making the right plays at the right time.
They kind of played more aggressive on their ball screen coverage the second
half. I tried to make the right reads and get my teammates involved, as I
would do at all times. They played kind of passive in the first half, so it
opened up some shots for me.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to Elijah after his technical in the first
half?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Just take him out, let him calm down, and talk to him a little
bit later. You never really address it right then. But he's a passionate guy.
He plays with his emotions on his sleeve, and you never want to change that
from him because that's what makes him special. We knew he'd respond.  
  
But definitely, you know, sitting the whole first half and coming back he was
a little out of rhythm to start the second half for us. Then within the last
ten minutes, he really let his defense get going on offense. This guy here and
Nate in the time-outs were telling him, we don't care about anything
offensively. Keep guarding, keep blocking shots, keep rebounding for us, and
we'll win this game. He let that defense get him going on offense where he
makes those big buckets.  
  
Q. Darrell, Coach has the red shoes. It seems like the headband is
becoming your thing. You guys have only lost once when you 're wearing that
white headband. Is that superstitious at all?  
DARRELL BROWN: No, it's just something I do every game. You're going to keep
seeing the headband on me as long as I keep playing basketball at Bradley.
Coach's red shoes speak for themselves. I like that.  
  
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Nate, second half, when Drake was starting to make a run, before the
10-0 but they were making some spurts and so forth, you for a stretch pretty
much were the only scoring for your team. What did you see? Was that a mindset
that you just took on, hey, we 've got to get this done? We need this now? Or
what were they giving you that they weren't before?  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, I was just taking my spots, continue to move without the
ball. I think Darrell found me once. Other guys were straining to get me open.
So I was just trying to stay aggressive like I always do the whole game, and I
was just able to knock down a few and get us going when our offense wasn't as
good.  
  
Q. I 'm sure this has been asked, but for each of the players, first
time Bradley's been in back-to-back championship games in this tournament. Can
you describe what that means? I mean, a long proud history of this school, and
you guys have done something big here.  
DARRELL BROWN: Well, like Nate said, it's special being in back-to-back
championship games. I think we're roommates on the road, so we talked about
this last night when we couldn't really sleep and we were getting ready for
the game. So we're just excited to be back. It's a blessing. We put in a bunch
of work to get here. The coaching staff has been great. The younger guys have
been great listeners and hard workers. It's all coming together at the right
time. Hopefully, we can get this win tomorrow.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, it's exciting. This is where we want to be. Now that we're
back, it even makes it better. It's all the hard work and preparation we put
in makes these moments special, and we're just going to make the most of it.  
  
Q. Nate, just to follow up on that, you obviously grew up in the Peoria
area and went to Bradley games as a kid, your cousin played there, had quite a
career as well. Can you expand on -- with that background, what it might mean
to you personally and what you know it means to the community to see this
happen?  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, it means a ton. I mean, just the community is always
supporting Bradley. Peoria supports Bradley like crazy. It's super fun. It's
awesome just being from the area and just knowing how much people care. It's
great. All the fans are here. It just makes playing basketball so much more
fun, and just being able to celebrate with your friends and your family and
everyone around you, it's really special. Just continue to do what we do, for
them too.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: We need all those Bradley fans here tomorrow. We have such a
great crowd out there that energizes this group. This will be our third game
in three days. If our fans aren't here, I know a lot of them are going to be
coming up tomorrow. So we're excited about that.  
  
Q. Brian, to follow up with you, you came here, and the program was at
one of, if not maybe the lowest point it had ever been. You saw how few people
were down here that first year, and now to see what 's happening, round to
round, year to year, what does that say to you, and how does that make you
feel?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I'll reflect on it more, but it's what we worked so hard for.
It's why you recruit these high character kids. I took the Bradley job because
I know the passion of central Illinois and their love for basketball, and I
wanted to be around a city that embraced the sport and loved the sport. Our
fans do that. Our community does that.  
  
We're really a community-based program. Our community supports us tremendously
in all different ways. We try to give back as much as we can. These guys have
got a very busy schedule usually, but giving back here, winning some games for
our fans, keeping them around, letting them stay in the hotel another night,
and hopefully we can give them something more to cheer at tomorrow.  
  
But it's a special feeling, but it kind of was the plan. It's what we -- what
I envisioned and what my staff and I and these players have worked so
extremely hard for.

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Matt Lottich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34720)

### [Javon Freeman-
Liberty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38895)

### [John Kiser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38923)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 89, Missouri State - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Crusaders are here. They have a date with
Bradley tomorrow, 1:00 CBS, here in the Enterprise Center. John Kiser and
Javon Freeman-Liberty represent the student body. Matt Lottich is the Coach.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Really proud of just the fight and the effort to play three
games in three days, to have the intensity, the attention to detail, and
really just the camaraderie of our guys. That's special. Missouri State is a
fantastically physical team. We were worried about them rebounding the
basketball. We challenged our guys in our shootaround to really take to heart.
I mean, they were bigger. They were longer, and it's something that they
emphasize, and I thought our guys did a good job with that.  
  
Then in the second half, got the ball moving a little bit, got guys in spots
where they could be successful. We were really able to throw some shots in.
Wish we would have made some more free throws at the end of the game. It got a
little closer than I would have liked, but proud of the fight and the effort.
We've got one more.  
  
From where we were two years ago when we entered this league, the 10 seed
losing on the first day, to now, the program's going in the right direction.
It takes a lot of people to do that. So very proud of the collaborative effort
of our institution and our school to put ourselves in a position like this.  
  
Q. Javon, what was the difference from one day to the next for you to go
through the game you went through yesterday to go through the game in
specifically the second half like you had tonight?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: That game actually is out of my head. I knew I had to
come in today and compete, so that's what I did. I had the mindset to go out
there and give my all.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned about three games in three days. Now tomorrow,
they 'll be playing four games in four days. Does that have any concern to
you, and how do you want to prepare your players for that?  
MATT LOTTICH: No concern. It's just what we are. We like to play, I'll tell
you that. So we're going to have fun playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Question for the Coach and either of the players. You made history
today. The first play-in team and first No. 7 seed to make The Finals. Your
thoughts on that. And also, I 'm sure you want to make a little more history
tomorrow.  
JOHN KISER: Coming into the tournament, I thought we were a hot team. It's
just great to be where we are at this point. I wish we didn't have to play
that extra game and have a little bit more legs for tomorrow. It's just a
great moment for our program.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Yeah, it's -- 9-9, it might have been the first or second time
ever they had to play the play-in game. I'm not sure about that. I thought we
did enough work in the regular season. The one thing, we had five returning
players. So we didn't have a lot of guys that have been in the system. So one
of the goals is we've got to get better every single day. When you have teams
like that, if they've got the right mindset, then you can do that.  
  
We've gotten better, and I think we're playing our best basketball now, and
that's what you want to do. Again, 4-4, we can't control that. We're going to
go out and give a great effort, though.  
  
Q. John, you 're playing through injuries. Javon is coming off mono.
What is it about this team? I saw Krikke with the gauze in the face, and
Donovan too. What is it about this team that allows you to persevere to
this?  
JOHN KISER: Everybody on this team loves playing basketball. All of us coming
together, if one of us gets hurt, the others see that doesn't affect him, and
if they get hurt, it doesn't affect them. Just keep moving forward, survive
and advance.  
  
Q. This kind of has a feeling like an AAU tournament, four games in four
days. Do you have any secrets or tricks where you can recover and bounce back
in terms of your body?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: I actually just said that to my roommate, Danny. Man,
this is taking me back to my AAU days. I mean, just basically rest up a lot,
drink a lot of water. Wake up in the morning, eat some good breakfast, and
come out and be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
JOHN KISER: I haven't played AAU in four years now. I don't really know what
my tricks were then. I just know that we talked about it just being mental and
not really thinking about being tired or sore, just keep on moving forward.  
  
Q. Matt, you pressed with the lead. To me it seems kind of unusual. Do
you do that a lot, and why did you do it tonight?  
MATT LOTTICH: We just thought we want to be aggressive. When you have a lead,
seven, eight minutes, you don't want to get tentative, so I thought we'd
press. I thought we got a good rhythm with it. I thought they figured it out
too and got some quick, easy baskets. It's something we'll look at, but I like
our athleticism. I like how we can kind of dictate the game, and it gives
other teams something to look at.  
  
Q. Matt, you were talking about the rebounding, and Fazekas, in
particular, was just a warrior inside for you guys today.  
MATT LOTTICH: Yeah, he's been a warrior. If you watch him a lot, he's just not
the heaviest guy, not the strongest guy. He's dealt with a lot of injuries,
but he's got a lot of fight. He's got a lot of heart. For him to even be out
there today dealing with just the stuff that he's had to go through in his
career is a testament to his character and his toughness. We're really glad
that he's with us right now for sure.  
  
Q. Matt, your early thoughts on the matchup with Bradley?  
MATT LOTTICH: Really good. Really well coached. Old, tough. I mean, they're a
heck of a ball club, and they're experienced. So they've been in this moment,
and it's going to take a valiant effort for us tomorrow for sure.  
  
Q. Matt, can you touch on Javon? Obviously, to bounce back from last
night, and what did you see throughout the course of the morning to get him
ready for this, and then what he did in the game?  
MATT LOTTICH: Look, I've known Javon a long time. I've seen him play well.
I've seen him play great. The one thing that I know about Javon is he loves
basketball and absolutely loves to play, loves to practice, loves to get
better. So there's going to be good days, and there's going to be bad. With
good character, you can take -- learn from the bad and try to put it past you,
and I thought Javon did a great job of that. He was aggressive, but at the
same time smart. I didn't think he pressed tonight. I thought he moved
fantastically. You know, he was huge on the defensive end.  
  
So Javon is who he was. Tonight he was the all league guard. He was the first
team all league guard, and we needed every bit of it.  
  
Q. For John and Javon again, you guys are one win away from going to the
Big Dance. Looking back at that preseason trip to Canada, what do you think
that rafting trip did for this team to get to this place?  
JOHN KISER: Well, our -- during that rafting trip, we actually had a motto,
one team, one boat, to row, and I definitely think this team has taken that
motto and really sailed with it, I guess. It's just been a great year for us
and building as a team.  
  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: Actually, on that trip, I think that's when we all like
kind of came together because we were out there for so long, and we didn't
have much to do but to spend time together. So I feel like that trip is what
started it all, with us coming together, being with this group of guys, just
loving them and the brotherhood that we have, and the one team, one boat
motto.  
  
Q. Matt, we didn 't really talk about this last night, but you played
John a lot at the five over the last couple of games. What have you seen from
him against Prim and Krutwig in the last 48 hours?  
MATT LOTTICH: Pretty tough kid. He's really good positionally. John's strong,
and I'll tell you, it's genetic because, if you ever see his dad, he's about
the biggest, strongest dude you're ever going to run into. He was a Big Ten
champion? Six time Big Ten champion in shot put and discus. Give you an idea.
So he's got good genes and a lot of fight and a lot of heart and a lot of
experience.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow, 1:00, CBS,
against the Bradley Braves.

# [STATE FARM MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Dana Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36583)

### [Ross Owens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38858)

### [Keandre Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38952)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 89, Missouri State - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Missouri State head coach Dana Ford is here. We do have Keandre
Cook and Ross Owens on the way. Dana is going to open up with a statement
anyway. So we'll do that.  
  
DANA FORD: Congrats to Valpo. Wish them the best of luck in the championship
game. Disappointed that we could not come out on the plus side today, and I
thought our guys played -- I thought they played pretty hard. Maybe not as
hard as we've been playing, but I thought they played pretty hard and tried to
make an effort there at the end. But just not enough today.  
  
Q. Coach, pretty close game at halftime. It seemed like it slipped away
from you early in the second half. What happened there?  
DANA FORD: Well, defensively, we just never could guard them. We could just
never stop them. I think they shot about 50 percent, made threes, made layups,
transition half-court, free throws. I mean, they scored every possible way,
and we just never -- you can't go on a run unless you get stops.  
  
Q. Yeah, it just seemed like the ball kind of stopped moving a little
bit there in the second half. Is that something you kind of noticed there
too?  
DANA FORD: We had 15 assists on 30 baskets. We shot over 50 percent and scored
82 points. We gave up 89 points. We just didn't guard. Our feet stopped moving
on defense is what happened.  
  
Q. Just an end to kind of a season that had high hopes coming in. What
do you make of this season as it comes to an end?  
DANA FORD: Well, I mean, it's hard to answer today. We just lost a game that
we felt like we had a chance to win. But I'm sure I let a lot of people down,
but life it like that sometimes.  
  
Q. The back half there, Keandre, you were just bringing the team back,
big clutch shots. Just talk about what you guys were feeling trying to make
that comeback.  
KEANDRE COOK: We just tried to get a lot of momentum back. I was making some
tough shots and stuff like that. We were starting to come back, but we just
couldn't get over the edge.  
  
Q. Ross, I know this isn 't the result you wanted, but to go from a
walk-on to a starter on this team and to bring it to where it was today, you
know, just what's going through your mind as your career has ended here?  
ROSS OWENS: I'm sad it's over. It's been a long four years. I could never
imagine what I got to experience this year. It's been awesome. I've just been
enjoying the ride, and like I said, I'm sad it's over.  
  
Q. This is for Keandre first. Just what did everything mean to you, just
playing at Missouri State? You 've been around a lot of these young guys. Just
how excited are you for just what's going forward under Dana?  
KEANDRE COOK: It means a lot. Definitely created a family here. I learned a
lot. Coach Ford taught me how to be a man on and off the court. It's a great
experience, great journey, and it's a bright future for Missouri State.  
  
Q. Dana, if you wouldn 't mind, what will you miss about this senior
class?  
DANA FORD: I mean, they're great young men. Just being around them, having the
opportunity to teach them on the court, off the court, great kids, resilient
kids. They've grown a lot. Just being around them probably would be the most.  
  
Q. Coach, there was just the inconsistencies throughout the first couple
months, but you kind of started playing harder the last month, and yesterday
it just showed off. Just what do you think the last month can do for the
program going forward?  
DANA FORD: I'm not sure. I mean, you'd hope we play hard every game, but I'm
sure there's some things we can build off of once we look back, once we kind
of unload after a season and look back. I'm sure there's some teaching points
and some positive carryover.  
  
Q. Some of that was from your young guys tonight. Like Isaiah went
perfect from the floor and Ja 'Monta got a bunch of minutes. How excited are
you for the future with those guys?  
DANA FORD: I love coaching those guys. Looking forward to working with them
whenever we're allowed to get back out there. I think they're awesome. Great
kids on and off the floor. Good young Valley players.  
  
Q. You entered this off-season with four open scholarships, five
graduating seniors. Just what are you looking forward to build with now?  
DANA FORD: We'll have to evaluate the roster and see what we need. We've got
to get some backcourt guys, a couple frontcourt guys for sure. Just try to
fill some of the holes that we lose with the senior class.  
  
Q. Dana, when you -- Gaige 's early season injury, is that something
that's going to get better, or does he have to do work on that in the off-
season, number one?  
DANA FORD: I mean, he just has to be off. It's an injury that he'll be off
until it heals, but it will fully heal this off-season.  
  
Q. With the tough season and everything, just what did you learn about
yourself, and what do you feel like you kind of need to change going
forward?  
DANA FORD: I learn about myself every day, I guess. I don't -- I mean, at the
moment, I'm not sure. I'd have to really look back and see. I mean, I -- you
know, I try to be a good person, but I'm sure there's some things -- you know,
each team is different. But who I am as a person, hell, I hope that wasn't the
reason we had an up and down season. I don't think it was. I'm a pretty good
guy if you ask me.  
  
But I think each team is different, and we'll have to do a good job of
building a good team.  
  
Q. Coach, of the two games in the last basically 24 hours, what was the
biggest difference between the two that you saw?  
DANA FORD: They noticeably played harder than we did. When you look at the
steals number and the offensive rebound number, I don't think we won those
today. I don't think we won second chance points and points off turnovers,
which in our last nine games, I'll have to say we won that seven out of nine
times, and maybe Valpo is the two that we didn't. I'm not 100 percent sure of
that.  
  
But I just thought that they played harder. I mean, I thought it was really
that simple. You know, you can look at some of those 50-50 balls down there,
they just got them, and we didn't get them. When they made their cuts on the
offense, they cut harder than our feet moved on defense. They just went after
it harder.  
  
Q. For both the student-athletes, what is the hardest thing about a
season ending from your perspective? What 's the hardest thing when you walk
out and know there's not a practice or a game coming up? What will be the most
difficult thing?  
ROSS OWENS: I'd say the hardest thing is just knowing, for me, my career is
over. Working since I was in second, first grade, playing the game I love, and
being able to play at the highest level, and just knowing that it's all over.  
  
KEANDRE COOK: Yeah, I would say too my career being over. I'm not going to be
around my teammates because I'm going to graduate college and try to move on
with my future plans and stuff like that. Just being around family, being
around Missouri State, I'm just going to miss college.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck in the future.

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Darian DeVries](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36585)

### [Anthony Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36631)

### [Liam Robbins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38948)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 76, Drake - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Drake Bulldogs are with us. Liam Robbins and Anthony Murphy
represent the student-athletes. Darian DeVries, the head coach is in the
middle.  
  
DARIAN DEVRIES: First, congrats to Bradley on advancing. I thought they played
really well. For us, disappointing to be heading home. I thought our guys
really left it all out there, gave it everything they had, and unfortunately
came up a little bit short tonight.  
  
Q. For both players, three games in three days, physically, mentally,
all that. How did you feel in this game? Was the second half different from
the first half just in terms of your legs and everything else?  
THE MODERATOR: Anthony, you're first, please.  
  
ANTHONY MURPHY: The three games in the three days, it was tiring, but
mentally, we were well prepared. Coach gave us some good motivational
speeches, and we just wanted to win.  
  
LIAM ROBBINS: If I was to tell you we weren't tired physically, I'd be lying.
Mentally, I thought we were as fresh as you can be. We're a confident group
and stuff like that. Coach gave us a great game plan. We were ready to go and
execute.  
  
Q. Liam, you had a good first half, tough second half. How much did
their defensive strategy interrupt your flow?  
LIAM ROBBINS: Yeah, they played really good defense and stuff like that,
especially their bigs. They really made me work for position and stuff like
that to get my shots. Overall, that's something I just have to be better at,
is just being more physical and getting to the rim on my finishes and stuff,
fading away, which I did too much in the second half.  
  
Q. Darian, how is this game different from the last time you played --
you played Bradley about a month ago, your place. What was different about
this one?  
DARIAN DEVRIES: The game at our place was Noah Childs, first of all. So that
certainly impacted our matchups. The way we were defending completely changed
just by one guy, just the way guys match up better with other guys. At our
place, there was a lot of fouls called in that particular game, and probably
the biggest difference was Brown. I thought he was super, especially in that
first half. That was a senior not wanting to go home, and I thought he played
exceptionally well. At our place, he didn't play quite as well in that
particular game in the first half. I thought overall, Brown was a huge
difference in this one.  
  
Q. Liam, you took obviously a big step this season. Just what is the
next step for you next season for this program?  
LIAM ROBBINS: Yeah. Just I don't want to put like a roof on or a ceiling on
what I can do so I'm just going to try to keep getting better. I know my
coaches are going to help me do that. So my mentality is just to get better
and not limit what I can do. Just in every aspect, get better.  
  
Q. Coach, your team made a great run coming out of the second half. What
adjustments did you make at halftime to make that happen?  
DARIAN DEVRIES: We tried to get up on the ball screens in the second half. We
haven't done that a lot this year, but we did it a little bit. We were a
little worried about doing it initially because Liam had Koch Bar down low and
Childs posting up Anthony. We didn't want to get him too far away so he could
provide some help. We just felt like Brown was hurting us too much in the
pick-and-roll and was getting downhill and getting into the paint really
whenever he wanted. So we had to do something to keep him out of there a
little bit better.  
  
That's why we adjusted the ball screen defense. And offensively, we tried to
spread it and drive it a little bit more, get them out in space. It was good
for us for a little while. We just -- at the end of the day, we cut it down to
three, and we were right there.  
  
I just thought the next three or four possessions in there, I thought they had
some guys really hit some big shots. Kennell hit the big one in there. We
fouled the three-point shooter. Childs hit a big one. When we cut it to six,
he hit a three at the top of the key to push it back to nine. Every time we
gave them a challenge, I thought they answered and hit us right back with a
big play.  
  
Q. You guys finished 20-14. Can you kind of describe this season, how it
went, the ebbs and flows, and how you guys will look back on it?  
DARIAN DEVRIES: I think, when we look back on the season, the 8-10 Valley
record, Valley was tough. It was hard. Where we really struggled was on the
road, and we had six games, I believe, where we didn't win any of them, and
with five minutes to go, we were either ahead or within a possession. That's
something that, you know, as we move into next year and things, those are some
of the things we've got to clean up. We certainly were on the verge of maybe
finishing a little higher.  
  
Like I told our team all the time, you are what you are. So your flaws are
what gets you there, and as a coaching staff, those are the things we've got
to figure out why did we end up where we ended up and fix them and hopefully
we can -- the year after this year, we can figure out a way to finish those
games a little better.  
  
Overall, it's been a fun group. They're an awesome group to coach. They come
with a great energy, great spirit every day, and I'm really going to miss this
guy, just the tremendous leader, tremendous smile, tremendous person. You saw
him all weekend. He just left it all out there for us. What he did these last
three days, did offensively, was really special to watch. So glad that he's
been a part of our program these last couple years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. Best of luck in
the future.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 64, Southern Illinois - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Bradley Braves are now with us. They have a date
with Drake tomorrow in the first semifinal game at 2:30. With us is the head
coach Brian Wardle, Ville Tahvanainen, Elijah Childs, Darrell Brown on the
other side.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: That was a great basketball game. I thought two teams laying it
all out there, played hard, played tough, played physical. We just were able
to stay -- we struggled offensively. We missed a lot of shots around the rim,
especially in the first half, even the second half. We couldn't get going
offensively, but our defense and rebounding keeps you in the game. That's what
March is all about; survive and advance. You've got to have an identity that
keeps you in the game when the offense isn't going. We've proven we have that,
and the guys believe in it, and they know.  
  
The huddles are great. They just kept saying keep guarding, keep rebounding.
This offense will come. Obviously, Darrell stepped up big time in the second
half, made a lot of plays for us. Elijah was really good all game, Ville's
threes. Then Ja'Shon's back cut at the end, Nate Kennell might have had one of
his biggest assists he's had in his career on the drop-off to Ja on the back
cut.  
  
Overall team effort. Southern Illinois had a good year. They are a tough team.
Bryan has done a great job there. It's going to be fun to compete against them
in the future.  
  
Q. Coach Wardle, you spoke last night and this morning about what it
means to have big time players step up in big games like this. It seems like
throughout the game, different players stepped up at different times. Can you
talk about that?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Every year when a team wins this tournament, us last year,
someone's got to step up every game and make plays. Ville stepped up and made
some big threes today for us. It could be someone different tomorrow. These
guys are going to show up, and Nate's going to show up, Koch is going to show
up. Those guys that have been in this tournament a lot are going to be there.
It's the other guys that can make big plays for you to help win. I thought Ari
Boya played really well for us too.  
  
So just an overall really good team effort. Offensively, we struggled, but
tomorrow it's going to be somebody different, for us or for Drake.  
  
Q. Ville, did you feel like they were playing off of you. How long did
it take you to feel like you were in a rhythm tonight?  
VILLE TAHVANAINEN: The rhythm was there from the start. We moved the ball well
on offense, played hard defense. We got guards to make great passes. It's easy
to get in a rhythm from the start. I feel like even though I missed a couple
of first shots today, I had the rhythm from the start.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak a little more on the play to Ja 'Shon Henry
there at the end of the game? Was that the plan to go to him?  
BRIAN WARDLE: No. We were trying to get a pin down and a post touch for
Elijah. And Nate kind of came off it and curled it because his man trailed him
and attacked the middle. They're not leaving him and they were face guarding
him so Ja'Shon just made a great cut, his man turned his head. Made a great
back cut, and it was a big time finish.  
  
Q. Darrell, they led for probably most of the first ten minutes. You
guys were able to tie it and put them in catch-up mode. How easy was it for
you guys to hold them off once you took the lead in the last couple of minutes
there?  
DARRELL BROWN: That's pretty much been the story of my career since I've been
here. $100 team, most people count us out. I think, when we get down to stuff
like that, we stay together throughout all of that. We kept sharing the ball,
kept trying to compete on the defensive end.  
  
I think once you just keep working hard and give it everything you've got,
when your teammates are good teammates and you've got great guys in the locker
room, you can pretty much overcome anything. I felt like we did that in the
second half. We stayed together and got a big win.  
  
Q. Darrell, first half you had five assists, but you weren 't getting
shots. Second half, you just started making things happen, which has been what
you do. Can you explain a little bit what your mindset becomes in those
situations? Are you looking at what the score is and say, I've got to get
these now because we're just not going anywhere? What goes through your mind?
How do you make that happen?  
DARRELL BROWN: Just being the point guard and the go to guy. I saw that Eli
had it going on. Obviously, if you're a great player and you're a good
teammate, you feed the hot hand. I think the first half we tried to do that,
keep feeding Eli, and making the right plays at the right time. And the second
half, they kind of gave me some openings, and I was able to exploit those.
They had some great screens and made some great passes.  
  
Q. Eli, when the offense is struggling there in the middle of the game,
especially in the beginning of the second half, it seemed like you stepped up
and had some big buckets to keep you guys in the game. Take me through that
stretch for you.  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Just credit to my teammates and you know how they're saying, go
to Eli, go to Eli. Credit to the coaches, the staff drawing up plays for me,
and just knowing -- just at the finish give my team a spark, and that's what
it's really all about.  
  
Q. For Darrell, and I guess Elijah. Darrell, you mentioned you guys kind
of having the underdog mentality. I 'm wondering how much maybe just having
last year's experience was a motivator, kind of helped you see, even if you
aren't the Number 1 seed, you can keep advancing?  
DARRELL BROWN: I think last year gave us a bunch of experience and confidence.
Last year means nothing this year. We've got new guys in the locker room. I
think, as long as they return the veterans and stay composed and show the new
guys the way, this could be a great run for us, and the new guys will just
follow along.  
  
ELIJAH CHILDS: To piggy-back on what Darrell said, we've been down before. We
don't get discouraged. We don't get down on each other. We try to stay
positive. Like Darrell said, we've got new guys in the locker room. If we get
down, they get down. Just try to stay positive and encourage each other.  
  
Q. Coach, any thoughts on tomorrow 's matchup with Drake?  
BRIAN WARDLE: They're hot right now, played well today. Played well last
night. So we'll dive into the film as soon as we get back to the hotel. It's a
short turnaround, it's about you. Honestly, there's a few tweaks you can make
maybe in a night, but with our six returners, with Ari and Ja'Shon as
sophomores, we've got nine newcomers. They're learning a lot right now on
short prep, how to take care of your body and how we do things. That's what
we're going to be diving into in the hotel tonight.  
  
They're playing well. They're a good team. Best 8 seed I've ever seen. You've
got to be kidding me. They're tough. We've got our hands full. We know that.
As long as we defend and rebound, we'll be all right.  
  
Q. You 've got the red shoes again. What was the decision to do that? I
think last year you were commenting they were a little uncomfortable. Are they
broken in now?  
BRIAN WARDLE: These are way more comfortable than last year's. I'm not very
superstitious, maybe a few things. A lot of coaches are very superstitious,
but if I didn't wear my red shoes, my kids would have killed me, put it that
way. My three kids were all over me about wearing these red shoes. Whatever
gives us a little spark or energy, I'd love to do it.  
  
But it's these guys that win the game. It's the effort they put out there, the
composure they played with, and believing and having faith in our identity and
knowing it can get us through a game when we're struggling offensively.  
  
Q. This is for each of the players. Just start with Darrell and Eli and
then Ville. First half offensively -- and Coach talked about how your identity
is the defense, and you just stuck with that. Okay, that 's fine. But when you
are in there getting the ball down on the block in the paint, missing point
blank layups, missing point blank put-backs, how frustrating is that, and how
difficult does that become to maintain that defensive identity? And when it
gets to Ville, I just wonder from a newcomer's perspective, how you feed off
the veterans on that?  
DARRELL BROWN: I would be lying if I said it wasn't frustrating as a player
when you miss layups at the rim. It's very frustrating. But at the same time,
all summer, when you get on campus, everything starts with the defense. So I
mean, as long as you keep playing and stay positive and keep giving it
everything you've got, things will work itself out. We're all hoopers on this
team. We spend hours in the gym. At the end of the day, it will go in when you
need it to.  
  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Just what you work on in the summer. You miss shots in the
summer, you work on moves, you miss shots and keep doing it over and over and
over it again. It's going to fall sooner or later. We know our offense
dictates our defense. We miss a couple shots, we say come down and get a stop,
get a deflection, get a charge, get a block, and that leads to offense. Get
your defense going, definitely your offense is going to come.  
  
VILLE TAHVANAINEN: It's, of course, frustrating, but we knew coming into the
game it was going to be a tough game. There's going to be tough times, that
things don't go as you want them to go. As long as we trust each other, as
long as we play defense, we're going to be good. I mean, feeding off the old
guys, like you said, it's pretty easy for me to feed off them because, even
though things don't go as planned, especially Eli and Darrell, they're both
leaders. So they just always bring the spark, like whatever happens.  
  
Q. Ville, this one is for you. Nate kind of struggled today as one of
those veterans. Did you take that as a cue to step up? And also, throughout
the season, how much has Darrell and Elijah helped you with your development
leading up to this moment?  
VILLE TAHVANAINEN: I mean, even though Nate was struggling or not, I'm just
trying to help my team win, whatever it takes. I was just concentrating on
making winning plays. I mean, these guys made great passes today, and it was
just my job to shoot the ball. Like talking about Eli and Darrell, like I
said, they're both natural leaders. They're good leaders both, like, when
things don't go as planned, they're there to help. So I learned a lot from
these guys.  
  
Q. A couple questions. This is for all the guys on the panel. Usually
with most great teams, there 's a point in the season where either in the
preseason or regular season things just start to click or come together. Has
there been a moment this season for you guys when you realized how good you
could be?  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with Eli, go to Ville, and end up with
Darrell.  
  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think we've shown flashes of how good we can be, but like
Coach said, I think we still can be better. There's still things we can
tighten up. I think there's still holes in our game that people can expose.
Once we tighten that up, then I think we'll really be clicking.  
  
VILLE TAHVANAINEN: Like Eli said, I feel like we can still get better. There
will be some good games, and there will be some bad games, but every day is a
new chance to get better. That's what we strive for. We're trying to get
better every day. I feel like we can still get a little bit better.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: In college basketball, you really don't have too many games
where you have a perfect game. As long as you stick with it, keep working, and
just do what you do every day in practice, and I think that will come out in
the games. You can always pull up close games or blowout wins when you need
them. As long as you just stay true to yourself, everything will work itself
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Bryan Mullins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38851)

### [Barret Benson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38853)

### [Eric McGill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38854)

### [Lance Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38917)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Bradley - 64, Southern Illinois - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: Salukis are here. Barret Benson, Eric McGill, Lance Jones
represent the student body. Coach Bryan Mullins is in the middle.  
  
BRYAN MULLINS: Give credit to Bradley. They made a couple big plays at the end
and made one more basket than us. I'm incredibly proud of how we competed
today and how we've competed all year. This group of guys have represented the
university extremely well on and off the court. It's been a special team.  
  
Q. Lance, 20 points today. How were you able to find yourself to the rim
and make some things happen tonight on the court?  
LANCE JONES: I just want to credit my teammates. They got me the ball in the
right positions. I just wanted to try to make a play off of that.  
  
Q. How much did you feel like the back-to-back threes -- you guys were
ahead for most of the second half. Ville hits two threes to put them ahead
53-51, and you guys weren 't ever able to lead after that. How much do you
feel like that changed the momentum today?  
BRYAN MULLINS: Obviously, it was a back and forth game. Any time you score six
straight points, it's kind of a little mini run. It definitely got them some
momentum, but we were still in it. We were up one, down one, tie game all the
way until the last minute of the game.  
  
Q. Bryan, you mentioned how proud you are of these guys and the way they
fought all year, but when you look at this year, just what kind of foundation
did you want to put down in your first year? What do you feel like you
accomplished in that sense?  
BRYAN MULLINS: I think we have a great foundation, A, because of the seniors
-- Barret, Eric, and Ronnie -- they've done a great job throughout the year of
leadership on and off the court and represented themselves and their families
and this program the right way. They've practiced hard every single day and
shown the younger guys what it takes to be successful at this level.  
  
For the younger guys -- Lance, Marcus, Trent, Karrington, Harwin, everyone
else -- they played in big games. They played in big atmospheres now. This was
a high level game today, and we've won some big games this year, and we've
lost some. Hopefully, that fuels them for the rest of their career at SIU.  
  
Q. Eric and Barret, what was it like to lead this group of largely a
bunch of newcomers and a new staff. What do you think the highlights of this
season will be for you guys?  
BARRET BENSON: It was an honor to be a leader in this program, especially for
the first year for Coach Mullins. Like he talked about, establishing a
foundation, and getting on track to where this program needs to be again. Saw
a glimpse of it this year, and we had a lot of big wins and a lot of memorable
times. So we're very appreciative to this program for giving us the
opportunity to be in this position.  
  
ERIC MCGILL: Like Barret said, I'm very grateful to play with Coach Mullins
and to play with the young team we had, and just a great experience for me.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the younger guys getting experience playing
in these big atmospheres, but want to know how it was for you -- obviously not
the result you hoped for, but coaching as a head coach for the first time in
this big atmosphere?  
BRYAN MULLINS: Arch Madness, it's one of the best conference tournaments in
the country. It was like this as a player, as an assistant coach, and now as a
head coach. St. Louis, the Valley, they do an unbelievable job. It's like an
NCAA Tournament weekend here. That's why I think teams in our league have a
lot of success. So it was a great experience for everyone.  
  
Q. Bryan, can you describe your team 's defense? Obviously, you held
them down in the first half, and you held Nate Kennell scoreless for a good
chunk of the game. What particularly were you focused on? Did you do anything
differently than you did in the past against them?  
BRYAN MULLINS: Not too much. I thought our guys had incredible urgency and
effort today. They did a good job trying to get over screens, trying to
pressure passes. Obviously, we tried to limit our turnovers so they couldn't
get transition threes. Bradley is so dynamic where they can score 80 points
easily on you. So that was a huge concern of us.  
  
Then rebounding has always been a concern. We've got to continue to do better
at that obviously, but especially in the first half, I thought we did a better
job of that.  
  
Q. Lance, playing a position largely you haven 't really played a lot.
Just how much do you feel your game has evolved this year when you look
back?  
LANCE JONES: I feel like it has evolved really well. My teammates gave me the
confidence that I need, my coaches. They believed in me, and that made me
believe in myself more. I want to give thanks to them because without them, I
don't feel I can be the point guard that I'm going to be.  
  
Q. Lance, your first Arch Madness game today, but you certainly didn 't
play like a freshman. What was your mindset coming in, and what are your
thoughts on the whole Arch Madness experience?  
LANCE JONES: This is a great experience. I just wanted to try to do whatever I
could to keep playing and just try to be the best teammate I could be.  
  
Q. Bryan, what do you think you need to take the next step in this
program, and how, I guess, satisfied were you? You kind of overachieved this
year in some people 's eyes?  
BRYAN MULLINS: Definitely not satisfied. I thought we had a group in that
locker room that was capable of playing here on Sunday. That was our goal
throughout the whole season. Moving forward, we've just got to continue to get
our young guys better and continue to add pieces. We're going to miss these
guys' leadership, though, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Congratulations on a good
season.

### [Cameron Krutwig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35099)

### [Keith Clemons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38861)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 74, Loyola Chicago - 73,  
  
THE MODERATOR: Loyola Ramblers are with us. Keith Clemons and Cameron Krutwig
represent the student body. Head coach Porter Moser is in the middle. We're
going to ask Porter to make a statement about the game and then we'll go to
questions for all three representatives of Loyola.  
  
Porter, please.  
  
PORTER MOSER: Obviously, it was a really tough loss. I got to congratulate
Valparaiso. They made some really, really winning plays. I know Fazekas hit a
tough three. Kiser hit a step back, shot another three, Sackey hit one. They
just kept on making winning plays. It's been our Achilles heel all year. If
we're not in that position to make free throws. We tried to hold off. We tried
to do everything you could possibly do. If it wasn't tonight, it was going to
be one of these other two nights. Can't win this thing shooting 50 percent
from the foul line. Krut made two big ones. We were, I think, 12 of 25 going
into those last two free throws. You can't win on this stage.  
  
I got to give Valpo credit. They made some terrific basketball shots to put
themselves in that position. That shot by Fazekas. Kiser hit two -- Kiser was
probably the best player on the floor tonight. The shots he made, the
toughness he had, and I got to just tip my hat to them. They made some really
tough shots to put themselves in that position, and then we didn't finish it
with the free throws.  
  
Q. Cameron, after being up by 18, what did you see go wrong for you
guys?  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: I don't know. I thought we all were pretty positive. We
talked about it a lot throughout the year, just when teams make runs on us,
just try to counterpunch and just try to stay positive through it. I thought
throughout the whole huddle and stuff, there was no kind of shock or anything.
We were all really, really positive and stuff.  
  
It's just credit to them. They made plays and hit some big time shots, like
Coach said.  
  
Q. Porter, after Valparaiso made such a strong second half surge, what
was your message to the team heading into overtime?  
PORTER MOSER: I think it happened with Northern Iowa at home. We talked about,
hey, we've been here before. Northern Iowa made a huge surge at home, and we
came out and went on an 11-0 run. Our message was it's a five minute game. Got
to win this five minute game. Got to stay aggressive. We talked about being
aggressive breaking the press.  
  
I thought Marquise got us off to a good start and made a couple baskets. I
thought Keith -- I mean, 28 points, his career high. He was just terrific for
so many things. Our bench was good. I think our bench was 8 for 12. Krut and
these guys carried us all year long. Take them any time, any place. I'll take
them by my side going into these games.  
  
Our message, back to your question, was, hey, it's five minutes. We've been
here before. Same thing that happened with Northern Iowa and they came back in
that flurry. But it's been a thing for us. I mean, Valpo, we were up the same
thing at our place, and it came down almost the last thing. Why? Because we
were under 50 percent for the foul line. I think we missed two or three
straight front ends and one and ones. Those things, when you start getting
into nine, 11 when they're fouling, then that shot -- they're just different.  
  
It happened to Drake, happened to Northern Iowa, it's happened to us a number
of times. Now that the season is over, we're gonna get back to work. We've got
capable guys. It eventually caught up to us, and it caught up to us tonight.  
  
Q. Porter, you guys had a lot of newcomers, some veterans too, injuries
at the start of the year. Just how would you kind of sum up what this year was
and what you want guys to take from this?  
PORTER MOSER: It's just tough because it's such -- I'm just -- I'm sad. I'm
bummed. Just I'm upset. A lot of emotions going on right now, but I know I'll
reflect on just how proud I am of the guys. We lost two back-to-back Players
of the Year. We really had three guys that have played in this tournament. And
didn't have a senior. Bruno, I love, had a great career, but in our top nine
or ten scorers, we had no seniors.  
  
I said -- I know I'm going to get this question, but I said to our guys at
pregame lunch, what was the first thing I walked in and said? I said, nothing
that's happened today is going to affect us. They knew all the eyes were on
Northern Iowa losing. That didn't come into play. We addressed that at
pregame. Nothing that's happening today is affecting us. We have Valparaiso.
We didn't take them lightly. The newcomers, I thought, were ready to play.
This guy was phenomenal tonight.  
  
It's tough because now you've got to go in the off-season with that taste in
your mouth. You've got to go in the off-season with that taste in your mouth
knowing that -- but we'll sit down and reflect on what we did. We got
everybody back. That's not what we're going to talk about right now, but it's
probably one of those games that's just tough because we really were in a
great mindset coming into St. Louis. These guys were ready. Everything -- I
thought we did a lot of things we needed to do to be up 18.  
  
But we've been skating on thin ice for many, many games with this free-throw
shooting, and tonight it caught us.  
  
Q. Keith, Coach mentioned it a couple times. Obviously, you had a career
high 28. What did you see out there, and what was going right for you?  
KEITH CLEMONS: I just took advantage of what they were giving me. They kept
going on their ball screen, so I just stepped and take the shot. Continue to
be aggressive. If they went over, just go to the hole.  
  
Q. Apologies about asking about the other team, but I know you mentioned
seniors. Valpo had two, Fazekas and Kiser, who made big plays down the
stretch. What did you see from those guys going up against them tonight?  
PORTER MOSER: You don't have to apologize. I've got a lot of respect for those
guys. It's hard to beat a team six times in two years. That's the sixth time
we've played Valpo in two years. It's hard to beat a team six times. So I --
you don't have to apologize. I've got a lot of respect for them. They made
huge shots on that stage in just -- it seemed like they were both like I've
had enough. I've had enough. That's how they were playing down the stretch.
I've had enough.  
  
I know one of the coaches said at the luncheon, at this stage, guys have got
to make big shots, big plays to win three days in a row. Fazekas and Kiser
made huge, huge plays down the stretch, and I respect that.  
  
Q. You pounded the free-throw thing throughout the season with these
guys, but can you pinpoint anything? Just even in the past, it seems like one
of the things that it 's hard to know why. Is it mental? What would you point
to on that?  
PORTER MOSER: I've been really studying it. They're totally capable. We've
done a million things. We've had just -- I think we were 60, and the ninth
place team was 70. There was a ten percentage point difference between 10 and
9. We're capable of that. We're better. We're going to be better in the off-
season. But it just seemed like it got a little contagious. It just got a
little contagious. That was a hard snowball to stop going downhill, no matter
what we were trying.  
  
And they're all capable. They're all capable.  
  
Q. Porter, Tate only had four shots today. What were they doing
defensively that kind of took Tate out of the game?  
PORTER MOSER: I'll look at the tape. I haven't seen the tape yet. I know he
wishes he had that one back. Tate's been great all year. I'll have to look at
the tape. I don't know specifically, to answer that question. I know he's
disappointed. He's tough. Wants to win. Everything you want in a kid. Had a
great year. Third team all league. I don't know specifically what happened.
I've got to look at the tape.  
  
Q. Cameron, similar to what I asked your coach, just what do you want
the team to take from this season?  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Yeah, like Coach said, he was super proud of us. I've said
this -- Coach will probably remember, but I've said this the last three years.
The faces change, but the expectations don't. The good thing for us is we
don't have a lot of faces changing the next year. We didn't live up to our
expectations and our standards. Coach always talks about standards, kind of
our standards for ourselves and as a program. This season, we didn't live up
to them.  
  
So you've got to get back to work. You've got to come with a better focus,
more of a grind in the off-season and in the summer, and, yeah, like I said,
faces change, but the expectations don't. It's fortunate for us because we
don't have that many faces changing. So everyone's got another year under
their belt -- you know, Marquise, Keith, Pip, Pax, Tom, those guys. So yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 74, Loyola Chicago - 73,  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Crusaders are here from Valparaiso. John Kiser,
Ryan Fazekas, Daniel Sackey, and Eron Gordon represent the student body. Matt
Lottich, the head coach, is in the middle.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: This is a pretty big moment for us. Since we entered the Valley,
Loyola is a team we haven't been able to beat. They've got tremendous players.
They're very well coached. To come out here and get a victory in the fashion
that we did, we're very thankful. Our backs were definitely against the wall.
I thought they had planned for us. They did a great job taking us out of our
offense. We challenged our guys to really just play a little bit harder, have
a little more fight, have a little more grit, and they did.  
  
It was a fantastic effort from a lot of guys, and we held on long enough,
great execution at the end, unselfishness across the board. Really one goal in
mind and try to get a win, and just really proud of these young men. They are
so much fun to coach. We survived another round, and we're advancing. We're
going to get them off their legs, get some fluids in them, and tip it up
tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for John and Eron. Kind of take me through the last five
seconds of that. What did you see on the drive, and what did you see on the
shot?  
THE MODERATOR: John first, please.  
  
JOHN KISER: Just coming down, I knew they would close out on me a little
harder. So drove past. Luckily, E.G.'s guy moved over to make it a little
easier shot for him. So he got open and made a pass for him to make a play
after that.  
  
ERON GORDON: That's pretty much what happened. (Laughter).  
  
Yeah, he was asked to make plays down the stretch through this game, and I
know that's something we ask him to do from time to time. He's asked to do a
lot. So when I saw him driving down, I just wanted to get to a spot where, if
his man does come and help, I could just be open. So I just wanted to make
sure I finished the play.  
  
Q. For Matt, down 18 early in the second half, what do you think was the
turning point for this game?  
MATT LOTTICH: I thought we were playing much harder. I know they made a little
bit of a run, but I thought we were playing harder. We weren't on our heels.
We were delivering the blows, and that's important. It's hard to play
basketball when you're tentative. I don't know if it's just a little bit
nervous, opportunity to play against Loyola in an environment like this, but
for whatever reason, we got out of our shell and really started executing and
really started guarding.  
  
I thought our full court pressure hurt them, got them a little bit tentative.
Again, I just thought we were competitive. When you have like minded guys that
are competitive fighting for one goal, it's a tough team to beat.  
  
Q. Ryan, obviously, this could have been your last game. Just talk about
the grit and the fight that you guys had to put on in the closing five minutes
of the second half and then into overtime.  
RYAN FAZEKAS: Yeah, I mean, I love it. My teammates -- really, we came out of
halftime, they said, don't let these two seniors go out like this, and I
really appreciate them. We battled, and we did everything. We were gritty. And
we made plays down the stretch and came out on top. So it feels amazing.  
  
Q. Daniel, you have been in this position, Illinois State, Drake, all of
that. What is it about this team that allows you to shake off these 18-point
deficits like it 's nothing?  
DANIEL SACKEY: Just the heart of this team. Everybody has big hearts on this
team. Everyone is so selfless. Like Ryan said, he said, we've got to get it.
We can't let them go out like that. These are our brothers. So out of respect
to them and respect to ourselves and this program, we've got to at least go
out with a fight, and that's what we did, and we ended up coming out with a
win.  
  
Q. For John, you got a little bit banged up toward the end of the game.
How are you feeling going into tomorrow?  
JOHN KISER: Just going to put my ankle in a boot. Feeling good right now. And
hopefully the adrenaline stays with me throughout the night until 5:00
tomorrow.  
  
Q. There 's no question that Javon was off tonight. What did you see
from him, and what do you need to see from him in the next 24 hours to feel
good about tomorrow?  
MATT LOTTICH: He's obviously a little bit under the weather. He looks like a
young man that hasn't practiced. The thing about Javon and one of the coaching
moments that we can have is just, when things aren't going your way, continue
to keep your head up, continue to trust your teammates, and I thought he did a
good job of that tonight. It just wasn't his night, but he also made a big
shot in overtime for us. He got down the lane. I think -- was that the first
lead that we had in overtime? It tied it, yeah.  
  
So he kept his head up, and it wasn't his best game. These last two games
haven't been his best game, but hopefully, he got some rest today on the bench
and is able to give it a go tomorrow.  
  
Q. After two close losses to a Loyola coach, is there something that you
changed, or what went different this time around that you were able to sneak
out a win?  
MATT LOTTICH: I think, when you do play teams as much and you play them for a
third time, there's some familiarity of really how they're trying to attack
you. I thought we put in some wrinkles. We tried to take them off their
rhythm. They're a great rhythm team.  
  
Really we tried not to turn the ball over. I think, when they really made
their run, we were turning the ball over, they were getting out on the break.
I looked at the stat sheet, and they're one of the top turnover teams in the
country, and we only had 13 in an overtime game, and we'll take that.  
  
We tried to take care of the ball. We tried to keep them off their rhythm, and
that was basically it.  
  
Q. Matt, if you can just, what was going through your head when you saw
the final five seconds unfold of this game?  
MATT LOTTICH: Well, you put the ball in a senior's hand, and I thought Sackey
did a great job of drawing help, getting it back to John, and John did have an
angle. I thought he was going to shoot it, but he made the right play.
Obviously, guy came up to help and was able to make the pass to Eron, and we
got a layup for the game. And I thought we actually did a really good job.
After we scored, there was three seconds left. Donovan got over there,
pressured the ball without fouling, made sure they couldn't run down the floor
and shoot a layup.

# [STATE FARM MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Greg Lansing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21764)

### [Christian Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38860)

### [Jordan Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34754)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Missouri State - 78, Indiana State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sycamores are with us now. Jordan Barnes, Christian Williams
are the student-athletes. Greg Lansing is the head coach. We're going to ask
Greg to start off with a statement on the game. Then we'll go to questions for
all three gentlemen of Indiana State.  
  
GREG LANSING: Just really disappointed with how we played. I didn't see that
coming. Our preparation, the way we've been playing has been really good, and
it didn't look like it tonight, I know that. But give Missouri State a lot of
credit with that. They're obviously very talented. They're picked to win it.
They're deep. They're athletic. They've got great size. They're physical, and
they were too much for us tonight.  
  
So I really commend Dana for getting those guys going again, even though they
struggled a little bit early. They're really good and played better than we
did tonight.  
  
Q. Greg, Missouri State 's physical defense just seemed to dominate the
game. How did you see it?  
GREG LANSING: Well, yeah, I thought they were more aggressive at both ends of
the floor right after the start. I think they really dictated the pace and
were very physical, and it got us standing around a lot. I think our poor
offense, we've been guilty of this when we haven't won games, of it negatively
affecting our defense. They've got a lot of different weapons, and they're
extremely athletic and great in transition and great at the end of the clock
with offensive rebounds.  
  
So they're big, physical, athletic. They can switch one through five, a lot of
it. So it does take stuff away from you. I know we didn't shoot very well. I
thought the first half we were standing around a little too much because of
how aggressive they were, again, at both ends of the floor.  
  
They dictated the pace of both ends for the majority of the time, and I'm not
saying we didn't play hard, but those guys dictated how the game was played.  
  
Q. Christian and Jordan, as Greg mentioned, the shots just never fell.
Do you give Missouri State the credit for that, or was it just an off night
for you guys shooting? There were some open looks, but how do you guys see
that?  
JORDAN BARNES: I think like you said, I think we got good looks. Yeah, those
are the type of shots we normally take and normally go in. Like you said, we
had a lot of open looks. It just wasn't one of those nights. The defense was
pretty physical, and that probably played a little part in it. But I felt like
we always could have played better.  
  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: Our shots just weren't falling. Credit to them, they
played pretty good defense. They're pretty long, so they contested a couple
shots, and it kind of threw us off a little bit. We just weren't making shots,
and I felt like a couple of shots were a little rushed by us. So it just
wasn't a good night for us.  
  
Q. Again, for both of you guys, what 's your level of disappointment
that they were able to dictate the way they did?  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: It was pretty disappointing because our mindset going into
this game was that we were going to be the more physical team, the more
aggressive team, and we weren't really that aggressive and physical tonight.
They were a little bit more aggressive and physical than us.  
  
JORDAN BARNES: Yeah, I think they brought the fight to us. I think all year
we've done a pretty good job of being a smart, physical team, playing through
a lot of pressure and things like that. But I feel like we lacked that a
little bit tonight.  
  
Q. Coach Lansing, how much of a role do you feel rebounding played in
today 's loss?  
GREG LANSING: They've been averaging 14 offensive rebounds over their last six
games, and we knew that coming in. It's not like in practice. Last week we've
been doing a lot of rebounding drills. We've done some, and you've got to talk
about it a lot. A guy like Prim, that's a task to try to block him out. They
do a great job of rooting themself down in there right before the shot goes
up.  
  
They're big at other positions, and they're athletic. So that certainly
showed, and they dominate in the paint. It's 40-22 in the paint, and 21-6 off
turnovers. You've got no chance of competing with anybody doing that.  
  
Q. Coach, just regarding Missouri State, did that kind of look like --
does it seem like they 're clicking right now, just being the high level, just
being the team that was picked to win it all?  
GREG LANSING: I would say they look like an SEC team. With the transfers and
the team -- and it took a while because of the new guys, for Dana to get them
believing. I think throwing Owens in there really generated a lot of the
harder playing that Dana has been talking about a lot, unselfish, playing for
each other a little more, stuff that I think our team was good at all year.
But, yeah, they are good, and when they're right, they're going to be tough to
beat.  
  
Q. Greg, it was a question mark whether Jake was going to play or not.
Can you expound on his effort tonight? I know he was hurting, and that was
probably one significant bright spot.  
GREG LANSING: Anybody that's had a bad back -- his is bad. That's a tough dude
right there to give us 22 minutes. At the end there, he just couldn't do it
anymore, and you could see how disappointed he was, but there were times he
looked like the best player on the floor as a freshman. He just hasn't been
able to do anything, as you know, for about three weeks with practicing or
anything. I know these guys will appreciate how hard he competed and tried to
give us everything he could tonight.  
  
Q. Christian and Jordan, can you guys tell me how you guys feel the
start of the game affected today 's outcome?  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: I thought our pace was pretty good at the start of the
game a little bit. Just, again, they were a little bit more aggressive right
from the get go, and I think those first couple minutes, we kind of turned the
ball over, and I think that's where we kind of started off really bad.  
  
JORDAN BARNES: Like he said, I think our coaches did a good job of preparing
us for the beginning of the game. They gave us a great scouting report, and I
feel like the physicality, it just played a part, also missed shots. So I feel
like we could have played better offensively and defensively, but at the end
of the day, they're just a more physical team.  
  
Q. Greg, would you consider playing on in another tournament? And if so,
what have you considered on that? If you don 't play in another tournament,
kind of talk about the way this season played out.  
GREG LANSING: I haven't talked to these guys about it yet, but I would
definitely like to keep playing, and any chance you've got to keep playing,
especially being around these guys -- we've got a lot of young guys. There's
tournaments out there. We wouldn't be able to host because of the
construction, but we've started -- we're successful there, on the road the
last couple of league games, and I think I'd be all for it, whether it be the
CBI or CIT or whatever tournament it would be, but it would have to be on the
road.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the start of that second half? It
seemed like the Bears had kind of kicked it into another gear to start that
half.  
GREG LANSING: Yeah, I mean, basketball is a game of runs too, and they can put
one on you really quick. If you make a mistake at one end, they'll turn it
into something at the other end, and you do that a couple times in a row --
then with all the turnovers we had just to -- and not making shots. You've got
to be able to get your defense set. We just couldn't do that enough tonight.  
  
Again, they're very good. Give them a lot of credit for us not playing as well
as we played -- could have played.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

### [Austin Phyfe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38909)

### [A.J. Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38910)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Drake - 77, Northern Iowa - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Northern Iowa Panthers with us now. Head Coach Ben Jacobson,
A.J. Green, and Austin Phyfe represent the student body. We're going to ask
them to make a statement on the game, then we'll go to questions for all three
representatives of UNI.  
  
BEN JACOBSON: Thanks. We played great for all of it, for all four months. You
just like to play your best, and today, we didn't. Had we played our best, I
don't know that we would have won. Drake still may have beat us. Drake played
good. Give them credit for the way that they played today, and they played
good yesterday.  
  
So when I say that, that doesn't mean we would have won the game, but today
wasn't -- it wasn't our best. We've been great for four months. So, again, I
give Drake credit for the way in which they played.  
  
Our guys -- we haven't been behind very much, very often this year, each time
we have, we fought back and got it to a one possession game. Today we had it
back to a two-point game and missed a three that would have put us up one.
That one there may have been enough to turn the tide and maybe tip it over the
edge.  
  
I'm proud of our guys for getting it to a point there early in the second half
where we were in position to get the lead and it didn't go.  
  
Q. Ben, what stuck out this go around with Drake? Obviously, you guys
had a lot of success with them less than a week ago when it came to their
playing and what they were trying to do against you guys today.  
BEN JACOBSON: There wasn't anything noticeably different with what Drake was
doing or with what we were doing. They played better in this game than they
played a week ago, and that's always a part of this when it happens this way.
I felt like there were some plays at the offensive end we didn't execute, some
of the things at the end of offensive possessions as well as we have, and it
didn't feel like we blocked out. When you add those things up, we gave away
some possessions at the offensive end. We gave them some second chances at our
defensive end, and those are things that we just haven't done a lot of.  
  
We've done a great job. We've been highly efficient offensively than we were a
week ago in that game, and we've been a terrific defensive rebounding team,
one of the top defensive rebounding teams in the country. So both of those
things were going on, and Drake was playing good basketball. That's where I
give our guys a ton of credit. To cut it to ten at half and then to cut it to
a two-point game after all that was going on for most of the first half.  
  
Q. What do you look at as what prevented your team from playing at the
level that it had earlier in the season as you mentioned too? Was there
anything that you saw early in this game that looked different out there?  
BEN JACOBSON: Not really. Other than what I just mentioned, I don't -- we left
a couple possessions on the table offensively, and we didn't block them out
very good, and that's enough, right? That's a lot of a basketball game. Boy,
outside of that, our guys played their tails off. When I talk about we left
some possessions on the table and we didn't block them out, it wasn't because
we didn't play our tails off. Our guys practiced well this week. So all of
those things were great.  
  
Then we hadn't been in that spot. We got it to two, and as it got back to 8 or
10 or 12, when it got to that part of the game, we hadn't been in that spot
all year. So it's the first time we had to handle that part of it. There
wasn't anything, other than what I mentioned. Fundamentally, we've been really
good. We left some plays on the table at both ends in the first 20 minutes.
Otherwise, it's a tie game at half, and maybe we have a chance to come out and
get up eight or ten, and we just left too many plays on the table.  
  
Q. Austin, you hit that three-point play inside to get it down to two in
the second half. Can you talk a little bit about kind of where the team was at
at that moment, and what were the challenges of just kind of turning the
corner from there and being able to continue to build on that?  
AUSTIN PHYFE: For sure, like Coach said, first half we were down a little bit.
We were just overthinking some things and not playing our type of basketball.
Then in the second half, getting the crowd into a bit and having some momentum
was really big for us.  
  
Q. A.J., Coach had mentioned how at the end of some of the offensive
possessions, the execution wasn 't quite as sharp as it needed to be. It was
certainly tough out there for you today. What were you seeing? I mean, how
difficult was it for you to find space and get the looks you were trying to
get?  
A.J. GREEN: I think I was able to get some of my spots, but I think I might
have just rushed it a few times too early in the possession. I maybe didn't
just stick with what we were doing a week ago, just letting our offense work
for us, and then when I have shots, just shoot it.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have been in conversations for an at-large bid for
the NCAA Tournament for a couple weeks now. Do you think this changes those
chances? And how are you going to prepare for that decision?  
BEN JACOBSON: Yeah, our -- man, as I mentioned, these guys, what a four months
that these guys have put together. That's all of the resume, except for today.
And I bring that up because this is going to have an impact on it. Any time
you lose a game -- had we lost last week at Drake or at home to Southern or
Evansville, any of those games are going to impact where you stand.  
  
But there's a lot -- between now and next Sunday, there's a lot of teams that
are playing, a lot of conference tournaments that are going. So the team
sheets that look like ours, the ones that they'll be comparing, there's a lot
that's going to happen with those. These guys have done an unbelievable job.
We've been between -- when you look at the different -- the NET rankings and
KenPom and the different rankings and you look at the AP poll or the USA Today
coaches poll, we've been between, basically, 26 and 40 the entire year, once
you get to mid-December or late December. From January 1 on, we've been pretty
well between 26 and 40, and that's an NCAA Tournament team.  
  
When you add all of that up with everything these guys have done this year and
you put our team sheet down next to the rest of them, yeah, I feel like --
this obviously doesn't help, but it doesn't change what happened for four
months, and that's, when they get to next Saturday night and Sunday, they're
looking at everything that happened over the course of the four months, and
that's where I feel great about these guys and I feel great about what we've
done.  
  
Q. Correct me if I 'm wrong, but I think this is the first time in your
time here where it's been kind of a wait like this to Selection Sunday where
you guys have been right on the bubble for an at large. How will you guys
approach this next week just in terms of keeping an eye on what you think
needs to happen, or will you guys go back to practice, business as usual?  
BEN JACOBSON: We're playing either way. We're either in the NIT, or we're
getting an at-large bid. So how we structure our practices and what we do will
be the same way we have in 2016, 2015, the years that we've known we're in the
NCAA Tournament. We'll do everything exactly the same.  
  
Then there's -- we don't have control over how the games turn out and what
happens. I follow all that stuff, and I'll be tracking it, and we'll be
talking about it with the guys. They've earned that. They're right in the
middle of the at-large picture. So we'll talk about it some during the week,
but we'll be able to approach it the same because we're playing no matter
what. So we'll be ready to play whether we get an at-large bid or we're
playing in the NIT. We'll be ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Missouri State - 78, Indiana State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Bears are with us. They have a date in the
semifinals tomorrow against Valparaiso. That's Game 2 in our double header.
Lamont West and Gaige Prim represent the student body for the Bears. Dana Ford
is in the middle. He'll give a statement on the game.  
  
DANA FORD: First of all, congratulate Coach Lansing on a great year. They did
a great job and had a fantastic season, and I'm sure they'll play more. I'm
not sure what tournament, but I have a lot of respect for them and what they
do.  
  
I'm really proud of how hard our guys played. Just happy to see them happy. I
thought we came out in both halves and took it one possession at a time and
tried to play together as much as we can on both ends, and I'm just really,
really proud of their effort.  
  
Q. Coach, just the high level performance from you guys. Just the way
you guys responded to that little run there when Indiana State had a 7-0 run
there in the second half, just to be able to respond to that, how proud are
you for that?  
DANA FORD: I'm really proud. We're trying to encourage the players to not put
a cap on themselves, meaning the other team doesn't have to make a run. And I
thought tonight we did a good job with that mindset of continuing to play and
not falling into it has to be a madness, or it has to be this, or it has to be
that. We just focused on playing hard, and they did a good job.  
  
Q. Dana, the physical tone your defense set, can you illustrate now
important that was and what your defensive plan was going in to get Indiana
State out of sorts?  
DANA FORD: Well, I mean, it was really important because they do a good job
running their offense. They've got really good balance on offense, so it's not
like you can just guard the three or just guard the end. You've got to guard
everything. We're fortunate to have guys that are some interchangeable parts.
We did a pretty good job in the first half keeping the ball in front of us,
helping whenever we didn't. I just thought that our guys were really locked in
defensively.  
  
We've had all week to prepare, so I think that they really did a good job of
executing what we simply asked them to do. I mean, it's just -- when we have
so many interchangeable parts, it's not very complicated.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys look to one game at a time and all that, but
you see the upsets that happened earlier today, top seeds are gone. A path may
be open to the ticket that goes to something at the end of this tournament. Do
you think a little bit about that?  
DANA FORD: No. We finished sixth in the league. We just got to .500 today, I
think. I'm just -- we're just looking at the next possession. We're going to
get these guys back, get them rested up, and we'll do the first possession of
the next game and just take it one possession at a time.  
  
Q. Lamont, you 've kind of talked about how you guys can just get better
and that we haven't seen your guys' best. How close was that tonight to how
good you guys can be?  
LAMONT WEST: We practiced real hard, and Coach always gets us prepared for the
games. We want to play for each other. We want to play for him as well. We can
only get better from here. Like Coach said, we can't put a cap on ourselves.
We can only get better from here.  
  
Q. Coach, you have talked throughout the season how you guys start the
second half tells you how that game 's going to go, and today it went really
well. What was said at halftime to keep that energy going?  
DANA FORD: I think the first thing we emphasized all week, you achieve what
you emphasize. We made a concentrated effort to get their attention of how we
start the second half. Again, not putting a cap on ourselves, meaning you
don't have to have a lull. Something has to happen for you not to play well,
but you don't have to make that decision.  
  
We just hadn't been coming out of halftime very well down the stretch, but you
have to give these guys credit today. They did a good job moving the
basketball, trying to keep the defensive intensity up, and make things
difficult for Indiana State.  
  
Q. Lamont, you said play for him. Just how much was that kind of
weighing on you guys this week? Just how nice was it to have that kind of
performance for that?  
LAMONT WEST: I mean, it really hurt us. You know, he was really important to
our team. Everybody dreams of going to college and playing for a good program,
and he really didn't get that opportunity. So we just want to not take each
day for granted. So we want to just go out there and just play for him.  
  
DANA FORD: I'd rather not talk about A.J.'s situation out of respect to his
family. We're not going to make anything about that, but I understand why
you'd have to ask that.  
  
Q. Gaige, it was a pretty scrappy game down low. What did you see, and
what did you like from you, yourself, and your teammates?  
GAIGE PRIM: I think my teammates give me the ball a lot. I think that just
helps a lot because I can't do any of this without them. So it's a team game.
Guys are going to double, kick out, get wide for a three for Ross, so probably
get it like that.  
  
Q. Gaige, just talk about it being March and trying to get on a roll
here and the tournaments and the NCAAs and all that.  
GAIGE PRIM: It's really important to get on a roll, start early. I think this
win helps us a lot going in the right direction. So we've just got to keep it
going.  
  
Q. Gaige, just kind of what do you make of the day? I mean, just the top
three seeds going down. What 's kind of the player's mindset when you see a
thing like that?  
GAIGE PRIM: It happens. It's March. Anything can happen. Any team can win on
any given day. So should be ready for anything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. See you tomorrow against the
Crusaders, second game in the doubleheader.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Drake - 77, Northern Iowa - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Bryan Burwell Memorial
interview room here at Arch Madness.  
  
The victorious Drake Bulldogs are with us. They have a date in the semifinals
tomorrow, first game against the winner of Bradley and Southern Illinois. From
the student body, we have Anthony Murphy, Jonah Jackson, and Roman Penn. The
head coach is Darian DeVries.  
  
DARIAN DeVRIES: First off, I'd like to congratulate Northern Iowa on a
tremendous year. They're certainly an NCAA Tournament team and deserve to be
in the tournament, but wanted to congratulate them on just an incredible year.  
  
For our team, certainly happy about the way they performed today and really
competed, and it was fun to watch them out there for these 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you talk a little bit about your defensive approach
against Green, and how your team was able to regroup after UNI got it within
two points there in that second half when you held them scoreless for a ten-
minute stretch.  
ANTHONY MURPHY: Of course, I had A.J. Green up the half-court so he wouldn't
give me great shots or any drives to the paint. My team was on the offensive
end, Roman, Liam, Jonah making big shots and kicking the ball out so we could
get the victory.  
  
Q. For you three guys, what does this mean to be able to pull this win
off, to come together from the same area, and to do this?  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Roman, Jonah, and then Anthony will finish.  
  
ROMAN PENN: It means a lot. We're all from the region. Being able to play and
represent the region as best as possible, it's a blessing and an honor. Just
being able to be on the Division I level, five of us from the region, you
don't really see it that much. So we want to represent to the best of our
abilities and also represent Drake and our fans and everyone who supports us.  
  
JONAH JACKSON: To go off of what Roman said, kind of humbling. Most don't have
that kind of opportunity we have in this region, so we make the most of it.  
  
ANTHONY MURPHY: Playing with these guys is great. To finish out my last year,
I wouldn't want to do it with any other guys. I just love playing with these
guys and the coaching staff.  
  
Q. Darian, what did you see out of your team defensively after UNI cut
that deficit to two and had a couple looks at it that allowed you to get those
strings of stops to get that separation and put this game away?  
DARIAN DeVRIES: I thought we got a little sped up coming out of halftime at
the offensive end and got us a little disjointed. Defensively, they hit a few
shots early to cut that lead pretty quickly down to two. I gave our guys
credit coming out of the time-out and things. I thought they settled down a
bit, really dug in more defensively, and made things hard. They're tough to
guard. They spread you out. They can go inside with Phyfe and A.J., Player of
the Year, and all the other pieces, they're just all tough. They spread you
out so much.  
  
I thought the guys did a tremendous job, just from an effort standpoint, of
really fighting and competing and trying to challenge them on everything.  
  
Q. For Roman and Anthony, can you take us through that play where late
in the shot clock there 's a scrum. I think, Anthony, you picked up the ball,
kicked it over to Roman, you hit a three with a about a second left on the
shot clock. Felt like the dagger of the game.  
ANTHONY MURPHY: I saw Roman when I hit the ground, and I knew he was going to
make the shot because he was hiding. I just had faith in Roman.  
  
ROMAN PENN: Yeah, I don't know about that, but it was a scramble. I saw the
shot clock going down. I actually was able to set with my feet a lot better
than I thought I was, and I was able to actually get a pretty good look for
the situation that we had, and I was able to knock it down, and we were able
to get some key stops towards the end.  
  
Q. Darian, to go from that blowout loss in your home gym the final game
of the regular season, you lost three straight coming into this tournament, to
accomplishing something that 's never been done before in this tournament,
what can you say about what your team was able to do to get to this point
today?  
DARIAN DeVRIES: I've told the team all year, we didn't finish where we wanted
to, but we've been really close in a lot of games. We continue to believe in
each other, and we went into this tournament saying every game is just a new
40-minute game, and we really approached that today.  
  
Northern Iowa has had a tremendous year. We didn't have quite the year we
wanted to, but today was just one 40-minute game, and whoever's better after
these 40 minutes gets to play on. That was our challenge to them is just be
the best us we can be today, and we'll take the results. I thought these guys
really kept believing. It started yesterday and then today again. Just played
with tremendous kind of effort.  
  
And they had fun. They were having fun out there. It's awesome as a coach to
see them enjoying playing the game.  
  
Q. Coach, we 're almost exactly 24 hours until your third game in three
days. What's the next 24 hours look like?  
DARIAN DeVRIES: For these guys, they get to go rest, and for me, just no
sleep, but it's the best no sleep that there is out there. This time of year,
I don't even know if you feel tiredness in March. I don't think it's humanly
possible when these guys on this stage -- they just want to play. There's no
way they'll come out and be tired tomorrow. They want that next game, and then
they want to play one more. They'll be ready to go. They're resilient. I
couldn't do it, but these guys can.  
  
Q. Jonah, they gave you credit for a two-point shot attempt. You came
close, I think. What is it about the three-point shot for you? And you have
not hit a two-point shot all year.  
JONAH JACKSON: Yeah, just, I don't know actually. It's just what I'm good at,
so it's just what I kind of do for the team. The team needs me to make shots
from the perimeter, from the three, so that's what I do.  
  
DARIAN DeVRIES: Drew it up for him today to get the one shot.  
  
Q. I was going to ask, is there a celebration planned for when this
happens?  
DARIAN DeVRIES: I told him this morning in our shootaround. We're going to run
this play for you, and you're going to get a two-pointer. You can dunk it, do
what you want with it, just don't trip and fall. It didn't work. He's got a
unique skill set to not have any two pointers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Brian Wardle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30352)

### [Darrell Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32700)

### [Nate Kennell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34765)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Braves are defending champions. They'll play the Number 5 seed
SIU Salukis 2:30 on Friday. Nate Kennell and Darrell Brown represent the
student body. Head coach is Brian Wardle is in the middle. We're going to ask
Brian to open up with a statement about being in St. Louis, about his team and
then we'll go to questions for all three Bradley Braves. Brian, please.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's good to be back. We're excited for a great postseason
tournament and Arch Madness. Excited for this team, this group. We've got a
nice energy, nice bounce about us, and we're excited to compete at 2:30
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For each of the players, could you guys give us some of your memories
of last year 's championship run and how much you think that helps you guys
coming into this tournament?  
THE MODERATOR: Darrell first.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: The tournament last year was special. We fought through a lot
of adversity, some comeback games, comeback wins. We played the top seed,
Loyola, and had just lost to them the year before. So it was special to get
revenge on them. It was a great run overall.  
  
NATE KENNELL: It gives us a lot of confidence coming into this tournament.
We've got a lot of guys who are experienced and know how to win. It's exciting
coming back and get another shot.  
  
Q. Coach Wardle, going into a third time playing a team in a season, is
there much you can really change going into the final game, or do you know
what to expect?  
BRIAN WARDLE: They might add some things, whether it comes from a set play on
offense or tweak defensively, I think that's what you do. You kind of tweak
things, little details, but not a whole lot, you're right about that. It comes
down to playing under the lights. It's a different type of feel, different
type of vibe out there in conference tournament, and you've got to go out
there and perform.  
  
I think for both teams it's going to come down to defensively who makes the
least amount of mistakes and then got to make big shots, and then you've got
to make momentum changing plays. We were able to do that last year, and
hopefully that helps us do it this year. It may not. I've seen teams win ten
in a row and come in and lose the first round of the conference tournament.
I've seen teams lose five in a row. Or lose five to end the season or come in
and win the conference tournament in my years as a coach.  
  
It all comes down to that two hours and performing in that two hours.  
  
Q. Brian, could you review the two games with the Salukis this year? You
guys won them both, but it was like each team won two halves almost, the way
the games broke down. Could you just kind of review how the games went.  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think what you show your team is, when the second half of our
home game and the first half at their place, when we're doing things right and
clicking and executing, how we can look. Also, when we make mistakes on
personnel or we break down or take a bad shot offensively and so forth, it's
all teaching. These guys know what they can do. They know when they're
clicking and performing at a high level, that we can play and beat anyone.
That's what we have to do. I mean, we've got to do a great job defensively on
them -- knowing personnel, knowing what they're trying to do to us when it
comes to driving in goals and getting the ball inside. If we can execute that,
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. For both players, could you guys just look back. You played them
about three weeks ago down in Carbondale. That first half, you guys have had
few first halves you 've played that well. It seemed like you did everything
well that first half. The second half was a little different, but you guys
held on to win. Could you just focus on that game and what you guys feel you
did well and what you think other things you'll need to improve on this time
around?  
THE MODERATOR: Nate, you're up first this time.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, just putting a full 40 minutes together. I think our team
is really capable of doing that. That hasn't happened. I know our best is yet
to come. Really just dialling in and focusing and just continue closing out
games. That's what we know how to do is finish a game, and we need to keep
doing that.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, the first half we came out and did pretty much what we
wanted to do, and it led to a great first half. The second half, we let them
get to some of their tendencies, and they went on the run a little bit. That's
what good teams do is, go on runs. We just have to weather the storm and
finish the game up the right way, and I think we did a good job of finishing
the game up.  
  
Q. You guys have both had great careers at Bradley. I wonder if you
could just kind of review your four seasons. You 're both up there in
different categories for career stats. Could you -- Nate, you're second in
three-point shooting, and Darrell, you're sixth now, but maybe end up fifth in
total points. So can you guys just kind of reminisce about your four years and
what you feel went well for you at Bradley?  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, it's been a great career. Hopefully, we can keep adding
on to it. That's the plan. But you have to enjoy the memories and the moments
with your teammates. You have different teammates each year, so it's just
special building bonds with new guys. Having the same coach was big for us, me
and Nate's development both. So we're just grateful for our situation and our
opportunities that have come about since we've been here. I think we've been
in the 4-5 game pretty much three out of our four years here. So we kind of
know what the situation feels like. Hopefully, we can keep on building.  
  
NATE KENNELL: Yeah, it's just been really special. It's been fun the entire
time, just being able to enjoy it and just going through all the adversity and
the excitement and ups and downs. That's really what builds relationships. I
mean, it's just awesome to get to do it one more time here in St. Louis. It's
really special, and I know, for the younger guys getting to watch us is
important, too, so the program continues to keep building.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. Best of luck.

### [Eric McGill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38854)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the Southern Illinois Salukis. They are the 5th seed.
They'll play the No. 4 seed Bradley Braves at 2:30 on Friday. Eric McGill,
Barret Benson, and Ronnie Suggs, Jr. represent the student body. The head
coach is Bryan Mullins.  
  
BRYAN MULLINS: We're excited for our game tomorrow. We have a tough opponent
in Bradley. We played them tough both times. I think these guys are really
looking forward to this weekend. Right now, it's about us being us and playing
the right way. We know that Bradley is going to be ready to go. With our three
seniors, they've done a great job of leadership and communicating this whole
season. I'm excited to coach these guys tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what it 's like to be here? Do you feel like
you've put the three-game skid to end the year behind you and taken this as a
new season?  
THE MODERATOR: Eric, we'll start with you, and Barret and Ronnie finish up.  
  
ERIC MCGILL: I feel like we had a lot of great preparation the last couple of
practices to where we can get past those last three games and be ready for
this weekend.  
  
BARRET BENSON: I agree with Eric. Definitely excited for this. You get in the
arena and get that conference tournament feel. The excitement is there, and
like he said, it's a new season. All the guys are ready and are going to do
what we have to do.  
  
RONNIE SUGGS JR.: Agree with what they said. We have a next game mentality.
It's a new game, new season, and I'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach Mullins, what do you plan to do differently as a team heading
into the third game against Bradley this year?  
BRYAN MULLINS: We played two good halves against Bradley. The first game we
played a good first half, and the second game we played a good second half.
Our challenge is to play 40 minutes against them. We've got to play the right
way, we've got the value the ball, we've got to rebound and get back in
transition defense. We can't play only 20 minutes and expect to be successful
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Barret, you know, obviously, their size, big matchup for you. Just
how much responsibility do you take? You 've got to either win that matchup or
match their numbers, so to speak, on Friday night.  
BARRET BENSON: I mean, I approach every game the same way regardless of who
we're playing. So I'm just going to go as hard as I can for as long as I can
and attack the game whatever way I can and help our team get a win.  
  
Q. Bradley typically crashes the boards pretty hard, as you guys know.
How well do you have to rebound as a team to be effective on Friday?  
ERIC MCGILL: Just being able to be physical and just being able to mentally
just be prepared to block out everyone and just having guards to come down and
crash and help us with the rebounds will be huge for us.  
  
Q. Ronnie, I apologize if this has already been asked. Coming back to
St. Louis for the last time for you, how special is this, obviously, as it all
kind of comes together playing against your former team?  
RONNIE SUGGS JR.: Yeah, it's definitely special. It's always special to play
in front of my hometown. I love St. Louis so much, and to be able to play
against my own team, it's going to be very competitive, but I'm excited for
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your attendance. Best of
luck.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Dan Muller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24792)

### [Zach Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38885)

### [Keith Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38886)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Drake - 75, Illinois State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Illinois State Redbirds are with us. Head coach Dan Muller is
flanked by Keith Fisher, III and Zach Copeland. We're going to ask Dan to open
up with a statement on this game and we'll go to questions for all three
representatives of Illinois State.  
  
DAN MULLER: Credit to Drake. They competed. The start of the second half
obviously killed us with our turnovers, but I thought Drake really played a
great game, and Coach DeVries did a heck of a job. Always tough to lose your
last game and not be able to coach your seniors again. Proud of how we fought
back, but obviously, it was too little, too late.  
  
Q. Zach, could you talk about the start of the second half? It seemed
like you guys had all the momentum from the first two minutes of the first
half. Why weren 't you able to bring that back out to start the second half?  
ZACH COPELAND: Just defense, defensive breakdowns, turnovers. That's what it
really came down to. We fought. I thought those guys did a great job while I
was out fighting back. I love those guys, man. They left it all out there for
me when I wasn't in. That's what I'm most proud about. They gave it their all,
and that's all you can ask.  
  
Q. Dan, can you talk more about Torres leading that charge in the second
half, sparking the team?  
DAN MULLER: Ricky came in and did a great job. Makes a three, makes three free
throws, gets the pullup, really was a big part of the comeback. Ricky is a
great kid. He hasn't had the season he wanted to, a lot of guys haven't, but
in particular, Ricky. Part of the reason that D.J. Horne had the year he had
was because of Ricky Torres. He was selfless from the beginning, which is
pretty unique, especially a guy who comes in for one year, but he was terrific
during that stretch. Like I said, it certainly wasn't enough, but we did keep
fighting.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the mentality at halftime when your team was down? Do
you try to tell them that you 're still in it and you guys have a chance?  
DAN MULLER: Yeah, we talked about having momentum. Going into the locker room,
it was our ball, and we came back and made a couple of big plays down the
stretch there and felt like we could make some adjustments that we talked
about because we had nine turnovers in the first half. So we talked about how
not to turn the ball over, a couple of adjustments, and thought we had a great
mindset coming out of the locker room. Obviously, the start of the second half
did not show that, but, again, it was the turnovers. I think we had six
turnovers in the first five minutes of the second half, and when you do that,
you're going to be in trouble, especially with a team like Drake who pushes so
hard to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Coach, was the matchup between Abdou and Robbins not really working
throughout the first half?  
DAN MULLER: Robbins is hard for us to guard. We talked about that going into
the game. He's so much bigger than us. Abdou did a solid job at times. Ray did
a solid job at times. But the bottom line, he's just bigger and more physical
than our guys. They just throw the ball up to him. I wouldn't say anything in
particular about Abdou's matchup, but Dou struggles to score, so when you get
down, it's hard to play him. We needed some scorers out there. But he is a
tough matchup for us.  
  
Q. Keith, can you just talk about -- you guys have been playing pretty
well the last three weeks or so. To go out this way with some of the problems
that kind of reared their head all season, how tough is that to kind of
fathom?  
KEITH FISHER: Just really tough, it hurts. Really wanted this win for my
seniors and for the rest of my brothers and my coaches and things like that. I
love playing with these guys, especially the three guys I won't be able to
play with for the rest of my college career. It's extremely tough. It hurts
like hell.  
  
Q. Zach, final game as a Redbird. What kind of emotions are running
through you right now?  
ZACH COPELAND: Definitely sad that I won't be able to play anymore. Play for
Coach Muller, play with these guys. We built such a good chemistry. Actually,
both years I've been here, both teams I've played with, I've built such good
relationships with these guys. I'm going to really miss them. For Coach
Muller, he's taught me so much, helped me so much through this process. I'm
really just grateful and blessed to be able to say I played for Illinois
State.  
  
Q. Dan, could you just talk about defensively, obviously, the zone did
not work as well as it did when you played Drake the last time, but to their
credit, they shot the ball much better than they did from three.  
DAN MULLER: We knew it could be an issue. It wasn't just their shooting. They
were getting the ball inside a little bit better. We talked about how we did
struggle to guard them in man. It was just a tough matchup for us with the big
fella. Transition, again, our turnovers, we let their only great shooter make
five threes. We had emphasis on that. Just some of our issues over the course
of the season showed itself. Some of the inconsistency defensively, turnovers,
lulls in scoring the ball. But they are a tough matchup for us because of
Robbins.  
  
Q. With D.J. 's struggled play, do you think the moment might have been
a little too big for him first time around?  
DAN MULLER: No, not at all. They did a great job defensively on D.J. He
struggled to make shots. They're big around the rim. I thought he did a lot of
really good things. A couple of his turnovers weren't really his fault, a
couple of passes missed. But D.J. is a competitor. He was in there during the
part we came back, so not at all about the moment. He didn't have a great
game, but, no, he was ready for tonight.  
  
Q. For both the players, when you look back on this season, where are
you going to look at where maybe there were some shortcomings this season?
Obviously, you guys started pretty well and just kind of went down for a while
until the end here.  
KEITH FISHER: I would say it's tough to just think right now because of the
emotions and things like that. Throughout the season, we had one player after
another have like sort of a drought, or if you want to call it that, a bad
play. That hurt us a lot. I don't think we ever had a game this season where
all of our players were hitting on the same cylinders and things like that
other than -- I don't think any game this season we had that.  
  
So it's a lot of things to look back on, think about this season that I have
to take, and I have another year. So it's a blessing that I get to have this
experience and be able to take all this and get back at it and try to come
back next year and be better.  
  
I really wish we could have did something special. We had a really, really
special group. We obviously underachieved so much, but we are a very, very
special group.  
  
ZACH COPELAND: For me, just the way we started off the season, I'll look back
and really reminisce on how good we were playing. We kind of fell off in the
middle of the season just with inconsistency from players, and obviously, that
hurt us, but it happens. I don't blame those guys or discourage those guys.
I've seen them go to work every day, work hard every day. So I'm going to take
the good moments and just keep them close to me.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at the totality of the whole season, is there one
thing that you kind of take away that you can kind of take toward next season,
something that you maybe learned that you would maybe do differently or just
something you would take into next year?  
DAN MULLER: There's a lot of things. You've got to look back and reflect and
self-evaluate. Absolutely, there are things I would have done differently.
It's tough to know exactly what those are right now as we're in the middle of
it. It's my responsibility to put a team out there that represents this
university the right way, and to no fault of the players, we didn't do that.
So that falls on me.  
  
This program means a lot to me, a lot, and it's just really disappointing to
have those fans out there because we've got great fans. It's hard for me. I
love these kids. We've got a great group of guys, high character. We didn't
play the way we wanted to, but a lot to learn from for next year without a
doubt.  
  
But I'm proud of this group because of the guys that they are. It doesn't make
it better. It doesn't excuse the season we had. But I love this group of guys.
I'm going to miss coaching them, like really. I'm really going to miss
coaching them, even though we didn't have a great year, because they're good
dudes. They're just going to be successful in life, and I'm happy about that.
But it is tough, obviously.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our final session, 3:15 to 3:30, featured the Loyola Ramblers.
They're the No. 2 seed. They'll play the winner of Valparaiso and Evansville.
That game will be at 6:00 on Friday. The student body is represented by
Cameron Krutwig, Aher Uguak, Lucas Williamson, Tate Hall and Keith Clemons.
The head coach is Porter Moser. Porter, please.  
  
PORTER MOSER: Obviously, everyone here is excited, just like all the other
coaches have probably said. Just excited to get going. The valley does such a
great job with this tournament that it makes you want to tip it up and get
going. We're here. I'm proud of these guys. We're excited to get going.  
  
Q. Hey, Porter, how are you? So I wanted to ask about the sickness. I
know last week, Bruno was out because of being sick -- not out, but not
playing, and then Cameron got hit by it. I just wanted to see if everyone is
healthy and feeling better.  
PORTER MOSER: Everyone feels great. Bruno feels better. Cam feels better.
Thankfully, no bugs. We're all good.  
  
Q. I 'll ask from the Valpo perspective, since they could be a potential
opponent. I know they're not locked in. But I think the first couple years --
last year, you beat them pretty good. This year, it's been a couple of five-
point games. What has that team shown you in their kind of maturation coming
into the valley, kind of like what you guys have done?  
PORTER MOSER: They've got a lot of good pieces. Obviously, Javon scoring the
way he does, he affects in passing defensively, but they've got some other --
the way they shoot the ball, they're really dangerous. What did they hit, 17,
18 threes against Bradley with Fazekas? McMillan shooting from that 5 spot.
Kiser has hit a couple of threes against us. I think they're shooting it, and
they've got some guys that can go downhill. Freeman is so athletic. Sackey is
so athletic. I think they've got a nice blend of guys that can shoot it.  
  
They've always defended hard. It's just crazy to think they're on the play-in
game. I heard Matt on his -- 9-9 you wouldn't think you would have to play on
Thursday night. It just shows you the depth of our league, and it shows you
that anybody can beat anybody, but anybody can lose to anybody.  
  
Q. To the players, how are you guys feeling going into tomorrow? Some of
you, this is your first Arch. Some of you, it 's not. Just from that
perspective, how are you feeling?  
THE MODERATOR: Lucas, Tate, and Keith in that order.  
  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: We're always excited. Arch Madness is always fun to play in.
Just getting ready to go and can't wait until tip-off tomorrow.  
  
TATE HALL: Obviously, I'm really excited. I was here last year and sat on the
bench and took it all in. Saw how it was, saw how Arch Madness was. I'm
excited and ready to get going.  
  
KEITH CLEMONS: Same. First year here, obviously excited, but treating it like
any other game, same mindset, going to get the win.  
  
Q. Lucas, can you give me a good Javon Freeman-Liberty story from high
school, something that maybe encapsulates his toughness or his drive?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: Wow. One thing I do remember -- weirdly. I don't know why I
remember this. I just remember in the state championship game, I just remember
the chaos that happened going into overtime with that last play. I just
remember he had the confidence to take that last shot. Although it didn't go
in, we just found a way to win in that overtime game. That's just one of the
many things that happened on the court, off the court, but me and Javon are
still cool.  
  
Q. Cameron, Lucas and Tate, you guys were all named to some All Valley
teams. How does that help you going into this weekend?  
THE MODERATOR: Cameron, lead us off, please.  
  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: First and foremost, it's a team award. It comes with team
success. I know Keith's won Sixth Man of the Year. I was First Team. Tate was
the Newcomer. It all comes with team success. You couldn't have done it
without all the other guys that weren't mentioned. We came in second. So we
were pretty well represented on the teams, like you said. Just kind of echoing
what those guys said, I think we're really excited to kind of be here and to
play.  
  
We've had a good week of practice, and we've been tightening up the screws.
We've been kind of prepping for both teams, not really locking in on one
specific team until obviously the game tonight. I think we're really ready to
go and super excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Lucas and then Tate.  
  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: It's a good feeling, but at the end of the day, we have to
go out there and play basketball and play our best basketball and beat teams.
It's a good feeling, but we're more focused on winning games this weekend.  
  
TATE HALL: Going off of what Lucas just said, it's a good honor, obviously.
That's why you work in the summer, you workout to be the best player you can
be, but at the end of the day, it's a team game, and we're locked in on one
thing, and that's winning one game at a time.  
  
Q. Aher, about a week ago now, but you had your first career double
double against Bradley. How did that feel, and how do you kind of build off of
that going into Arch Madness this weekend?  
AHER UGUAK: I think mainly it's just doing whatever I can to help the team.
Bradley had, I think, a 20-0 run, and we were kind of down, and I was in foul
trouble. So as soon as I got in, I told myself do whatever you can to help the
team win. I think I should do that every game to help my team out.  
  
Q. This is to Porter and Cameron because you guys were at the luncheon
earlier. I wanted to ask, Marquise Kennedy had the biggest smile on his face,
and I want to hear from your guys ' perspective what it was like to see him go
to his first kind of thing and get that award.  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Yeah, we're super excited for Marquise, not just me and Coach
but all the guys. We had kind of a team meeting, and Coach announced that he
won it. We were all silent, and Coach was like, Quise, you won Sixth Man of
the Year. I don't think he was expecting to win that. We were all super
excited for him and happy. It was a good moment kind of in the locker room.
It's just a testament to his hard work and really accepting his role.  
  
As a freshman, you just want to come in and contribute literally any way you
can, whether it's playing 10 minutes, 15 minutes, stuff like that. So he's
accepted his role on the bench, and he's done it really well.  
  
PORTER MOSER: It might surprise people outside looking in, but not us.
Marquise smiles all the time. He's got a big smile, and I think he was -- I
mean, it was a nice banquet. He was dressed up in his nice black suit, and he
was just enjoying himself. He smiles a lot with us. I know he gets very stoic
on the court and business-like, but for him to have that big smile, I don't
think the smile was for him receiving an award. He was just excited about the
atmosphere of being there and all that. That's just the way he is. He's a fun-
loving young man.  
  
Q. I 'll stick with those same two, Coach and Krutwig. I just looked at
the starting lineup that's up here is 16 and 6 this year. It's been a good
change since Keith joined the lineup. How has that developed, and how can you
ride that wave into this weekend?  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Yeah, I think through the whole year we've been building
chemistry with each other. That started in the summer when all of us got to
campus and started doing workouts and stuff like that. We've been building
chemistry, and it's just kind of developed through the year. You always want
to be playing your best basketball towards the end of the year, and that's
just developing chemistry, knowing what guys are going to do, and just playing
together as a team.  
  
PORTER MOSER: I think it was more -- we probably never even knew that stat up
here. It's something that we don't think about with the starters. What it was
is Keith got healthy. It gave us another contributor. It took a little
pressure off Marquise. Marquise got thrown into playing the point guard right
out of day one, having to replace two 22-year-old Larry Bird trophy winners in
the backcourt.  
  
So it more speaks to we got Keith healthy, in the mix. We don't look at it as
starters. These guys never do. We're looking at all hands on deck. We need --
to win this tournament, you need strength in numbers. You're going to need a
lot of guys contributing. It's going to be no starting five wins this thing.
You're going to need guys off the bench. When that starting lineup happened is
when Keith got healthy from his surgery and just gave us another primary ball
handler. We just have a ton of confidence in Keith at the point, and it just
keeps going from there.  
  
Q. This could be something or it could be nothing for Porter and Lucas.
I notice you 're wearing the 2017/18 warmup jackets right now. Is that a
conscious choice to channel some of that energy, or is it just clean laundry
day and what was on top of the hamper?  
LUCAS WILLIAMSON: This is one of my favorite hoodies, not just because it's
Sweet 16 and Final Four, but also it's just a nice looking hoodie.  
  
PORTER MOSER: I think I look great in it. Just kidding. It's my favorite
hoodie. I'm the same with him. But the patches are nice, but we don't -- we
are -- you got to have -- and I've said this before. You've got to have
amnesia because that's not going to get you where you want to go, but you've
got to remember what it took that to get you. The hoodies aren't symbolic.
It's just we like it, right?  
  
Q. Cameron, I 've got to ask. You were preseason MVC Player of the Year,
but then you didn't end up being Player of the Year. What was the reaction to
that?  
CAMERON KRUTWIG: Credit to UNI and A.J. Green. They won it outright. Congrats.
You can't really compete with that. I don't think I -- I mean, it would have
been nice, but it doesn't really matter now. Everyone is 0-0 now, and now it's
just about winning the tournament and just competing at a high level, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much and best of luck.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 58, Evansville - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: As advertised, the victorious Crusaders are with us. Donovan
Clay, Daniel Sackey, Javon Freeman-Liberty represent the student body. Head
coach is Matt Lottich.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: Listening to you talk, I guess we made history tonight. Winning
a game where we don't -- actually, just don't hit a three in the tournament. I
thought we were nervous. I think that's, in some ways, a little
understandable. Playing in, obviously, a big-time arena, the lights are
different here. I mean, it just is the way it is.  
  
Javon hadn't been practicing much, so we had to kind of get the feel for
playing with him. You know, it's hard. It's hard to play in games where in a
lot of ways you're expected to win. They're playing really with nothing to
lose. So I was proud. Our message was just as simple. Like, we didn't play
great. We're going to have to play better to win tomorrow, but we played well
enough and tough enough to get a win, and we'll take it. In a tournament-like
setting like this, you've just got to survive and advance, and we were able to
do that.  
  
Very pleased with the effort. Very pleased with the ability of our young men
to keep their chins up when really there was probably ample opportunity for
them to put their heads down and fold, and they didn't do that. They made
enough plays, enough shots, enough free-throws down the stretch to win a game,
and we'll take it.  
  
Q. Donovan, you 've been in this position before at Illinois State. You
blocked a shot late in the game. I know you don't want to fall in that
situation, but what did you see?  
DONOVAN CLAY: I see an opportunity because he kind of fell and stepped up, and
I was like, I should block it just in case. You never know if it goes in or
not. So I saw an opportunity, and I took it.  
  
Q. Javon, some people said that on the TV broadcast they could hear an
extended scream from you when you hit the ground. Kind of take us through what
happened there.  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: I think I tripped, and I hit the floor pretty hard. I'm
good, though.  
  
Q. Did you hurt your leg?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: Knee.  
  
Q. Coach, what 's the next 20 hours look like for you and your staff?
Kind of what do you do to kind of regroup to get ready for tomorrow night?  
MATT LOTTICH: You know, when you're preparing for a tournament like this, you
do a lot of work on teams that you might play. So we've done a lot of scouting
work on Loyola already. So for the guys, it's going to get food in them, get
water in them, get them off their legs. For us, as coaches, it's we're going
to meet and put together our scout, put together our game plan, and share it
with the guys in the morning and tip it up and play.  
  
Q. Daniel, you could have gone sideways a couple weeks ago, kind of
taken out of the starting lineup, but you stuck with the process a little bit,
and you played a great game today. Just take me through your mindset here in
the last couple of weeks. Coach, if you could follow up on what you 've seen
from Daniel and how he's responded to that as well.  
DANIEL SACKEY: My mindset has just been I've got to help the team any way. It
would be very selfish of me to not perform and be like, man, forget this. We
have a saying called 'we above me' always. That's always been my mentality.
Whenever I'm starting, coming off the bench, whatever it is, I'm just going to
play my hardest to help the team and try to get a win. I can't win by myself.
I need my teammates. I need my coaches. I need everybody, and they need me to
be my best all the time no matter what the situation is.  
  
MATT LOTTICH: I'll follow up a little bit with that. It's not easy. Obviously,
I'm sure Daniel would prefer to start, but it's what we're asking him to do
for our team right now. When I was going to make that change and I brought him
into my office and talked to him, he said, Coach, it's not a problem. In
moments like that where there can be some adversity, if you put your head down
and get in a woe is me attitude, it would be impossible for you to perform,
and that's been the opposite of what Daniel's done.  
  
We don't win this game tonight without Daniel Sackey. Absolutely, 100 percent
do not win this game. His integrity, his fight, his heart, that's really the
backbone of a lot of what we're trying to build and do. He is a key component,
whether he's coming off the bench or starting for us. He's a big, big member
of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about Donovan 's 16.7 rebounds tonight, and just
talk about how he's grown throughout the season and what he's meant to this
team as a freshman.  
MATT LOTTICH: Donovan, we had him in, there's no denying his talent. You could
see his talent. What Donovan's done a great job of is just learn to play,
learn to pick his spots within what we're trying to do. Tonight is, again, he
was fantastic. Hit big shots, big layups. Then he's a lockdown defensive
player too.  
  
Donovan's going to get -- he's gotten a lot better this year. He's going to
get a lot better this off-season. There's big things to come from him, but,
again, without Donovan tonight, we don't win this game. He was huge. He really
was scoring at a high rate, especially during the first half. Had a couple in
the second half roll out, but I'm sure he'll make those tomorrow.  
  
Q. Javon, obviously, you missed the last two games. What was the energy
like for you? How did you feel as you progressed through the game?  
JAVON FREEMAN-LIBERTY: My mentality was just don't think about, like, how
tired I am. Just keep fighting. That's what I just basically did the whole
game, just kept fighting.  
  
Q. Matt, with some of the patterns, lineup patterns you had Mileek and
Ryan on the bench a lot. Did the game unfold kind of like you thought it would
with those guys not being in down the stretch?  
MATT LOTTICH: I just thought we were getting more stops, and I thought the
group that was out there was playing the way that we wanted to. That's the
best thing about having depth, right? Certain times, there's going to be guys
that play more minutes than others, and you know, tonight I thought Ben did a
great job. I thought he switched on the guards, kept guys in front of him,
made shots hard, and was effective scoring. I just thought -- I think we had
Daniel in there really for those minutes. They were small and quick, and I
thought the matchup defensively was better.  
  
Q. Donovan, your first Arch Madness game. Obviously, we talked earlier
this week about playing in front of your friends and family here, but talk
about the bright lights a little bit and what your mentality was going into a
game like this where the stage was a little bit bigger.  
DONOVAN CLAY: I've definitely been on the stage before at Arkansas, and I kind
of froze up because it was different. It was a big crowd. But I mean, I came
in here with the mindset to just play hard. Coach told me to go out there and
play hard, and that's what I did. I'm from this area, so I have a lot of
family here, so I felt comfortable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow. Crusaders
at Ramblers at 6:00.

### [Todd Lickliter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16034)

### [Noah Frederking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38893)

### [Evan Kuhlman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38894)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Valparaiso - 58, Evansville - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Evansville Aces are here. Evan Kuhlman and Noah Frederking
represent the student body. Head Coach Todd Lickliter is in the middle. Todd,
please.  
  
TODD LICKLITER: Okay. Hard fought game. I think it's really an example of what
these guys have shown since I've been with them. They just keep fighting.
Somebody asked me about did this, what we've been through, build character? I
said, no, it revealed character. These guys have shown character.  
  
If you came to our practice, you'd never know what the record was or what had
just happened. They're a pleasure to coach, and I'm extremely proud of them.
It's hard to do what they've been doing. This was a very good basketball game.
It's so hard fought. Neither team got good looks. Both teams defended it hard.
It's our third one, and the other two, I think, were two-point games or three-
point games.  
  
So I think it just shows the teams are pretty even. They were able to come up
with -- I think there was a series when they rebounded it on their end, a few
possessions, got the extra plays, and that's hard. I mean, it wasn't anything
necessarily we didn't do or whatever. They came up with them. So hat goes off
to them. They played well enough to win. They played a nice -- you know, Valpo
did a nice job, and I guess it was anybody's game all the way down. What more
could you ask for other than I wish we'd have been the ones to come out on
top.  
  
These guys have got nothing to hang their heads about today. They competed
hard the whole time.  
  
Q. Todd, did you kind of give a play there on that last possession? What
was kind of the thought with that?  
TODD LICKLITER: If I'd have had a time-out -- we had used all ours -- we could
see that they weren't going to pick up full. We thought they'd pick up full
court, and we've got one that we put in where we could get Shamar streaking
down the side and then spot Noah up in the corner. Evan knew, and so he stayed
back, he saw it. I wanted him to throw it straight up to Evan and see if he
could either shoot it or throw it -- make one more pass.  
  
Four seconds, you can get four dribbles in. If I'd have known how they were
going to align, we would have thrown to half-court or beyond, but we didn't
know. So it was just one of those things. I wish I had it over. I feel bad. I
wish I'd have helped them more.  
  
Q. Noah, I know you 're kind of from this area, but just how are you
feeling tonight? You came out and scored five early points, then you were kind
of key in that second half run too. What was your mindset tonight?  
NOAH FREDERKING: Just try to get a win. For a lone senior, I want to get out
there and play one more game, play the right way. Really just keep playing
hard like we've been doing all season.  
  
Q. Evan, like Coach said, your guys ' character was revealed throughout
this stretch. What are you going to remember about this? What are you going to
take away from this season?  
EVAN KUHLMAN: I'm just really appreciative for everything that came to us.
Coach coming to us midseason, giving us his all. KJ giving us his all. As a
team, we're really, really going to miss him. I don't think anybody quite
grasps exactly what he gives our team on and off the floor. He's a perfect
leader for us. I'm going to miss KJ. I'm going to miss the team. But I think
we've got good things moving forward with Coach Lickliter, and just really
appreciative for everything that came our way.  
  
I thought we fought hard today. A couple of balls didn't bounce our way, but
just hats off to KJ. He could have pouted all season. We didn't win a
conference game. But that's not who he is. I just look up to KJ.  
  
Q. Coach, similarly for you, how do you build on this? You 've been here
six weeks or so now. How do you take the next step and turn things around
now?  
TODD LICKLITER: I'd like to echo what Evan says. I probably can't say it quite
as well, but KJ is special. He's a guy who leads by example. He's very
dependable. I thanked him earlier. We're trying to lay a foundation. It's a
new system. They're picking things up. We've got a very small percentage in,
but what we did get in, they grasped. They had -- not just willing, but eager
to do what you're supposed to. KJ is a big part of that. He allowed me to
coach. It's his senior year, and we struggled, but he was always at practice,
prepared, paid attention. I just can't say enough.  
  
But he wasn't alone. He had really good teammates. He'd tell you these guys
are really good teammates too. And I really believe this, that you look at the
final scores, and you'll think that this was a -- it was a tough year, but
there is a foundation laid, and they did it, and they did it during adverse
times. If you saw -- if you look at our stats and the improvement they've made
over the course of the last 13 or 14 games, whatever it is, it's really
impressive. They probably picked up things faster than any team I've had.  
  
So I can't wait to get back to work with these guys, but with that said, I
wish we had KJ again.  
  
Q. Coach, what do the next 48 to 72 hours or through the weekend look
like for your team?  
TODD LICKLITER: I imagine that we'll head back to campus, and they'll probably
go home. They've got spring break coming up and relax. We'll give them some
time off when they get back, and then we'll meet and go back to work. And I
say go back to work, I mean, we get to go to work in a gym. Pretty nice.
Pretty nice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck in the future.

### [Tyreke Key](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36600)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: 3:00 to 3:15 features the No. 3 seed Indiana State Sycamores.
They'll play the team that just left here, No. 6 Missouri State. The game is
8:30 Friday night. Jordan Barnes, Christian Williams, Tyreke Key represent the
student-athletes. Greg Lansing is the head coach in the middle.  
  
GREG LANSING: Just excited to be here. Been part of a lot of conference
tournaments. There's nothing better than Arch Madness. It takes a backseat to
no conference tournament, and I know this one, maybe in particular, compared
to all the other ones I've been in, I think everyone going into it is thinking
they've got a chance, and they do have a chance. It's going to be some great
games for the fans. I know our fans are excited. I know these guys are
excited.  
  
I really like our group of guys. I mean, I've never enjoyed a team as much as
I have this group, and large in part to the guys that are up here. I'll throw
Bronson in there, too, as the third senior. But being able to go through
J.B.'s four years and being able to bring him back here with the outstanding
year that he had. Christian here, again, being rewarded All-Defensive Team
after fighting injuries, and Tyreke just continues to show that he's one of
the best players in the league as well.  
  
So we're excited. A lot of credit goes to these guys up here for leading us,
and just keep staying with our young guys and continue to get them developed
because I think we have improved throughout the year. It's a good time to do
it going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Greg, it 's really the first period of time you get any rest. How did
you handle that aspect of this week, especially playing the late game tomorrow
night? What was your approach with the team in terms of getting them some
legs?  
GREG LANSING: We had to take two days off just because of the compliance and
stuff and how we had practiced leading up to it. So Sunday -- these guys got
Sunday and Monday off. The coaching staff all went recruiting, but then got
right back in, and we didn't do -- probably right at an hour on the floor on
Wednesday. That was all about us, nothing other than talking about Missouri
State in the last two days, is going to be Missouri State prep.  
  
Again, not a lot of time on the floor. I think that's one thing this group has
been mature about. We've been able to not practice long and heavy and pounding
on each other because these guys are focused. Christian's had hip injuries.
You've got Bronson and Jake and J.B. and Tyreke both log a lot of minutes and
beat up. So we really have been erring on the side of fresh legs and then
being locked in and getting the work done when we go in there.  
  
Q. Tyreke, Christian, J.B., you guys can all weigh in on this. One of
the things I don 't think we talked about too much this year is how good this
team has been with taking care of the ball. You guys have good turnover
numbers. What's been the key in that this year in terms of being reliable and
not turning the ball over?  
THE MODERATOR: Tyreke, we'll start with you and come this way; Christian and
Jordan next.  
  
TYREKE KEY: It just comes down to executing. It's what we do every day in
practice, practice not turning the ball over for one. At this point in the
season, you can't make mistakes like that. We know that, and it comes down to
executing. That's really about it.  
  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: Just like he said, we've been executing really well, but
we have a really good court with our guards, and we're really well
experienced. So I think that's the biggest reason to why we take care of the
ball.  
  
JORDAN BARNES: I agree with what both of those guys said. We have too many
good guards that can take care of the ball, and with that being said, we
shouldn't be turning the ball over as much. I feel like that plays a part into
it too.  
  
Q. For Tyreke and Christian, I 'm going to make it awkward now. I want
to get your thoughts on Jordan and what he means to your team. Try to put that
into words.  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: He's big for us. His first couple years, he kind of had to
score the ball a little bit more. Just from watching him from the year that I
sat out, he's really made a big jump to really taking ownership of the team
and really leading the team and making sure the team's doing everything they
can. He's really done a good job of making sure everybody's in the right spot
at the right time, and I think that's just really helped us out along the way.  
  
TYREKE KEY: Like C. Will said, he's our leader. He makes us go. Whatever he
says, we'll do. He's our leader, a great guy, great communicator, and he's
just a great leader.  
  
Q. Coach, ever since you guys beat Missouri State, the past month, they
've just been kind of playing a little better. Is it as easy as they're just
playing hard or what are you seeing on film?  
GREG LANSING: It's about all Dana said, just play hard. I think you get that
way as a coach. You hope you don't have to coach effort. I think they started
getting ripe a little bit in the second half. When we were down there, we had
the lead at half. They came back and took a lead, but then we won the game.
But they've been pretty darn good since then.  
  
There's a reason they were picked to win the league, talented across the
board. These guys, I think like us, they're defending better. As towards this
last month, I think that's one thing both teams have done. And they're killers
on the offensive boards. I think they've averaged 14-plus over the last six
games. So just an awfully talented team, awfully talented group.  
  
Q. With Ross Owens, just he 's a walk-on player, but just kind of what
are you noticing from him that the rest of the team might be feeding off of?  
GREG LANSING: Wondering why he didn't get a scholarship earlier, that's what I
was wondering. I've got a strong affinity for walk-ons because throughout my
coaching career, there have been some special guys that have played important
roles and even tournament championship teams.  
  
But he plays at both ends. You have to guard him. He can shoot the three. He's
a good-sized, basically a guard, a stronger guard. He guarded all three of
these guys at different times, and they can switch with him. But he's a tough
competitor and really brings something to that team, I know, with how hard he
played.  
  
Q. Jordan, wanted to ask you about your hunger -- not for toasted
ravioli, but hunger to win the tournament. You 're back home senior year. Can
you just put it in your own words?  
JORDAN BARNES: I would just say everybody has the hunger to come out and win
this tournament, especially in St. Louis when it's one and done. For me, it's
being back in St. Louis with these guys, especially the younger guys we have,
bringing them along with me and just showing them how hard it is to actually
win this tournament and the feeling that you get after winning it.  
  
Q. Greg, I wanted to give you a chance to expound on the turnover thing
I was talking to the players about, and I wanted to expound on that a little
bit. Tre and Jake, their handles and their ability to handle the ball as well,
what influence has that had on the turnover numbers that you guys have had?  
GREG LANSING: The whole reason is, I think like Christian said, is these guys
up here. They've got the ball in their hands a lot, and we take care of it.
One thing these guys do is they work on their craft a lot. So they're logging
a lot of time in the gym where they work on their ball handling and whatnot,
but it's something these guys take personal. I would venture to guess that
might be the first stat a couple of these guys look at is how many turnovers
did I have after the game? You give them all the credit for taking. They know
the importance of valuing the possession and of the skill that they have with
it.  
  
So it's been a big part of our team. Our turnovers have really come from the
interior guys the majority of the time. They'll get a couple. We'll get
charges, offensive fouls or those things. But Jake and Tre's skill level is
good. They can both handling the ball. They can both pass the ball. That's
only going to get better.  
  
Q. Speaking of which, how is Jake doing? He had back spasms in the last
game. What 's his condition?  
GREG LANSING: Better today. He's logging a lot of time with Connor and doing
absolutely everything he can to be as ready as he can. It's been bothering him
for a couple weeks, and he's gutted it out. He's a tough dude. He'll give us
everything he's got. Whatever that is, we don't know right now.  
  
Q. For the players, you guys can weigh in on this. Both matchups
occurred at times during the season where both teams were in different states
of mind, so to speak. You guys caught them at a good time. They came to Terre
Haute and caught you guys before you started playing better. How much can you
derive from both of those matchups that apply to tomorrow night? Is there much
that matters? What translates?  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, you're first this time followed by Christian and
Tyreke.  
  
JORDAN BARNES: I would say, like you said, they caught us at a good time, we
caught them at a good time. With that being said, it's just one game. We've
got to play them again. I feel like it will be a better matchup with both of
us playing as well as we can.  
  
CHRISTIAN WILLIAMS: I think with the first two games that we played, there's
takeaways from both of those games because the games were kind of different.
Just looking at how both of these teams won. So I think just going back and
looking at the film and seeing how both games were won by each team and just
making those corrections will be big. And going into this game, we know how
talented and everything that they are. So just pay attention to the details
and try to get everything correct.  
  
TYREKE KEY: Like he said, we've both seen each other, so it's really going to
come down to who executes the most and who comes the most prepared.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you about Jordan as well. Can you describe,
especially for the St. Louis fans coming to the games that might not have
gotten to see you play Jordan, can you describe his role on the offense?  
GREG LANSING: Since he's gotten on campus, he's been important to everything
we're doing. This year in particular, he's taken it upon himself wanting to be
the best point guard in the league, and I think he is. He's playing both ends.
With his stature earlier in his career, some people might be able to take
advantage of that because of his size, but he takes that personally. He's a
tremendous competitor, has always worked at his game and taken his leadership
to another level this year.  
  
Q. The clock is ticking. I 'll just ask Tyreke this because I think I
asked these guys this over the weekend. You guys beat every team in the league
this year. What does that do, what does that matter for this tournament
overall in terms of the confidence you guys have to win it?  
TYREKE KEY: Man, just we know we can beat everybody. So that's the mindset
we're going to go into. We've seen everybody, and we've seen how we played
every game. We're very capable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time and best of luck.

# [STATE FARM MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=STATE+FARM+MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

### [Isaiah Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34712)

### [Spencer Haldeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38864)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The regular season champions, Northern Iowa Panthers, are with
us. They're the Number 1 seed. They'll play the winner of Drake and Illinois
State. That game will be at noon on Friday. From my left to right, the Larry
Bird Player of the Year, A.J. Green, the MVC Coach of the Year, Ben Jacobson,
and then there's Isaiah Brown and Spencer Haldeman.  
  
BEN JACOBSON: I would add Zay being Defensive Player of the Year, and Spence
didn't get one of those, but he's been an unbelievable guy and a program guy
for us. As a senior this year, just been tremendous. The guys were -- I
touched on it a couple different times. The guys were great. They've been
great all year, but great when it mattered most last week and got it done at
home twice and at Drake. To get that outright championship, that takes a lot
to get through the 18 games and be the last one standing.  
  
We play in just a terrific league. It's hard every night. Just proud of these
guys for getting that done. The thing that I've enjoyed most is no matter
what's happened -- nonconference, at Grand Canyon, at Colorado, and then
coming back home -- with what we've done here over the course of the 18 games,
these guys just want more. It's been great the last couple of days just being
around them. They've celebrated what's happened, but they just want more. It's
been really awesome to be around these guys.  
  
Q. Spencer, when you hear Coach was named Coach of the Year, as a
player, what does that kind of say to you guys?  
SPENCER HALDEMAN: I don't think a lot of us are surprised as players. What he
does for us on the daily is incredible and something that not many players get
to experience. So I mean, I think he deserves it, and a lot of people don't
see what he does on the daily besides us. Like I said, we weren't too
surprised.  
  
Q. For Isaiah, you guys obviously don 't know who your opponent is going
to be. How weird is that, kind of, when you go through a week? Obviously, you
always know who you're preparing for, and for this week not to know who you're
preparing for.  
ISAIAH BROWN: Yeah, obviously, during practice we scout the team we're going
to play and watch film on them. Like you said, we don't know who we're going
to play. During practice, we practiced a little bit of both here and there. We
obviously just played Drake, so we're kind of more familiar with their stuff.
If Illinois State were to win, we'd have to watch their game and get more
familiar with them once again. I think whoever we're going to play, we're
going to be ready to play, and we're going to come out ready.  
  
Q. This is for the guys and Coach Jake to jump in too. In this three-
game winning streak you had to put together to win the outright title, what
were some of the things that you guys picked up and did better after coming
off those two road losses? You knew you had to win three in a row to win it.
What were the areas that you guys felt you had to play better and you did?  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with A.J., go to Spencer, and finish with
the Coach.  
  
A.J. GREEN: I'd say, defensively we were a lot better in terms of our
communication and everybody being on the same page. Then I think just kind of
our mindset knowing we had two home games after those two losses and we needed
to pick up both of those. Then securing the outright championship that last
game, I think everybody just kind of moved past it and continued to want more,
like Coach mentioned.  
  
SPENCER HALDEMAN: Yeah, I mean, after those two losses, I mean, we kind of had
to refocus up a little bit, kind of look forward instead of at those past two
games. I think it showed a lot of toughness from us to keep pushing forward
because, I mean, after those two losses, we could have sat down and kind of --
we kind of knew that it was still in our hands on how we were going to finish
in the MVC, and we did well those last three games, and we're outright champs.  
  
BEN JACOBSON: Yeah, I guess a couple things that come to mind. We really
fought hard, and one of the things that I let it get away just a little bit.
We spent a lot of time -- and most teams do -- spent a lot of time on the
scouting report, a lot of time watching film of the opponent, a lot of time
going through their stuff, a lot of time practicing live against their stuff,
and I let that get away. When I went back and watched our first Southern
Illinois game and watched the two games we had played on the road, it hit me
that I let that get away from us, and we weren't fighting hard enough, and
that's on me.  
  
We've got such a tremendous group of guys. They're going to do what we ask
them to do as their coaches. They're going to do it the best that they can,
whether it's in practice, in film, or in the game. They're going to do almost
to the letter, what they're asked to do, and it's a great compliment to these
guys. So that's on me that it had gotten away. We talked about fighting
harder, moving the scouting report from what it kind of got in the wrong place
at the top of the pecking order, moving that down to second or third on our
list, and just fighting harder.  
  
So we spent time talking about that, spent time doing that, and these guys, it
didn't take them -- it didn't take them any time to get it cranked up. Then I
-- and the other thing that they did, you're down ten with 15 minutes to go on
your home court after losing at Indiana State and Loyola, at that point,
you're either going to respond and take care of your home court and get
yourselves in a spot for the next one, or you're not. That can be a tough
setting to be in, when you've had such -- you've had the year that we've had.
These guys, man, they just cranked it up for that 15 minutes. I mean,
absolutely cranked it up. When they knew what was going on and what it felt
like, and that's a tremendous response by guys to be able to do that in that
game.  
  
Our offense was great against Evansville, all 40 minutes, and we had a
complete game at Drake. But it's the response, and it's the fight that the
guys really showed.  
  
Q. Being named Coach of the Year with this group, what does it mean to
you personally?  
BEN JACOBSON: It really -- just really proud of these guys. I think about
Wyatt and Miles from last year, seniors last year, and just how that November
and December last year was -- you know, in terms of the number of times we got
beat, and then more than that, the way that we got beat in some of those
games, that hasn't happened to these guys at our place or in high school. That
just hasn't happened. And Miles and Wyatt just really -- they kept bringing
it. They kept bringing it. And A.J. and Trae, as the year went on, they got
comfortable in their first year.  
  
These guys that are now seniors, that dynamic last year is something that I
think about, even though we're talking about this year. Miles and Wyatt have a
lot to do with what's going on right now. The fact that these guys really paid
attention to the work ethic of those two guys. They weren't going to let down.
They weren't going to give in, no matter what our record was, and it got us to
a great finish, and it got us to a championship game because of the way those
two guys approached it.  
  
Then to see -- last week was -- when I refer to last week, the three games in
the week, that week was one of the proudest weeks of my 14 years as a head
coach and my 19 years at Northern Iowa. The fight and the response and how
much these guys care about each other, it all showed up. It all showed up.
They wanted that outright title, and they went and got it. Nobody gave it to
us. Loyola beat Bradley at Bradley, which is going to be a really hard game.
That result comes out two hours before we play, and these guys just went and
got it. I'm just proud of these guys.  
  
Q. For the guys, being the 1 seed, do you feel like you 've got a target
on your back this weekend? And all three of you guys played an instrumental
role in getting UNI to the championship game last year. How much did that
experience, or how much of that experience do you think helps you coming back
this year as the 1 seed?  
THE MODERATOR: Isaiah, start us off, then Spencer, then finish with A.J.  
  
ISAIAH BROWN: I'd say we've almost had a target on our back the whole season.
We started off having a great tournament in Cancun, and then after that, we
started receiving votes and stuff like that. So I think that attention from
the NCAA just put a target on our back, especially starting conference, and
Illinois State got us that first win. So we knew everybody was going to give
us their best. Coach preached that we've got to be ready every time we play
because we have a target on our back, and everyone is going to play their best
against us.  
  
SPENCER HALDEMAN: Kind of what Zay said. We kind of knew coming in after
nonconference play that we had a target on our back. We started receiving
votes. I mean, any time you see a team receiving votes, you want to give them
your best shot. So, yeah, I mean, it was our job just to come ready every
night. We knew we were going to get their best shot. When we lost those two
games, it kind of opened our eyes, too, a little bit for the last three games,
and I think it helped us in the long run.  
  
A.J. GREEN: To build on that, I'd say just the experience we had last year in
this tournament, winning two games and then having a great shot to win that
last one. I think that just motivates us even more this year. Even if we are
the Number 1 seed and teams are coming for us, we -- in the back of our mind,
everybody on this team still remembers that game. I think we're going to do
everything we can to get past that point this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much and best of luck.

### [Dana Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36583)

### [Gaige Prim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38857)

### [Ross Owens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38858)

  
_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The 2:45 to 3:00 session features the No. 6 seeded Missouri
State Bears. They will play No. 3 Indiana State, 8:30 Friday night. Ross Owens
and Gaige Prim represent the student body for the Bears. Coach Dana Ford is in
the middle.  
  
DANA FORD: Thanks. Excited to be here. Looking forward to the first game
against Indiana State. Just happy that our players are feeling good about this
experience and happy to start a new season.  
  
Q. Coach, my condolences on what I 'm sure has been a tough week for you
guys. I was just wondering if you could say anything on the passing of A.J.  
DANA FORD: It's been a tough week. Out of respect for his family, I'm just
going to say that they're in our thoughts and prayers. That's how we're going
to leave it.  
  
Q. What have you kind of seen in a change in Indiana State in recent
weeks? You guys were the last team to beat them.  
DANA FORD: Obviously, they're shooting the ball well. They've got a veteran
backcourt, well coached. Their two interior guys can both score the ball,
although they're young, and defensively, they've gotten a lot better. Just
playing well, just playing really well as a team.  
  
Q. Dana, both matchups during the regular season were so different, and
the state of the teams were different when they were playing at the time. Is
there much that can be derived from both your win and Indiana State 's win
down in Springfield that apply to the way the teams are right this minute?  
DANA FORD: I think a little bit. I think the first time we played them, we
were still trying to find our way a little bit. We're definitely a different
team today than what we were even the second time we played them. I would
imagine that they feel like they are too, but I would imagine there's a few
things that you can kind of take. It's a new season. The stakes are different.
It's just a totally different game.  
  
Q. For people in our area that only see you guys twice a year, what did
change for your team that made you guys a better team in the last month of the
year?  
DANA FORD: Well, it started off by just playing harder. I think what ended up
happening when we started playing harder is that we all started caring about
the same thing, so that kind of connected us a little better. I think, when
you have a group of guys that care about the same thing, you can get some
things done, and I think that's kind of what we've had happen here since that
loss against Indiana State.  
  
Q. Yeah, that loss, Ross Owens played quite a bit, played the entire
second half, if I remember correctly. What influence has inserting him into
the rotation had on your team?  
DANA FORD: Well, obviously, we -- it made us deeper because now you have guys
who are starters coming off the bench. So it automatically made us deeper. He
plays really hard, and I think that other guys kind of got the message that
that's what we're looking for. He's a great teammate, tries to make people
better, and everyone on the team likes him. So I think he's had a really good
impact on our group. Inserting him in the lineup has definitely changed who we
are as a team for the better.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you about Indiana State 's Jordan Barnes and
get your description of what kind of a player he is and basically your
admiration for his game and all that.  
DANA FORD: Really good player. He's not big in size, but you can tell his
heart's big. He's made big shots for them every year he's been there. What I
like about him is the things that I hear Coach say about him this year, how he
sacrificed his game for the betterment of the team. I want to say this is the
highest he's finished since he's been there, and he's a guy who's capable of
20 points, but if he felt like this year would be better to distribute and
it's gotten him as close to a regular season title, I think, since he's been
here.  
  
I just have a lot of admiration for that, for being able to sacrifice what's
better for the group.  
  
Q. Ross, just these last few weeks, you getting put into the starting
lineup and everything, kind of how crazy has that been for you? I don 't know
if it's something you kind of expected from the beginning or just what has
this kind of been like for you?  
ROSS OWENS: I'd say it's nothing like I expected, first off. It's been good
for the team. We're playing better. We're winning. Everybody on the team is,
what Coach said, working for the same goal, and that's winning. So it's been
good.  
  
Q. Coach kind of calls you contagious sometimes, just kind of with that
energy. Do you kind of feel them feeding off of that a little bit?  
ROSS OWENS: Yeah, I mean, it's gotten other guys who weren't playing as hard,
and everybody's playing hard now. It is contagious. Guys that weren't diving
on the floor at the beginning of the year are diving on the floor now, and
that's winning basketball.  
  
Q. And, Gaige, for you on Ross, just how have you kind of felt that
impact throughout the season?  
GAIGE PRIM: It's been a big impact for sure. You've got a guy like Ross, and
you get to see him play and whatnot. He just sacrifices for the guy next to
him. He's gonna be a help. Every other player on the team sees that and says I
want to be just like that, and it kind of feeds off everybody else.  
  
Q. Dana, one of the Indiana State 's strengths is they don't turn the
ball over very much. How do you get that team and those guards and even their
bigs, who can distribute the ball pretty well, how do you get them to make
mistakes? How do you get them to turn the ball over?  
DANA FORD: I just think we have to play as hard as we can. If they turn it
over, hopefully, we can convert those into points. If they don't turn it over,
hopefully, we can make them miss. I don't know if there's anything that we're
going to set out to do to make them turn it over. We're just going to try to
play as hard as we can.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of take me back to that Indiana State game, where you
just decided to start playing Ross as much as you did. Just kind of what goes
through the coach 's mind to say, hey, this is the direction we need to go in
right now?  
DANA FORD: You've got to try to help your group. We had given almost everyone
else an opportunity, and hindsight, we probably should have given Ross an
opportunity sooner, but it was just his chance to get a shot. We had gotten
that far down the bench. In terms of what we were looking for, we're just
basically looking for guys that are willing to empty their tank, and he
definitely is that type of guy. We're fortunate that he got to that point.  
  
Q. For those 20 minutes that you played him there in the second half,
was he fighting to not come out, or kind of what 's the decision to go a whole
20 there?  
DANA FORD: He was giving us the best opportunity to win. He was emptying his
tank, took a time-out, let him fill up. We had a couple medias, and I just had
more confidence that he would empty his tank than anyone else. I'm glad that
we got in that situation.  
  
Q. Gaige, just kind of how surreal is this experience so far? Is this
anything kind of like you 've played in the past?  
GAIGE PRIM: It's definitely a new experience. It being Division I and whatnot,
it's new, but I've been in this position before, so it's nothing really too
surreal for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

_St. Louis, Missouri - Arch Madness_  
  
Drake - 75, Illinois State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the victorious Bulldogs with us. They will play UNI
tomorrow at noon. Darian DeVries is the head coach. He's in the middle.
Anthony Murphy and Jonah Jackson represent the student body.  
  
DARIAN DeVRIES: I thought it was a great effort by our guys tonight. It was
great to see them playing a little loose and free. We got some threes to go
down. We've been struggling the last few games with that. It was nice to see
us get it opened up on the offensive end. I thought defensively, the second
half, their guys played a tremendous half and really took some of the things
that they like to do away.  
  
So I was really proud of our guys' effort, really from start to finish.  
  
Q. Darian, could you just talk about how you guys handled the zone
tonight? It looked like you were much more comfortable.  
DARIAN DeVRIES: Yeah, it helped we had three days before the tournament here
to really get prepped for it. I thought our guys did just a better job of
being aggressive against the zone and attacked it on the interior a little bit
better than we did the first time around. So I thought the guys, like I said,
just their overall mindset was better against the zone this time.  
  
Q. Jonah, what did you look at as the keys to getting things going from
the perimeter for your team here going into this tournament?  
JONAH JACKSON: Just going into the game, the coaches tell me to shoot the ball
when I'm open and just have fun. I got my feet set and hit a couple today.  
  
DARIAN DeVRIES: I told him they were bigger baskets here (Laughter).  
  
Q. Anthony, could you just talk about -- I think they cut your lead to
four points with about six minutes left. What was kind of going on in your
guys ' mindset, and what were you guys talking about in the huddle there?  
ANTHONY MURPHY: Coach said they're going to hit us with a run and don't panic
and stay composed. That's what we did. Jonah hit some big shots and Liam made
some free throws, Garrett and myself, also. We just didn't panic, and we just
did it.  
  
Q. How determined are you guys to have another shot at Northern Iowa
after that final game, home game, didn 't go your way and you guys probably
felt like you didn't play as well as you could have there?  
ANTHONY MURPHY: You know, they came to the Knapp Center and got the victory.
Like Coach said, they're not going to see the same team. We've just got to
come off strong and stay composed.  
  
JONAH JACKSON: Yeah. To kind of piggy-back off of what Tone was saying, we
just have to play our game and do what we do best, and hopefully the results
will be what we want to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jonah, just wondering, for those who don 't see you all the time,
what is the key for a player offensively to get open shots like you do when
defenses know largely what your offense is going to be from behind the arc?  
JONAH JACKSON: Just run offense and -- you know, I got really good teammates
who look for me at all times. They kind of hunt for me, you know, coming off
screens and just being a team player. Just knowing to come to me when I'm open
and staying patient.  
  
Q. Darian, looking back at film from Sunday 's game, what did you take
away from that, and what are some of the adjustments you feel like your team
is going to need to make tomorrow?  
DARIAN DeVRIES: You assume I watched that film. I burned that thing.  
  
They're a good team. They present a lot of problems for you. You know, they're
well coached, got good players, and so there's -- when you look at it, there's
some areas we need to clean up, that we need to do a lot better job of that I
didn't think we were sharp at this last time around. On a quick turnaround,
you can't do a ton. It really comes down to just relying on what your
principles are at both ends of the floor and knowing what you're looking for,
and then just be confident in what you're doing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, congratulations. Thank you very much.
