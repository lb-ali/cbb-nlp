THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon and welcome to the 2020 ACC basketball
tournament championship game press conference. I'm joined by head coach Sue
Semrau and No. 15, Kiah Gillespie. Coach?  
  
SUE SEMRAU: It was a great championship game, the largest lead by either team
was 6. It was great for ACC basketball. It's great for women's basketball and
I love this team. We battled. We fought and came up short. Got a lot of season
left, though.  
  
Q. For both of you, can you talk about the crowd and if it had any
impact that you know of?  
KIAH GILLESPIE: No. I mean, we're in North Carolina, where in NC state is
from, so it's expected that they bring a large crowd and they do that. We play
for each other. Not don't really see the people in the stands. Good for them,
but, yeah, we got each other.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: I think the last thing I would say is congrats to NC state.
They've had a great year. Wes has done a great job and I know we've both gone
through our ups and downs and really happy for his team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 71, Florida State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon and welcome to the 2020 ACC women's basketball
tournament championship game postgame press conference. We are joined today by
NC State head coach Wes Moore and student-athletes, Aislinn Konig and Elissa
Cunane. Coach?  
  
WES MOORE: Obviously I couldn't be prouder of this group. We have come a long
way in the last couple of years and these two have played a really, really big
role in that. Happy for Ais as a senior came in here all the way from the west
coast. As I mentioned earlier I can remember the night she committed about
10:00 at night and the I had to run to the store and get a big steak and
grilled out at about 11:00 at night because I knew it was going to be special
and definitely didn't disappointment.  
  
Elissa, for her to be here in her hometown and for this to happen is obviously
special. Obviously Elissa is the one who opens things up for people on the
perimeter and Ais was 1 for 6 at halftime and a lot of players would have
shied away in this stage in the second half. Kid's got a lot of confidence.  
  
Really happy for them. Florida State, great team, excited to see what they do
in the NCAA tournament. They got a lot of talent over there and Sue does a
great job. We're very excited to go out like this in the ACC this year and
head into the NCAAs with momentum.  
  
Q. Coach, you used the word momentum, you guys have won five in a row,
what 's peaking at the right time for the team?  
WES MOORE: A few weeks ago they thought we had peaked in January or something.
Again, I feel like right now we got a good mojo about the team. We've got a
lot of people that are playing and contributing, and I think that helps to
keep everybody engage and had winning doesn't hurt. We saw the ball go through
the net a little bit against Syracuse and Virginia the last two games and I
think that helped us now to get our confidence going. So I think we're playing
with confidence, and I think we're having fun.  
  
They enjoy being around each other and that makes all the difference in the
world. I feel, like I said, feel good about where we're at right now.
Hopefully we can keep it going.  
  
Q. Ais, yesterday after the game you said you didn 't want to start
celebrating or thinking about when this all means until it's all done. What
does it mean and what is it like?  
AISLINN KONIG: I mean, there is no words to describe the type of feeling that
the whole team has right now. This was a family that came together and really
bought in and played together throughout this whole tournament and through the
ups and downs through the season. Being able to celebrate that with them and
the coaching staff and the amazing fans who filled up this arena for us is
super special. To be part of this legacy of NC State that has had so many
contributors from before us and will guarantee to have after us, it's amazing
to be part of that.  
  
Q. Coach, your two freshman both scored in double digits today. How
important is that?  
WES MOORE: It's real exciting. Both of them were ACC all freshmen team
members. Jada Boyd brings so much energy when she comes out there, so
athletic, makes plays for us, Jakia, what a day she had today. Definitely
didn't play like a freshman. She didn't play like a freshman this whole
tournament. It's awesome to see somebody step up like that in this environment
their first year. It's exciting to think you have those two freshman and
Elissa sitting over here who is a sophomore. That's a good nucleus. We're
graduating a lot of guards so we have work to do there. But it's exciting to
think about having such a good core back.  
  
Q. Elissa, NC State had two steals today, you had both of them. You had
three fouls on you at the time. The first led to Ais 's tying basket and the
second led to your free throw that put you ahead to stay. What was going
through your mind? You've got three fouls on you at that point. Can you
describe both steals?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I kind of remember them, but you get five fouls for a reason.
There is only a little bit of time left in the game, I'm not going to shy away
fro playing defense. Kiah was a great scorer so I knew to keep my hand up and
keep pressure on them. I was just fortunate to get those and not fouls.  
  
Q. Wes, Kay Yow is the beacon at NC State. You have now joined her. What
does it mean to do it with The Wolfpack?  
WES MOORE: First of all, I want to make sure we understand the players do
this, okay? The plays they make, the shots they make, how much they lay it on
the line out there every day, so I definitely understand my place.  
  
But as far as Coach Yow, having worked for her a couple of years, walking out
on her court in Reynolds Coliseum, seeing the banner up top that she put up
there, it's been a long time. So for Coach Yow's legacy and the NC State
tradition she built, this is pretty awesome.  
  
For our fans, you know, we sold out three or four of our last games. I know we
lost three home games that were sellouts, okay? So I was so happy that we have
a full house over here today and we're able to send 'em home happy and knowing
that NC State is a champ. So just really special. Coach Yow, again, she is the
one that put this program on the map and we're just trying to, you know, take
care of what she left.  
  
Q. Ais, you were able to create some good looking shots in the first
half but went 1 of 6 in the first half. Shots weren 't falling and you went in
the locker room and came out and went 3 for 3 from behind the arc. What was
going through your mind at halftime and how do you have that ice in your veins
for these big moments?  
AISLINN KONIG: I'm surrounded by a coaching staff who has ultimate confidence
in my shooting ability, so that's not a big factor going in I knew I was going
to get other looks and I have teammates who aren't afraid to give me the ball.
I was able to hit those shots but their confidence in me and willingness to
trust me is a big part of that success.  
  
Q. I don 't know if you're familiar with the term "NC State stuff." You
probably hear it a lot. How does it feel to break that stigma of actually
bringing a major title back to campus?  
AISLINN KONIG: I don't think that's ever applied to us. You know, we have had
a lot of success over at least my four years here and I'm hoping that we can
continue on that and we have a lot of fantastic teams at NC State. As long as
you're willing to support them and have confidence in them they're going to
show up for you.  
  
Q. Elissa, a year ago before this tournament I think you talked to you
and you said as a little girl you would come here and watch a tournament. Now
you 're playing it in your hometown. Can you describe what it's like to win a
championship in your hometown after watching the tournament growing up all
those years?  
ELISSA CUNANE: It feels unreal right now. I remember as a kid when the
champions would be crowned I would see the balloons and the confetti growing
up, and I said mom, I want a balloon and she said no, you can't get one. So I
went down today and grabbed as many as I could! I have one in my locker. But
it's amazing to be on this stage and surrounded by all my best friends. It
means a lot to us.  
  
Q. Elissa, in the second quarter with 1:33 to go you had a traveling
call on you where it looks like there was physical play. You made the layup
and you wanted the "and one" and so did the crowd. On the following possession
you had a big rejection on the other end on the defensive stop and you put up
points to pull within one at halftime was that the spark that led to the 12
second half points? Did that flip a switch in you?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I think I got my momentum going and I was trying to focus on
the next play. They're going to be a very physical team, DI is a physical
league. So I had to keep playing through it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the crowd and how it impacted the game or impacted
the way you played?  
WES MOORE: Again, they make all the difference in the world. Felt like a home
game, to be honest with you, but they were here pretty much all week, but
especially today.  
  
Like I said, I know what was meant by the question a minute ago. It's been a
while since we've won one. So for our fans it means the world to me for us to
win a championship for them. Obviously the players, the staff, everyone
involved in it day-to-day, but also for them, year after year after year being
there for us.  
  
We got a lot of momentum going there, our season ticket sales have multiplied
by about seven times. We're selling out some games. So those fans are making
it special for this program and sure makes our job easier as we try to build
something special.  
  
Q. Coach, after the first win you said if Elissa has more assists than
turnovers, you would let her run point, she went 2 for 2 today.  
WES MOORE: We will get her all the threes we can get her. I have ultimate
confidence in her ability to knock down threes, point guard I go by the season
stats not day-by-day. So if her season stats get above there, we might be
talking. Again, I love the way she has developed her three-point shot and
y'all, we're running stuff to try to get her threes.  
  
I never thought I would do that, you got a 6'5" kid you want them on the
block, all the time, but she has gotten pretty good at it, so we will let her
roam around out there but we'll leave the ball be handling to others.  
  
AISLINN KONIG: Are you going to add those steals to the season stats?  
  
WES MOORE: Yeah, we'll add 'em.  
  
Q. Do you feel a responsibility to represent your country when you run
with the Wolfpack? If you could speak to Canadian girls what would you say to
them?  
AISLINN KONIG: To answer the first part of the that question I think I
represent Canada in who I am, that's always with me. My entire family is
there. It's my home. I play for the national team, so that's something that I
don't think about but I try and emulate in my life.  
  
And then to speak to those girls, it might seem like it's impossible, and it
might seem really hard but as long as you keep working and you are willing to
do the things that other people are not willing to do and whether that's
getting extra shots up or running in the rain, whatever you have to do, there
is a chance that you get to be up here like this and celebrating. On top of
the world.  
  
WES MOORE: And if they're really, really talented we want them to emulate her
and come to NC State, so, yes, it's possible.  
  
Q. Wes, Florida State came in shooting 46%. I think they were the
highest shooting team percentagewise for the tournament. You held them 12
percentage points below that today. Looking at the first game and this game
were there any defensive adjustments you made and how were you able to do
that?  
WES MOORE: Well, again, we just try to take away strengths. It's nothing too
fancy. We adjust how we play pick on the ball some, things like that. But
mostly it's these kids focused on what they have to take away and doing a
great job of helping each other. We obviously, at our place I felt like they
struggled to shoot it a little bit. Today they were knocking down shots I felt
like, especially in the early going. It came crunch time we were able to get
some stops. I'm proud of defense and rebounding, that's what wins these
things. I grew up -- not grew up, but I started out coaching in the shadows of
Pat Summitt, and they know I tell them all the time offense sells tickets,
defense wins games and rebounding wins championships.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thanks and best of luck in the postseason.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Jazmine Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30823)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida State - 62, Louisville - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome head coach Jeff Walz as well as Jazmine Jones.
Coach?  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just want to first congratulate Sue and Florida State. I thought it
was a fantastic basketball game between two teams that really competed. It
went back and forth, we came back, we take a lead, they hit a big shot, we hit
some shots, they stepped up, made some free throws, we make some free throws
at the end. Just a great basketball game.  
  
The first quarter is where we kinda got behind the eight ball there. Had some
great shots, shots we normally make and she just didn't go in. We go 4 of 17
in the first quarter and that put us behind. We kept clawing and kept clawing
and tied back up at half and then when we would get the lead you gotta give
Florida State credit they came up with big offensive boards where we couldn't
get any separation.  
  
So overall, you know, just I thought a great basketball game. I think our
young women competed. I'm proud of them.  
  
Now, you never want to lose. There is no question about that. But now what
we've got to do is we'll get some time. We will get some rest, get back in the
gym and prepare for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you went smaller for a lot of this game with Kylee getting 20
minutes. Talk about the rationale behind that?  
JEFF WALZ: What we tried to do -- the one point -- she had two fouls, got
those two and kind of for a little bit they called a foul on Yaya when they
put it to the scorer's table I thought they said 21. So I thought that was
Kylee's third. So we took her out and we bent with Bea and they went with four
guards also and we were having a hard time trying to match-up with two bigs in
the game. I thought Bionca was doing a nice job defensively for us again.  
  
We chipped away and chipped away and came back and took that lead and then 2
hit a big 3 at the top of the key there, it was a huge shot. That's something
we talked about. What we've got to get better at and we know it's something we
take pride in is Florida State converted when we had breakdowns. When we make
teams take shots we want them to take it normally works out in our favor and
we didn't do a terrible job defensively, we only gave up 62 points but the
problem is they made some big ones when we had some breakdowns.  
  
Q. Jaz, take me through the final possession, what you guys were trying
to get done?  
JAZMINE JONES: Coach drew up a nice play for Kylee to screen across for me and
if Mykasa had Kylee, because they switch, and if Kylee was open she was going
to throw it to Kylee, but she wasn't. So she threw it to Dana and Coach said
go for a layup if you can get to the basket and she missed it and I got a
chance to try to tip it in and it just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about No. 2 making the big three-pointer. I saw you
point her out at least a half a dozen times, shooter, shooter, shooter. Why
did she get open right there?  
JEFF WALZ: We just lost her. It's part of the game. You've got to give her
credit for stepping up and making the shot. But, unfortunately, that's one of
those situations that we will sit there and watch film with them and just
explain that it's so vital that you know where shooters are on the floor.  
  
Now, they lost us a few times, too, you know, when she made that three then
Dana got a wide-open three in the corner that didn't go in for us.  
  
It's part of the game. We will regroup. This stings, it hurts, nobody likes to
lose, and we put a lot of time and effort into this and our goal was to come
in here and be not only be conference champs but win the tournament.
Unfortunately we came up a little bit short and now we will get prepared for
the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you say to the team after this one to get them ready
for a high NCAA bid?  
JEFF WALZ: You've got about two weeks before, a week and a half before we find
out who we're going to play. We know we will play at home. There is not much
you say. They're all competitors. It's not like I have to give a big speech to
get them excited and prepared to play.  
  
We will take some days off, which they all need, and then we will get back at
it on Thursday, probably, Wednesday, Thursday, of this coming week, have some
good practices leading up to Selection Monday and then figure out who we're
going to play and when.  
  
Q. Jaz, the bench gave you guys a boost today is that a positive you can
claim from this loss, their performance?  
JAZMINE JONES: It was a positive for us all year. We knew we had a deep team
coming into the year and we knew no matter who Coach took out the game we knew
we was adding something to the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, any concerns that this might knock you out of a number one
seed?  
JEFF WALZ: The reveal a week ago showed we weren't a number one seed. So I
wasn't too concerned about that. That's the one nice thing about the reveal.
There is really not much guessing of what goes on. The only chance we would
have had was to win out and hope somebody would have gotten beat. I'm not
concerned about that at all.  
  
Q. Jaz, you were matched up against Gillespie a lot in this game. Talk
about her athleticism and how hard it was to prevent her from doing things?  
JAZMINE JONES: She is a great player, first time all ACC, of course. She has a
nice -- she can stretch the floor, being at the 4 position she is, coming down
here and getting threes, getting into your body, reverse pivot, hitting a
15-foot jumper. She is a great player. We just had to stay on her and make her
shoot in the pocket and make it difficult for her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you and good luck in NCAAs.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Nausia Woolfolk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38943)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida State - 62, Louisville - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce Florida State head coach Sue
Semrau as well as student-athlete Nausia Woolfolk. Coach?  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Proud of the way our team battled. Louisville is an excellent
team. After going up there and pulling out a win I knew they would come out
with a lot of fire. They did, but we matched it. I'm proud of my seniors. They
are something else.  
  
They were not going to be denied today. You saw Nausia go down. I thought she
might be out. You saw Kiah go down. We're still looking into her.  
  
But they battled, and I'm guessing, yeah, that we won the rebounding battle
and that was huge. I'm just really, really proud of them. Ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the thinking? You went more than 6 minutes without
scoring in the fourth quarter. What was the team mindset at that point?  
SUE SEMRAU: We thought we would let them come back, you know, and spot 'em a
couple points. I mean, what do you mean. What's your thinking? They played
great defense. It's a battle! You gotta play on the defensive end and
sometimes when you don't score you don't defend and that wasn't our team
today. We defended like crazy.  
  
Q. Nausia, you hit some key free throws down the stretch. Talk about
this atmosphere in this game.  
NAUSIA WOOLFOLK: I think the team as well as myself, we like competition.
Louisville is a team that always bring it so at the end of the game the
mindset was do anything you can do to help the team win, concentrate on the
free throw line, making sure the team's head is in the game and at the free
throw line they were 8 for 9 and that was a key win to the game.  
  
Q. Coach, for Kourtney to come off the bench and hit the two free throws
and steal the in-bounds afterwards what can you say about her impact?  
SUE SEMRAU: If you say saw her play yesterday you know she's coming into her
own. She looked at me with wide eyes like it's me! I trust her so much at the
free throw line and in the game. I'm proud of her, back-to-back really good
games.  
  
Q. Let me restate that.  
SUE SEMRAU: Thanks.  
  
Q. What was the team mindset at that point when you 're down and you
haven't scored in so long? What are you telling your team at that point?  
SUE SEMRAU: It's what we've told them all year: Defense travels. Sometimes the
ball doesn't go through the net. It's a lot easier to defend when you see that
thing go through the net. This team didn't have to see that. They turned
around and didn't hang their heads, they came down and they knew that they
needed to get a stop.  
  
We talked about just there's going to be a lot of things that come at us,
okay? We had to bring every weapon. We brought every weapon we had today.
They're a tough team to beat.  
  
Q. The big three-pointer, they had been defending her very well all
game. How do you think she got open all of the sudden?  
SUE SEMRAU: Did you see the last play of the half? Sammie does that and the
next look she gets it's going to be a dagger. It's a hard game. To see
shooters all the time, all places, I mean, we left shook open a couple times
where she had a couple threes. It happens. Just really proud of Sammie as a
freshman in that situation to knock it down.  
  
Q. Nausia, you guys have beaten Louisville twice this season. What has
been the key?  
NAUSIA WOOLFOLK: Locking in, making sure you know personnel and staying
focused. I think it was harder for us today just wanting to get to the
championship and today it was lay your heart on the line and that's what we
did. It wasn't about scouting, leave it on the floor forget everything and
just play and that's what we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Jada Boyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38944)

### [Aislinn Konig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34693)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 82, Boston College - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to welcome to the stage NC State head coach, Wes
Moore, as well as student-athletes Aislinn Konig and Jada Boyd. Coach?  
  
WES MOORE: First of all, what a job Boston College staff and players have
done, you know. Believable what they have been able to accomplish this year. I
think they definitely deserve to be in the NCAA tournament and play some more
games.  
  
First congrats to them. Proud of our kids, the way they responded. We got off
to a slow start again and first quarter we gave up a whole lot of points and
then in the second quarter we seemed to be able to get some stuff going in
transition and get Elissa some touches inside and Ais knocked down some
threes. So that gave us momentum going into the locker room at halftime. It
was good. We were able to get some people some rest in the second half and not
play them quite as many minutes, so I thought that was good as well. Again,
we're excited about the opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ais, what changed in the second quarter? Was it just a matter they
hit every shot in the first quarter and they were bound to start missing or
did you do something defensively?  
AISLINN KONIG: I think they were doing a good job of getting the ball into the
post and that is a talented senior there for Boston College who scores really
well so switching up the defense and we ended up putting Jada Boyd on her for
a little bit and that changed the way she was being guarded and that was able
to disrupt their offense.  
  
Q. Jada, obviously yesterday was your first time playing in this event.
Was it a matter of getting comfortable and adjusting to the big stage?  
JADA BOYD: Not a matter of adjusting. Well, yeah, adjusting, getting my feet
wet and trying to get in the improve of things. I'm still growing and still
learning so just coming back today and doing it!  
  
WES MOORE: It gave us a big lift on both ends of the court. She did a great
job on Guy there in the second quarter and got in front of her some and made
it tougher for her to get the ball and offensively she knocked down 7 out of
10 shots. So that gave us a lift there as well.  
  
You know, if we're playing well, I don't touch it a whole lot so yesterday I
thought Kayla Jones played really well. The team was playing well, so we kinda
let it roll. But, again, Jada Boyd, when she gets an opportunity they makes a
difference for us and she did that both ends of the court today.  
  
Q. Ais, guys were down 7 with about 15 seconds left in that first
quarter. Then Kai and Kaila hit big threes and obviously in the second quarter
you guys exploded and went on that run. How important were those shots in the
end of the first quarter to get you guys momentum?  
AISLINN KONIG: When anybody hits big shots like that it really excites the
team and allows us to get more excited on the floor. We play a little harder
we are able to celebrate and. So I think that was the big momentum changer and
really got us into the flow.  
  
Q. Coach, in that first quarter when Boston College was playing really
fast and it seems like the team was struggling defensively, are you expecting
them to kinda just -- eventually the defense is going to tighten up or are you
actively thinking this is something that might go on for 40 quarters. So what
are we going to have to do in quarters two, three and four?  
WES MOORE: Again, Elissa was having a hard time getting around Guy, so we
thought Jada Boyd with more athleticism and length could be effective so we
did that.  
  
I've got confidence we're going to eventually start hitting some shots and
gettin' some stops. Boston College had a great fourth quarter as well, shot
the ball really well. They're capable of doing that. They got a lot of
weapons, both their posts can score. They got two, three guards shooting 35%
or so from the three and they make it tough. Again they've got a lot of
balance. Again, you know me, I never panic, I'm patient, cool. Again, got a
lot of confidence in them that they can come back and turn things around.  
  
Q. Wes, you mentioned earlier in your opening statement but how big is
it to have them fresh for that third game in three days?  
WES MOORE: By having such a strong second quarter we talked at halftime let's
win the third quarter. If we win the third quarter we are in a position to do
those things some so we were able to do a good job in the third quarter and,
again, Boston College, they have no quit. They kept coming at us which made me
a little nervous over there. But definitely wanted to try to get some people
off court and, again, some people that went in, Jada Boyd played extremely
well when she went in. So that allowed us to get both of them some rest
because we played Jada at both positions today. That's big. You've got to go
out and play. Both teams will be excited tomorrow and have a lot of
adrenaline. So how much of a difference it makes I don't know. But, hey, did
everything we could to make sure we're set up and ready to go.  
  
Q. Wes, knowing the reputation Boston College has for three-point
shooting, especially after what they did to Duke last night. They were eight
for 15 but four of those threes came in the last two minutes of the game. What
were you able to accomplish squaring the three-point shooters that other teams
weren 't able to do?  
WES MOORE: I don't know. We were trying to get our post up there to make the
guard with the ball swing out a little bit wider and give our guard time to
get through it. They hurt us on the roll some when we did that and obviously
Guy being so effective on the block makes you have to play it a little bit
more honest, but, again, our kids did a pretty good job, really, most of the
game of defending the pick on the ball. That's going to be really important
tomorrow, too, because I know Florida State does that quite a bit as well.
We've got to mix it up, try to keep 'em off balance some and hopefully we can
continue to do a pretty good job against that.  
  
Like I said, Boston College they get hot, sometimes it's tough.  
  
Q. Ais, how are you balancing the sense of urgency as a senior and
enjoying the moment?  
AISLINN KONIG: Winning is a lot of fun so I guess it's trying to make sure the
urgency doesn't turn into getting out of control and really staying patient
and running the offense and finding good shots. Then celebrating the big
moments when my teammates get to hit big shots or Jada has a big game. Those
are the way I enjoy it as a senior.  
  
Q. Jada, would you say that this is the longest basketball season -- you
're a freshman, so how do you feel about the length of the season?  
JADA BOYD: I feel great.  
  
Q. Not tired?  
JADA BOYD: No.  
  
Q. For all of you, first, ACC title game in ten years. Just comment on
that.  
WES MOORE: Yeah, you know, really not that excited about that. What I would
like to do is obviously try to finish it off. It's going to be really tough.
Florida State has had a great year and they're playing well down the stretch.  
  
You know, this isn't the time to sit back and evaluate your accomplishments.
Gotta keep preparing, keep going, obviously after this game tomorrow the
players are going to get a break for a few days and that will be good for
them.  
  
Right now is not really the time. I told the team in the locker room
afterwards, let's don't spend a lot of time thinking about all the outside
stuff, let's focus on the scout, the film, the preparation, like we've done
all year long and get ready to play one more game. That's the important thing
right now, the preparation, focusing on that and not wearing about the
implications of the game. There will be plenty of time to do that later.  
  
That being said, I would love nothing better than for these players but also
our fans to be able to enjoy a championship. Like I said, we got work to do
and we've got to focus on the game itself but, yeah, we understand.  
  
AISLINN KONIG: I think he summed it up pretty well. As a player in the last
four years we've kind of came up short the last two at least, and it's
exciting to be able to be in this position to really capitalize off of our
capabilities as a team and the potential that we have for the rest of the
postseason.  
  
JADA BOYD: I'm just excited to get there and get it done.  
  
Q. Coach, what would it mean for this program if you can finish this off
and get over that hump? I think it 's since 1991 so what would it mean to get
a title?  
WES MOORE: I think maybe 1990 even, but who's counting? You saw the fans, the
crowd out there. There was a lot of red! They've been awesome. We sold out
several games this year down the stretch and our season ticket sales are,
like, seven times what they were a few years ago. So we got a lot of momentum
and excitement and our fans are awesome so we would love to do that. Also for
the players. It's not easy doing what they do. Obviously they're students and
there is a lot that goes into that, but also just the demands we put on 'em,
the film, the scout, the practice, whatever, walkthroughs.  
  
It's a lot of work. So you would love for them to be rewarded like that. It
would mean everything, as far as, you know, our program and our fans. But like
I said, now's not the time really to sit back and evaluate that. We still have
some work to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the scout and the film. You guys played Florida
State so long ago. Do you watch that film or more recent games or a little bit
of both?  
WES MOORE: Tonight we will watch recent games and tomorrow morning we will
watch our game clips, and, again, we try to cut those down to where we can
show them in 10 or 15 minutes. It is tough, you know, so some teams don't
shootaround maybe or whatever, but we usually do a walkthrough so we're going
to have to get up pretty early in the morning so hopefully we will get in bed
at some point after film and then we will walk through what Florida State runs
and what we want to do against them. Again, they're going to get three days
off after tomorrow and they can rest then. But we got one more to go.  
  
Q. Quickly, Coach, big picture with the parity we have seen across the
board, Duke the ACC has been underrated this year?  
WES MOORE: We went to an 18-game schedule because of the ACC Network, yeah!
Consequently, we knocked each other off, you know? So it makes it a little bit
tougher when you're playing such good teams not night in, night out and you
knock each other off a little bit. I think it's a great league, you see this
tournament, look at the upsets. You can't sleep on anybody, and I know we're
not supposed to be in the big three, thanks for the motivation there, we
survived it!  
  
Again, though, yeah, I think this league is brutal when you start preparing
night in and night out. It's a bear.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will see you tomorrow in the championship game. Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 82, Boston College - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce from Boston College head coach
Joanna Bernabie-McNamee and student-athlete Emma Guy. Coach?  
  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: All I can say is I love, absolutely love the fight in
our team. I think it could have been so easy after the bad second quarter that
we had for us to kind of fold and just hang it up, but there was no such
thing.  
  
These ladies have grit. They have heart. It comes down to, and I'm sure you
guys all take note, our bench, you know, they deserve a big shout out, Mimi,
Bolden-Morris, Sydney Lowery, Clara Ford, Jaelyn Batts got in a little bit.
They cheered their butt off and they had these ladies back and on the court I
felt like we left our blood, sweat and tears in that second half.  
  
I just hope we get to show the NCAA tournament what we're made of because I'm
proud of the fight these ladies had.  
  
Q. For both of you: What happened in the second quarter? You guys shot
lights out in the first. Did it even out or did something change defensively
that you didn 't adjust to?  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: I think in the first quarter we traded baskets the
whole quarter. They were kind of lights out and we were kind of lights out. In
the second quarter I think we continued not to play the defense that we're
capable of playing, and then we also didn't make shots. I think that
compounded on each other and made for just a really terrible second quarter.  
  
On top of that, and I challenged them at halftime, I wasn't happy with what we
looked like on the boards and neither were they. They know what they're made
of and capable of and we weren't doing it, I think we had 2 offensive boards
in the first half, and we ended up with 12 so much better in the second half.
NC State is an awesome team. They play hard. They play the right way and they
get after it and we in that second quarter didn't necessarily step up to the
challenge that we needed to and it really started because we weren't making
shots and that trickled into our defense which we are usually not like that.
We cleared up that in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks to both of you. We hope to see you in the NCAA.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Jazmine Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30823)

### [Dana Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36629)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 71, Syracuse - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started with the Louisville press conference. We
are joined by Jeff Walz and we are joined by student-athletes Dana Evans and
Jazmine Jones. Coach?  
  
JEFF WALZ: I would like to congratulate Syracuse on what was without a doubt a
tough year going into it you realize you're not going to have Tiana with the
news that they received but so excited that she is doing well and will be back
on the court next year. She runs that team for them. I thought Kiara got
thrown into having to be at the point and I thought she did a nice job.  
  
Overall I thought, you know, Syracuse and Q really handled everything
extremely well. I thought they competed. Just really impressed with their
team. They're going to be really, really good. As they continue to move
forward for next year and once they get Tiana back at the point.  
  
For us I was just really proud of these young women. I thought we competed
from the get-go. We defended extremely well. It's pretty impressive when you
can lead the league in points allowed three straight years. You're obviously
doing something the right at the defensive end of the floor. For us to be able
to lead the league offensively with points discard I think it says something
about our kids the fact that they're willing to defend and also willing to get
in the gym and work on their offensive game. So just pleased with how we
played today.  
  
Q. Coach, the defense has been pretty spectacular the last couple of
games but you hold them to 27 points tonight, stepping it up a notch. What
were you seeing that was allowing you to shut them down tonight?  
JEFF WALZ: I wish we held them to 27 points. We held them to 27% but points
sounded better! What we did was we dictated a lot of what we wanted them to
do. Instead of just reacting to what they were doing, I thought defensively we
were there on the catch. They missed a few shots in the first half when they
had open looks but after a while when you only get so many of them, you start
to press, like my God I finally got one! So now you rush your shot.  
  
These young women did a remarkable job of making sure we had a hand in the
face. Kiara Lewis is a big-time player. You aren't going to hold her
scoreless, but we made her take 21 shots. I thought that was a win.  
  
Not giving them a bunch of second-chance opportunities was another key thing
we talked about, we had to do a good job of keeping them off the glass and we
did a great job of that today.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you 're coming in as the unquestioned head liner of a
tournament, winning it outright in the regular season for the first time, is
there anything different this year as opposed to past years where you shared
the regular season title with Notre Dame? Anything different this time?  
JEFF WALZ: No, there are still plenty of people that don't think we're all
that good. It's just a fact. It's okay. They not might not like the way we
play or what it might be. At the end of the day, we compete. I watch all the
stuff that goes on and Oregon is having a fantastic season and they talk about
their one loss in November but they won't ever say who beat 'em, I think it
was us.  
  
I would love to get the chance in the future to possibly play them again. We
are 2-0 against Sabrina, that's not too bad! We are a pretty dam good ball
club. Do we just have to show up and win, no! We have to compete. We play
hard. I think for the 13 years I've been here I don't think anybody would
question how hard we play, and that's the one thing I talked with Q about at
the end. He said, man, I'm just so impressed with how hard your kids play. I
take a lot of pride in that about we have wonderful young women who represent
themselves off the basketball court as good as anybody I've been around but
when you step on to the court, they're here to compete. That's what it's all
about.  
  
Q. Dana, you struggled against Syracuse in these first two games what
was different tonight?  
DANA EVANS: I would say the tempo of the game, I got more easy shots this game
but I credit my teammates for looking for me and getting me those open shots.
Defensively we got the ball out and rebound and had were able to push the ball
so they weren't able to set up in their zone as quick.  
  
Q. Jeff, what about your personnel defensively allows you to play the
way you want to? The way you switch screens and deny passes?  
JEFF WALZ: We have good legs. That was one thing we missed when Elizabeth was
with her national team qualifying for the Olympics here this summer is she
gives us a lot of length there on the wing. You put her and Yaya, they both
play extremely well. I've said it all along and I'll knock on wood and hope it
keeps going but we have not had a ball game where they have both played bad
the same game. If you want to say someone struggled, they've both -- someone
came in and played well, or they both played well. They both did not defend,
they didn't rebound. One might struggle, but then I've got the next one to
throw out there and they complement each other so well.  
  
Q. Jazmine, Coach talked about rebounding before the game you out
rebounded them 53-31. You had 10 rebounds. How much of a concerted effort was
that?  
JAZMINE JONES: Now he can get off my back about rebounding.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Seven of them fell into her hands.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: He's been challenging me these last couple games getting to the
glass and get rebounds and helping my teammates out and Coach put a big
emphasis on it everything else. We really committed to boxing out this game
and rebounding and that's what I think was a big part of this game for us.  
  
Q. Coach, last game against Syracuse the loss at the Dome, much better
shooting percentages today than then. Was that because of changes you made?  
JEFF WALZ: We had some shots that didn't fall up there, but you gotta give
Syracuse credit. I thought they really did a good job. Like I said, the thing
about Elizabeth is she is not scoring 20 a night, but what she does, you have
to respect her. She's got the ability to make four or five three's in a row so
it spreads the floor for us and that allows Jaz to do what she can do and she
has been shooting 40% from the three-point line in ACC play. Now you've got to
respect her from out there, Kylee is shooting the ball well from the three-
point line. Dana is shooting it well. Yacine goes 1 for 2. Now we're able to
spread things out so when we do get a chance to drive and attack the gap we're
getting nice looks from 8 to 10 feet on a pull-up jump shot.  
  
Q. Dana, congrats on the award this year. How much has Jazmine been a
part of helping you to take the next step in terms of challenging you?  
DANA EVANS: She is a great teammate and great person. When I'm struggling, she
always picks me up and I feel like she complements me and I complement her
well too. I just tell her go run. Nobody can catch you and we feed off each
other.  
  
Q. How much will you hang your hat on what you can do defensively with
Elizabeth back tomorrow in terms of defending the Seminoles?  
DANA EVANS: She is long and she played great D. She is going to help us and
complement us a lot in this next game. Because they're a really good team.  
  
Q. Jaz, we 've seen so much joy, when you look at this team the growth,
what's the thing that you're most proud of in terms of the kind of ball you're
playing right now?  
JAZMINE JONES: I think consistency, after two losses we regrouped and came
back playing Louisville women basketball and we've been consistent especially
on the defensive end too and that will allow us to get out in transition like
Dana and Coach said. That is what I think is leading us to this run we are
making. We just have to keep it up and that will lead us to easy offense.  
  
Q. Jeff, you have talked about Bionca and how well she is playing down
the stretch and Dixon came in today and gave you a lift when Kylee picked up
those fouls, how important are those two in anything you want to do long
term?  
JEFF WALZ: For us I thought Liz played as well in the first half as she has
played all year. She was on top of every assignment. She knew what she had to
do at the defensive end. She was rebounding the basketball with two hands,
just really, really impressed with how she played, and that's what we're going
to continue to need from her as she goes forward, and I talked to her, it's
not just bout this year, but every day she is learning and getting better for
next year, also, because it's a process. It's the one thing I can say about
Dana and Jaz sitting here. They did not come in as freshmen and completely
dominate. It's been a process. Jaz has worked on her game year in and year
out, and has gotten better and better.  
  
Dana was a little bit of a bullhead, and that's being nice. I'm watching my
language, here, her freshman year, but I will say she is fortunate to have a
wonderful father who puts her in her place every once in a while, which does
not happen all the time as a coach when a player can come and be like, man, I
want to apologize. My dad said he not wouldn't have played me as much as you
did.  
  
DANA EVANS: Shout out to dad!  
  
JEFF WALZ: It's great! Then for Bionca, I'm so excited and proud of her. A kid
that, you know -- we were the only division I scholarship offer she had out of
high school. The only one. She came in as a freshman. I tried to redshirt her
and God bless her, she goes, "I didn't come here to sit on the bench. I came
here to play," and I was like, all right. And she has just developed year in
and year out. What she does for us at the defensive end of the floor, she
controls everything. She is talking every second she is on the floor. It's
amazing how well she knows what everybody is supposed to do.  
  
You know, we have had a few in the past. We had Keshia Hines that played for
us my first few years, it was the same way. Sam Fuehring knew what everybody
was supposed to do, and Bionca is out there directing traffic, which we're
going to need her to continue to be able to play. I played her all 20 minutes
in the first half and was fortunate that we only had to play her four minutes,
because she was like, "Hey, Coach, I can only go so long." It's perfect.  
  
Everything is great, and she has been wonderful all season. We've only given
up 70 points once in the ACC, and that's the game Bionca did not play, at
Boston College.  
  
Q. Dana, Jeff mentioned Oregon and you guys are 2-0 versus Sabrina. Do
you have a reaction to that?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I'll take care of that. We just state facts. That's it. We're
all about fact checking, and that would be accurate if you looked it up. I
fact check for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, all.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Kourtney Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38902)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida - 76, Wake Forest - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Florida State. We have Sue Semrau and our student-
athlete is Courtney Webber. Coach?  
  
SUE SEMRAU: I ask my players to sit in the first three rows of class, so I'm
disappointed with the media here. There we go! You're the superstar! Just
proud of the way our team came out. I thought the tempo really favored us. I
thought our guards did a good job of pushing tempo. Wake Forest made a heck of
a run and they're a really good basketball team.  
  
Raca is one of the best in the conferences, obviously and she was tough to
guard. We had to go deep to find a way to stop her. But really proud of 'em,
and excited to be moving on.  
  
Q. Since I 'm the superstar I figured I might as well start with the
first question.  
SUE SEMRAU: That's right.  
  
Q. What kind of impact was the six early turnovers from Wake Forest and
then the hot shotting, 8 for 10 from behind the arc in the first half, what
contributed to those two things having such a big impact?  
SUE SEMRAU: First off, we lost our last game at home and we've been chomping
at the bit. They've been great at practice ready to come out and see what we
can do here in the tournament so our defense was much better than it has been.  
  
So, you know, we caused the travels, we did our work early and then to be able
to go to the other end and hit big shots like that, that always gives you a
lot of momentum, makes you play harder on defense, too, when you see that ball
go through the net.  
  
Q. Coach, you got a great effort on the boards today against them and
Kourtney came off the bench and had a big game. Is that what you expected
against a tired Wake Forest team?  
SUE SEMRAU: Not expected. Wake Forest has done some really incredible things
this year. They're really hard to guard. We knew we had to bring it. Everybody
I thought on my team came in and contributed. We talk about rebounding all the
time but Kourtney was phenomenal. Like I told Kelley Deyo, she plays like that
all the time. They call her, you know, they say we want three on three
Kourtney Weber, that was the summer thing we did and she was a beast. I think
she is just getting comfortable in being an all-time contributor.  
  
Q. Kourtney, talk about your effort coming in and ending up with 15
points, tell us all about it?  
KOURTNEY WEBER: Honestly, I wanted to go out there and do what we team needed
me to do. Today was in more scoring and driving and tomorrow it could be
rebounding. I want to go out and play comfortable and not force anything.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: She had four assists and no turnovers and she said that's the
proudest stat she has.  
  
Thank you guys so much. Appreciate you being here.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 84, Duke - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Duke head coach Joanne P. McCallie, and
joined by student-athletes, Haley Gorecki and Leaonna Odom. Coach?  
  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Obviously an exciting game, a great tournament game, very
offensive minded, perhaps a little bit too offensive minded relative to stops
we need to do get at critical points. I'm really, really proud of our team
being down 9 or 10, I'm not sure, but coming all the way back and doing what
we did to go up 7 was great. But you gotta play a full forty minutes and there
were plays to finish and rebounds to get and the ball to take care of. So we
didn't finish down the stretch.  
  
There were some great lessons for us, preparing for the future, the Tournament
and the whole thing there and learning about time and score. Execution. We've
had some of that pretty good, but today we didn't execute it fully. Give
credit to Boston College. They had some foul trouble as well, so obviously
we're excited for them to do well and continue on. It was a great basketball
game, disappointing for us, no doubt. But I think some valuable lessons for us
moving forward.  
  
Q. Haley, you 're up 77-70 against a team that played last night and by
all rights should have been somewhat fatigued. What was Duke not able to do to
close them out?  
HALEY GORECKI: Just stopped at the end and what Coach just said, take care of
the ball, not much else to say, really, we gotta get stops down the stretch.  
  
Q. Leaonna, throughout the night you showed no hesitation with the pull-
up jumpers and it ended up being helpful for your team down the stretch. Can
you talk about that approach heading into the game?  
LEAONNA ODOM: I don't think any of that matters, we didn't get any defensive
stops therefore we are not continuing on to the next game.  
  
Q. Assuming you make the NCAA tournament, what are the keys to having a
better outcome next game?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: I'll take that. We should unequivocally make the NCAA
tournament. Our RPI is very high. You can check that. Our strength of schedule
as well. There is no question whether that is going to happen or not, that is
going to happen.  
  
These women have been pretty amazing to get from 10th to 3rd and to do what we
have done in the season, especially the finish.  
  
It's hurting now because we definitely want to move forward and do more in
this tournament, but that's not -- there is no question to that. The question
is how we get ready. Again, time and score, we will be watching this film
tomorrow, getting a good feel for it, understanding the things we could have
done differently.  
  
Q. Coach P., at one point I think Boston College was around 70% from
three. Talk about what they were doing on their end that was making it so
difficult to guard?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It was a tough combination. Their paint points were more
significant even than their three-point shooting. They had a good outside
game. We needed to do a better job of ball pressure and taking away passing
angles. You let any team score 84 points you're leaving it to chance at that
point. We scored plenty of points, 77 was enough. We had goals to hold them
below 84. So it's a good lesson about where our focus needs to be and that
needs to be on the team side of defense and rebounding and what we're going to
see are the put-backs that they got down the stretch that were so critical and
some of the possessions that we didn't utilize.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Elissa Cunane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36638)

### [Aislinn Konig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34693)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 57, Georgia Tech - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by NC State head coach Wes Moore, student-
athletes Aislinn Konig and Elissa Cunane. Coach?  
  
WES MOORE: First of all, what a job Nell and her staff has done at Georgia
Tech and her players. I mean, they make it so difficult for you to score. They
keep the game close, oftentimes they keep it ugly. Just really proud of the
fact that we had more assists than turnovers. Like I said, normally they win
the turnover battle and today we were -- did a pretty good job of taking care
of the ball and handling that.  
  
What do you say, the zone we probably hadn't played five minutes of zone all
year, but we felt like maybe we could get 'em out of their rhythm a little
bit. Fletcher was doing a great job attacking one-on-one and you definitely
don't want to help off their shooters.  
  
So we decided to give 'em a different look and our players like I said did a
great job. We worked on it a little bit this week and they just did a great
job. I was real pleased with the way we rebounded out of it because that's
your big concern.  
  
I always think that the team that played the day before has the advantage
early in the game, and that was obvious today, they definitely had an
advantage. They looked a lot more comfortable and a lot more aggressive, but,
obviously, if you have not played, you hope in the second half or in this case
the second quarter that you maybe can take advantage of a little bit of
fatigue or whatever.  
  
Again, good win, get us going, hopefully, and proud of the team.  
  
Q. In anticipation of this game did you feel you would have to play zone
as much as you did? Fundamentally what did you do differently to get your
offensive cranking the second quarter?  
WES MOORE: I don't know. I think we got some transition going a little bit. We
were able to get stops, which allowed us to get out and run. As far as the
zone, I did feel like from watching film that the zone might would be
something that we could use to disrupt them a little bit. I tell the players
sometimes that and then we never use it if things go well but obviously things
weren't going so well.  
  
So, like I said, they did a great job considering we hadn't spent a whole lot
of time this season working on it. Again, I don't know, second quarter, I have
to look at the film but I do know we were able to get a little transition
going and we started attacking a little better and quit playing, your Honor,
so much one-on-one.  
  
Q. Pan scored 30 the last time you two played and today only 15. What
were you doing as a team that limited her impact today?  
AISLINN KONIG: As a team we were trying to focus more on her. She has the
potential to go off and be a huge player for that team and last game she
scored and she has been playing well all tournament up to this point so we
were trying to force other people to hit shots and helping off of players that
we thought we would have a better chance of guarding.  
  
Q. Coach, Camille hasn 't played a lot this year. What kind of spark did
she provide off the bench?  
WES MOORE: I thought she did a good job. She has done a nice job all year. We
went back to the senior rotation a little bit. I said to Camille hopefully
over the next three years you appreciate my loyalty to the veterans. She was
frustrated at times and she has handled it great. I thought she did a great
job. She was able to knock down a shot or two. I thought she did a great job,
gave us a big lift with Elissa being in foul trouble pretty early in the game.
Camille has a lot of good skills and is going to be a really good player for
us. Sometimes this time of year you go with the veterans but felt like we
needed her today and she did a great job.  
  
Q. Ais, when you guys were down early and you started to go on the run
what did you say to your teammates?  
AISLINN KONIG: What we were talking about as a team is we're better than what
we're playing. We need to be patient. The shots aren't falling but we need to
do the little things, play defense, take care of the ball and get rebounds and
that's going to get us into motion to start scoring on offense.  
  
Q. Elissa, when you came back in, I know for you establishing your
position in the post this year has been and then got bumped off your spot.
What were you thinking --  
ELISSA CUNANE: Coach came up to me and said you gotta demand the ball inside
and they were double-teaming, but we started knocking down shots so that
opened up the double team more and I was able to score inside.  
  
Q. Jakia Brown-Turner, ice water in her veins. That was a big shot?  
WES MOORE: Yeah.  
  
Q. How does she keep herself ready? When she takes shots like that what
do you feel during the game?  
WES MOORE: Again, I love it when Jakia gets open threes, and I forget who it
was that kicked it to her but they did a nice job of drawing help and kick it
go out. Was it you? Good job Elissa. That's your one assist for the day, good,
go ahead and brag about it (Laughter.) You had as many assists as you did
turnovers. I told her if she reached a point in the season she had more
assists than turnovers, I would let her play point guard but I think we're
pretty safe (Laughter.) But Jakia is a great player, she is a freshman, first
time on that stage and you could tell at times it got to her a little bit but
what a big shot, no doubt. Late in the game, still a couple of possessions and
that was a big, big shot right there and happy for her.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys hit a little bit of a skid to finish the regular
season. But what are you most proud of in terms of the way this team is
playing right now as you head deeper into the postseason?  
WES MOORE: I think you maybe said we be weren't going to be a big factor?  
  
Q. We can have an honest conversation, Coach. Let 's get it.  
WES MOORE: I appreciate it. It helps us, you know? This league is tough,
y'all. We lost to Louisville. They're pretty good, okay? We lost to Duke,
okay? Again, they were playing really well and had a lot of momentum. We lost
to Georgia Tech. They beat Florida State twice. They're pretty good! They beat
us once. So we didn't shoot it well the first six games in February. It wasn't
any secret. We had kids shooting 17%, 18% from three that normally are
shooting 35%.  
  
So, yeah, we went through a tough time but we knew we got some great shooters.
They're going to snap out of it. I do agree we're kinda built where we need to
hit shots. We're not go to going to create a lot of offensive out of our
defense and turn you over that much the way we play. But, again, you can't
panic. Everybody goes through a stretch in this league, sometimes it's just a
matter of who you're playing.  
  
Heck, we were lucky to get out of Miami. I think we hadn't won in Miami since
2007, NC State hadn't. So tough stretch of games. We hung in there, and I
think it was big winning our last two and coming over here a little bit happy,
feeling pretty good and now this helps. It would be nice if we shoot about 50%
from three tomorrow, I would feel a whole lot better.  
  
Q. Wes, you guys hit a season low three 3 's against them in the first
meeting. You hit four today. What do they do so well against the three that
makes it difficult for the shooters, beyond players missing shots?  
WES MOORE: They play hard. They close out hard. I kept telling them on the
bench, use the shot fake and attack some. But we're used to shooting threes. I
don't know how many blocked shots they had. I haven't looked at that, but I
bet every one of them came off threes, four, and probably came off shooting
threes. Again, that's who we are. We don't want to get away from that too
much, but we would like to work inside out, get some touches. They make that
tough because they're going to double the post. Like I said, they got some
length and they make it hard for you to get your shot off.  
  
But, you know, again, like I said, we've hit a stretch here and there where we
haven't shot it well but hopefully we kinda do like we did in the first half
against Virginia the other day and come out and get hot and hit a few and get
this thing rolling.  
  
Q. Elissa, first quarter you were 3 of 16, shooting 18%, you missed
eight three 's. You're down 11 points. At 7:01 Ais hits the first three of the
game. A minute later Camille hit a short jumper. It's the first two
possessions you had actually put two possessions back-to-back where you
scored. How big was that in terms of just regaining confidence for the rest of
the game?  
ELISSA CUNANE: It was huge. I think one emphasis we have had on our play is
"next possession." We know that we're not going to hit a shot, we don't get
the rebound, okay, next possession we are going to hit that shot, and I think
the energy that especially Camille brought off the bench and us being on the
bench cheering them on, I think that all helped to propel us.  
  
AISLINN KONIG: I would argue it wasn't a lack of confidence for us, shots
weren't falling. We were still taking good shots, and we were moving the ball
around and attacking. I think it was more patience. That was the moment where
we start to see shots go in and then it starts to click, and that is a lot of
fun and allows us to get into a rhythm.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Jennifer Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38824)

### [Ivana Raca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38826)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida - 76, Wake Forest - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started Wake Forest. Head coach Jen Hoover and
student-athlete, Ivana Raca, Coach?  
  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I'm super proud of this team for what we came to Greensboro
to do and the fact that we came up short today is no discouragement to me
because these kids are warriors and they fight and they claw. I thought today
we came out and were ready to go and give kudos to them. They were red hot and
went 8 for 10 in the first half. Whether we were a step slow or whatever may
be the case, I thought we got some good looks and we couldn't finish a couple
things early and it just started to go the wrong direction and we couldn't
stop it.  
  
Q. Coach, third round of the tournament here. Was it the motivation
level you will play up to your team after this one?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I told them, like, we want to play three games every time we
come here but we want the third game to be the championship game. I don't like
to have those conversations in the locker room with seniors in there that
won't have that opportunity, but they're a big part of what we've done and
every player that's wore the black and gold uniform is a big part of what
we're trying to do and that's our goal. We've got to get off playing in the
first day and you want to get off playing in the second day and that third day
is the championship game.  
  
Q. Jen, what kind of impact and how big were the six early turnovers,
coupled with Florida State 's 8 for 10 shooting?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I thought that was tough. The Virginia Tech game I thought we
turned it over something like 7 of the first 10 possessions, too, and kudos to
them they took advantage of those turnovers.  
  
Some of those I convenient yet. I have a hard time thinking we traveled four
times in the first three on four minutes of the game. Yeah, maybe our legs
were that heavy but that's a struggle for me as a coach when we haven't had
issues with traveling that much in the past.  
  
Again, you've got to give them credit. They knew we were a hot team and we
were dangerous and I thought they came out and were overly physical and
physically aggressive and ran us off of screens and bodied us up and that
might have caused some of that. It might have made us play faster. We were
trying to step to things a little bit more. It was disruptive and I think
that's probably their game plan, not to let us get any confidence because if
so they were going to have their hands full. We knew they had capable scorers
and capable shooters and our game plan is was not to sit back and let them
shoot the three. I think they did a good job of spreading the floor and
pushing it in transition against us and getting us back on our heels and they
had a couple that got by and you say we overrotated and I thought we got
hesitant about getting beat off the dribble and we allowed too many open wide
looks and they shared the ball really well. They ended up with, what, 18
assists? And they were making that one more pass, we would cover the first
pass and not able to get out to the second pass because we were worried about
the midline and doing some of those things and are we say step slow because of
it being the third day, it definitely -- it takes a lot of gas out of you when
you see them go up and every one of them go in, felt like 20 went in in the
first half.  
  
Q. You were a target of their defense today yet you responded with 18
points. Talk about the motivation this brings you as you get ready to go to
next year?  
IVANA RACA: I'm not going to talk about next year. I will talk about the
postseason. We have that now and we will focus to take the championship home.
Now for the three games, I took advantage what my defense gave. If they gave
me guard player I would post up and if there were post players I would just
attack off the three-point line.  
  
Q. Jen, obviously you 've won a couple games in the tournament, got to
500, do you feel like you've done enough to earn WNIT bid, and are you excited
about that opportunity?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: This group is super excited about it. We came into the season
seeking out a postseason bid and wanted that to be the NCAA bid when we
started conference when we did. But this group is hungry and they want to
prove how tough they are and what we can do. In the locker room I heard them
talking about that. We're not done yet. We get to play and we're at the mercy
of wait and see now. We do feel like we've done enough in this conference to
make this run late to make enough noise throughout the conference season and
some of our wins. Hopefully it will be enough to give us a shot because we
would like a chance to win a championship and it would be a big, big thing for
this program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Kiara Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33279)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 71, Syracuse - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have head Coach from Syracuse, Quentin Hillsman and Kiara
Lewis. Coach?  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously disappointed in the loss, for yesterday was a big
game for us. We knew we had to win the first one to get to the second one. We
had a great opportunity today to play against one of the best teams in the
country. The have a chance to do some big things and possibly win a National
Championship. Jeff has done a fantastic job with this basketball team. We knew
we had to play with tempo, play with some pace and try to make some shots and
when you shoot 17% in the first half it makes a difference. The second half we
didn't make a few shots. We were able to you know, speed the game up a little
bit and get some more possessions. Just a lot of credit has to go to
Louisville. They were fantastic today. We knew this game was going to be tough
for us coming off yesterday's game but I thought our kids came out and battled
as hard as they could I know I coached as hard as I could and the outcome is
what it is.  
  
I was really happy, Kiki has been playing forty minutes a game all season long
and to play against a tough team like that who is blitzing her on every ball
screen and hedging hard on her. She did a good job of keeping her composure
and to play against that style of defense and limit her turnovers, only two in
the game fantastic game by her so got to give her credit for keeping us in it.
We couldn't get the ball in the basket and you can't score in the 40s and 50s,
you gotta score in the 70s and 80s to beat Louisville. They are a special
team. Most of all I'm really proud of my team's fight.  
  
Q. With Emily who is the diagnose on her ankle and what did her playing
mean to the team?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: It's just a sprain but obviously less than 24 hours away
it's tough to rehab that. If we would not have played today and played
tomorrow she would have been a lot better, better shape on her ankle, but it's
just a sprain.  
  
She'll be fully recovered by the time we get back on the court but just a lot
of credit to her for just trying to play because she could have sat this one
out.  
  
Q. Coach, some of the things that you 'll say to the team after this
game, things that you will be looking forward to do the rest of the season,
next year?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: We just want to continue to play hard and play our way.
Obviously, you know, we should be playing in the NIT at least and I'm really
looking forward to continuing to play together and to grow.  
  
When you have Emily hurt and tonight with high man not playing that's another
guard in our rotation that's a big piece for us and that's tough playing
without high man and definitely without Emily, but it was about 14 minutes
left in the game, I said, hey, we only got 14 more minutes, we're not go to
shut this game down. So we had to finish the game hard. So we scrambled to
play hard and came out and just play the way we play.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a schedule that you put up as one of the hardest you
've had in a little while. There are still games to play but what about the
season down the stretch and your overall team fighting it out through the rest
of the year in?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: That's what it's about, just stay together and continue to
compete. Every game we play we're going to go out there and prepare to win the
game. We're excited for whatever games we have left, I know I am. Whatever
comes next we're going to go out there and play the way we play.  
  
Q. Coach, you were able to contain Dana Evans in the first two meetings
during the regular season. What challenges did she present today and what did
you see out of her?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: She shot the ball well, obviously. We came out and we were
trying to get our defense set and every time we were in the zone we would get
off her and she would shoot the three. She played fantastic today, gotta give
her credit for being tough and playing that way.  
  
Our goal was to go into that game and try to have Dana and Kiki kind of cancel
each other out and they did, 23 points for her and 18 for Kiki so that was a
tough battle. We just needed more scoring from other spots on the floor.  
  
Q. For Kiara, the second quarter seemed like it was a turning point,
what was Louisville doing in that quarter and where did you guys struggle?  
KIARA LEWIS: We just didn't make shots and like Coach said, you gotta make
outside shots and we just didn't do that.  
  
Q. Kiara, they kept you in front and forced you to take mid-range
jumpers, what did you see out of their defense?  
KIARA LEWIS: Like I just said, the paint was clogged up and that was part of
their game plan to enclosing the paint so I couldn't attack and they had one
of their longer posts on me.  
  
Q. Bunch of close losses throughout the season. When you think about the
season, from a birds-eye view what are flash points that you think of now that
we 're here?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, to be at this point of the season and have 16 wins I
thought that was a tough task for who we had scheduled. We had some really
good wins on the season.  
  
On any given night I think it's proven that we can beat anybody in our
conference at least and definitely play with anybody in the country. But
obviously when you are undermanned it's tough to sustain that for an entire
season when you have players like Kiki playing forty minutes a game every
night, and it's tough.  
  
I don't regret not one minute of this. Playing those games where you've got to
win by 60, 70 points ain't fun. They're not fun to coach. They ain't fun to
play, and I don't think you really learn a lot about your team in that
situation. So we scheduled that way so we could be tested. We gotta be ready
to compete because our goal was to win the National Championships, and you
can't win National Championships by not playing great competition.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Kierra Fletcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38918)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 57, Georgia Tech - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Georgia Tech head coach, Nell Fortner and
Kierra Fletcher. Coach?  
  
NELL FORTNER: I really thought we started off really well, and we defended
well, pretty well tonight for the most part, but we let 'em make that run in
the first half and then ended up tied. If we could have held on and gone into
the half well a little bit of a lead maybe you would have seen a different
story but I thought these kids played tough. NC State is a really good team.
They have five players on the floor that stretch you to that three-point line
so it makes it difficult to defend inside and cover everybody.  
  
But, man, this team played really hard. They fought to the end and I'm really
proud of 'em for that. I don't know what the future holds. Excited to find out
what that means in the next ten days, but I thought this team has handled
themselves very well, fought hard. I thought this one right here. Kierra had a
good second half. She was challenged at halftime and she met the challenge.
I'm really proud of her.  
  
Q. Nell, in the second half when they got ahead by 8 you guys pushed
back and tied it with six minutes left but couldn 't push back in front. Were
you tired or just be couldn't get the short or two you needed?  
NELL FORTNER: You don't want to make excuses for anything but we have played
with a short lineup all year long and, yeah, the kids get tired. Remember that
third quarter we didn't get that media timeout until about a minute 20. Both
teams were pretty gassed. I thought we really fought hard to get that game
tied back up again.  
  
But we probably spent a lot of energy doing that. But, again, you hold NC
State to 57 points, is that what it was? Yeah. I'm proud of that. That's a
really good offensive team. But we're a really good defensive team. If we
could have stopped their transition baskets, they got 16 in transition and
that was tough for us to overcome.  
  
Q. About the defense, they had three, three-pointers, against you guys
in the first game, what do you guys do to run them off the line?  
NELL FORTNER: It was a point of contention to keep us from getting really good
looks, our defense was pretty statute in that first half especially in the
first quarter it was nuts. Service awesome. So really proud of them for that.
That was a point of emphasis, hands up, make sure you close out with your
hands up and don't give 'em easy looks and for the most part I thought we did
that all night long.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you ladies.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Joanna Bernabei-
McNamee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35280)

### [Taylor Soule](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38928)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 84, Duke - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined first by Boston College head coach, Joanna
Bernabei-McNamee, and student-athlete, Taylor Soule. Coach?  
  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: My opening statement is what a game! Man, that was
fun! I loved the way every player on our team stepped up, especially the lady
next to me, Taylor Soule played like a pro and Marnelle Garraud handled the
pressure and ran the team like a good floor general. I loved the way our bench
had everybody's back and Emma Guy comes in and has a double-double. Georgia
scores her thousandth point on her first shot. Everybody was in sync and when
we got out of sync and Duke would make their runs we stuck together as a team.
I think that was a total team effort and I'm really proud of us.  
  
Q. In a game that was so back and forth, how did you guys maintain your
composure? At one minute Duke was leading and the next you guys made another
run.  
TAYLOR SOULE: Well, Coach tells us before the game naturally there are going
to be runs but it depends on who is willing to fight the hardest at the end of
the day so when Duke goes up, you have to understand that they're a great
basketball team but we have confidence in ourselves that we can go on runs
that are greater than that ask that's how the game turned out today.  
  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: Same, I think it's a matter of, you know, playing
tough and controlling the things that we can control which a lot of times are
rebounding and just having each other's back defensively.  
  
Q. I believe it was at one point you were 75% from three. Can you talk
about if that was part of your game plan heading into this contest?  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: I don't think that's every part of our game plan. If
we end up shooting well from the three-point line it's an added bonus.
Generally our game plan revolves around all the time working to get the breast
shot possible and making sure we take care of the boards and cover each
other's backs on defense.  
  
Q. Taylor, you came in with four fouls and your team on the ropes. You
scored 12 points. How were you able to basically carry your team to victory?  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: How were you able to do that?  
  
TAYLOR SOULE: Just my team they give me so much confidence and when I look
over and see everyone getting super hyped, it feels like we have so much
confidence in each other and knowing that we can do absolutely anything with
each other. Knowing I had four fouls, I can't foul out of games like this,
gotta be there for my coach and everybody and stepping up to the challenge,
and it was well worth it today.  
  
Q. You guys played yesterday and fatigue could have been a factor. Where
did you find the extra boost and energy to make that run late in the game?  
TAYLOR SOULE: Naps when you can get 'em, massages, but, no, just understanding
the importance of every possession, every game and as this team has matured,
understanding you're going to be tired, the other team is tired. But those are
all just excuses and at the end of the day we want to win a basketball game.
So yeah we had a basketball game yesterday but we also have one tomorrow so
just gotta fight.  
  
Q. You guys haven 't seen NC State since December. Seems like that was a
year ago. You guys lost.  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: It was last year.  
  
Q. Yeah! What if anything stood out to you from that game and what do
you have to correct tomorrow?  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: Well, you know, NC State is one of those teams where
they have a lot of players that can score and do dynamic things, so for us
it's going to be a matter of being under control and knowing our personnel and
how to guard them and often offensively it's going to be us pushing, even
though it's going to be our third game trying to push the tempo and trying to
play our pace, so it's like a tale of two teams when they play them and we
want to make sure we play our pace and that could be a challenge being our
third game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Lance White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35299)

### [Amber Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38876)

### [Davshanette Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38877)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 68, Pitt - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome Lance White as well as Davshanette Harris and
Amber Brown. Coach, when you're ready.  
  
LANCE WHITE: I was really pleased with, you know, our effort for a long period
of time. These kids, recruiting them and told them this year they're going to
have to make all the mistakes underneath the bright lights. For four freshmen,
junior college player, they have come in and done everything I've asked.  
  
They've -- step by step, by step, by growth, by all of those things that you
have to do to be able to be a good college player, and, again, to see these
last two games where so much of it we've talked about trust the process, and
then to be able to see us -- you never know when that -- some of those things
are going to come into play and you're going to see the end result of it.  
  
To see that their growth and their games have improved, it's really, as a
coach, rewarding to watch them do that.  
  
I'm excited that, again, they've laid the foundation of what we're going to be
in the future. Obviously we've gotta get some help. They've got to -- we need
a couple more classes to come alongside them and the energy and the
competitiveness that they have brought. I'm most excited that these freshmen
will become sophomores, and they quickly become juniors by the amount of
minutes and the games that they've had to play.  
  
We talked in the off-season that you don't know what you don't know. They've
had to learn a lot. Very, very quickly. Now on the ACC level they're able to
understand what I'm talking about and how hard and how fundamentally skilled
you have to be in order to be a great basketball team.  
  
So I'm ready, I'm anxious to get back to work with them and give them a little
bit of time and then get back in the gym and take that next step in our
program.  
  
Q. You were down 3 points going into the fourth quarter. What killed the
momentum?  
LANCE WHITE: You know, we made a couple of turnovers, and for us that hurts
us, obviously. The thing that Pan is able to do, obviously as a senior player
that knows how to get to the free throw line, knows how to score buckets and
all of that, and it's been our Achilles' heel all year, that things go wrong
and then we implode.  
  
So, again, you get it close, 3 points, and then now you've got to do those
same things over and over and over again. We struggled with that a little bit
and hopefully some maturity will play in, and we can get better skill
development and then be ready to play.  
  
Q. You said at the beginning of the season they were going to have to
learn a lot. Looking back over the whole season what do you think their
biggest area of improvement has been? Going forward what do you need to
improve more in?  
LANCE WHITE: Their biggest area of improvement has been mental toughness.
Again, we brought in seven new players, five of them freshmen, four of them
were able to compete.  
  
So you bring all of that that you don't really know what you have. Again,
watching Day those first couple of practices could go right extremely well,
couldn't go left very well. To watch her practice after practice work on that
skill, her ability to shoot the jumper consistently, and I think you saw today
at a very high level with defense trying to completely take her out of it, she
was able to score and shoot that consistently.  
  
And AB, same, not being able to shoot the jumper and today now being able to
see her abilities to do that; more so than anything is just their mental
toughness. You go from high school to college and you don't understand
possessions, you don't understand how, you know -- one thing is that you're
used to playing offensive and defense when it's convenient. Now you have to
play defense. You have to get through screens and just all of the mentality
and for us as we were losing.  
  
So then it's that confidence and all of those things, which this group stayed
with me throughout the entire season. For the year that we've had and the
number of losses and to keep them energized and focused on getting better
every day, that's their biggest thing that I'm most pleased with and proud of.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Fortner noted your ability to game plan and had positive
things to say about that. What was your game plan going into today 's game,
and maybe how was it different than yesterday's?  
LANCE WHITE: You know for us, having such young kids, we haven't been able to
scheme as much as we would probably like so we have had to keep things simple
and basic. But at the same time if you can do a couple of things really well,
and I thought for us the transition defensive part had to be a big key. We
couldn't give them easy buckets, so we tried to contain that as much as we
could and not let them get layups.  
  
I think we did a pretty good job of being able to do that. So playing off of
Fletcher and making her try to shoot outside shots and trying to get to Pan --
and obviously 26 points later we didn't quite get that done as much as we
needed to, but, again, it was trying to do that.  
  
Trying to rebound with them, I always felt if we could stay within five, we
could be in it, and they outrebounded us six. They outrebounded us by 20 last
time so this was a huge step forward.  
  
Q. For Day and AB. Yesterday you beat Notre Dame, historic win for the
program. Today you push probably a team that 's going to the NCAA Tournament
to the brink, going down into the fourth quarter. How do y'all feel? I know
this loss probably stings, but how do you feel about the future of this
program and being the core of what Coach is trying to build on?  
AMBER BROWN: We feel great about it. We are ready to attack the off-season.
Everybody is coming back except for Bug, and we've pretty much finished the
season without Bug, but I feel like we're stronger together. So moving on into
the off-season, just attack and skill development, as Coach said, and ready to
attack everybody else in the next season.  
  
DAVSHANETTE HARRIS: What AB said. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. I 'll give you another one, Day. This is your third game in a row
with 20 or more points. Can you talk about the progress that you've made as a
player this season and how strong you finished it?  
DAVSHANETTE HARRIS: The progress I've made this season? It's been tough, been
a tough road. Didn't start very well, but I knew that I needed to step up my
game a little bit, so in order to do that I needed my teammates to push me in
the right direction, and my coaches.  
  
I was pretty proud of the way that we came together these last couple of
games, and I can't wait for you guys to see what we got comin'.  
  
LANCE WHITE: And I think, you know, too, it's been -- I feel great with these
two. We talked when I first got the job we had to become more athletic, we had
to look like an ACC team, and we had to get competitors.  
  
Whenever I'm standing beside these two, and sitting beside them today; they
are both of those things. The competitiveness is something that's so hard to
tell. You watch them in AAU, and you watch them with their high school teams
but it's got to be something where you hate to lose.  
  
These two, and by their performance all year long and, again, we were
outmanned and don't have enough yet to be able to compete with everyone we
have to compete with, but their fight, game after game after game and getting
down and battling back, and that for me is where I feel great about where
we're going as a program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Appreciate you guys.

### [Jocelyn Willoughby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32640)

### [Dominique Toussaint](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36562)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 67, Virginia - 50.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start with Virginia. Now joined by head coach,
Tina Thompson, and players Dominique Toussaint, Jocelyn Willoughby and Lisa
Jablonowsk. Coach?  
  
TINA THOMPSON: Well, it's tough to lose like this, you know, especially with
the heartfelt season that we had. We just weren't ourselves and when you're in
the tournament, it's not the time to not be yourselves. You have to come in
kind of being your best selves and playing your best game, especially to have
to win night after night after night and we just weren't.  
  
We turned the ball over way too many times to be successful. Our effort was
there but just did not turn into the positive intentions that we were wanting
and hoping for.  
  
Q. Coach, that was basically anybody 's game going into the fourth
quarter and then the ball just wouldn't go in for y'all. Was that a matter of
their defense that they were putting on you?  
TINA THOMPSON: Well, I mean, they didn't do anything differently than they do
all year. They have a basic zone defense that they play and they tweak it
every now and then.  
  
We weren't on. We didn't make shots that we normally make, our decision making
was a little off. We were just a little different. I can't put a finger on
what it is right now, but you're right, going into the fourth quarter we
definitely had an opportunity to get back into the game and win and it just
didn't happen for us.  
  
Q. Coach, I believe you beat Syracuse by 17 in Charlottesville. What was
the difference in the two games or two teams?  
TINA THOMPSON: Well, for us, we were different just as far as our aggression.
We were very aggressive in transition as well as defensively. Our trapping, as
well as our doubling in the post. We were just kind of clicking on all
cylinders. We forced quite a bit of turnovers and were able to get in
transition. We ran on made baskets and that was our game plan today. We just
couldn't find a way to get to it.  
  
Q. Jocelyn, great career. Can you speak to the team and lessons learned
and moving forward?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: Yeah, I mean, this has been a decent season. We are young,
so we knew there were going to be some ups and downs, and right now looking
forward as Coach said to the team in the locker room, right now it's about
taking advantage of the opportunity that's before the younger players. We're
done, and it goes by just like that.  
  
So for the younger players, realizing that this season went by really quickly,
their second year. They've been second years in our minds for a little while,
but they're going to be taking on more responsibility. So the question for
them is what are they going to do with that? How are they going to work and
step into that role and just carry the team forward, the team and program
forward.  
  
I think that's where we are right now, knowing that we're young but just like
a lot of responsibility was put on us when we came in as first years, the same
kind of situation is happening again.  
  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: I think Jocelyn said it all. These underclassmen have a
lot of responsibility on their shoulders just like we did coming in and we
expect a lot of them because we know their potential and what they can do. So
it's up to them to take advantage of the opportunity and make sure they're
putting in the work to show what they can really do on the floor. Not even
just on the floor off court as well because UVA is an amazing academic school
as well, as you see Joc winning all these awards. I want them to take
advantage of the opportunity they're given and really shine for this program.  
  
Q. Jocelyn, can you talk about your recognition before the game? Will it
be easy to separate that from the game today?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: I'm sorry, can you give more clarity?  
  
Q. Talk about the ceremony before the game where you were recognized and
will you be able to put the game behind you and separate it from that award?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: Yeah, I mean, I'm very honored and thankful for the award.
I was notified yesterday so the ceremony piece be wasn't as much of a shock.
I'm definitely going to embrace that moment and the game I was expecting to
win, honestly. We go into any game look to go win and compete so that part is
a downer. Any game, any moment you take it for what it's worth. I think there
are things to learn and grow from and so even though we didn't have the
outcome that we wanted, there's still a lot to be learned from this
experience.  
  
It was the last game of my career, so I'm not going to dwell on it or be super
sad about it. I'm going to be thankful for the opportunity, because for some,
that last game comes sooner than expected. I was able to play in it healthy,
so I'm thankful for those little things and for the whole experience, the
ceremony before the game and the game itself.  
  
Q. Lisa, your teammates have touched on this, but is there some
satisfaction that you 're part of a class that laid the groundwork for what's
going to follow and do you feel like younger players are buying in as you led
this year with them?  
LISA JABLONOWSKI: I think it's always hard if you have such a big incoming
class and us as such a big class. We have been trying over the season to bring
them to the same level as we are at this point. It's definitely satisfying to
see how they have been growing from game to game to game over and we feel
comfortable giving the torch over to the younger players.  
  
Just at this point, all we can do is watch from the sideline and see our
fruits grow and hopefully they will have a successful season next year as
well.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Syracuse 's size. Obviously it didn't prevent you
from winning the earlier game, but how big of a factor was that today?  
TINA THOMPSON: Everybody is bigger than us, so we go into every single game
knowing that we're going to have mismatches, and it is what it is. We try to
keep the ball out of the post as much as possible and double team especially
when Lisa is in isolation. Tonight the double didn't come as frequently as it
needed to, they were strategic in taking Jocelyn away from the ball so that
she could actually be the double. Our weak side didn't come no matter how many
times we reminded them of that.  
  
Of course you would like to go back and change those moments but the reality
is we didn't and their size was a factor because they were able to play one-
on-one and put Lisa on an island, basically.  
  
Before we go I want to say how thankful that I am of these three and what
they've done for helping us build the foundation of this program.  
  
They were committed when I came in last year to the work that was necessary in
order for us to grow in a way to be successful going into their senior season.
It's tough that they didn't get the outcome that they wanted but the work that
they invested, their hearts into this program is definitely something and an
example that we're going to be able to build on. So I'm very thankful and
grateful for these three for investing into us the way they did. I appreciate
you guys and thanks.

### [Jennifer Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38824)

### [Ivana Raca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38826)

### [Gina Conti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36568)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 58, Virginia Tech -55  
  
THE MODERATOR: For Wake Forest, head coach, Jennifer Hoover, Ivana Raca and
Gina Conti, Coach?  
  
JENNIFER HOOVER: Super proud of this team for our fight and our grit. We knew
coming in we were going to face two really tough teams, but we're a tough
team, and we're tougher together.  
  
Today our challenge was to dig deeper, because we played yesterday and they
didn't. I have to give these kids credit. They played with a lot of fire. They
played with a little fight and they were really focused and had that was our
finish.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had multiple opportunities to succumb to the Virginia
Tech runs throughout the game. How do you explain the resilience of this team?
It looked like from my vantage point that you never blinked.  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I would go back to what I've said throughout the year, the
character of this team is above and beyond anything and I think when you hit
adversity and you hit runs like this team has learned that our character and
our fight and our desire to help each other out and play for each other and
they've got each other's back, just -- it was able to withstand it. I think
we're really confident. We know we've got a lot of different ways we can score
and I think we do a good job of giving up a good shot to get a great shot for
a teammate. I can't say enough about Maya Banks today. Her teammates believed
in her and got her the ball and she hasn't had a lot of opportunity but she
has been ready and waiting and she got it and she seized it in a key point for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about the way that Gina controlled the ball
at the end and then Ivana with huge shots in the fourth?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I thought these two all year have really done a great job of
kind of being our poise and both a little bit of fire and a little bit of ice
if you will at times and I thought Gina Conti controlled that game. When we
were at she controlled that game. She was a warrior on campus and today we
wore her out and we ran ball screen after ball screen and kept getting after
her to use it and she made plays downhill, including some buckets. The last
one was the toughest bucket of the day. Phenomenal job of moving the ball and
hunting Raca and we found her in open space and we hit the shots we had to get
and this team in the last couple of weeks has a lot of confidence in those
shots and confidence in getting them in positions where we know we can make
'em and we have been knocking' 'em down.  
  
Q. Jen, at your place when you lost to them last month they scored 73
points, shot over 50% from the field. What did you do better defensively
today?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: We really felt like at our place we let them establish Kitley
way early and that hurt us. I said then she is the Rookie of the Year in our
conference. They got Christina Morra in foul trouble early and I thought that
hurt us. I thought Maya Banks did a great job defensively. Taja Cole got out
in transition early at our place. Se had assists at our place again. I thought
she controlled that game a little bit today. I just thought today we didn't
allow am they to do that. We were on the help line, we were there when we
needed to be, we doubled early on Kitley. We attacked 'em downhill and I
thought we did a good job of at that being attacking in certain situations and
spacing the floor. And rebounding was huge for us. Alex Sharp's 7 offensive
rebound, that's what Alex does and when she is relentless on the boards she is
a handful.  
  
Q. For both of you, you get ready to play a third game tomorrow, is the
adrenaline so high you 're going to recover quickly or is it going to be a
test for you?  
GINA CONTI: I would say this is what makes it fun when you can play game to
game to game, our adrenaline is okay, and we're excited, who doesn't love to
play.  
  
IVANA RACA: Our passion is way bigger than our tiredness.  
  
JENNIFER HOOVER: There you go.  
  
Q. Gina this is the first Wake Forest team I can remember playing the
full season mostly healthy. How much of this --  
JENNIFER HOOVER: Knock on wood.  
  
Q. How much of this season has been about you guys learning how to win
and win consistently?  
GINA CONTI: I would think Jenna Rady or strength coach, the beginning of the
preseason, all of that, she kept us getting strong, if you have, and I think
that carried into preparation for conference play, preseason and now
postseason. I think that preparation from Jenna and individuals and stuff our
coaches put us through, so, yeah.  
  
Q. First quarter, making shots, what did you do better defensively in
terms of your three-point defense especially?  
IVANA RACA: We wanted them to run off the line so we wanted them to go for a
layup instead of the 3 because they're really good shooters and if they go to
the layup we can rotate and help.  
  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I thought early we dared Mabrey a little bit to shoot it and
give her credit she was taking a step and hitting her step-back and that's a
tough shot and she is a tough kid and a phenomenal shooter. But I challenged
them to take care of that and what Ivana is talking about, we can help you on
a drive but be can't nobody help you on a 3, you gotta defend that. So we got
locked in on that.  
  
I thought the first three or four minutes off of playing we had a great game
plan. They did a great job focusing in on it and obviously the fresher team is
going to come out and push you a little bit but I thought after that we
stepped up.  
  
Q. Jen, you 've got your record where you want it now. Does that free
you up tomorrow to kind of relax a little bit and play your game?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: Well, you know, these kids, they've been wanting postseason
play. A key was to get us two wins here so we could get above 500 again but
the one thing about this group I could say from every practice we've stepped
in is they're not satisfied. They've always wanted more, they're hungry,
they're in our offices nonstop. We have these brand new gorgeous buildings,
and I don't know if that's why they hangout in 'em and the fuel stations
underneath or if they want more. They're watching film, they're in the gym
shooting, and they're not satisfied. If I know these two and the rest of the
kids in the locker room, they're already thinking about what we need to do
better when we play Florida State.  
  
We played in two games against them this year, where we gave them a 20-point
lead and then we came back and it was a four point game. We were up the first
three-quarters of the most. The task at hand, this group will get off their
feet and rest and be ready to lock in and give it their all. This group has
given their all every time they step on the floor, and as a coach I couldn't
be more blessed to have these young ladies on the team and wearing a Wake
Forest uniform.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Amaya Finklea-Guity](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38856)

### [Gabrielle Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36615)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 67, Virginia - 50.  
  
Q. Coach, got the win early in the season without Elizabeth, now that
she is back in the lineup how does that change your game plan?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: She is a good player. We know that. I don't know how much it
changes our scout but we've got to play with great effort and energy. Jeff
does a good job with them and they play free and they play in space and they
play with great poise and tempo. So we've got to be able to get back on
defense, get our defense set and keep them out of the paint. Obviously this is
a very good basketball team and they're a top-5 team in the country and they
got a good chance to win a National Championship. So we were fortunate to get
past that game and be able to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. For both of the players, you had a good run last year, this is your
third and fourth years playing in the tournament. Do you feel like you play
well here? Comfortable with the court here?  
GABRIELLE COOPER: Yeah, I like playing here. I like the environment. I like
court. I like the balls. I love playing here. It's a fun time of the season,
we can see everybody, you see all the stands, you see all the kids in the
stands when they bring the schools out, it's fun to play here.  
  
AMAYA FINKLEA-GUITY: Exactly, the environment is fun here. I do like playing
here, too.  
  
Q. Coach, one of the keys tonight turnovers for y 'all. I think you
forced them into 25 turnovers. What were y'all doing?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: We controlled tempo with our press mostly, a lot of
turnovers were on the back end, cross half court and tried to get them into
offense. We had them off balance. They didn't have the ball in their point
guard's hands but they attacked when they crossed half court, so they had a
hard time get to go their stuff and I thought that was the key, we got the
ball in the hands of the people that we wanted to handle it.  
  
Q. It 's very obvious that Virginia shooting 6% in the fourth quarter,
was that something you did in terms of coaching to go to the next level? Or
just Virginia, the pressure eventually wearing them down?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think that when we got up, and we got them to take quick
shots and they didn't have a lot of flow or balance as well. Obviously when
you're taking shots and you're breaking your offense, a lot of times they're
not going to be great shots. I thought they took quick shots when they maybe
could have moved the ball a little bit, but I understand when you're fighting
a depth of 12, 14 points you try to save possessions so I think they tried to
speed the game up by taking quick shots and I thought it played against them
tonight.  
  
Q. I want to talk about your size advantage. You had 10 blocked shots.
Did you feel that was a factor?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Our goal was to take zero block shots. We said we were going
to take charges all night, so thanks for telling me that, we should have had
zero blocked shots. When you can keep ten shots from getting on the back of
the rim obviously that's a big advantage, but our goal was to not let will Bea
turn the corner. We wanted to build a wall and stand in front of her and our
players did a really good job of both and we kept them in front of us and the
10 blocked shots. At least it wasn't 10 blocked fouls, so I guess I gotta take
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Francesca Pan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34683)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 68, Pitt - 58  
  
Q. Francesca, were you playing with an urgency because of what she just
said? Talk about that?  
FRANCESCA PAN: This is my last ACC Tournament. I didn't want to go home. I
wanted to win tonight. I gave everything I had for my team, and I'm just happy
we won this game.  
  
Q. For both of you, 20 points on turnovers this game. What was the key,
or what was the game plan going into this game to put that pressure on for
those turnovers?  
NELL FORTNER: I would have liked 40 points off those turnovers, but we knew
Pitt averaged 18 turnovers a game so we wanted to put them in stressful
situations and help them with that, help turn the ball over. I thought we did
that. I thought we came out really aggressive and tough, but then they
adjusted and we had to get out of that and create some turnovers the other
way, and I thought our hustle, our defense, our hands were active.  
  
We got a lot of loose balls going, and toward the end of the game I think our
will kicked in. But we've been a good defensive team all year long; we can do
a lot of different things to you. I thought that kicked in at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, on paper, and if you 're looking out on the court, you can see
that there was a big size advantage that y'all had. Was there, I guess, a
conscious effort to attack the basket knowing that you had that?  
NELL FORTNER: Well, it wasn't really about the size advantage, because I felt
like we could have scored more maybe inside. I give a lot of credit to Lance.
I think he's an excellent coach. He game planned well. I thought what he did
was tough for us to get the ball on the block, and he's got some little
freshmen, dang, they're going to be good in the coming years. But they came
well together as a team.  
  
I thought they guarded us very well, they defended us well and didn't allow us
to just throw the ball inside. I thought their game plan was good in that
regard.  
  
Q. Francesca, moving forward what is your advice to the under classmen
as the lone senior, as Coach said, moving through the tournament?  
FRANCESCA PAN: We always want to play hard and play smart and be tough, no
matter what, tough situation. We have to keep playing hard, keep fighting and
keep being together. We can't fall apart. If we are in tough situations we
still have to be together and just fight.  
  
Q. For both of you. NC State, you had some success with them fairly
recently. What do you need to do well again and what do you expect them to try
to do different when you see them tomorrow?  
NELL FORTNER: We need to do the exact same thing we did the first time and
hope they do the exact same thing. That's a really good team. That's a really
good team. This one right here had the tremendous game, so we're expecting
that again, Pan. No pressure. They've got size, they've got shooters, they've
got every piece of the puzzle. We're going to have to be sharp in what we're
doing defensively and offensively. We're going to have to execute well on the
offensive end, because they'll "D" up pretty good, also. We're looking forward
to it.  
  
FRANCESCA PAN: I think she said everything. We just have to play like the last
game, be focused on the game plan and execute.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks to both of you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 85, Clemson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce Clemson head coach, Amanda
Butler. Coach?  
  
AMANDA BUTLER: Yeah, just got beat by a really good team. They're having an
outstanding season. We knew this was going to be a battle of not just skill
but will and that is a great credit to the way I regard both teams. Joanna has
done a tremendous job. They definitely earned the right to advance. It's
always disappointing when you love a group so much like we do, team 45 to see
it come to an end but a lot of things especially down the stretch to build on
and to push our seniors into, you know, the next phase of their life feeling
good about themselves.  
  
Q. You played a lot of people and you kept coming at them, even when it
looked like they were about to pull away you would always answer. Playing two
nights in a row did it catch up with the team or was it Boston College 's
resolve?  
AMANDA BUTLER: I didn't feel like fatigue was that much of a factor. Obviously
we try to keep the right people on the floor that match the moment and give us
the best chance each moment and coach moment by moment and do a really good
job with that. It was hard for us to get some of our players that we depend on
offense civil, to get them going. Again, you have to credit Boston College for
that.  
  
I think they just played better than us in the right spots. We played better
than them in some spots but they played better than us in more spots.  
  
Thanks, Coach.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Kenny Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30712)

### [Elizabeth Kitley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38847)

### [Dara Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38848)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 58, Virginia Tech -55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Virginia Tech. We have Kenny Brooks, Elizabeth
Kitley and Dara Mabrey. Coach?  
  
KENNY BROOKS: Obviously we're disappointed. We felt like we had a really good
situation with our team, and we were going to go out and compete for an ACC
Championship. But what you have to understand is this time of the year you
gotta perform, you have to execute. Games are going to be a little bit
different. They're going to be more grinded out. I thought we didn't play well
today at all. We never really got in sync. Foul trouble early in the first
half kind of limited us to try to get into a flow, and so we had to continue
playing that way. I give credit to Wake Forest. I thought they did a good job
of taking us out of things that we wanted to run, the way we wanted to run
'em. We didn't come out and play as well as we felt like we could have or need
to do play.  
  
Q. Players, your best ACC record ever, how stunning or aggravating is it
to come here and have to go home after one game?  
DARA MABREY: I would say it's pretty aggravating, but at the end of the day we
can't take anything away that this group has done this year with our record
and everything that we accomplished.  
  
ELIZABETH KITLEY: I mean, it's frustrating because we know how good we are
when we play well together but that's something we struggled with all year. We
don't all play well together at the same time and that's what you need in
March and we didn't do that today.  
  
Q. Some of the things you talked to the team about after this one,
Coach, takeaways?  
KENNY BROOKS: Obviously there is a lot of emotion going on right now but I did
tell them to reflect back on the year and don't allow one performance to
dictate how you feel about your year. It was a really good year. We had a lot
of fun, we did a lot of wonderful things together.  
  
This group, this team has laid down a foundation for years to come, in my
opinion, as far as where we want to be and how we want to be recognized.  
  
So it was really good. It was really good. I'm very excited for the future of
this program, and I think this particular group has laid down that foundation.  
  
Q. For either of you, what did Wake Forest do defensively that made it
such a difficult day shooting and handling the ball?  
DARA MABREY: I wouldn't say necessarily like, yeah, give credit to Wake
Forest, they played a really good game. But I think we're such a strong
offensive team if anyone went wrong it was probably us. We needed to adjust
and I would say we needed to not find a rhythm and we never really did.  
  
Q. When you beat 'em at their place last month you scored 73 points and
shot better than 50% from the field. What were you doing bettered last time
than today?  
KENNY BROOKS: I thought we had a better rhythm. We got taken out of the rhythm
early, Liz got her second foul with 7 minutes to go in the half, we had to
take her out for the remainder of the half and we just never -- Aisha Sheppard
got a second foul in the second quarter as well so we finished that quarter,
we were trying to have makeshift line-ups, line-ups we've never practiced
before. Dara had to play extensive minutes, probably took a toll on her a
little bit. We just never got into rhythm.  
  
We're a team that needs to play with balance and we went 4 for 15 from the
three and all four threes came from Dara. We needed more production from other
areas in order for us to be a good team. As Liz mentioned, we're a really good
team and we're really, really good when we have everyone stepping up and
producing at the same time because then it's hard to focus on one area. Liz
was dealing with double teams a lot today and they probably felt a little more
comfortable in doing so because we didn't have our outside shot flowing.  
  
Q. You guys had 16 turnovers, did you feel like they were under
characteristic turnovers or turnovers that Wake Forest gave you because of
defensive?  
ELIZABETH KITLEY: Personally I had five so that was not handling the double
teams well enough. You can give credit to their defensive but I didn't handle
that how I should have. We know how to do that, but we didn't -- or I didn't
execute that at all.  
  
Q. Dara, obviously you 're making the threes in the first quarter there,
what were they doing differently defensively the rest of the game because
obviously we're they were trying to stop you from that point?  
DARA MABREY: I think I got open ones but didn't knock 'em down. Just have to
adjust. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Did you find them defensively doing anything better first half
compared to second half?  
KENNY BROOKS: Again, the game was stagnant for us. As I was looking at my play
sheet, it's kind of -- I just felt like I didn't have all my options and we
were trying to force feed it inside. They did a good job of doubling on Liz,
we did a poor job of capitalizing on it and flashing to high post so we could
relieve their pressure. We were doing it as an after-thought and I thought we
took some bad angles trying to throw the ball inside which takes us back to we
were turning the ball over. We don't make those mistakes against ourselves,
Wake Forest did a good job of -- and they're long. That's one of the things
that provided problems for us all night long is they're so long that they send
Sharp in to rebound on the backside when we try to go zone and she is really a
post player and getting offensive rebounds. They said they only had 15 but it
felt like 35. They came up with key plays throughout the game. Banks came in
and I don't know she played -- I think she played a little bit yesterday, but
she made big shots. Conti hit a couple of runners that we had people hanging
all over and they kept us at bay down the stretch. We just never could really
recover. We didn't feel like ourselves especially that second quarter when we
lost Liz and she went out and we weren't able to capitalize on anything.  
  
Q. Kenny, Aisha went 1-9, was it a product of not feeling herself? What
was your message to her about getting her confidence back up?  
KENNY BROOKS: You know, I wish I knew. I don't know. The game happened so
fast, you encourage and we needed her. We needed her. My postgame message
wasn't anything to her. It was directed totally to the team.  
  
We win as a team. We lose as a team. Everyone has to step up and produce. It
was mainly toward them and really, you know, talking about what we've
accomplished so far.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys have another tournament yet to come. I 'm not sure
how this might affect seeding, but you've lost 3 of your last 4, what about
the mindset to get you back to playing the want you want to going into the
next?  
KENNY BROOKS: Honestly we need a break. These kids are, obviously they're
student-athletes first, and I think Liz had two or three tests on Tuesday
right before we left and everybody is kind of fried a bit. They have one more
day of class tomorrow and they'll get back and then they have a couple days
off.  
  
I think we're an NCAA team, but I think the part that excites me the most is
that it's going to be fresh, because we're going to play against people we
haven't seen for the last two and a half months.  
  
I love the ACC, but I'm sick and tired of it right now, because it's a good
league and every night it presents a challenge. You look at Wake Forest,
they're long, they have tremendous players in Raca. Their kids are good. For
me, and I think I can probably speak for them, it's going to be refreshing to
see people we haven't seen before and to be able to go out after a break and
recharge our batteries a little bit. It's a long grind. It's a long season.  
  
I was talking to, I can't remember which coach it was, we had a head coaches
meeting and I was talking to the baseball coach and the soccer coach and they
said your season is so long and I said amen, we've been going since July. I
think this break is going to be really good for them.  
  
The three out of the four that we lost, they were good teams who had good
performances. UVA had a good performance against us, the two kids played ought
out of their minds. This was a good performance by Wake Forest, take nothing
away from them, they're good teams. We're looking forward to recharging and
seeing some new people.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Joanna Bernabei-
McNamee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35280)

### [Marnelle Garraud](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38890)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 85, Clemson - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce Boston College head coach Joanna
Bernabei-McNamee as well as student-athlete, Marnelle Garraud. Coach?  
  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: What a game! I thought that was pretty intense going
back and forth. I thought as the game went we really took better control of
the boards, where it was even at halftime I think we ended up plus six. I
loved our composure as the game went on, both knocking down our free throws
and handling the press and handling the traps and Marnelle was a big reason we
were able to handle that, only having one turnover with all that heat.  
  
I loved the way that we shared the ball on offense. I'm really proud of our
team and I hope that we continue with confidence going into tomorrow.  
  
Q. They made several runs and you seemed to stand firm every time they
did and answered them. One stretch particularly there in the fourth quarter,
Marnelle, I think you hit the big 3 and Georgia followed with a jumper. Could
you talk about that? Did you think it was the knock out punch so to speak?  
MARNELLE GARRAUD: Our coaches told us, stay calm, they go on their runs and we
have our runs. So we stayed poised and calm while they were on their runs and
we kept doing our offense. I think that's why we got good shots is because we
got what we know we can get on a normal basis.  
  
Q. Been a long time since you 've seen Duke, but talk about what you
need to do tomorrow night in that game.  
JOANNA BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: It's been a really long time since we've seen them. I
think both teams have greatly improved since our first interaction with each
other. I think we have to not handle their zone, so not probably a better game
for us to prepare for Duke's zone than going up against Clemson's zone.  
  
We will see their match-up zone quite a bit but defensively we have to be on
point and playing together 5 as 1 because we're going to need the backside
help and they outsize us in some positions and we're going to need that help
and Haley Gorecki is an unbelievable scorer so we're going to have to be on
lockdown mode with her, but I think it will be a really nice battle with her
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, we will see you tomorrow.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Lance White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35299)

### [Ismini Prapa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38834)

### [Dayshanette Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38835)

### [Gabbie Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38836)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Pittsburgh - 67, Notre Dame - 65  
  
LANCE WHITE: This is the result of their hard work and that growth, and so
whenever they are finally able to see it and get to experience it, I'm pleased
and excited for them to have that opportunity. These kids made plays today and
especially when you get to play against Notre Dame, at Florida State and here
they've been the pinnacle of what we all wanted to be for this whole time.
It's a huge win for our program, getting to play in March and we get to
survive and play another day. I'm excited about that.  
  
Q. Coach, all of the sudden boom, you were there, talk about that.  
LANCE WHITE: I thought what Ismini brought to us in the first half, because we
were a little shaky at te beginning of the game. We went over to the practice
facility to practice and all of the sudden I thought our kids don't even know
this is the practice gym. They think this is where we're going to play
tomorrow.  
  
Whenever you start those new kids that have never been in this building and we
were a little shaky and Ismini came in and provided us with a huge boost in
the first half and calmed us down and made some big shots. The way she guarded
13 on Notre Dame's team and did a great job of helping and playing off of her
and allowing us to get back in the game and been able to take that lead at
half and all of that stuff that really helped us give us the confidence we
needed down the stretch. She was huge throughout the game. Wanted her there
toward the end, it would have helped us a little bit, we made it closer than
we needed to but I was really pleased with her effort today.  
  
Q. Dayshanette, can you walk us through that last possession where they
trap you on the wing and somehow you worked your way out of it?  
DAYSHANETTE HARRIS: Coach set up a play and he told me if I don't see
anything, stay calm and do what I do and with my teammates clearing out for me
I was able to get to the bucket and got a God blessed bucket.  
  
Q. For any of you, you had success against Georgia Tech during the
regular season. Talk about that game for those of us who didn 't see it and
what do you have to do well tomorrow?  
GABBIE GREEN: The Georgia Tech game? I don't remember any of it.  
  
LANCE WHITE: We will go back and think about Georgia. Great team they hurt us
on the inside whenever they played us before and, again, they have length and
that's going to be the thing that we have to be able to do. They outrebounded
us and that's something that we're going to have to concentrate on to make
sure to handle that. Again, we will go back now and get ready for them and
take that one tonight.  
  
Q. Two points, 7 to go you come out of the timeout and you steal the
ball from Notre Dame. Was that something you drew up or in the huddle or a
spur of the moment play?  
LANCE WHITE: Again I always believed players make plays. I can get them in
spacing and do that stuff and they made two great plays, she saw openings I'm
going to try to put 'em in position.  
  
Again, it still comes down to this time of year in March big-time players make
big-time plays and I thought she made two huge plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. Ismini, you were 4 for 4 from 3 in the first half. What was it like
for that momentum going in the first half?  
ISMINI PRAPA: I have been working for it, my teammates found me so I knew I
had to step up.  
  
Q. For any of the players it 's been a hard, tough season, a lot of
losses, hard work. Is this validation? Does it feel good, I guess, to have a
win to sort of signify everything you've been working toward?  
GABBIE GREEN: I say yes because throughout these games we've lost a lot of
games and talking outside of the locker room and in the gym and trusting the
process and trusting each other and today we did that in the huddles, and
outside of the huddle we had to lift each other up and it just showed today.  
  
Q. Dayshanette, this was a double-double for you, is this the biggest
game you 've every played?  
DAYSHANETTE HARRIS: Make it to the National Championship, that will be the
biggest game.  
  
LANCE WHITE: As to date, yes.  
  
Q. Coach, there was, I heard that Lorri Johnson passed away and I don 't
know if you or the players had any relationship with them but to have that
earlier and to have this big win probably an emotional day for the program as
a whole?  
LANCE WHITE: Absolutely. Lorri is the all-time leading scorer, men or women at
Pitt. For somebody that -- she was the first women's basketball jersey to ever
be retired and that's really important. It's really important for our present
players, for our future players to have somebody that they can look up to, up
in the rafters and that's where I want my jersey to be hung. Her legacy will
always live on. We send all of our condolences to her and her family. From a
small town outside of Pittsburgh. The things she was able to do is phenomenal
but that legacy and being able to do those things once I got to Pitt our
administration said that's something that's really important to hear is that
we have to get a women's basketball jersey retired because they deserve it and
her points speak for themselves.  
  
Now we have that up in the rafters to always look up to and she'll always be a
part of Pitt women's basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Congratulations.

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

### [Endia Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37056)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 68, Miami - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Miami head Coach Katie Meier as well as Endia Banks
and Beatrice Mompremier. Coach?  
  
KATIE MEIER: Well, gosh, you gotta give hats off to Clemson. That was -- they
haven't had that much -- their percentages were incredible. Kobi was really
special. They have some three-point shooting but the timely threes they got
from people other than Kendall Spray was crushing and then Kobi in her
isolation moments, we put about everybody we had on her and she still was
hitting big shots at big moments. When we took the lead I thought Clemson's
response back was great. They had gone cold to start the second half and
that's about as cold as we have been all year. We have struggled this year at
times but the three-ball has been our friend in February and we were shooting
at a high clip, 13 a game, 13 a game, 10 a game and our shooters were getting
them and they weren't going in. I did not think if we outrebounded Clemson and
we had 8 steals and forced the turnover 18 times, that formula is a win for
Miami normally so then you gotta look at something else because it wasn't for
lack of effort from my team at all. It wasn't for lack of execution. We got
the shots we wanted, we put quite a few up. It's a matter of, we do rely on
Kelsey Marshall hitting big shots and Mykea Gray hitting good shots and 2 for
16 is a bad formula for Miami so you have to look at the percentages and
realize they did a nice job of forcing us to miss shots and we didn't do a
good enough job of forcing them to miss theirs. I never blame it on anything
but that, you know, you gotta give the defensive some credit.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a team that you beat twice in the regular season?  
KATIE MEIER: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. What happened this evening as far as the way that they were holding y
'all away from the three-point line?  
KATIE MEIER: Right, well, it's crazy because obviously we were open from the
three because of Beatrice's performance and I do want to make a comment about
Beatrice. I believe she had 15 of our 22 or 23 in the second half, and Bea
didn't have to come back and play. She has a bright future and a lot of
basketball ahead of her and she was dealing with an incredible injury. You
know they were doubling her, she drew how many fouls? I want to say 11. So the
paint was pretty clogged, the three was open, we had to have hit it to win. It
was just a matter of us, you know, just not being in the same rhythm, maybe,
you know I don't know. I'll take my team's effort, there have been times this
year where I didn't think we were focused and played as hard as we needed to
play or together. I think that was just a great basketball game and, you know,
we shared the ball and we would have had some pretty special moments and I
kept saying we're about to catch fire guys, keep fighting, keep fighting, keep
fighting and we just never caught fire in that second half.  
  
Q. Beatrice, to follow up on Coach, certainly leaving it all out on the
court and playing a great game, what has been the highlight during your career
playing ACC and Miami basketball?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: My highlight would be just coming out here and playing
with my team, giving our best effort and winning some games.  
  
Q. Beatrice one more question, Coach mentioned you didn 't have to come
back, you did, the last four games you played like yourself, you averaged 19 a
game. Talk about the last stretches and what it's meant to you to get back on
the floor and play?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: It meant everything to me, coming back out here with my
team. I don't know, I really don't know what to say. I just wanted to be out
there with my team so that's pretty much what really brought me back.

### [Katlyn Gilbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38833)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Pittsburgh - 67, Notre Dame - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Notre Dame Muffet McGraw and Katlyn Gilbert.
Coach?  
  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Just another disappointing game in a very disappointing season.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the last play offensively what you were looking for
and what happened there?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, we make a pass into the wing and we didn't meet the ball.
They stepped in and stole it.  
  
Q. Katlyn, you had the big steal there and the layup and things have
been breaking your way for the last few weeks, won three in a row. Did you
feel like you could keep it going, was that the momentum you needed at the
time?  
KATLYN GILBERT: At the time I wasn't thinking too much about it I was doing
whatever I needed to do to help my team win.  
  
Q. Not the outcome you guys were looking for this season and in the
tournament but where do you go and where are you looking moving forward?  
KATLYN GILBERT: We have to use this year as a learning lesson, do whatever we
need to do to not get back to this year. We have some bright futures ahead of
us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Jennifer Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38824)

### [Alex Sharp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34686)

### [Ivana Raca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38826)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 83, UNC - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to today's postgame press conference. We will with go
ahead and get started. We have Wake Forest, transcripts will be available upon
completion of today's press conference from ASAP Sports and we will be sure to
have those on our app and website.  
  
JENNIFER HOOVER: First of all, go Dukes. I couldn't be more proud of this team
where we had our warrior spirit all year in a game where we knew it was going
to be a touch match-up. We had a close game a couple weeks ago against them at
our home. We just had different players step up at different times and it was
a total team effort and one of our big emphasis coming in was you gotta defend
and rebound if you want to move on in March and in postseason and when I look
down and see we beat them on the boards 47-22, they took it to heart and so
proud of our kids.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Christina Morra and Ivana Raca.  
  
Q. With a week between games basically how important was it for you to
come out and not have any rust and look like it didn 't take long for you to
get going?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: Praise God we finally got a break and had a bye. It was our
first weekend off since before Christmas, so the kids, we gave them off Friday
and Saturday and when they came back on Sunday they had a refreshed and
renewed spirit and energy that we were excite about and I know they felt it as
well and just felt really ready to go.  
  
It's an advantage not having a bye until now but it was a disadvantage back in
the first week of February when we were in the grind.  
  
I thought we had a good practice on Sunday, got after it a little bit on
Sunday and less on Monday and even less yesterday and prepped to be ready to
go today and give our kids the credit they go out and make the shots and
defend and I thought we came out with a real focus and fight about us.  
  
Q. Coach, you end this third quarter on a 6-0 run and then you go on an
18-3 run to start the fourth. What were you seeing on them that allowed you
all to score so quickly and fast on them?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: I think we saw some opportunities where they started to trap
our point guard and give Gina Conti a lot of credit because I thought she made
some great passes out of traps that led to a lot of buckets for us and you
look at Gina's line and she not only has one assist but I think they had a lot
of passes to the person who then made the assist because that's the way it's
built coming out of the traps. I thought we got into a groove and put the
peddle down and that was key for us.  
  
Q. Ivana, tied career high out there today and did you get frustrated
with slaps in the game?  
IVANA RACA: I have to give credit to my teammates. They were fighting me
really well under the basket, and I have so much that I took advantage of.  
  
Q. Alex, I think you hit a shot on the second or third possession of the
game and then you didn 't make a shot until it was like 50 to 50 something.
What got you going there? What clicked at the end?  
ALEX SHARP: I think my mentality was just keep shooting it. This is my senior
year so I wanted to go into this game saying play every game like it's your
last. So I wasn't going to second-guess my shot at all, I was just going to
put it up.  
  
Q. Jen, you talk about the rebounds, but if you look at points in the
paint and second-chance buckets you guys dominated inside. Knowing that they
weren 't at full strength there in the paint was there an emphasis to attack
the basket?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: We felt like we had to win the battle of the paint and
control the third of the court and we knew Bailey was going to be back and we
prepared all week as if she would be back and she is a great player so we
thought that would present some opportunities for us and we thought it would
present some match-ups for them in having to guard Ivana we which is s tough
match-up for some guards. So we did work to get the ball inside and give Ivana
and Christina credit for being able to finish when we got it inside and when
you get two kids that got double-doubles and are playing as hard as they play
for as long as we gave them out there. I don't think Ivana got a break today
and I might have given Sharp a half minute which is too much usually. But we
kept talking in timeout about defending and rebounding. We have to defend and
we have to limit it to one shot and done. So I think we did a great job of
that.  
  
Q. Jen, I know it 's tournament time and it's survive and advance but do
you go into tomorrow looking at a must win to play in a postseason
tournament?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: We started talking about that two weeks ago before our last
three games and what our scenario was to be eligible for the NIT and we said
we didn't want to talk about the NIT yet we could work and once you win one
game it's what can you do in the next game. It's a quick turn-around and we
will play a team that presents a lot of challenges for us, but we will get a
lot of rest today and we will turn it around and give them a shot tomorrow.
It's another team that we played recently so it's not a ton of -- this time of
year everybody knows what everybody does and what everybody runs and it's a
matter of who can execute it on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, this was a close game at halftime, 37-35, UNC. What was the
message to the squad in the locker room to get them to come out?  
JENNIFER HOOVER: The message was to defend and be background, still. We talked
about that and we were up on the boards at that point and we talked about that
was going to be the difference maker because if we could background we could
get out in transition a bit and get some be points on the board and get them
to believe in themselves and play confidently. They did a great job with that
moving the ball around and sharing the ball. I think when we have 14 turnovers
and a few of them were late-game situations we got a lot of shots up. When we
played them before I think they shot 80 shots and we only got in the 60s. Our
goal today was to make sure we had great shots and in that span coming out of
halftime we locked in and focused and got some great stops. We try to get
turkeys, three stops in a row, we continued to report those to them. Coming
out of a timeout we needed one more stop to get it and they came out and got
fired up about it and got that stop and it fueled us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Kobi Thornton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38841)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 68, Miami - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We have to my far left, head coach, Amanda Butler. Coach,
when you are ready?  
  
AMANDA BUTLER: First of all, we competed really, really hard because we knew
we had to because we have so much respect for Miami. That program and the
position they can put you in on both ends of the court. You know, just a
really good ball team with some outstanding players.  
  
I think our effort and Kobi's response is 100% about us and who we want to be,
but at the same time we knew we were going to have to play our guts out to
compete better with them than we had earlier in the year.  
  
Really, really proud of the team effort, no matter how adversity kept
presenting itself but super proud of Kobi Thornton playing like a senior with
that urgency and confidence and aggressiveness that I felt like only seniors
can bring and she led us and we followed.  
  
Q. Coach, Miami came back and took a lead on you in the third quarter
and all of the sudden you turned loose a run that put them away to end the
third quarter. What did you see that caused y 'all to be able to do that?  
AMANDA BUTLER: I thought we had a great deal of composure with our guards and
that's something we have struggled with a lot this year and our goal all along
this year has been the same, we want to be better and better each day and I
think you see the accumulation of a lot of improvement of our primary ball be
handlers, doing their job, making their teammates feel confident, getting the
ball across half court against the press and our team taking advantage of
whatever was there.  
  
Q. Coach, two years in a row now you have come in and won at least one
game in the tournament and I think that is the first time it 's been done at
Clemson since 2008-2009. How difficult is it to win games here?  
AMANDA BUTLER: This is the best tournament in the country. To be able to come
in here and be successful regardless of what day you're playing o what team
you're playing against, is a big accomplishment for just about any team in
this league. We all have so much respect for one another. For our program and
where we are trying to take steps toward it's a huge demonstration of
improvement which is really important for team 45 as I already mentioned but
also for where our program is headed and I also think it's a big part of our
seniors legacy to be able to come in here two years in a row and compete the
way they have and bring their best when their best was required.  
  
Q. Kobi, 27 points tonight you shot 75% from the floor. How much fun was
this one?  
KOBI THORNTON: This win was very fun, you know, coming into this tournament we
had 0 on 0 mindset and we were hungry, we were starving, we wanted to win and
we'll do whatever it takes to win.  
  
Q. Kobi, leading a majority of the game and up by 15 at one point, what
are you telling your teammates to keep them pushing and not let up and let
Miami in the game?  
KOBI THORNTON: Well, in that moment came in the game I'm just telling them, we
worked too hard for this, don't let up, we worked too hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will see you guys tomorrow.

### [Taylor Koenen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32634)

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 83, UNC - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by North Carolina, Taylor and Shayla. Coach if
you could start us off.  
  
COURTNEY BANGHART: First of all, I want to thank the Greensboro people across
the board. This event is totally first class. It fun for me as a first-timer.
A lot of people have been at this tournament a lot so you're looking at it
from fresh eyes and it's a first-class operation with a lot of people that
care about basketball both in the stands and in the hallways, and what pride I
have to represent North Carolina in an event like this that loves basketball.
My goal will be to get here later next year and stay longer but for the day I
was here it was impressive. Hats off to Wake Forest. Raca, what did they get?
27-13. She was just a warrior tonight in all forty minutes. She gave us a real
fit and I also want to give a real shout out to our group because they just
kept battling. I told them in the locker room after the game I thanked them
for trusting me and giving me what they got and they are the first class that
will start this new North Carolina basketball tradition.  
  
Q. For the players, was this like the season where it was promising for
so long and got away from you?  
TAYLOR KOENEN: I mean, we just went out there and we wanted to fight. I'm
proud of our fight and obviously it didn't end the way we wanted it to but I
like our fight. We didn't give up. We tried to play as fast as, get some
steels and get up under them and I guess we just wish it would have been a
different outcome.  
  
SHAYLA BENNETT: I think the difference was our three-point percentage. It went
down and like Coach said hats off to Raca, she gave us trouble in the first
half and second half. But like Taylor, I'm proud of our fight. We never gave
up and the seniors and the freshmen we never gave up and we played through all
forty minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, this was a 1-point game in your favor, 1:25 left in the third.
What did they do in the fourth quarter that allowed them to take the lead and
continue on?  
COURTNEY BANGHART: It was a key possession late in the clock they got out of
our trap and threw it to Sharp, I'm sorry to Raca, which is not her skill set.
She is basically below 30 percent, 3-point shooter in conference. A total
bummer there. Our margin of error isn't very big, right? We know that. There
is not a lot of -- as the game wears on you're at 1:36 of full court with
Taylor and Shay and Dino and a lot of our guys so we know the margin of error
gets smaller as the game wears on. You need to hopefully make shots and use
the energy it takes. They spread us out and made shots and they scored 32 in
second-chance points, 20 offensive rebounds, last game we held them to 7. It's
a good rebounding team. We have struggled all year to understand the
importance of a blockout. We're second to last in the conference if that area
and, again today. It's an area that we're going to have to put our hard hats
on this summer and make sure our kids understand that position.  
  
Q. First season is over, what are your take-aways and where do you see
the program moving forward?  
COURTNEY BANGHART: I have a lot of take-aways. I think some of it will come in
a point of reflection. I told them in the locker room, good teams stay in the
moment, good leaders stay in the moment and I kept trying to find ways to help
this team progress and put them in the best position to win. Some of the
obvious take-aways are I'm at an institution that cares about women's
basketball and whether that's the other coaches in the department that are
pulling me along or the administration who continually shows up or our
student-athletes that take bride in the greatest highlights are wearing the
jersey. As a basketball coach, you are living the dream if you are in a place
that loves women's basketball. I think also the conference. I'm excited that
as I go through my first off-season I know what everybody's got and I know
what the length of this season looks like. So I have great affinity already
for this place. It's a place they take that gets into your heart and it has. I
have a huge roster change over at the end of the season, because we're not
just losing these two we're losing a bunch of guys. We will regroup as a staff
and relook at our roster and figure out the best way to play in their
strengths.  
  
In terms of the immediate reflection, my affinity to the University of North
Carolina and the appreciation I have for it's love for basketball and I'm
really proud and humbled and like I said I'm more driven than ever to come
back here and be here so that you're tired of hearing my voice after every
game.  
  
Q. For the players, you guys, you know, Coach talked about how this is a
transition and y 'all are heading out but how do you feel about the foundation
that you've set for Coach Courtney Banghart's future teams and how you've left
this team?  
SHAYLA BENNETT: I think there is not only room for improvement from here.
Coach has a lot of great kids coming in and she is a great person so I think
it's only forward from here for this program.  
  
COURTNEY BANGHART: Thanks, Shay. Coming back for a fifth year?  
  
SHAYLA BENNETT: I wish.  
  
TAYLOR KOENEN: I think Shay said it. We tried to turn it around with the help
of Coach at the beginning and we were up high in the standings and it didn't
end the way we wanted it to; but like Shay said, Coach will make the changes
she needs to make and the future it is bright for Carolina basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Janelle not 100% today. Talk about the difference
that she makes to this lineup when she is healthy and ready to go.  
COURTNEY BANGHART: You know, the post position, the game is played from the
inside out, guards win you championships but the game is played from the
inside out.  
  
Before she was out of the play she was on minute restriction so we haven't had
her for a while and that means they have been able to guard the arc tighter
because we don't have an anchor inside. Malu has done a tremendous job and
wasn't quite ready to be a dominant 5 in this league. So we had to change our
style and these guys really tried to do that. I give credit to Janelle. She
could have said I'm going to hang 'em up until next year. She was literally
crawling up the doctors and the trainers saying come on, come on it's our
seniors and she didn't practice in full and she played today because she
wanted to give the senior the best she could. That kid gets a bad wrap because
she has that phase that's angry, but if it's a story about Janelle, it's she
played today because she rode herself to play today for her seniors. She
wasn't conditioned necessarily to do so. We will look forward to building
around her in the year ahead.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## July 14, 2020

  

### [Player Test](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38113)

  
_Irving, Texas, USA_  
  

### Press Conference

  

THE MODERATOR: THIS IS A TEST PAGE DEMO -

Please respond to asapsports with questions and to confirm receipt of the
email.

PLAYER1/Player2

5-7, 6-2, 6-1

Team1 - 102, Team2 - 101

Q. Is this is a test page?

SPEAKER: Yes, there is no posting to ASAP sports. You can edit for practice.
Ita�

We'd like to welcome Carlos Ortiz to the interview room. Carlos currently is
No. 1 on the Web.com Tour regular season money list. He's won twice this year
-- Panama Claro Championship and El Bosque Mexico Championship. And he also
got an invitation to play this week.

Carlos, start off with your thoughts on the golf course.

CARLOS ORTIZ: The golf course is amazing. Coming from the Web.com Tour, we
don't get to play these kind of golf courses, and I'm just happy to be out
here.

It's a great shape. And also the service you get out here, it's amazing. You
don't get that out there, and I'm just really happy to be out here.

Q. Is it hard for you to believe that you're here, playing on this level
here this week?

CARLOS ORTIZ: It's not hard to believe. It's impressive. It's different from
what I've been used to. And I'm just happy. It's a new experience, and I'm
just going to try to enjoy it, not try to put any pressure on me.

And it's a bonus for me. Right now I'm playing the Web.com Tour and that's my
focus, and that's how I'm saying it's a bonus for my great playing this year.

Q. Could you talk a little bit about when you found out you were going
to play here? And I saw on your bio where you put you would put Jack Nicklaus
in your dream foursome. Could you talk a little bit about being here and
possibly being around him?

CARLOS ORTIZ: When I first found out, I couldn't believe it. I've never played
a PGA TOUR event before. And making my debut on the PGA TOUR in this
tournament was just great. It took me a while to realize that I was going to
play out here.

And being the Jack Nicklaus tournament, I always look up to him as a player
and as a-- as a man, how he is. And just an honor. And I'm just really happy
and I'm going to try to really enjoy this week.

Q. Just wondering if you could talk for a minute about any influence
that Lorena Ochoa has had on your career or your golf or any connection with
her.

CARLOS ORTIZ: She's really been a really big influence on my career. We are
from the same country club. So I grew up with her.

When I was young, starting to play golf, she was a sensation. And just being
able to see how somebody can make their dreams come true with the hard work.
Because I saw how hard she worked and dedication. And so being able to see
that from close, it's really an inspiration.

Q. Have you talked with her recently, all the play that you've had, the
good finishes and so forth?

CARLOS ORTIZ: Of course, she's unbelievably nice. She reached out to me and
offered any advice. She's going to be there. And she keeps sending me e-mails
and making sure I'm good.

If I ever need anything, she says she's going to be there for me. And she's
really a nice person, really humble, and I'm just pretty lucky to have her
close.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2020

  

### [Megan Duffy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16260)

### [Lauren Van Kleunen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38954)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 88, Marquette - 74  
  
MEGAN DUFFY: First off, congratulations to DePaul and Coach Bruno. What a
tremendous team. They've been so consistent and such a high-octane offense,
very difficult to defend. Their pressure on us was obviously a huge key to the
game. So congratulations to them, and the tournament, to win another title.  
  
But overall, despite that, I just am extremely proud and very excited for
what's ahead with this team and our no-quit attitude, especially in that
fourth quarter to try and battle back.  
  
Q. Lauren, what do you do now to kind of put this game past you and look
forward to the rest of the postseason?  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yeah, I think we obviously need to learn from this game,
and I think there's also a lot of basketball left to be played. So I think
we've got to obviously watch the film, even though it's going to be very
extremely hard, but we've got to learn from this, take it with a grain of salt
and move on and make sure we learn from it and not do the same thing in the
postseason.  
  
Q. You guys had 46 from the paint. What was working for you down low? It
seemed pretty physical.  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yeah, it was very, very physical, and it was -- we knew
that we had the size advantage inside there, and so I was just -- every time I
got down the floor I was trying to post-up on the smaller girls and try to do
my best in that. And we pride ourselves on, the group of four of us, just to
be relentless in the paint, on the boards and everything, so that's what we
can do.  
  
Q. What made it hard to stop them on the defensive side of the ball?  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yeah, DePaul, they're a heck of a team. Just offensively
they're constantly moving. Anyone can drive it, shoot it. So it's hard to
defend them. And I think just communication-wise we just didn't have it, and I
think they were constantly moving, and I think we took that second to relax,
and that hurt us, and you can't do that against DePaul. They're too good.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
MEGAN DUFFY: I mean, we've watched DePaul all year turn teams over and create
extra possessions on the offensive end for them. I thought the first time we
played them, we struggled with it early on in the season, and then we did a
tremendous job when we were at home handling it and really scored lay-ups and
easy baskets off of it.  
  
You know, we tried to do some of the similar things we did in that game, too,
and then obviously you saw just the passing and we started losing some
confidence out there. I thought DePaul's pressure, they kept turning it up,
especially in that second quarter. We scored the ball pretty well. You look at
our field goal percentage, when we could get it there, we could score. But it
really did feel like it was a turnover or we scored and nothing in between.  
  
And then the thing about playing DePaul, especially when you get them on the
third day, I don't know if people can tell, but they can wear you out with
just their ability to score and the pressure. I thought a little bit of that
got to us early on, and playing some youth and people playing a lot of
minutes, and they've always been known for that, and unfortunately we weren't
able to kind of stop the bleeding with it.  
  
Q. (Question on Jordan King.)  
MEGAN DUFFY: First off, I love that kid. For her to be a freshman on this
stage as a starting point guard, what we've asked her to do this year with a
young team and some inexperience, she's been phenomenal. I don't think her
shooting percentage and her numbers is really indicative of what she's meant
from a steadiness and a leadership side for such a young kid. She had a great
game against last regular season game against DePaul and then in the
tournament, was really scoring the ball, which she was really great at that in
high school.  
  
And I think she ran out of gas a little bit, turned the ball over a couple
times, and just didn't have her A game. But I'll tell you what, I feel like
the future is in good hands when she's going to be on the floor for us for
three more years. Just a tremendous student-athlete and individual and a kid
you root for. Every challenge we've given her, whether that's me getting on
her or telling her to sacrifice this for her team or really lock into the
defensive end, she's been, "I've got you, Coach, whatever you need me to do."
I'm really thrilled despite the tough night tonight and being held scoreless,
I'm thrilled to have her on my side.  
  
Q. You guys split the regular season series with them. What was the
biggest difference tonight that you saw?  
MEGAN DUFFY: I mean, absolutely. I think the reason why we won on our home
floor the second time was just the ability to handle their pressure, and we
were confident, we were moving the ball, and obviously that was in not a good
way a contagious thing tonight, where we turned the ball over, it led to easy
points.  
  
One of the things I thought we have been pretty good all year at is our
transition defense, and we had some possessions where we were spinning around
and I felt like we had to go back to junior high practice and talk about
getting the rim and the ball. But when you've got five people on the floor
with DePaul who can score, it's challenging.  
  
So that was a little bit disappointing about that when we had the opportunity
to still get stops, we weren't able to, especially in that second quarter.  
  
Q. What can you build on moving forward from this? What did you see from
this tournament that you can take into the next series?  
MEGAN DUFFY: What I told our team was the run we went on to get to the finals
is huge growth. We talk about the overall picture of our program and picking
ninth because we lost so much, and there were no expectations and they were
sick of maybe seeing Marquette towards the top, and we felt like that was our
fuel throughout the whole year. I'm just really proud of this group for -- we
talk about player development and getting better, this team has gotten better
all year, and obviously it didn't show too much tonight too much, but this is
a high-quality team and a balanced team and you've got Selena who really
stepped up, Lauren Van Kleunen was great inside. And then you have enough
freshmen sprinkled in that will really be good for us.  
  
I really, really can't wait. I'm actually going to give them a few days off
for spring break, but I can't wait to get back in the gym with them and get
back to coaching them up and being in practice with them. I've been on a lot
of teams as a player, a lot of teams as a coach - assistant, now as a head
coach, and I can't tell you how much I love these girls and how much they're
selfless and all the things you talk about in sports and why it's so great,
they live it every day.  
  
I know we're going to be back, ready to go here in a couple days, and looking
forward to hopefully the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Lexi Held had 31 points tonight. Talk about her ability to score.  
MEGAN DUFFY: I mean, Lexi did everything. She got easy shots, she made tough
shots, she shot it from the outside, she got to the rim. Always have been a
huge fan of her actually from even the recruiting process watching her come up
through the ranks.  
  
She struggled a little bit the last couple weeks, and I thought this
tournament she really got going and was a concern for us coming in with her
ability to score. You know, obviously talented scorer as all of them are, but
tremendous game by her.  
  
Q. 27 turnovers for you guys tonight. What needs to be done for the long
stretch of the postseason?  
MEGAN DUFFY: Yeah, I feel good about our offense when we are executing. I feel
that we're a better defensive team than maybe we showed today, and we'll get
back to the basics. That's the great thing about when you're preparing for the
NCAA Tournament before you have an opponent for postseason, we'll go back to
the little things and work on catching the ball and getting our confidence
back.  
  
Obviously we're disappointed, but a lot of great things ahead for our program.

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 88, Marquette - 74  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Marquette is really good. Coach Duffy did a magnificent job with
this team this year. She truly earned her Coach of the Year award this season,
and her team was just really, really special all year. We wouldn't be sitting
up here today as champions if they didn't take us to school the way they took
us to school eight, nine days ago. We went to Milwaukee, we went to the Al,
and Marquette just did a job of taking it to us, and that's what competition
is all about. That's why you compete, why you play against one another. I
think the fact they took us to school the way they did eight, nine years ago
is why our players were ready to play tonight against a really, really
excellent Marquette basketball team.  
  
I'm proud of our players. They learned well, so I'm just really proud of the
way they came out, their energy was probably the best defensive energy not
just in the full court but in the half court all year long at moments during
that game.  
  
Q. Chante and Kelly, what do you think about the win?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: This feels amazing. Definitely a huge goal of ours after we
earned our Big East title last year. I was just so hungry to get back here and
be able to do it again at home against Marquette. But I'm super excited and
can't wait for what comes next.  
  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, it definitely feels great. This is what we work for all
year, to come out here and defend our home court feels really great.  
  
Q. Chante, you seem to have a little bit of an edge on the court
tonight. Was there some revenge on your mind? What brought about that edge?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I think our team, they just got me so excited. Like I said,
this is a date that I marked down on my calendar, like I can't wait. Circled
it a bunch of times, circled it in red. Definitely had an edge, and I feel
like my energy kind of rubs off on my underclassmen a lot, even sometimes
Kelly. So I just felt like I needed that edge, needed that energy, starting
with the defensive side, so I thought that helped tonight.  
  
Q. Just talk about the three-point shooting. You guys broke the
tournament record for most threes in the tournament. You all contributed to
that. Talk about how that feels as a team and the offense.  
LEXI HELD: I mean, that's just how we play. Every shot we shoot we practice,
and just having the freedom that we have just really helps, and nobody thinks
about the shots that we're going to take, we don't have to second-guess. We
know that our shots are going to fall or not, and then we just have to focus
on rebounding.  
  
So I think the freedom of having the greenest green light in America really
allows us to shoot as well as we do.  
  
KELLY CAMPBELL: I think a lot of it came from how well we defended and
rebounded as well. So we were able to push the ball, get the ball inside. Once
we got the ball inside, we were able to find shooters outside. And we really
moved the ball well and found the open person well today.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: And I just also thought we just have so much confidence in
each other, and even if we didn't make a three, our rebounders were there,
offensively rebounding and kick it out and try it again.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
KELLY CAMPBELL: I think today we really came out focused and played how we
should play ever game on defense. We all learned our lesson last week and they
really dominated us on the glass, dominated us in the block. So I think we
really came out focused today and executed well on defense.  
  
Q. Kelly and Chante, just in general playing Marquette for the fourth
time in a row, what 's it mean to you?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I feel like Marquette does a great job against us,
definitely brings the best out of us, like I said, one of those games you
really look forward to. Every single time I see a DePaul player (sic), you
definitely get the most competitive game up and down, and I definitely think
they bring the best out of us.  
  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Wouldn't really be a Big East final if we weren't playing
Marquette, so glad it ended up that way, and they really played a great game
today. And I'm glad we were able to execute and get the win.  
  
Q. You kind of went over and gave thanks to the fans. You got a standing
O. Take me through the emotions that you were feeling at that time.  
LEXI HELD: It felt really good. We were obviously very serious and very locked
in throughout the whole game, so when we heard that buzzer and there was a
minute left and we knew it was finally over, it just felt really good,
especially just having so much support here was just really a good time.  
  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, I think it didn't really hit me until about that one-
minute mark that we sealed the deal, so it was great to get a standing O and
just really get a great team win with my team.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: It just shows how much the DePaul community is wrapping
their arms around us at this time. When we needed them the most, coming off
two losses, they never lost hope in us. And they definitely backed us up
tonight, and I appreciate them so much.  
  
Q. For the seniors, was there a time during this game (indiscernible)
pressure became a factor?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I just believe once we started getting turnovers and
speeding them up faster than what they were used to playing, I felt like
that's really when I finally noticed that it was working.  
  
Q. Was there a quarter that it happened?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I think second half because we were really focused on having
good, strong third quarters because we struggle sometimes coming out of the
locker room. So I thought we were super focused to finish the game, close it
out strong.  
  
Q. Lexi, just give us your thoughts on winning Most Valuable Player.  
LEXI HELD: It means a lot, but I really couldn't have done it without any
teammates. We work really hard for this, so it feels good to win, and it feels
good that I got to award, but I couldn't have done it without my team or my
coaches.  
  
KELLY CAMPBELL: She didn't even know she dropped 30 when I told her.  
  
LEXI HELD: I had no idea.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: How do you not know that? She deserves it. So proud of you,
Lex.  
  
LEXI HELD: Thanks, Chante.  
  
Q. Without giving away too much, what was the game plan heading into
tonight 's game?  
DOUG BRUNO: Like I said in the opening statement, Marquette just did a great
job of taking us to school on the 1st of March. We played hard up in
Milwaukee. I don't think, though, we had an applied focus, and that was
basically the terms we used today, is you can play hard, you can work hard,
but you still have to apply your focus, and Marquette just -- they just killed
us on the backboard up there. They really just took it to us and did a great
job of taking it to us, and did a great job of showing why Coach Duffy and
their program and their team had such a great year and deserves to be not just
in the NCAA Tournament but to have a really strong seed in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
So I mean, their non-conference schedule, losing to Mississippi State very
close, losing an overtime game to Northwestern without Lott, people forget
that that game -- they played that game without Selena Lott. They really,
really schooled us. So when you talk about the game plan, the game plan is
really pretty simple. It didn't change a whole lot, but the application of the
game plan -- when you hear me say it's always the players, we coaches can come
up with a game plan, and the players have to apply it. And I thought they did
a great job of that.  
  
The pressure was the best -- Chante commented about the third quarter, but it
was obviously the second quarter when it kicked in. Basketball just doesn't --
there's just not one simple moment. I think they started to feel that the
energy defensively was working, and they made plays in the quarter court in
the second quarter, not just the full court, and I think that's what some of
those little plays by little people on big people, I think those were some of
the plays that really juiced us.  
  
Q. Just talk about the adrenaline rush, as you guys had a really tough
match with Seton Hall last night. Talk about how the team was able to come out
and they played the textbook way you want. Talk about how this tournament
helped you guys, those games leading up to tonight to get you through
tonight.  
DOUG BRUNO: For sure, Seton Hall gave us a really good, tough ball game, and
we preach winning every possession, possession by possession, and when it
comes down to the last possession or two, it really educates you as players.
It educates you as coaches. Seton Hall and Coach Bozzella did I great job.  
  
I really believe this league is a great league, and I can't -- the
prognosticators are the prognosticators, but St. John's, Seton Hall belong in
the NCAA Tournament along with Creighton, along with Marquette, along with
DePaul. This is a really, really great league, and I think just it's really,
really a great league, and we welcome UConn next year, it's going to make it
even a better league, but at the same time you've got to live in the present
and the moment, so it's a great league, so it prepared us.  
  
One thing I said to the young women when we were getting ready, you women are
all 18 to 23 years old, okay, so take yourself back 10 years, when you were
eight or when you were 11, 9, 10, 8, and it's summertime and went out and
played on Monday and you played all day, and you went out and played on
Tuesday and played all day, and then you went out and played -- no, wait, the
third day you were tired. You asked for a day off because you were tired.  
  
So basically the point is, you've got to go out and play, and three in a row
is hard, but at the same time, you go out and play when you're kids, you've
got to go out and play when you're 18 to 22-year-olds, that's why these
conference tournaments are really cool, because it's the only time you do
this.  
  
Now we get back to the Big East format, which is Friday-Sunday, which prepares
you for the NCAA Tournament. That's what's happening now all. It's all going
to be Friday-Sunday, so just all of this comes together at this moment and
you're really proud for the players. It's always the players that make the
plays.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago (indiscernible) take me through that.  
DOUG BRUNO: You know, goals are -- ideas are a funny little thing that only
works if you do -- goals is a funny little thing if you do. And sometimes you
can get your goals too far out ahead of you, and I think our players got too
focused -- when we got tight in the middle of the season here, I think they
were too focused on hosting, and to just try to get them back and just get the
next win, get the next game. It's all going to take care of itself. Just
because -- first of all, we don't know that we're going to host, and if we do
get to host, that doesn't mean you're going to win. You've still got to go out
and play really good basketball teams in the NCAA Tournament. That's why it's
a great championship. So you still have to go out and win the game.  
  
If we don't host, so we've got to go on the road and we've still got to go out
and throw the ball up and play against a really good team, and you've still
got to get the W.  
  
We just kind of tried to take the pressure off of them and just stay focused
on the next game, and whatever is going to happen at the end of the year is
going to happen at the end of the year, and I think that kind of finally took
the heat off of them a little bit. I thought we were getting pretty tight
there in some moments of the season.  
  
Q. I 'm wondering if you can comment on Sonya's contribution today?  
DOUG BRUNO: Sonya has been so special to this team all year, and that's what
makes this team special is on any given night, any player -- Lexi's turn to
get 30 was tonight. Sonya has had 30 a couple this year. I think she had 30 at
Notre Dame, at Oregon State. Those are big places to get 30 or 29. Maybe it
wasn't 30, maybe it was 29.  
  
But Sonya has been great all year. Both these sophomores have really been
great. We've had great senior leadership with the two seniors - Kelly Campbell
and Chante Stonewall. But these two sophomores have been special also.  
  
She brings an energy. She brings a mojo. She brings a fight to the game that
is just -- you just love it as a coach.  
  
When the shot is working, everybody is a better player, and tonight she wasn't
necessarily shooting as well as she has in other games, but she's still a
really impactful player on the floor.  
  
Q. What has Kelly meant to your program?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, it's just always -- when you do this for a living, four
years goes so fast. When you're a young freshman looking in at the four years,
it seems like it's going to be forever. The next thing you know you are going
to graduate. When you do this as a coach, four years -- freshmen are coming in
and you're still talking to eighth and ninth graders trying to replace them
already. That's how crazy the choice we make to coach college basketball is,
but the second freshmen are entering, you're thinking who's going to be their
replacement? And they haven't seen played ball yet, but that's what we coaches
have to do.  
  
So to see them actually matriculate through the four years, to see them put up
-- look, I love what I do and I love my players, and I think my players love
me, but it's love-hate, and they have to put up in a lot, and we demand a lot.
We demand a lot of accountability. We don't just let them walk in and run the
show and do what they want to do, and so I'm just proud of the fact that they
were coachable players, and that's what I love about coaching in today's age.
I can't stand labels. To me the M word, "Millenial" is a swear word. I will
never say it. I can't stand adults talking down at generations. It drives me
absolutely crazy.  
  
And so to watch these young people execute the same necessities and the same
formula to succeed that exists -- it's a thrill to watch them work that hard,
set their goals, go to work to achieve their goals, have broader goals than
just basketball, think of people outside themselves. That's been the joy of
watching Chante Stonewall and Kelly Campbell, and we're going to miss them and
we're going to try to make this last as long as possible.  
  
Q. This program 's accomplishments are historic. You added another
accomplishment tonight, and yet somehow this all gets left out of the
conversation amongst other programs.  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, I believe that there are -- we have moved up the food chain
of women's college basketball to a place and point where we are a perennial
top-25 basketball team. We have not yet won a National Championship. We have
not yet taken our program to a Final Four. There's still programs like UConn,
and we welcome -- Coach Bruno here wants UConn in this program, in the Big
East. I'm excited about it. It's going to make the league better. It's going
to make what we have to do exponentially more difficult. But it's going to
make the league better.  
  
So there's your UConn program. Oregon right now is in that place. You've got
South Carolina in a special place, and Baylor in a certainly place. Coach
VanDerveer at Stanford has got her program in a special place. So there's five
or six, seven programs that are in a place that -- it's why I still do this.
I'm not just doing this to count W's. I'm doing this because Jeannie Lenti
Ponsetto back there was my first captain back in the '70s, when we had
nothing, when they wore tee shirts and sat in the back of a van, five to a
room and all that stuff. We've watched this program go from infancy to where
we are, but we still aspire to move into that level of play. And that's why I
still coach.  
  
We're proud of what we've achieved. I don't know if the nation understands
what we've achieved. We here in Chicago kind of do, but across the nation
doesn't really get what we've achieved here. But we're here to fight, to
compete with the best of them. We haven't done that yet. You are what your
record says you are, and we're a really good college basketball team that does
it the right way, does it with ranked academic teams every year, but we still
have another level, and that's the highest level to climb.  
  
Q. Do you agree that women 's basketball in general should be getting
more attention on the national level?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, absolutely. When 2 to 8 percent of all sports coverage in
the electronic and written media is about women, that's wrong. It's just flat-
out wrong. It absolutely deserves -- I'm not saying 50/50, but come on, 2 to 8
percent? How about let's start with 25. Let's start with 30. So absolutely.  
  
You know, when the male editors, mostly male editors want to talk about it,
they say there's not any interest, we're short staffed, we don't have enough
space. I've fought very hard for this, and yet -- so that's what they say. But
I was here and watched the Chicago Bulls have four beat writers for four
Chicago dailies with less people at their games than come to watch DePaul
women's basketball.  
  
So what comes first? I just heard Tony Kornheiser the other day talk about the
XFL and he made a great statement: It won't have a chance to make it unless it
gets more coverage. He was bemoaning the fact that they weren't getting much
play in the newspaper, therefore they weren't going to succeed. Well, what is
he telling you? He's telling you that we've been fighting uphill.  
  
Val Ackerman over here is sitting here, former commissioner of the WNBA,
fighting to answer the question. Jeannie is fighting to answer the question.
But it's really about a media that doesn't really want to cover women's
basketball, and I guess it's hard for women because our game is compared to
the greatest players. When you watch the NBA, those guys are great players,
and college men's hoops is great ball. So I get it. It's hard to juxtapose
your game to that.  
  
But at the same time, no coverage or very little coverage, I just -- I really
do think that -- you asked me a question here. I've just gone on and on.
Winston Churchill said, "Give me ten sentences on any man and I can have him
hung." So right now this media thing is going to go -- the only thing that's
going to be talked about is that question, me answering that question, and
it's going to sound like I'm a big crier-whiner about women's sports coverage,
and I'm answering your question, but you asked the question, I'm answering it,
and that's just the God-honest facts. The rivalry I love. I'm honored to have
played against Coach McGuire and know Al McGuire, played for Coach Meyer, and
Al used to come out and he used to look up into the corners. If you knew Al,
he'd tell you that when you got to know him. If the corners were full, he was
happy. He filled the Mecca up. It was called the Mecca back then. And we had
great battles and great games, so I understand what the DePaul-Marquette
rivalry is about because I was able to live it through the great coaches and
Coach Ray Meyer and Al McGuire.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible.)  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, you love college hoops and you love to work in college
hoops, but it's really -- you've got to really focus on this team right now
that's still includes Chante and Kelly. I'm excited about this play of our
sophomore Sonya Morris and Lexi Held for sure. We have two really special
freshmen coming in next year. I don't want to anoint any freshmen anything
until they get here, but Darrione Rogers and Kendall Holmes are two of the
best state-level players, but Darrione is actually a national-level player.
She's really a special player.  
  
And yet some of the people that you're not seeing right now, I think that's
one of the things we're proudest of at DePaul is we do develop our players. We
try to get the same people Geno does. When they say no to us, we have to
develop our players, and some of the people you haven't seen play yet I
guarantee you will step up and they'll make themselves names here over the
next couple years, but right now we want to live in the moment with the team
that we have.  
  
Q. Third quarter you guys came out and led by 12 and didn 't let up and
just kind of kept the pressure on.  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, that's all the players, and the players just did a real good
job of applying the pressure and making big shots, and anything that happens
within -- coaches deserve credit for what happens in practice. Players deserve
credit for what happens in the games, and the players were knocking down
shots. They were still defending with the strong sense of urgency. So it's
just always the players. And I'm just proud of the way the players stepped up
and played.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2020

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Leilani Correa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38959)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 78, St. John's - 55  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Obviously a difficult game for us today. Hasn't been an easy
match-up for us all year, which we knew, but obviously credit to Marquette and
to Megan, who I've had the pleasure of watching her grow as a first-time
assistant with us and now watching her now at Marquette. Pretty cool.  
  
Yeah, I don't think we really ever got in the flow. I felt pretty good at half
after we made a good run to make a comeback there to cut it to five, but we
looked gassed. We didn't really have the energy level I thought we needed to
be able to win a game of this magnitude.  
  
So I'm really proud of our kids, proud of our team for the way that we
finished the year, and obviously we've got to wait and see where we'll be.
Obviously we hope that our resume will be good enough for the NCAA Tournament,
but at the same time we're just continuing to grow as a team, and we'll get
ready for whatever games are ahead of us.  
  
Q. You had a good showing here at the tournament. What 's going to be
your biggest takeaway from this?  
LEILANI CORREA: My biggest takeaway? Just always pushing through no matter the
adversity or whatever is going on around you, just always finish strong.
Obviously upsetting that we didn't get to the championship, but like Coach
said, I'm very proud of us. I'm very proud of my teammates for pushing to get
as far as we did.  
  
Q. What was Marquette doing defensively that made it difficult for you
guys?  
LEILANI CORREA: Pressuring us. We really just couldn't score. Not a lot was
going in for us tonight. You know, they were just getting up, relentless on
the ball, off the ball. They were just all over the place. They're long, so it
was very difficult to get around them.  
  
Q. A team of that size, how do you play against that when you 're not as
big as them?  
LEILANI CORREA: I mean, I really -- obviously it's about size, but it's really
not about size, it's about setting screens the right way or driving or being
faster or quicker than your opponent. We're a very, very quick team, so the
plays that we did score were off of being faster than them. But no, just not a
lot was going in.  
  
Q. It seemed like the first couple games were kind of contrasting, you
had a high scoring game the first game, then the second one was a little lower
scoring, but you guys fell behind a little bit early with Creighton last
night, but even though they led the whole way you guys did a good job of
hanging around. What makes it difficult against them when you 're trying to
come back and you fall behind like you do early in a game against a team like
Marquette?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Well, listen, at the end of the day, we do lack size. We do
have speed. We were minus-5, I think, on the glass at half, and the finish,
whatever that is, 16 at the game. So the difficult task with them is they can
play multiple speeds. They've got experience. They've got players that have
played in meaningful games. People forget that, I think, sometimes. And at any
moment they can go get the ball. So to be able to play a lineup like that that
they have, where they've got the length, they can always get a rebound, they
can get loose balls and get deflections they're beating you to 50/50 balls,
and we just didn't do a good enough job of staying connected and keeping them
from getting to those things.  
  
You can make a run. You can have a couple things go your way, but they're
experienced enough to make the right play at the right time, and they made big
shots. Spingola has been doing it since she got there. Lott has obviously got
a lot of experience, and I think even their younger kids that didn't play,
even look at Anderson, she just didn't play a lot the last couple years, and I
think she's had a pretty good season for them. It was something that we knew
we were going to have to try to counteract, and we just weren't able to do
enough here to be able to kind of keep it close to have a chance at the end,
unfortunately.  
  
Q. You had two relatively close games against them during the regular
season. Tonight was different. Did they do anything dramatically different
than you had expected?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: No, I don't think they did anything different. They played
with energy. They played with their length, and they went to the things that
they're good at, and we allowed them to too many times in the game.  
  
I think Leilani was trying to say it, but we just didn't make shots. At the
end of the day we didn't make any shots. We were 3-for-16 from three and were
8-for-whatever it is, 14 from the line, and that's not a recipe you want, for
us at least. We've got to be able to make shots from the outside. I felt we
had to probably make at least eight or nine today to feel good, and they just
did -- we just didn't put them in.  
  
Q. What made it hard to stop Marquette during their runs throughout the
game?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Again, their size. 50 points in the paint. When you're
allowing players to get deep or to be able to make moves that they're
accustomed to and you're not taking things away that they do well, it's going
to be hard.  
  
I thought we -- again, I think regardless of the game the night before and the
physicality, everybody feels that way this time of year, so it's nothing that
you can say that other people aren't feeling.  
  
And the difference with teams that win, they get through that. They did a good
job. They pounded it inside when they had to, they made shots from the outside
when they had to, so obviously credit to them.  
  
Q. Coming out of (indiscernible) the conference, your best-case
scenario?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Listen, our body of work I think is there. When you look at
our league, to have five teams that were 11-7 I think shows the strength. I
don't know if it's for me to argue in this case. That's for other people to
look at, I guess, but we challenge ourselves every year in the non-conference.
We've done that. We've beaten teams in our league like Creighton three times,
and I think our RPI is somewhere in the 50s, and I think our strength of
schedule is top 60. It depends on who you're in the pool with. I've been doing
it long enough to know that.  
  
And so these kids, we put ourselves in the conversation right now, and that's
what we've got to hope for, and I think that we certainly would be a fun team
to watch.  
  
Q. My question is about Leilani: What do you see from her as far as
maturity?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I'm not sure I've had a freshman even be in this room,
so I think that says enough. To watch what she did and to get her the
experience she had and to see her step up on the stage, because you're not
really sure ever how kids will react when you've got this type of kind of win
or go home magnitude of a game. I thought she played great.  
  
The future is bright for her, for us. She never stops playing. You can't
really tell what she's thinking, which is not bad, but she was tired today,
too, and I could tell that. But she played hard. Yesterday you got to see what
she really can do, and today I thought she really battled. But she's a special
kid, and like I said, I don't know that we've ever had a freshman in this room
even being able to be getting asked questions like that after her
performances, so that's pretty fun.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2020

  

### [Megan Duffy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16260)

### [Selena Lott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38974)

### [Isabelle Spignola](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38975)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 78, St. John's - 55  
  
MEGAN DUFFY: I can't tell you how proud I am of these two sitting next to me
and our entire team. A very excited locker room to be coming back tomorrow to
be playing for a championship.  
  
I thought our defense in the second half was the difference, and just a
balanced attack inside. 52 points in the paint is kind of our bread and butter
and we were able to execute it, so we're just really thrilled.  
  
Q. How much is this team looking forward to playing DePaul in the
championship tomorrow?  
SELENA LOTT: Yeah, for sure, we want to defend the title because they got it
the last two years. I mean, we need it. We want it.  
  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: Yeah, four years in a row, like Selena said, get the chip
back, and then obviously we had a good game against them last week, so
obviously just looking to do that again.  
  
Q. Isabelle, obviously you are a Chicago person, so you know the history
and tradition of Coach Bruno. Now you 've had to go against them for four
years. Talk about the progression from you as a player and with the program
from a freshman to you being a senior and those battles and facing DePaul one
more time.  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: Yeah, I mean, it's been a good four years. I think
obviously I've grown a lot as a player, and then just playing against DePaul,
it's a great rivalry for us. They play a fast speed, and I just think for us
as a team tomorrow, we just need to come ready to play.  
  
Q. What was the talk like in the locker room after the game?  
SELENA LOTT: Just emotions. We all came in there screaming, clapping. We do
our little chant, our little -- I don't know, our fight song. And then we all
bring it in and she just tells us what we did good and what we need to improve
on.  
  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: We're just ready to go. Like we're pumped right now. We're
so ready to go to the championship. It's huge for us.  
  
MEGAN DUFFY: They're at a loss for words. I never would have thought those two
would be at a loss for words.  
  
Q. Talk about what it 's like coming back from a game last night where
you shot 3-for-11 from the field.  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: I just think like staying in the present, not like taking a
miss too hard, just getting into my shot and then for the rebounds just
playing hard, playing my game and just doing what I need to do in order for
the team to win.  
  
Q. What will it be like tomorrow for you playing in your final Big East
Tournament?  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: For me and Tia, yeah, it's going to be really exciting for
us. Obviously once again we had a long four years together, we had a good
senior night. Yeah, we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the play of this league? It 's been such a tight
tournament. Speak to the competitiveness of this league.  
SELENA LOTT: Yeah, it my opinion I think this conference is the best
conference, and all the coaches recruit good players, so it's going to be a
tough competition between all teams. It's honestly who shows up that night and
who wants to win.  
  
ISABELLE SPINGOLA: Yeah, bouncing off that, Big East, great conference. Every
team, like good players, good competition, everybody comes ready to play, so
it's just like Selena said, who wants to give more on that one night.  
  
Q. Tell me about your relationship with these players off the court. It
seems pretty special.  
MEGAN DUFFY: Well, they get all nervous in front of you guys. I don't know
what the problem is because about five minutes ago they're jumping up and down
and screaming.  
  
These two are special. They bought in from day one when I came a year ago, and
just looking at Selena today, got in a little bit of foul trouble but her
efficiency was incredible. To finish 7-for-9, 4-for-4 from the free-throw
line, 18 points, just steady. Hopefully, she'll have fresh legs tomorrow
because she didn't play as heavy minutes. And then Izzy is more the quiet one,
but she's been the silent assassin for us in so many ways. I think the big
thing you saw today, her shot was falling but she was showing her versatility
a little bit more. She's always been for a few years just a shooter, now she's
got -- she had the challenge of -- shoot, guarding any of those St. John's
guards is difficult.  
  
She keeps this team together. She's in a quiet way a tremendous leader for us,
and I'm just thrilled for them. There was so much hype with the teams before
how much talent there was with Hiedeman, and to see them up there as now the
lead guards doing it is pretty cool.  
  
I know they're going to be very excited to be obviously facing an incredible
team tomorrow in DePaul, but also just the opportunity to win a championship
again and a whole new role for them is going to be fun to watch.  
  
Q. At your worst tonight you shot 52 percent. What was going so well?  
MEGAN DUFFY: I think our balance inside and out. Obviously we talked about the
paint points was big, but I thought we did that in a couple different ways,
whether that was the guards getting in there, offensive rebounds.  
  
It didn't feel like we shot it that well just because of their pressure, and
we really had to execute our offense to the backside of things, so our first
one or two options weren't there, and I thought that was the difference in the
third and fourth quarter. We kind of kept our composure, and we have a little
package where we can get to some things that we score a little bit later. When
Sel went out with her fouls, that's happened a little bit this year, where
she's had a few games in foul trouble or she's been hurt and been out, and the
confidence that our freshmen, Jordan King had and Camryn Taylor, to make big
baskets. I thought Chloe Marotta was tremendous tonight, just scoring
efficiently in the paint.  
  
Until you guys mentioned that and I saw the stats sheet, I really couldn't
believe it with the pressure we're facing against their guards. Hopefully we
can keep that going for one more night.  
  
Q. You faced a legendary coach tonight, you 've got another one
tomorrow. Would you like to say something about that?  
MEGAN DUFFY: Yeah, it's special. When I wholeheartedly with my heart wanted to
come to Marquette, I knew the caliber of the coaches I was going to be
coaching against with Coach Bruno and Harry, and obviously Joe and I go way
back from our days when I was an assistant at St. John's. At this level you
want to compete against the best, whether you're talking to your players or
the coaches. And I know how much preparation myself and our staff has done
this year to be in position that we can beat those legendary coaches.  
  
It's pretty cool for me personally because I was a player still playing
against these guys when I was at Notre Dame, so now to be on the sideline and
have a team that I'm so honored to go to battle with, it's pretty cool to put
them in position that they can go out and have fun and execute.  
  
You know, and then you talk about Flan at Creighton, the list goes often
really good coaches in our league, and it's been a great just individual
challenge for me, as well, and our staff to continue to put a good product out
there and make adjustments and win in different ways, too. I think that's one
of the things I'm most proud about. We've been able to win in a lot of
different ways this year.  
  
Q. Would you describe the competition level between Marquette and
DePaul, what gets brought to the table?  
MEGAN DUFFY: Yeah, it's incredible. I was sitting, not as a head coach last
year, watching the games on TV and watching the rivalry, and obviously Doug
has laid a foundation for all women's basketball in some ways, it's just how
consistent they've been going to the tournament and being at the top of the
conference for so long, and I thought it was pretty cool that Coach Kiegs and
her staff got this thing going where it kind of turned into a little bit of a
rivalry and the games were so close and everybody brought their best.  
  
I'm just thrilled that we still have the opportunity to keep that rivalry
going, and we're going to give it our best effort. We've got some great
confidence in our final regular season game at home, at the Al, where we beat
them on Senior Night. When you get that taste of it, you know you can do it
now. The second factor is you've got to show up tomorrow and do it again
against a very talented team.  
  
It's a great rivalry, I think, and even in the recruiting world everybody
knows DePaul and Marquette. And it's awesome that it'll be a game on Fox
national TV with a lot of great support behind both teams.  
  
Q. All year you guys have had that underdog mentality. In the locker
room what 's it been like the last couple games being favored going in?  
MEGAN DUFFY: Yeah, I think we're going to keep the underdog mentality through
the last buzzer that happens this season. I think they like that. They all
have a little chip on their shoulder, at least I do - can we beat DePaul, can
we beat St. John's, and they've kind of taken -- the 12 players in the locker
room have kind of taken that ninth place preseason and kind of run with it.
I've let them do that, do what you want with that. We're going to keep getting
better every day.  
  
I think it's pretty cool after all is said and done. I was just talking to
Bill Scholl our director of athletics, and he said, can you believe you're
playing for a championship tomorrow? And we saw some spring and summer
practices all together.  
  
It's very rewarding to see how our juniors and seniors have grown and now our
freshmen stepping up in some of the biggest moments of their careers so far.
So we're going to keep, like I said, celebrating the positives. We're going to
keep our normal routine and have a heck of a time tomorrow.  
  
Q. St. John 's finished the second quarter on a 10-2 run. What made it
difficult to stop them during that stretch?  
MEGAN DUFFY: Well, our defense fell apart for a minute. We had a really hard
time keeping the ball in front of us. They got a ton of paint touches and led
to some fouls or led to some easy baskets. So we kind of went back at halftime
to just collect ourselves, get our legs back under, made a couple little
adjustments on some match-ups.  
  
And really what I've been able to do with this team, which has phenomenal with
our players, is to say like, you've got a choice, you've got 20 minutes to
find a way to play better one-on-one defense, and they really stepped up to
that challenge and made it a lot difficult, and for St. John's to take a few
more perimeter shots as opposed to getting the easy lay-ups. And then I
thought once we got a little confidence going with that, it allowed our
offense to continue to push forward.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2020

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Lexi Held](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38969)

### [Chante Stonewall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36700)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 83, Seton Hall - 80  
  
DOUG BRUNO: They're playing the best basketball right now, and they played a
great game last night against Butler. We knew we would get their absolute best
shot, and we did. And just proud of our players for starting to grasp and
understand what postseason basketball is all about, it is about, you know, one
possession at a time and you know just battling and executing little things,
each possession.  
  
I'm very proud of the way they hung together through a lot of ebbs and flows
in that game. There were many of them. I mean, the fourth quarter when -- the
unique beauty of basketball, sometimes the whistle blows, the stops and chops
of the game every 15 seconds, sometimes the whistle doesn't blow for four
minutes, and we had a stretch there in fourth quarter with both teams going
back and forth and, you know, I thought they really hung tough.  
  
When we got good open looks and couldn't make a shot, I was proud of how they
hung tough through that adversity because they could have sent them down the
tank. I thought they hung tough at that moment.  
  
I think that was a key moment in the game.  
  
I'm just really proud of them, proud of both players sitting next to me, but
proud of the entire team.  
  
Q. Happy International Women 's Day to you guys.  
LEXI HELD: Thank you.  
  
Q. My question, throughout much of the game it seemed every time Seton
Hall came within three, within five, you guys answered, the three-pointer. Can
you talk about your ability to maintain composure in those moments and just
never giving them -- obviously, that changed in the fourth, but throughout
most of the game. That was how it was?  
LEXI HELD: We -- they're a good team. We knew they weren't going to go away.
We were trying to focus on getting stops, rebounds on the defensive end, and
that helped us separate the lead at times when they were coming close.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: Also learning from previous games, being the team come back,
something we have a theme of, we wanted to make sure that we didn't have that
happen this game and it goes back to our experience in big games like this,
understanding if we can get a stop, we're just going to do good things for our
team.  
  
Q. Lexi, good looks in the fourth quarter, seemed like how the game was
going, was going to be 100-point game for both teams, but things got stagnant
offensively in that fourth quarter, and then you hit that three that broke the
ice, broke the tie and the other three gave you breathing room. Let 's talk
about that stretch and those two shots.  
LEXI HELD: We were running the floor, we knew we could get open looks if we
sprinted the floor after we got stops or got the ball out quick. I was just --
Kelly was able to push the ball to me, and my teammates were able to get me
open and I was able to knock it down.  
  
Q. At the half (indiscernible)?  
LEXI HELD: I don't know. I knew the first half I had to sit because of my
fouls. I was trying to do whatever I could do help my team.  
  
Q. During that time in fourth, what were you communicating to each other
on the floor, just obviously shooting and knowing eventually they would have
to drop?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: We understood that the fourth quarter is where our defense
needed to be perfect. Or at less close to perfect. We knew our shots were
going to fall. We play DePaul ball for a reason. We have to keep shooting and
then we're going to fall. I thought our team really, really did a great job of
offensive rebounding at the end.  
  
LEXI HELD: Controlling, we couldn't control the shots going in or not, getting
it done on the defensive end.  
  
Q. For both you guys, beating a team three times in one season is
difficult. Take me through how -- you know, you have seen this team before, do
you kind of expect what 's to come or do they change things up for you? Take
us through that mentality.  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I think every game has a life of its own. That's something
we preach in our program. We knew it would be different. I felt this was
actually one of the first times we played them where the pace was up/down,
up/down. Sometimes when we pressure them, slow them down. But this was
definitely an up-and-down, fun to watch basketball.  
  
Like I said before, every game has a life of its own. Our coaches definitely
prepared us to play them, clearly, from the previous two times, but we did a
great job just learning as we go throughout the game and adjusting.  
  
LEXI HELD: Same.  
  
Q. How much would you guys like to play Marquette in this
championship?  
LEXI HELD: I mean, they're both really good teams. Whoever we play, we just
got to focus on what they do and what we do. Hopefully we get it done.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: Whoever wins, I'll take either or.  
  
DOUG BRUNO: I would like to share with you that they're coachable players and
they answered that last question exactly like I told them to.  
  
Q. Doug, talk about the strategy late, you had fouls to give, I know you
guys probably practice those situations, sometimes it is hard when you want
them to foul to foul the right way, it seemed like Seton Hall was trying to
shove it a little bit, getting the shot off before you had a chance to foul
the last couple of chances they had to score?  
DOUG BRUNO: Fouling, when you have fouls to give, it is a thing that everybody
in every bar in America knows and knows what you should do, every coach knows
what you should do, it is a lot simpler to do it. It is a lot simpler to say
it than do it.  
  
In a perfect world, I would have liked to have used a little bit more -- eaten
a little bit more time with each of those fouls we had to give. At the same
time, you know, you start messing around, trying to wait a second or two, then
the next thing you know, bada bing, bada bang, and all of a sudden the ball is
flying. This time of the year, that's when balls are flying all over the
place.  
  
We tried to use the fouls. And then at the end we put Katie and Kiara Dallmann
in to try to guard the little girl -- that's not fair. I mean, you know, Park-
Lane rebounding the ball is a small player, we wanted a big player on her. But
still we knew they had to make a three, we were going to give them a two, we
weren't going to foul them on a two. It was good to have the fouls in your
pocket, but it is never as easy to execute the fouling at the end as it seems.
You have to be very careful too that you don't commit that foul on a shot. You
saw Alexis Lewis throw a couple up there that crazy things happen at this time
of the year in these kinds of situations.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Campbell 's play in the first half?  
DOUG BRUNO: For sure. She had 16 at halftime, that was a big deal to keep us
going. You know, we have been telling Kelly Campbell to shoot since she got
here. Kelly Campbell gets rebounds. Kelly Campbell gets assists. And Kelly
Campbell, she's a leading three-point shooting percentage player in the Big
East.  
  
And that's not lost on her head coach. Her team knows it. At the same time,
she's got to take them to make them, and she took them in the first half and
knocked them down. It was really, really huge for us.  
  
Then, you know, she didn't have -- you know, Lexi -- that's the kind of team
we have, where one player gets hot in one half, another player is hot in the
second half, and don't forget Lexi got to rest the second quarter. Lexi got
rest tonight other people didn't get because if I can keep a player on the
bench with two, I will; if I have to play them with two, I will. I just read
the situation, and we left her on the bench in the second quarter, so she did
get to rest in the second quarter.  
  
Q. Chante played 40 minutes, Kelly, 40 minutes, almost 38, how would you
describe how it is to come back and such a physical battle tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: They're tough people. I mean, they're really tough players. I
really would like to use the bench more deeply, and there's a reason why all
coaches get tighter at this time of the year, there's reasons that the bench
shorten this time of the year. There is no margin for error, the bench either
puts you in a place to have total confidence that they can play the same
minutes, and right now basically we have got an eight-player rotation, Kailah,
Mya. As a game, we have to play everybody. They're tough players. And if you
asked them, they like to play 40 minutes. Tomorrow they'll have to gut it out.  
  
And it is the only time all year, except for the preseason tournament, that
you play three in a row. We get through tomorrow night's game, they're not
going to have to play three in a row again or two in a row again. It is just
right back to the rhythms of the Big East Friday/Sunday weekends, which some
of us that like Friday/Sundays try to preach, this is how it will be in the
NCAA Tournament, it will be a Friday/Sunday situation, Thursday/Saturday,
Saturday/Monday.  
  
So we have one more game to gut through with our rapid-fire game after game
after game, and then it is going to get in the actual rhythms that the Big
East is preparing us for with our Friday/Sunday format.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way they had the (indiscernible)?  
DOUG BRUNO: It is amazing to watch young great players come out of high school
that most of them don't value rebounding, they just don't value it, they just
don't get it.  
  
You know, we put a real high emphasis on it here at DePaul. She's starting to
grasp it. She's a really, really athletic player. She's really explosive. And
once it starts dawning on you that every time you get a rebound for your team,
it is worth a point, even though it doesn't show up as a point in the box
score, it is huge.  
  
So for her to start rebounding this way, we need her to rebound this way.
We're a small basketball team. We need everybody to rebound this way on this
team. We got beat on the boards. We were beat most of the game. I'm pretty
sure -- I haven't looked at this yet -- that we did get beat on the
(indiscernible).  
  
Q. Seton Hall got 50 points in the paint, (indiscernible)?  
DOUG BRUNO: You know, they're strong in the paint. You know, we're just going
-- we got an hour shootaround tomorrow. Basically we can show videotape, we
can emphasize the concepts of guarding, you know, not letting the ball dribble
penetrate the way we did.  
  
We had six lay-ups, and we gave up six dribble-drive lay-ups in the second
quarter alone. That's 12 points. We're sitting 50-46 at halftime. That was
just at halftime, not talking about the (indiscernible) one on one, I'm just
talking about the bounces facing you going at the rim.  
  
I mean, that's got to change for sure. You know, we don't know who we'll play.
Each team brings a different -- each team brings a different way they get the
ball to the paint with Marquette being the big, strong team that gets inside,
and St. John's a team that drives it inside.  
  
You know, you got to get paint touches yourself, and you have to keep the
opponent from getting paint touches. I wish we had a magic wand to tell you
how to fix it. I don't know that we'll do everything we can to fix it. We do
understand we have to try to keep people out of there.  
  
Q. Is this how you expected this tournament to play out? Tomorrow, what
's the key for the team (indiscernible)?  
DOUG BRUNO: This is really a great league. The Big East is a great league.
What makes it great are teams -- I mean, like St. John's, Seton Hall, they're
easily better than many -- many teams in the 64-field team, those two teams
are much better than many teams are going to be in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We're playing against this kind of teams and players and coaches every night.
It is a great league. You know, it's -- you know, you're prepared by having to
play against this diverse group of coaches and players every night. As well as
the second part, what do I expect?  
  
Q. Looking ahead to each team, are you able to avenge --  
DOUG BRUNO: You have to be careful what you wish for. There are two really
good teams playing out there. You start wishing for one team, then you get
whacked upside the head by the other. They both bring great talent. And John's
guard are really hard to guard, all of them. Every one of them is a great,
scoring, penetrating guard. And they're small, like we are, and then Marquette
brings the size, really, really great players. And they bring a size and the
rebounding.  
  
You know, they're just doing a great job of being a team in this league that's
been the big dominating team. They have dominated the league with their size,
and they're the only team in the league that's really dominated with their
size, whereas St. John's is much more like us, much more of a guard-
penetrating basketball team.  
  
Both really tough basketball teams. I think it's pretty fair to say Marquette
is going to go to the NCAA Tournament for sure, and they'll be a really good
team in the tournament. And Coach Duffy has done a great job of earning their
way to that point.  
  
These are all teams worthy of being in the NCAA Tournament. I'm not sure
that's going to happen. They are worthy of playing that NCAA Tournament. It's
going to be a great game out here in the next couple of minutes, and we'll see
what happens.  
  
Thank you all for covering women's basketball. We really appreciate it.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2020

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

### [Shadeen Samuels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38970)

### [Desiree Elmore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38971)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 83, Seton Hall - 80  
  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Thank you, my friend. Yeah, it was a really good basketball
game. I give DePaul a lot of credit, as always. It was obviously well coached,
just foolish to say that.  
  
They just made one more shot than we did. It was a really good basketball
game. It's funny, I watch a lot of the other tournament championship games and
semifinal games, two leagues that think they are our level, and it's a joke.
Our league is a tremendous league. Any person that doesn't think that the Big
East is one of the best leagues in the country is a fool. These kids played
their heart out. It is exciting basketball. It is intense, physical, tough.
It's just tremendous.  
  
I'm proud of our players and proud of being in a great league. I'm proud that
DePaul will represent our league because they're a great team. I watch the
other leagues, anyone who thinks they're as good as our league is a fool. We
have really good teams and really good players. I know our resume doesn't look
like an NCAA team, but our team is an NCAA team.  
  
So enough with the resume. I know we're probably not going to get in. But when
I talk about our players and our team, very proud of them and proud of who
they are and what they do and everything about them.  
  
You know, these two young ladies to my right, especially Shadeen, because this
is her last year, have given me everything they could ever give me. They're
great human begins and great people.  
  
And I'm just proud of them. Yeah, I'm frustrated we lost. We're competitive.
We expected to win, and we wanted to win. We expected to win. This was the
first time in a few years we expected to win. That's a tribute to these girls.
It is not a knock on anyone, but a tribute to how good our team is. We lost to
a team that's 27-5. They're really good.  
  
Q. Wondering if you can describe the ebbs and flows of the game, highly
emotional game (indiscernible).  
SHADEEN SAMUELS: For me, it was -- it was fun. I had a lot of fun, especially
playing against DePaul. Every time we play them, I know it will be a tough,
physical game. You know, me and Stonewall, we always try to push each other in
the game and make each other do things we're not comfortable doing.  
  
I always have a good time playing against DePaul. I knew coming to this game I
had to give it all I had. I had nothing to lose. It was either win or go home.  
  
DESIREE ELMORE: Same thing as Shadeen just said. You know, especially me being
a junior, Shadeen is a senior, this is her last year. I just try to go out and
play as hard as I could for our seniors. This is it for them. That's it.  
  
Q. Desiree, obviously a great performance, the team as a whole,
(indiscernible)?  
DESIREE ELMORE: During shootaround our coach let us know that, you know, the
paint was going to be wide open, they can't guard us in the paint. Whenever we
catch the ball in the paint, go up strong, finish. And I just tried to execute
that. I think, like you just say, we did a very good job of that.  
  
Q. DePaul ran away in the fourth quarter (indiscernible)?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I think we defended a little harder. You know, really stayed
a little more focused. I think it is hard. In the regular season game, we got
really frustrated. In the first game at DePaul, we took a big lead, went to
that zone, and we got frustrated. We cut it to nine, turned the ball over.  
  
Another big thing, we only had 12 turnovers. One of the big things on DePaul's
game notes, which are really well done, it is just how much times they force
over 20 turnovers. Well, we haven't committed 20 turnovers against them yet
this year. That's a tribute to the kids on the team. And also having Lauren
Park-Lane in the back. She's tremendous. I mean, anyone who doesn't think she
is an All-Rookie player is just -- it's crazy.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) I know you said yesterday you thought your
(indiscernible) two-part question, that was really key to the assists, I also
just wanted to ask you about the strategy in the last second?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Yeah. I thought we moved the ball well. And that was a big
thing.  
  
I knew coming in, if we could really work the ball, DePaul really struggles to
guard inside, it's not their strength, their strength is forcing turnovers.
I'm like don't give the ball to them for a basket. We did a good job with
that.  
  
It's so funny. It's something I'm kicking myself, you know, why I didn't foul
at the end, because they have tremendous foul shooters. Kelly Campbell doesn't
miss. You know, all of them are just such great foul shooters. It's a three-
point game. If it was a two-point game, maybe I would have gambled they would
have missed one of two. There's no way with the percentages and odds -- I'm a
big statistic guy, so I study really well. There is no way statistically they
had anyone on the floor that was probably going to miss two foul shots.  
  
And only having one timeout, I could only advance it once. If I had two
timeouts, I certainly would have fouled, because I could have kept advancing
it. But I had one chance, one gamble. My gamble was either, you know, try to
stop them and call a timeout, which we did, or foul, hope they miss two and
call timeout. I'd be in the same position.  
  
I would have 14 extra seconds, 12 extra seconds. It wasn't going to benefit me
because I didn't have a timeout and I didn't need those extra seconds to be on
the floor anyway and given them more time to foul in the backcourt. That's why
I thought in the half court, they foul, we get lucky, we throw the ball up.  
  
You know, I really studied that statistically before. They're foul shooters.
They didn't have one kid that I thought would miss both shots. If I was down
two, I probably would have fouled. I would have had a 50/50 chance. They would
have had to miss both, and statistically they had nobody on the floor less
that was than 77%.  
  
Q. Coach, (indiscernible) highly about this conference, I wonder if you
can as a competitor (indiscernible)speak that program. They have accomplished
so much and yet there is this debate about whether they belong in this
conversation with Notre Dame. I wonder if you can talk about, you know, the
level of eliteness, I guess, of this program?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I would love to. I have so much respect for them. Obviously
Jeanie in the back. Everything about DePaul. I love playing DePaul. I wouldn't
be like -- if someone said they were going to the Pac-12, I would be -- I
would be upset. I enjoy competing against them. They set a standard.  
  
I mean, people don't understand -- can't appreciate how good DePaul is. I
always laugh because they will draw an NCAA Tournament or play in these other
tournaments, people are like preseason, NIT, playing the top team in the, I
don't know, the CAA. Oh, yeah, we'll play them.  
  
Okay, you wait until you play DePaul. You think you watch on tape, you think
have a clue on how DePaul will play you, you have no clue. You're smacked by
20 and 30. In the league, it is a little harder for them because we play
against them, our kids though them, and we're playing three times, you know,
but the whole system, what he's accomplished here, forget the win, how about
the consistency, the student-athletes. I mean, he's winning with student-
athletes. The consistency of their level, it is to me amazing.  
  
What we're trying to do at Seton Hall, you have been there seven years, you've
been there a long time. Seven years is not a long time. When I took over, it
was not in good shape. You know, we had a lot of success early, and then you
have to rebuild it and build it a certain way, and it is hard.  
  
So his consistency is amazing. That's something we strive for. We studied him.
You know, those of you in the room know we have tried to change our system, a
little more faster, very similar to him, you know. Now we're getting better
players. So we're not at their level yet, but we're getting there. You know, I
just -- having them in the conference is amazing, great, but having them
represent the conference is even better.  
  
I'm excited to see who they're going to play in the NCAA Tournament. I can't
wait for them to play this team, this team. You guys have no clue for what
you're in for. You know, if it wasn't for some bad luck, he would be in the
Sweet 16 numerous time or the Elite 8. You know, this is -- these games, in
the playoffs and stuff, there is a little luck involved, who is in foul
trouble, right match-up, on the road, stupid shot, you know.  
  
I mean, he just has been unlucky. I haven't seen him -- in seven years I have
been here, the six previous years, I haven't seen him win a game where he got
a break or he got a little lucky in the tournament. He hasn't been lucky yet.
You have to get lucky every now and then, and he will.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on (indiscernible) what she meant to the
program this year?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Shadeen made Second Team All-Conference. I understand
statistically, and maybe her play is why she did it, but she played against a
First Team All-Conference kid yesterday. Who is, Kristen Spolyar is. You know,
Shadeen locked her down.  
  
Shadeen is playing on one leg. She has a degenerative knee. It has been
difficult for her. She's gotten better and stronger. It is a hard year. She
missed five games. I think if she doesn't miss those five games, we go 5-0,
we're probably in the NCAA Tournament tournament.  
  
I never questioned her as a human being, as a competitor and most of all as a
student-athlete. She's represented us tremendously for four years. I'm not
going to -- I'll miss the points and rebounds. But like Doug says, you miss
the people a lot too.  
  
I'll miss her as a person. You know, we'll get some good players in here. I
don't know if we'll ever get people as good as Shadeen. She's a good person.  
  
I want to again -- I say this pretty much every year, and I don't say it for
any other reason than it is true. The people at DePaul, I say it to Jeannie
and say it to the Big East, people at DePaul treat me like it is my home team.
They do. From Frank, to every person that takes care of me, when I walk in,
they come over, they're genuine, hello, take care of us. The people are great.  
  
It is a reflection on Jeannie. She does a great job. It's a reflection on
DePaul. I say it because it is true. I do. I hope I can say it next year
whether I'm here or whether we're somewhere else. I'm only going to say it if
it is true. And it is true. The people here are as genuinely helpful and nice
as any people that I go to any arena at all. I want to thank them for that,
thank you for that.  
  
I want to thank you for covering women's basketball here. I started on that
thing, and I get a little angry because even us, we have some alumni that
think the Big East is a middling middle-level conference I was told. You're a
fool. The Big East is a really good conference. We have great teams. I don't
care if we get one team in, two teams, three teams, four teams in.  
  
I know Seton Hall is an NCAA team. We're not going to get in. We have good
players, and we compete hard. The other conferences, you have no way how good
our conference is. Yeah, Connecticut is coming in, it will make it even a
better conference. It is a damn good conference the way it is right now. Thank
you for covering it. Thank you.

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Leilani Correa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38959)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 70, Creighton - 54  
  
LEILANI CORREA: The way we started wasn't great at all, but I think our
defense is what really won the game for us tonight. Defense wins
championships. That's what I've grown up with, so just defense leading to
making shots and all of that is what led to the double-digit win tonight.  
  
Q. How much fun did you have?  
LEILANI CORREA: I had a lot of fun. I love playing with teammates. They're the
best. I really enjoyed playing with them.  
  
Q. After that first quarter, you sort of settled into the game and made
a comeback. What really changed? What was your message to the team?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think I took care of the frantic part in the first quarter
instead of them, but no, again, it was just more about being patient, tried
not to get on them too much, but we had to create some type of energy. I
thought a couple things that went our way were the couple deflections and some
energy plays I thought started to spark us a little bit.  
  
They're confident in themselves. They're resilient. They've been like that all
year. We've been down, as much as people talk about leads and things like
that, we've been down two now in the last few weeks and have been able to
really put it on and finish strongly.  
  
But no, I mean, listen, we knew we could score. I said it to them at the end
of the quarter. I'm like, guys, we've scored five points, we're going to lose
if you do that again, but we scored an average of over 70 a game, so relax, be
patient. I thought we did a better job of being patient. I thought we did a
better job of reading things, and then we had a few players get hot and make
some shots. That was the bottom line.  
  
We didn't manufacture as many points as I would have liked probably from the
line, which always helps you, but it was a crazy game, and the physicality and
the stoppages and everything else throughout, so it was a physical battle.
That was a war.  
  
Q. Who 's the spark on your team?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think Leilani obviously made some big steals. When she
missed the lay-up at the end of the quarter I was hurt, but she did a lot of
really good things. I think even Kadaja got some hands on the ball, Alissa,
and I thought Tiana played probably an undervalued game on paper in just
controlling the game.  
  
The beautiful part about our team, to have a freshman who can be probably a
starter, who becomes the Sixth Woman of the Year was a unanimous kid who can
drop 27 and 11 when your best player, quote, unquote, doesn't play well is a
testament to our group. Probably a few weeks ago we would have took ourselves
out of the game mentally, and I thought we didn't do that.  
  
So energy-wise, though, I think a few of those guys made some big plays and
made some shots. Tiana I thought got us sparked. The play in my mind is just
coming down the floor and the little pull-up in the lane. To me that was the
play that kind of changed I think the complexion of what we were doing, for
whatever reason in my head, but my head is whack, too, so just got to go with
that.  
  
Q. You knew this was going to be a physical game. How do you think you
guys handled that?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: To be honest with you, this was probably the most physical
game we've ever played against them. Usually it's not this bad. But both teams
were fighting, and that's okay, obviously, but I thought we handled it well. I
think it played to us a little bit at times. I think the physicality probably
played to us a little bit. I thought Alisha, I was worried about Alisha and I
was worried about trying to make sure we were going to have fresh legs, but
that's where Kadaja coming back in the second half and playing really hard,
especially in the fourth quarter really changed the game.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Obviously we want to compete and win. We've had some tough
match-ups with them this year, so they posed some things for us that we've got
to figure out. But that's the beauty of the game and you've got to play it. So
we're excited to get ready, and obviously we want to get out there and to be
able to play the best game we can play, that's the goal for tomorrow,
regardless of the win or loss but obviously we want to play the best game we
can play and obviously move on into the championship game.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 72, Villanova - 59  
  
HARRY PERRETTA: I thought it was a good game. I mean, they're a little more
athletic than we are. They played really good defense in the first half and
took us completely out of our offense. The second half I thought we did a much
better job of executing our offense. We got much easier shots. We were able to
get it to one, but at that point we made a couple defensive errors, and I
think we hit two threes and then we gave up two threes. At that point I
thought the game came down to that one little stretch of defense where I
thought we -- I don't want to say we let up. We just made defensive errors,
and they kept coming at us, and they did a really good job on the glass, which
we knew going into the game we were going to be in a deficit at that area.  
  
But so I thought we did the best we could. We're not a really good -- we're
not a great sustained offensive team. We kind of go up and down a little bit
like a roller coaster, and we made a good run there, but then -- and our
offense kind of gave out on us.  
  
Q. Take us through the locker room conversation after the game.  
HARRY PERRETTA: I just told them I thought they did a great job. I mean, all
year. I thought they did a fantastic job. I'm being honest; beginning of the
year, I didn't think we would win 10 games to be honest with you after the way
we started, and they really got themselves together. You know, I think they
got -- I think they got the most out of what they had, and a lot of teams
don't do that. They needed everything they could get. I just told them they
did a great job, and hopefully we'll play in two weeks from now in the WNIT,
but I was happy with their effort. I thought they gave a great effort.  
  
Q. This being your final Big East Tournament, I 'm sure a wide range of
emotions. Can you just describe how you're feeling right now?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I feel pretty good. I mean, I thought this team came in -- I
thought we were at a deficit in some areas, and I thought they did a great
job, and I thought our staff, my assistants did a really, really good job, and
I relied on them a lot for the scouting and the recruiting, but just fun to be
here. At some point you have to give it up, and this is the time to give it
up, and it's just great to be here in this venue, to be with all the Big East
people because the Big East has basically been my family like Villanova has
been my family. I think we joined the league the second or third year it
started, and I've been -- I knew Dave Gavitt really well, Tranghese, Marinatto
and now Val. All these people have been mentors to me and taught me, and it's
been like a real family for me, so to be in the Big East in the tournament is
kind of great.  
  
Q. Talk about what it 's like to see coach (indiscernible)?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I thought it was great for her. I told her she did a great
job, and she obviously learned a lot as a player and as a coach before, and
she's got them playing really hard, and I think that's the big key. Any coach,
the biggest key is to try to get your players to play hard and play together,
and she's done that, and when you do that, you're going to win X amount of
games given your talent level, and like I said, I thought she did a great job.
She looks like she communicates really well with them, looks like the kids
interact with her really well, so I watch all that stuff, and I just think she
showed a lot of maturity. Told me she's getting married. She waited a little
long. I waited until I was 42. At least she's doing it when she's 35.  
  
Q. What made it hard to stop Marquette on the defensive side in the
fourth quarter?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, I think physically they're just stronger than we are,
and I think we gave so much effort in the third quarter, I don't want to make
excuses. I thought we were a little tired in the fourth quarter. I wanted to
try to go zone, but we were afraid the 3-ball, they were shooting the 3-ball
half decent, and also you can't rebound out of the zone very well, especially
when you're outmatched physically. So I just felt like we were a little
fatigued, and it led to some defensive errors that we made. But they kept
running their offense. They didn't give up. They didn't quit running their
offense. They didn't start taking it one-on-one. They didn't panic, and that
shows a sign of maturity all the way from the coaching staff to their players.  
  
Q. What did you see from Jordan King in that first quarter when she had
that hot hand?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, I mean, like I said, she played the way she's capable of
playing. I don't want to say -- she forced us to make defensive mistakes. She
moved really well, and she just was really aggressive offensively. I thought
that was the difference in the two games. I mean, the first two games we
played we were always in contact with them. This game they were able to get up
double figures and made it a lot harder for us, and she was a big reason for
that early in the game.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 83, Butler - 57  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: I think overall, as I mentioned to the kids, I thought we had
a terrific season. It wasn't the best representation of ourselves. I thought
Seton Hall was fantastic. Anytime that you're able to make 16 threes in a game
and shoot the ball as well as they did -- I thought we had a good game plan
coming in, but when you have teams play like that, all the credit goes to
them.  
  
Q. Take me through kind of how some of your players have battled back
from injuries and have that tough grind to get to where you are right now.  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Yeah, it's been a very tough last three weeks. We've either
had somebody sitting out or been -- played with an injury. Naira dislocated
her finger in St. John's, and it's definitely messed with our rotations and
hurt our chemistry. But that's no excuse, and the girls know that. It's next
person up.  
  
I thought for the most part, we competed for most of the season. I'm not sure
that we really gave our best competitive effort tonight, but like I said,
Seton Hall is probably the most -- as far as being a 5 seed, the most
underrated 5 seed in this tournament with Shadeen and the way that Lewis is
shooting the ball and the way Jackson is shooting the ball. They're a very
dangerous, dangerous team when they have all those combinations going.  
  
I don't know how much it was about us tonight, more about what they were
doing. They were fantastic.  
  
Q. Tough way for Kristen to go out. What did you see from Seton Hall
defensively?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: It was kind of the same thing as last weekend. I thought
Shadeen did probably the best job that's been defended on her all season the
last two times that we've played them, and with her length and her size, she
makes it very difficult for Kristen to get much of anything going, and then
our offense for the last two times that we've played them has sputtered
because of that. When we're not able to get her going and get easy baskets
going, we've kind of struggled scoring the ball and then have a few breakdowns
here and there.  
  
But you know, Shadeen's length and size is what kind of really has bottled
Kristen up the last few times.  
  
Q. We talked earlier in the season and you spoke about the standards
that were laid last year, how that definitely carried into this season. You
had such a great start to conference play. I know this is a tough moment, but
can you reflect on this team and the fact that you could be a WNIT team coming
up here?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: And the foundation that they've laid? Well, I think what they
have done for the younger players is they've shown that growth that can start
from the beginning of a season to the end of a season. You know, our playbook
at the start way back in November was shrunk compared to what Whitney and
Toure and that group could really physically execute, and we just kept on
growing and adding and adding, so I think they've kind of laid that part for
the younger kids, as this is something that if you really are focused and are
disciplined and bought into doing this with your team, it's something that can
be accomplished.  
  
And then the big thing is having so many kids really learn our defensive
scheme. It took Toure and Whitney and Michelle two years to really get that,
and for what we've done in a short turnaround with that group, with Shae and
Kristen kind of helping guide them and Kat guide them was fantastic, so it's
something they can always fall back on with the younger kids; if you defend,
you're going to have chances to win.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Jaylyn Agnew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34788)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 70, Creighton - 54  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, I think you have to admire what St. John's did tonight, to
fall behind 20-5 to start the game and to fight like they did, and flip the
game obviously in the second quarter and then continue in the second half, I
thought they defended us really well. I thought Alston set a tone and KB on
the glass, and then obviously Correa was their go-to. She had a big second
quarter, and I told the staff at half, we needed to -- with Hoppie in foul
trouble, we needed to do a better job on her.  
  
But they obviously have a lot of weapons, so you just can't say, well, it's
just her. But I thought they defended us really well. We really struggled to
score, and I thought as we got tired, we obviously were a lot easier to guard.
So from my standpoint, I thought I regret probably not using our bench a
little bit more and not -- I thought we clearly got tired, but their defense
had a lot to do with what we looked like on offense.  
  
You know, every game you play them it could be somebody else. Last time it was
Hoppie first half, Alston second half. That's what makes them good and
dangerous.  
  
But really proud of this young woman to my right. She's -- I love her to
death. She's been a dream to coach, and she was tonight, too. I told our
younger players, just not that she's a great player but how she carries
herself and how she tries to lift her teammates was fully evident tonight, and
so hopefully she gets a chance to play in the tournament that we want to play
in because I think she deserves that, and our team, too.  
  
St. John's was clearly the better team tonight, but I think if we get a
chance, we can play a little better than that. But they deserved to win. I
thought they really fought and really guarded us well.  
  
Q. That award presented to you before the game, your teammates were all
riled up for you. What does that feel like? What was that moment like for
you?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Yeah, it was pretty cool. I feel like I much rather would have
won the game today than received that, honestly, but yeah, it was cool. Their
love for me is just -- I feel it every single day, so it's awesome to play
with people who support you no matter what. Yeah, it was fun to be with them
and share that moment with them.  
  
Q. That was a really physical game. I wonder if you could describe what
it was like out there.  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Yeah, like you said, it was physical. They pressured us. Like
Flan said, they played good defense. We knew the first two games they were
physical, as well, so we knew it was going to be a physical game, but we kind
of let that get to us. There's some tough plays that we could have made better
offensively and defensively. So yeah, we just have to -- looking forward, have
to try to match physicality or just to make tougher plays.  
  
Q. We 've heard about you and your career. Marissa Janning was watching
the game tonight and messaging us and she talked a little bit about the guy to
your left. Can you reflect on what he's meant to you?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Yeah, I might get emotional, but yeah, he's -- see? I'm very
emotional, so this is not surprising to me at all. I think the best thing
about Flan is that he cares for you as a person overall. He could give two
craps about basketball in the long run. So I think that's what really attracts
people to go to Creighton, especially I'll see him walking in the mall, and
he'll be like, hey, what did you learn today in class? Like simple stuff like
that. I don't know, I feel like not a lot of coaches would be the type to do
that, and he just -- he just cares for us so much.  
  
It's just been so fun to play for him, and I've learned so much from him. I
actually was telling someone this over this last year and this year, I feel
like I start to think like him now.  
  
JIM FLANERY: Is that a good thing?  
  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Like I said, I've learned so much from him on and off the floor,
and so I'm just really grateful to have been coached by him.  
  
Q. When you think about the pedigree of this league and what you 've
done in it, what would you say about the NCAA Tournament case you have now?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, I mean, we've won -- I think we've won nine top-100 games
and we haven't lost a game outside the top 100. Unfortunately in my next life
I'll probably be an SID because I'm a numbers guy, and as much as I tell
myself not to look at the RPI and not to look at the nitty-gritty, Kathy is
nodding her head because she was on the committee, it's just addictive. It's
like caffeine in the morning, you get in and you're like, don't look, don't
look, don't look, and then you look, and you see where you are and you see
where St. John's is and you see where -- and so I just know -- I mean, again,
this is not to discredit St. John's because I thought they played great, but I
hope we get another chance because I think we're better than we played.  
  
Again, not to make excuses, but Tatum missed a lot of times and Jaylyn missed
four games, and we haven't probably improved as much the last two months, I
know I've talked to you about that, as I would have hoped just because we
haven't had the best practice situation. But everybody deals with that, I
understand.  
  
But I do think we're a good basketball team, and because Jaylyn is such a
great player, what we have around her and what we have around her is good
enough. Yeah, it's a great league. I said -- nothing against the bottom three
teams, but I felt like this tournament was -- any of seven teams could have
won this tournament. But I knew it was going to be hard because you've got to
beat three good teams.  
  
But yeah, I mean, I'll put our r�sum� up against those other teams, and our
non-conference scheduling. I think that's one thing that we do, we play -- we
go to, we went to Drake, we went to South Dakota, and I know Harry would say,
try going to UConn; South Dakota what? But those are really hard places to
play and win, and we went to Arizona State and we don't have any bad losses.
Not one. I think if you --  
  
So maybe our ceiling isn't what some teams are, but our basement I think is a
lot higher than a lot of teams, too. So thanks for that question, too.  
  
Q. I know you 'll have some time to reflect on Jaylyn's career after
this is all said and done, but just your initial thoughts? What has she meant
to you?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, well, her freshman year she texted me on Christmas morning,
and when you're the head coach, you don't usually get those from players until
you text them, and now my assistant coaches probably do because they don't
yell at them as much as I do, but I kind of knew at that point that she was
pretty special because she doesn't -- nothing you say carries over beyond when
you say it, on the practice court or in the game, whatever, no criticism that
you have, she lets it go. And she's a tremendous includer. I think one of the
great tenets of leadership I think for 20-ish-year-old females is being
inclusive, and that's who she is.  
  
So I have two kids, I have a 10-year-old boy and a six-year-old daughter. So
when my daughter, when they come to practice, everybody goes and talks to
Brynn because she's six and she's cute, but she does that and then she goes to
my son, who is kind of hanging in the back because he's too awkward, and she
goes -- so she moves from my daughter to my son, and to me that's an example
of how inclusive she is. She understands that everybody is valuable, and so
when you have that -- when you know you have that in the locker room, you know
that your freshmen are taken care of because it's not just that Liv, who's her
three-year roommate and fellow fifth-year senior is her good friend, but they
all are, and I love that she's so inclusive that she brings my kids valentines
to take home. So that's special to me. I've coached great kids, but that's
special because she just thinks about people differently than a lot of kids
her age who think about their phones more than they think about the people
around them.  
  
I don't think she takes people for granted, and that's what I -- and she's
worked really hard to get this good, too. Like I mean, she wasn't -- we
redshirted her freshman year because we didn't know -- she wasn't quite good
enough, and look at where she is today. So she's worked really hard.  
  
Q. I just want to touch on the game today. You knew it was going to be a
physical match-up; it was. Take me through how they were able to play against
that?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, Joe does a great job of taking what they can do
defensively, and we've had a lot of real -- I felt like it would be closer
just because we've had so many close games with them. But I think he and his
staff do a great job of getting their team prepared to guard, and they know
how to score, too. They take advantage of match-ups, and I think it's his best
-- since we've been here, I think it's his best offensive team, too. They're a
handful to guard, especially when they go small, and I knew it was going to be
one of those -- either we were going to go small and they were going to go
small right after it or they were going to go small and we were going to go
small. It was a guards game. But I thought they -- their players know our
players personnel-wise pretty well, and I thought they were pretty attentive
to what they needed to do.  
  
And like I said, I thought once we got -- our boom in the first quarter was
great, but I thought when we got tired, and that's why I said, my regret is I
didn't play our bench more because you kind of go into the game thinking
you've got to trust your older players, but you've got to be able to evaluate,
and the fact that we got off to such a good start I think probably froze me in
terms of -- because I felt like, gosh, these guys are playing so well
together, and then I didn't get some of those kids in until the second
quarter, and they were probably a little tighter based on that.  
  
I think you look at our two freshmen post players who normally get in in the
first quarter didn't get in, and now it's probably a little bit tougher for a
freshman to be effective when they're sitting longer than they normally are.
Anyway, Glenn says I can talk a lot. I left the question somewhere.  
  
But I think they do a really good job of knowing what your strengths are.
Right?

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Megan Duffy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16260)

### [Lauren Van Kleunen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38954)

### [Jordan King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38955)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 72, Villanova - 59  
  
MEGAN DUFFY: I'm just thrilled, obviously, in March to get a win no matter how
ugly or how pretty it looks. I thought our team was able to just keep our
composure when Villanova continued to make different runs throughout the game,
and I just can't tell you how proud I am of just this overall group for
individually making plays, whether it was on the defensive end or offensive
end to get this win today.  
  
Q. I saw you guys going crazy when your coach got her Coach of the Year
Award. What 's the best thing she's done to prepare you for March?  
JORDAN KING: I think just giving us confidence and the way that she believes
in us is something very special, and I think each one of us understands that
in a different way, and I think just like we're really excited to keep playing
this March, especially for all of us and our coach, too. So I just think that
the way that she's believed in us and our resiliency has been the biggest
thing.  
  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yeah, I'd also offer just the preparation that she does
with herself and the coaching staff has just been phenomenal for us, and
again, that gives us that confidence to go out on the floor, and we know
basically everything we need to do to get that win.  
  
Q. How were you able to withstand all those Villanova runs in the
third?  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yeah, we just understood that basketball is a game of
runs, so we understood that, and we just kept fighting, we kept our composure,
we didn't get down on ourselves, and we knew if they're going to go on their
runs, we're going to go on ours. So we just kept confident with each other and
understood with who we have, we can make plays when we need to.  
  
JORDAN KING: I think another point off that would be our toughness inside with
the post players. I think loose balls and rebounds, that is what will keep us
in games when they're going on runs. I think to get stops is important. So
just our overall toughness is something that kept us in that game.  
  
Q. I know winning Coach of the Year, first year, take me through when
you guys first met her what she was like, what your expectations were until
now?  
MEGAN DUFFY: That's a loaded question. We still have a game tomorrow.  
  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: So when I first met her, I just -- it was like -- it was
great. It was a joy to meet her, just a bunch of energy, and just wanted to
get up and down -- our first workout she was running up and down with us. It
was awesome to see that and awesome to see how much she loved the game, loved
us, and we had met her not even a day. You could just see that caring side of
her, and it was awesome to see that and awesome to have that.  
  
And then just kind of throughout, we weren't really sure what was going to
happen. She just said, we're just going to take it one game at a time, one
practice at a time, and she gave us that confidence throughout the summer and
into the fall and now the winter and spring.  
  
So it's been great obviously getting to know her off the court, too. She's
really big about that in terms of the student-athlete part, and I think that's
huge for being able to coach us on the court.  
  
And it's just been a lot of fun. Certain things, she doesn't care about how
many points you score or anything like that. It's the intangibles to her. Are
you working hard, giving effort. It's really fun to have a coach like that.  
  
JORDAN KING: Yeah, so I'm in a different position than her. So obviously I
didn't get to see her right away with workouts and stuff but I think the very
first conversation that I had with her when she got the job was just, I could
see like the determination that she had for this program and the way that she
believed into those five returners stepping into new roles. And then us
freshmen coming in, I think just the way that she believed in all of us to
come together is something really special.  
  
And then Lauren touched on it, like her energy in practice and just all around
her as a person, I think her energy has been really great for us in this
journey.  
  
Q. Lauren, talk about that three (indiscernible)?  
LAUREN VAN KLEUNEN: Yes. You know, it was -- me and So were kind of in a ball
screen, and I wasn't sure if she was going to pull it, and I saw out of the
corner of my eye that the clock was ticking down. Even though I don't shoot in
games, I do work on threes. So I knew -- we were talking to Coach just after
the game, and she goes, "In March you make plays." When it left my fingers, I
knew it was going in, but it was cool to see one go down for me, so yeah, I
was excited, and I was glad it went in.  
  
Q. The look you gave Lauren when she said she knew it was going in when
it left her fingers, did you know it was going in?  
MEGAN DUFFY: I mean, she had to shoot it. She's actually a really good
shooter. With our offense she probably doesn't get as many opportunities - or
any opportunities - to shoot the threes as much as she's probably capable. And
it's interesting, a few plays before we ran a little pick-and-pop action for
her to get her a 15-footer and she airballed it. I think it's indicative of
kind of who they are and just those two standing up, I'm just so proud of
their resiliency to bounce back.  
  
Nova is so hard to play against with their style and you get a little tight,
and I thought we were a little tight at times to start the game, a little
anxious, but to see that ball go through the net on the three, I think it was
just part of many pieces of making plays in this game by different people.  
  
Q. Your team responded really well coming out of time-outs. What do you
say to them? What is your formula when you 're in time-out?  
MEGAN DUFFY: I'll tell you what, we've gotten so much experience this year by
playing different styles and being down and being up and being able to execute
in late-game situations or out of a time-out. I have kind of an annoying
memory of all that stuff, so I try and reference different things of like,
hey, here's our time to make our run or hey, we just worked on this in
practice yesterday or back on Tuesday or back on December 12th. To give them
that confidence of hey, let's just take a deep breath and execute, and I
thought we did -- I don't think our execution -- we'll watch the film tonight,
was perfect, but I thought the way we did it timely, allowed us to win that
game. And they were locked in, and like any other team, we have a set of money
plays that we run when we need a quick basket.  
  
Q. I thought you guys early on were very aggressive on the boards. Were
you more instinctual or do you drill a lot? Just talk about that.  
MEGAN DUFFY: Yeah, we've held our hat on just the ability to rebound,
especially because we are a little bit bigger than everybody and just our
motors. But what was interesting I thought the whole first half, we were
crashing and I felt like we got nothing out of it. The ball was getting tipped
out of bounds. We were throwing the thing over the basket at times I felt
like, and I thought finally we settled down and continued to crash the glass
and continued to get rebounds, but we started executing out of that a little
bit more, which helped us.  
  
Yeah, that first quarter I think we were just so amped up to be here, and we
had to wait a little bit to play, but it's been our bread and butter all year
and it's something we emphasize and talk about on a daily basis, whether it's
our guard play or our posts being able to create extra possessions. I think
that's a little bit of what they alluded to with their confidence of when we
know we have a team who's going to hit the glass hard, you can kind of let
that thing fly and shoot some shots and not be afraid to miss a shot because
you've got your teammates around you that are ready to get extra possessions
for you.  
  
Q. Jordan (indiscernible) hot hand. What did you see from her,
especially this being her first trip to the Big East?  
MEGAN DUFFY: She's been great the last couple weeks. One of the things that
her and I have talked kind of privately about is we're not going to wait until
the end of the season to kind of reflect on your freshman year. We're going to
continue to give you new challenges and continue to give you different parts
of our offense that I think you can take advantage of from the offensive end.
And she's a big-time scorer, and some of her numbers maybe haven't shown that
all year, but after that DePaul game on Sunday where she came out in a very
similar way in the first quarter with just a different look in her eyes, she
really carried that momentum.  
  
And for a freshman like I said to play point guard for me, I'm always yelling
at her, always just challenging her to have the composure to now be an
offensive threat a little bit more and just score is tremendous. You know,
just she's just a composed kid. She doesn't get too high or too low and even
during their freshman year, where they're going to hit some really, really low
moments because it's hard, she really has stayed steady, and she's had that
positive demeanor about her.  
  
Her best basketball is still ahead, but it was so great to see her again have
another great start to help our team.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
MEGAN DUFFY: Man, she was great for us, just settling us down, and I trust her
so much on the floor, and even her and Camryn Taylor had a great one-two punch
tonight, just being able to get them a little bit of rest when they hit a
wall. Obviously Lauren is a tremendous player, she's getting her opportunity
to do some great things for us, but she's been a huge mentor for Camryn Taylor
and that entire post group.  
  
One of the greatest kids I've met. She's a kid you root for and maybe we'll
set up a play for her tomorrow to hit another three or something, who knows.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Jim Crowley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32727)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 97, Providence - 59  
  
JIM CROWLEY: Obviously all credit to DePaul. Very challenging day for us, but
that's what they do. They make it very challenging with how hard they play and
how many offensive threats they put on the floor the whole time.  
  
Really they don't get enough credit for their defense. They force you into
speeding up, creating extra opportunities, and really make it just an
unpleasant day for you.  
  
Q. Last time you were here against DePaul, you were down at least 10 at
halftime. What was the difference between that game and today?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, we were actually down five with two and a half minutes to
go in the third quarter. I didn't think we had the same legs that we had in
that game, and we weren't able to contest shots at the level that we did that
game. So I think that set us back, especially in that second quarter. They had
a couple threes in a row and we just couldn't really get any footing
offensively. When they hit a few, they're going to hit a dozen, so we just
could never really recover from that.  
  
Q. That second quarter, it just seemed like you guys did a good job
hanging in there for a while, but once they got that pressure going, just the
challenges to try and stay in it during that run that seemed like it was a
turning point in the game?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, that's what they do. We certainly turned it over, but we
had offensive shots that were turnovers, where we played way faster than were
comfortable and beat the press and then tried to take another shot or took a
few threes in a row - even at the start of the third quarter we did that -
that didn't go in. They know how to turn those into points really well, and
they recognize when that's happening, and they did a great job of creating
separation we just couldn't catch up to.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday you guys are banged up, a little more banged
up now after a second game. How are those players?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, I think they're all right. Obviously they have some time to
recover now, but tough break for both of them. They had had solid sophomore
years, so they'll recover and be ready for next year.  
  
Q. Your perspective right now from the beginning of the season to now
and looking ahead to the future, just the growth of this team, what you 've
seen, what you've liked, what you're going to work on for next year?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, clearly we're in a decent place with ability, but we have a
lot of work to do with some other things, and we're excited for that
opportunity. We've got to just realize that one year older doesn't make you
one year better. We've got a lot of catching up to do, so we've really got to
work hard with that, which we're looking forward to, and excited to see who's
on board with that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Chante Stonewall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36700)

### [Deja Church](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37021)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 97, Providence - 59  
  
DOUG BRUNO: It's always the players, and I thought our players had great
energy today and great readiness to play. Providence, Jim does a great job
with his team, and it's unfortunate that a great player like Mary Baskerville
was not able to play. So you always feel for an athlete when they can't play.  
  
So we're playing a Providence team that was under -- they lost a really,
really important player, and yet our players can't control that. Our players
can only control what they bring to the table and their energy and their
focus, and I just was impressed with the energy and focus that our players
brought today.  
  
I just am happy for our team that we got a badly needed W, and then we live to
make the semis and play a very good Butler or Seton Hall team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Both of you, it seemed like the defense really picked it up in that
second quarter, the midway mark. That appeared to be the turning point of the
game, the 15-2 run. Talk about the defensive effort that led to a lot of
points offensively during that run.  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I felt like our team really locked in, understood the game
plan and understood what we needed to do to have Providence speed up. And even
though we might not have got turnovers right away in the front court, we
ultimately got it in the back court.  
  
DEJA CHURCH: Definitely we just tried to speed them up, and our whole game
plan going into the game was just applying pressure and just staying
consistent with the pressure, and eventually our stops on defense just led us
to good looks on offense.  
  
Q. Are you more hungry to get back out on the court and play a game or
were you happy to have that week to practice?  
DEJA CHURCH: Well, it's been 15 days since we won a game. Obviously this feels
good for us. But I mean, win or loss, we're excited to get back in the gym and
get back to work.  
  
I mean, yeah, we dropped two, but we were excited for this opportunity, and
yeah, it feels good, but now we're focused on tomorrow.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I'm always excited for game day. Practices are great, but
it's nothing compared to a game day.  
  
Q. This is Chicago, where you guys play. Obviously a lot of fans in
here, a packed gym. How have you been able to get into that mindset, that
tournament mindset of possibly four days in a row?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I would kind of give all the credit to my experience playing
with DePaul and being able to play in this tournament so many times for so
many games. So I feel like my experience over the years has really helped me,
and like I said, this is the most exciting time of the year, so that's what
puts me in a good mindset.  
  
DEJA CHURCH: I think for me, just coming into this program since the first day
I got here, Coach and my teammates always preached that we play for March, so
I think throughout the season that's just been kind of like everyone's
motivator for us to keep going. So now that it's actually March, I think just
a whole new mindset has clicked in everyone's head, and I feel like we're a
different team now, so yeah.  
  
Q. Late in the game when you guys were on the bench and there were a lot
of other players that were getting their time, you guys were really almost
being cheerleaders for them. What does it mean to see some of the other
players who don 't get as much time to play, for you to get to watch them?  
DEJA CHURCH: Yeah, I mean, we're so close. We have great chemistry on our
team. So just to see our teammates, our sisters on the court getting what they
deserve and what they worked hard for is exciting for us. I mean, when I was a
freshman, upperclassmen did the same thing for me, so it's normal and natural.
Like I'm just so excited to see my teammates go out there.  
  
CHANTE STONEWALL: Speaking off what Deja said, it's a great answer, but I feel
like since I'm a senior, this is the future for DePaul, so to see them take
this tradition that we built for them, specifically Kelly and I, it's just
great to see our leadership and how they put it out on the floor just like we
do.  
  
Q. When you 're beating a team like Providence by 30-plus throughout
much of the game, what does your focus shift to as far as what you're telling
your players to focus on, and obviously you don't let up, but what are you
telling your players?  
DOUG BRUNO: We're really focusing on getting better with every possession. We
talk to our players a lot. Unfortunately, there are some times when we're on
the other end of that score, and then there's times when we're on the top end
of that score, and we try to teach our players to never play to the score,
play to the possession and work to get better in every possession. You know,
we have a saying here, there's no such thing as garbage time, there's only
getting better time.  
  
So every player on the floor, you've been given gifts from God, you owe it to
yourself and your teammates to play to your God-given potential and work to
get better, and that's what we talk about, and then we talk about how to do
it. So what you have to do to get better.  
  
Q. I asked the players about that second quarter stretch. It seemed like
that turned the momentum.  
DOUG BRUNO: There's no question. We're a small team, and when you're small,
you have to do something different, and so we've been pressuring all year
long, and the pressure is there for a reason, and we've gotten pretty good at
the pressure, and it's hard -- you make stops, you get some steals, you speed
up the opponent, and you still have to knock down shots. This beautiful game
is connected from defense to offense and offense to defense, so you create
multiple possessions by the pressure, but you still have to make shots. So I
think things got clicking.  
  
The question that somebody asked about -- believe me, these players want to
get back on the court. When you -- Chante answered it pretty well. You always
want to get right back on the court, but when you get knocked upside the head
in any game, the best thing that can happen is to get back not just on the
court for practice, you want to get back in and play a competition. The way
this has worked out for us, we got beat on a Sunday and didn't get to play
until a Sunday, and then we got beat on a Sunday and didn't get to play until
a Saturday. So basically these players have had a lot of time to have to
mentally deal with the fact that they'd been defeated, and that's not easy,
and you'd rather be playing immediately after a defeat than not playing.  
  
So I think that all kind of ties together. I think this group is really ready
to get back on the floor and get back to playing basketball.  
  
I've been reminding these players for 14, 15 days that, okay, we've gotten
beat twice, but we only one of 14 teams in the country that have won 25 guys.
You're the guys that won 25 games. You won 25 games and there's only 14
schools in the country. If my math is right, you could look it up, I was
telling them before these tournaments all started, there was 13 or 14 of us
that have won 25 games. So you did that, so let's just get back to doing what
we've been doing.  
  
Q. Deja talked about playing for March. Is there a switch that flips, or
is there anything that changes on your end or the players ' end when you're
entering this time?  
DOUG BRUNO: We really try to keep it consistent. I mean, the fundamental
functions that travel well, that help you win road games are defensive
rebounding. Everybody thinks about the ball - all we do is shoot, all we do is
shoot threes, all we do is score. But we work very hard to defend because we
shoot quickly and we give the ball back to the opponent. We're not going to
have great defensive metrics ever, ever, ever. But at the same time, we really
do work hard to defend, and we work hard to rebound. I didn't think we
defended or rebounded real well in the last couple ballgames, but you try to
keep that consistent all year, and you try to -- I hate to use the word
"sell," all right, but coaches have to convince their teams that this is what
travels. This is what helps you win road games. This is what helps you win in
the Tournament. It's not just shooting rainbows of threes and letting all the
threes drop. You still have to defend and rebound, and especially at
tournament time.  
  
We really don't try to change. We really want to keep it the same. We just
want to be better-same.  
  
Q. Is there any fear or apprehension where the team is feeling from last
year where you had incredible success at the Big East Tournament and then
faced a lost in the first round?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, you can't coach scared, and you can't have players that are
afraid. So we really -- I don't coach scared, and I don't try -- we really try
to teach our players to be fearless. How are coaches fearless? I think coaches
demonstrate their fearlessness by who they schedule. So we schedule a non-
conference schedule that's got really good teams on it. If you're afraid, you
schedule teams that you know you can beat.  
  
We try to engrain in our players that you have to be fearless. Our great
friend Kris Kristofferson who wrote "Bobby McGee," freedom is just another
word for nothing left to lose, and you can't win scared. You can't coach
scared. You can't be afraid. You have to be fearless, and every time you step
on the floor no matter who you're playing against.  
  
Actually, no. I'm just really, really looking forward to playing again
tomorrow against a really good Butler or Seton Hall team and seeing if we can
have our mojo right, our defense right, our rebounding right, our togetherness
right and live to play another day.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Tony Bazzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38945)

### [Alexis Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38946)

### [Lauren Park-Lane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38947)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 83, Butler - 57  
  
TONY BOZZELLA: First of all, congratulations to Butler. 19 wins, certainly an
NIT team. They have some tremendous seniors. I mean, obviously Kristen and the
rest of their -- Shae Brey, tremendous, Strong, Katherine Strong. They're
tremendous players. I knew we would have to beat them numerous times in this
game for us to have a chance. And I thought our kids defensively were really
locked in. They drew those charges, get her a little frustrated. It's hard.
She's a great player, and I thought we did a good job on both her and Strong,
and really dictated the game on the defensive end. I know we just talked about
the three-pointers, but our defense won the game for us.  
  
And our kids were locked in all week. They understood the scout, they
understood what we needed to do, and they executed it. I'm very proud of them.
Obviously the two young ladies on my right but all the girls, from the kids
who didn't play to the kids who played. I'm proud of them.  
  
I'm happy to represent Seton Hall. It's extremely important for us to
represent the school in a positive manner all the time, and these young ladies
have that done all year. I'm really happy for them. It's been a hard year.
It's a long season, it's a hard year, and our girls earned this win today, and
we're excited to be in the Final Four of the Big East, and we look forward to
competing against a great team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Alexis, back a few months ago when you guys had Creighton at home, it
was one of the first games you really kind of lit it up. And Coach told us
that you came to him and said, listen, this is on me. You took accountability.
What have you changed since then that has allowed you to progress?  
ALEXIS LEWIS: I mean, honestly, I don't really think I've really changed
anything. I think I kind of just realized I'm a senior. You know, I think it
started to kick in, I'm a senior, this is all I have, this is it for me. So
from then on, like I told him, I had his back. So I got in the gym extra, got
shots up. Make sure I focused in practice and did what I had to do to get us
to this point, to get us to the semifinals.  
  
Q. Lauren, this is your first Big East Tournament game yet you looked
like you 've played a bunch of these. What was your mindset that gave you so
much success in this game?  
LAUREN PARK-LANE: Well, I love playoff games, and I just told myself to play
with a lot of confidence. That's what Coach B tells me to do, and play my
game, and that's what I came out and tried to do today, and it worked, and we
got the win.  
  
Q. Alexis, what can you say about a freshman point guard doing what she
did in this game?  
ALEXIS LEWIS: At this point she's not even a freshman anymore. It's not about
that. She's a Division I basketball player at Seton Hall, and that's how she
played today.  
  
Q. Through this season, you won 't be a freshman anymore, but being as
though you were, what have you learned from the seniors and the upperclassmen
to get you here?  
LAUREN PARK-LANE: Really, I've learned from them like work hard and really to
just be myself. You know, our seniors, they do a really good job with playing
their game and getting everyone else involved, so we don't feel like freshmen
or like newcomers out there. We feel like a part of the team -- we felt like a
part of the team from the beginning.  
  
So I felt like our seniors did a really good job of that. We all have a really
good relationship with each other, so I feel like it showed today.  
  
Q. What will be the keys for you guys versus DePaul tomorrow?  
TONY BOZZELLA: Well, if we make 16 threes tomorrow, you know DePaul is going
to make 10 to 20 threes. It's going to be a lot of threes. We've just got to
understand it's a new day, a new game. We have to defend them. And be strong
in our convictions of what we want to do. DePaul takes away everything that
you want to do, or tries to at least, and we can't allow that. They beat us
twice this year in two very competitive games. Obviously they're playing at a
high level like they always do, and we know it's going to be a tremendous,
tremendous battle.  
  
But we've got to be able to defend them. We just can't give up easy baskets.
They're going to make hard shots, they're going to make some difficult shots,
and we can't get discouraged by that. That's why they're a great team.  
  
But we've got to share the ball on offense, as well, make the extra pass;
they're going to double us in the post like they do all the time. We've got to
either go up strong or pass the ball out and then make the next pass, and I
think if they try and double us in the post, we're going to get a lot of wide-
open shots. And I know our girls are shooting the ball with a lot of
confidence, so they'll make those wide-open shots.  
  
Q. You said before the season that this freshman class was beyond their
years. Alexis just alluded to it. What makes them such?  
TONY BOZZELLA: I think they play with confidence. Those two young ladies in
our back court, obviously Mya played well today, too. But Lauren, she is a
confident young woman. She walks on the court and people are like, oh, look at
her, she's so tiny and everything, and she plays with tremendous heart. They
couldn't even press us when she was in the game. She scored 17 points; that
was irrelevant to the point. She walked on the floor and she was confident,
and when your leader is confident, you're going to play confident. And that's
what she did. That's what she's done all year. That's what she does. She's a
freshman. She doesn't miss practice, she doesn't miss a game, she didn't ask
to come out. That's who she is.  
  
She was the starting point guard on the No. 1 team in the country in AAU, all
she did pass the ball. She was the starting point guard on the team that won a
state championship in Delaware and hit the winning shot. So she does what she
needs to do because she's a confident young woman because she works hard for
it. She was raised the right way. She's pushed all the time at home. That's
why when she's pushed here, she can handle it.  
  
Q. I 'm curious about this past week, having just played Butler a week
ago and that game being a lot closer than this one. Just take us through what
your game plan was getting into this one.  
TONY BOZZELLA: You know, when you get to my age, you have a lot of experiences
in life, and we had a very difficult experience last year when we played St.
John's here. We had just beaten them on that Saturday and had swept them in
the regular season, and we came in and we had okay practices that week -
wasn't great, wasn't bad, but we didn't prepare for any changes or anything.
And I said to myself, I'm going to learn a valuable lesson if that ever
happens again.  
  
We prepared in every single way for whatever Butler was ready to show us. So
our girls were locked in, understanding that again, we have to play way better
than what we just played, and from the first -- that Sunday night after we
beat them to every single day that we've met, talked, emailed, texted and
everything, we've talked about what Butler might do or will do, and I said
we'll never make that mistake again. And last year Coach Tartamella gave me a
great lesson and I learned from that lesson, because our kids, we were going
to make sure they were prepared, and Lauren, Jos�, Marissa and the entire
staff did a great job of getting these kids ready and prepared and showing
them what we needed to show them, and I made sure that they understood that
this was never going to happen again, and to their credit, they came out and
they were locked in.  
  
I mean, I thought Desiree played fantastic. She drew three, four charges. She
was emotional, she was into the game, she made some great passes. Obviously
Shadeen tonight, what she did, and it was fun to watch them play today. It
really was.  
  
Q. You kind of grabbed Kristen and a couple other players. What were you
saying to them?  
TONY BOZZELLA: I have a lot of respect for Butler. Kurt does a great job. It's
hard. It's hard to win the Big East, to win 19 games. He had a great team last
year. It really, in my opinion, was an NCAA team. He lost two great players,
and they still came out and won 19 games. And I told Kristen, I said, here's a
young lady that wasn't super highly recruited, played as a third or fourth
wheel, tore her ACL, rehabbed it, came back and scored over 500 points and was
a first-team all-conference player. That's fantastic. I'm so -- she's not my
kid, but I'm proud of her. I really am.  
  
Katherine Strong, really showed a lot of toughness and really was a big part
of their defensive mindset, tears her ACL last year, as they're going to go to
the NCAA Tournament. Comes back in less than a year and plays her heart out
and plays so strong and so hard.  
  
And Shae Brey is so underappreciated because she doesn't score 20 points a
game, but she passes the ball, she defends, she talks, she tries hard, and I
have to give those kids credit. I have a lot of respect for Butler. It's hard
to play in the Big East, and it's a tough league, and I just shared that with
them.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

### [Raven James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38912)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Villanova - 64, Xavier - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome in the Villanova Wildcats, a career high in points
and three-pointers for Raven James today. A couple of notes about the
Villanova Wildcats as they advance 64-56 over Xavier. They'll play No. 2 seed
Marquette tomorrow night. Villanova's first advancement in the tournament
since 2015. Villanova improves to 3-1 in overtime this year. Villanova has won
15 of 16 all time meetings against Xavier.  
  
We'll open it up first with an opening statement from Coach then questions for
Raven.  
  
HARRY PERRETTA: Yeah, I told the kids before the game that we have to play
good defense. The problem is our offense. We just don't score the ball. We
pass it pretty well. We get some open looks, but we're so inconsistent at
shooting the ball. I have no idea from game to game who's going to make shots.  
  
I've been on Raven like the last two weeks to shoot more threes because her
form is really good. She just doesn't look to shoot the ball. So today,
luckily, she did shoot the ball. Then the three-pointer at the end, we made a
mistake. We went for a jab step when a two-pointer couldn't hurt us, and we
gave up a three to tie the game.  
  
I was very impressed that we rebounded and won the game in overtime. I thought
at that point, we might be done at that point, to be honest with you, but they
did a really good job in overtime -- they made more shots in overtime than I
think they may have made in some of the quarters. Things like that, you just
have to work on and try to do your best. That's all.  
  
Q. Raven, Coach just mentioned it right there, that he 's been on you
with making -- taking and making more threes. Is that something that you
really have worked on even more so coming into this tournament?  
RAVEN JAMES: I mean, yes, like every day -- before practice, after practice, I
just try to get threes up. Like I'm always a pass first point guard, and I
usually look to Maddy or Mary or even Bridget, just to get those points on the
board, and I realize, like, we just need another scorer and just a chip in,
whether it's five, eight, however many points.  
  
I just knew that I could be a threat from the outside if I believed in myself,
and so did my team.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind with those last -- those two threes
in overtime?  
RAVEN JAMES: Through the whole game, I just knew where the sweet spot was for
me. It was on the right wing, and I just knew that off the reversal it was
going to be open. If my feet were set, then I knew I could make that shot.
Yeah, my teammates found me in the nice spots where I like to shoot it. They
just kept telling me to shoot the ball, and I was ready.  
  
Q. Coming from a player 's perspective, when Coach is talking about
inconsistencies on offense and shooting and you're not sure who's going to be
the star that day or what have you, how is it, and how are you able to kind of
rely or take the team on your back?  
RAVEN JAMES: Just constantly talking to our younger players -- and we're all
young -- and just said from the beginning of the season, we're all in a new
position here and we're all on the same level. So just really grasping that
leadership role and constantly talking to my teammates on and off the court.
We said, just coming into the game today, like it was about having fun and
about not giving up. Even when things went south, we just kept pushing each
other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Raven, thank you very much. We'll reset here and take questions
for Coach.  
  
This is the first overtime game in the Big East Tournament since 2018, the
first round, when Butler defeated Providence 73-67. It's the third overtime
game in the tournament since reconfiguration.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of mentioned in your opening statement you didn 't
think the team was going to come out in overtime after they hit the three. How
would you describe their ability to regroup after the buzzer and come back and
win?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I was really impressed. I've watched these kids play all year,
and they don't normally do that. They play really well. They play hard, but
that was the kind of game I thought was a mental game and we were kind of
really out of it. I thought that three-pointer might have been the dagger to
push us over the edge, but it wasn't. I really give them a lot of credit. They
took their time in overtime. Raven looked to shoot the ball like she should
have done.  
  
Like I said, I think we shot a better field goal percentage in overtime than
we did the whole game, I'm sure. I'm sure we were under 35 percent for the
game. I'm sure we took more shots than points scored, right? Yeah.  
  
Q. One more shot than points scored.  
HARRY PERRETTA: That's all? I thought it would be a lot more than that.  
  
Q. Coach Perretta, at what point in overtime did you kind of feel the
momentum shifting for your team to come away with it?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I think when Ray hit the second three, that was big. Because
it got us up odd, I think. It put us up five or seven. If we got the game odd,
I felt like, unless we missed every foul shot we took, if we didn't give up a
three, they couldn't catch us. As long as we made at least one out of two or
two out of two of the free throws and not turn it over obviously. When you get
the game odd like that, you know, the team has to score three field goals and
then they have to foul us three times so, you know, the chances are in your
favor if you can just shoot even 70 percent or 60 percent from the foul line.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, I know this could be a possible four games
in four days. I 'm sure you're looking at it one at a time, but how do you
start that day? Celebrating a little bit for a second and then moving on. How
do you coach that when this could be four days long?  
HARRY PERRETTA: We came into the tournament trying to give them a lot of rest.
So they expended a lot of energy today, but there's nothing you can really do.
You just tell them to get some rest and show up. You're playing on adrenaline
now anyhow. I think it's more adrenaline than conditioning at this point, to
be honest with you.  
  
I just think we didn't push them really hard at practice all week. We tried to
bring them into the tournament relatively fresh.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Melanie Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38911)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Villanova - 64, Xavier - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then open
it up to questions.  
  
MELANIE MOORE: I'm just so proud of our team. We obviously came up short, not
the end result that we wanted, but the fact that we got to overtime and they
competed and fought for 45 minutes, I was really proud of them.  
  
I just said, this is our first stone or brick in our journey together, and
don't get used to losing, and that we will change Xavier Women's Basketball so
that it is competing at a high level and that it's a sacrifice to win. Winning
isn't easy, but we know we've got our work cut out for us, and we will get
Xavier Women's Basketball back to what it once was.  
  
Q. First of all, great fight today. I know we watched it in overtime of
course, first overtime. What have you seen from the growth of this team being
here your first season from the beginning up until this game?  
MELANIE MOORE: Just how hard they did fight and brought it every single day.
We never got caught up in our record, and a lot of referees, opposing coaches,
they'd be like, wow, you're the best two and whatever or three and whatever
team in the country. I just think we made it a mindset that we're not going to
get caught up in the losses, and we're going to talk about winning every day
and what that looks like.  
  
So credit to every single player in this program and coach and my support
staff, everybody came in ready to work. We never got caught up in the losses.
It was about there's better days ahead. Let's keep fighting, keep grinding,
and it will all work out eventually. So those kids bought into that from day
one, and I think everybody in this room saw a change in them and just how hard
they played, and they bought in.  
  
So I'm really thankful to say that, that they fought the entire season.  
  
Q. Coach Moore, you just mentioned your team fighting the entire season.
That fight continued today, forcing overtime. What did you learn specifically
about the fight that this team has in them?  
MELANIE MOORE: That no lead is safe, that we can come back. We'll take a lot
of growing pains from this and a lot to learn, but we'll learn from it. When
we can get together again, we'll watch it together and just kind of break it
down, but that we got down -- I don't know how much, but when they hit those
two threes. But then our kids were able to regroup themselves and bought back
in to getting stops, and then we got some scores.  
  
I mean, the rebounding battle, I was proud of them. 21 offensive rebounds. We
outrebounded them. We just couldn't convert, and I think that in the end is
what kind of hurt us all season long is the percentages that we shot. So we've
just got to get in the gym, continue to work, continue to grind, and
eventually, hopefully, these are wins for us.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about A 'Riana Gray, led the team in scoring today.
Just what has she meant to you your first season and over the course of the
season?  
MELANIE MOORE: Ari is so competitive. She brings that edge to practice every
day, every game. You saw that. I think sometimes she gets a little frustrated
out there, but the frustration was less this year, and we'll continue to
challenge her to be the best. She wants to be a first team all league
performer, but she knows that it ain't easy, and this conference is loaded
with talent. It's one of the best basketball conferences in the country.  
  
So we'll just continue to challenge her, have her grow on all levels, but
we're so thankful we got to coach her for our first year. She's a fighter. I
mean, a double double machine on any given night.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask about Aaliyah too. She 's such a huge -- the
only three of that -- you know, the 40 minutes was her, that last one that
counted. Take me through that play and also what she has meant to you as
well.  
MELANIE MOORE: It was a stagger screen for Was to come off on the left side,
and then we had Mo on a single side, but they switched all of the screens. So
we tried to flare it. Then the time was running out, so Aaliyah just shot it,
and it went in. But so proud of her. She's the glue of our team. She's the
coach out on the floor. From day one as well, she's kind of been the voice of
us with the team, and that change is good, and let's keep fighting, let's keep
buying into this coaching staff. Can't say enough about her and what she means
to our program.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [James Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34798)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 49, Georgetown - 46  
  
JAMES HOWARD: Good afternoon. A tough game out there tonight, especially for
the kids in the locker room. I think whenever you fight to get back into a
game and you fall short, you know, for every senior, we have four, five
seniors in there, it's their last game, and you feel for them as they go
through, you know, these tough times, and it was a tough season.  
  
We'll continue to work for those that are returning and get better, and
hopefully next year we're not in this position but back in a position that we
have a bye week.  
  
Q. Coach, Taylor was on fire (indiscernible) the first half. What was
working for her?  
JAMES HOWARD: She played well off of ball screens. She comes off of ball
screens and makes good reads, and then when we're running someone else off,
they're able to try to find her on a spot-up.  
  
The key was drawing defenses and reading where she was. We try to run a lot of
action for her to get her some good looks, some pin-down stuff, try to get her
coming off to put the ball in her hand to make a good decision with it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just describe what you saw in your team there in the
last five minutes of the game? Thoughts on that?  
JAMES HOWARD: I think we had the interview before the game with some of the
media, and one thing we talked about, I said if we -- if we're in the game,
coming down to the last five minutes, their energy and their belief changed.
What I saw was they start to see the clock and they saw they were down three,
down four, they felt like they could win again.  
  
The energy changed there. I thought they picked up their action, their ability
to scramble, rotate. I thought right about the 3-minute, 3.5-minute mark, I
thought we had three key shots that we missed to tie it.  
  
Good looks. Three from the corner, three up top. Wide-open looks. That's the
thing, when you're having to set the season, it breaks your back, because all
year long we have had that look. We have had that look. We just didn't have
that player to knock it down at that crucial time.  
  
Q. Take me through the last five, six seconds between both teams with
the time-outs and then the play that ultimately ended it?  
JAMES HOWARD: Yes. I think when it came down to it, we tried to get Taylor
Barnes coming off of something, we tried to double screen and bring her off
the baseline side. The key in that action is making sure that you set a solid
screen to get it to your shooter.  
  
The second option was trying to get Tayanna Jones on a flare on the backside
and Anita on the slip. They did a good job of covering it, but we got it to
Taylor, Taylor got it back out, shot went up, and Anita got the rebound to put
it back in and take it back to a 2-point game.  
  
I thought it was a key possession before that when we cut it to two, we
fouled, we didn't have to foul at that time. The clock was in your favor, you
play through it. Again, you know, you're there, you make those quick -- not
understanding what time and place is, and play through it. We try to tell them
that, but you know when you're in the game, it is like your emotion, you're
not thinking, and then all of a sudden, bad decision.  
  
Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 49, Georgetown - 46  
  
JIM CROWLEY: Thank you. A credit to Georgetown, you know, they play really
hard. Certainly you can tell Barnes didn't want her career to end.  
  
I thought this game looked like a game of two teams that have played last
week, both knew each other, and I thought there was some nerves at the start.  
  
While, you know, we didn't rebound at the level we would hope, and we
certainly could do a better job taking care of the ball, I thought our defense
was really consistent. And we did a good job of regularly contesting shots and
staying with possessions, even when we gave up offensive rebounds, even when
we had those turnovers. To defend like that is a really impressive thing.  
  
Just proud of our group. This year hasn't always gone the way we wanted it o
to. They showed resolve and togetherness to knock it down at some moments
where they could have throughout the became. Really proud of that. You know,
going to enjoy this for about five minutes.  
  
Q. Career high in blocked shots for you. Six. Can you describe what you
were seeing out there?  
ALYSSA GEARY: I know that before we were looking at the Big East book, and me
and Mary were like I wonder, you know, had a little competition between us,
who could get the most blocks. Coach stresses a lot to just wall up and let
the ball come to you.  
  
You know, that's what I tried to do. I just tried to wall up. I really didn't
try to block anything, and the ball came in my hands, and I knew what I needed
to do.  
  
Q. I know looking ahead to tomorrow, a top ranked team, what are you
seeing? You said you 'll enjoy this for five minutes. What do you see looking
ahead to that match-up?  
JIM CROWLEY: You know, DePaul is obviously very dynamic offensively and very
underrated defensively. You know, we're banged up, and it doesn't matter. We
have to go out and play. We have to find a way to control tempo. They're great
at extra possessions, and, you know, we have to do a better job of not turning
it over and rebounding.  
  
DePaul is coming in a little feisty, I'm sure, from how they ended the year,
and they know they need wins to keep that home game.  
  
As I said, there's a lot of good things going for them. The good thing going
for us is we get to play again. We're going to go out, do what we do, play
really hard and look forward to the experience.  
  
Q. Coach, you used the word resiliency to describe this team. How did
that manifest itself in the last two minutes of the game?  
JIM CROWLEY: I would say throughout, Mary goes down at the start of second
half, every time we got it to eight or nine, they hit a few shots. We had the
turnover where the game looked kind of in control and, you know, we don't --
we give the ball back to Earlette before she's all the way in, they score off
of that.  
  
You know, their voices were a lot more prevalent as we were having huddles and
time-outs and stuff, and that's growth for us. So just to kind of stay focused
on what they needed to do to get to that point I thought was really resilient,
and especially in some other cases, and against Georgetown. A lot of these
folks, whether it is was our first game against Georgetown or all three last
year had had some fourth quarter issues against them. To do it against them in
this stage I thought was a good growth of our resiliency.  
  
Q. Any update on Mary? Obviously she 's out of the rest of the game,
tomorrow do you think --  
JIM CROWLEY: We're a pretty good hockey school, so I'm going to go with the
hockey lower body injury and see where it goes. We have an incredible athletic
trainer. You know, it's a short turnaround, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Coach, DePaul, how much harder is it for you now to play them in
their hometown?  
JIM CROWLEY: Well, fortunately -- well, not fortunately, we did that before,
about a month ago, and that didn't go great. We have played in this arena a
couple of times. We have played them in this arena.  
  
We'll prepare for them. We know, you know, the great thing about Doug and
DePaul is they are who they are, and they do it very well. We have to make
sure we play really hard. We have to make sure we grow from this, you know,
and see where it ends up.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 82, Ohio State - 65  
  
Q. You won 10 of 12 games coming into tonight; what can you attribute
that change to?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, I just think we've had a steady improvement throughout
the year. We've got a young team, and these kids have really committed to
getting better, and just kind of things started to click with us here late in
the season.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys made a statement this week with what you
guys did?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, I'm really proud of the group. We played really hard.
We really competed at a high level. Kids left everything out there. We ran
into a really good team today. Give Maryland credit; they're excellent. I
think they're going to have an opportunity to make a great run in the
Tournament. It's going to be fun to watch them. But really proud of the group,
and I do think we really showed what we're capable of for the rest of this
year and certainly with such a young team in the future.  
  
Q. Do you guys kind of enjoy that underdog role? Is that something that
kind of fuels you guys?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think the kids kind of did enjoy that. They kind of had a
little edge to them coming in here as a little bit of a lower seed than maybe
in years past that we've had, and kind of a lot of people probably weren't
talking about us having an opportunity to do anything in the tournament. I
think they did kind of use that as motivation for sure.  
  
Q. Where do you go from here?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, we're off, so we'll be off for a few days and then get
back to practice, and we'll wait next Monday, see what the NCAA draw comes,
see what that looks like when it comes out.  
  
Q. About how many players do you think will be returning for next
year?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Still working on that because we've signed three kids. We just
lose Savitha off this team, so we'll kind of see how the off-season goes.  
  
Q. You started off with a two-point lead after that first quarter and
then Maryland started to pick up some steam. What were you seeing there?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, they were getting points in transition and off
turnovers and in second-chance points. That really hurt us. I thought early on
when we could play five-on-five and just in the half court we were okay, but
they got too many second-chance points, and that was really what bothered us
early on. But in general, I'm really proud of our team. We fought, scratched,
and we had a great tournament. Give credit to Maryland; they're terrific.
Really good. I think they've got a chance to make a special run in the NCAA
Tournament, and that will be fun to watch.  
  
Q. You make it all the way to the final as a 6 seed. How do you use this
experience with such a young team moving forward in the NCAA Tournament?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, well, that was the goal was for us to continue to -- we'll
get some rest but then get back to practice and keep getting better, and once
we get a draw get prepared for the opportunity that lies ahead.  
  
Q. A lot of the team has said that they 've kind of taken on the
underdog mentality, that people didn't expect them to make this run. How have
you seen that kind of take its shape?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, I just think our focus, our intensity, our togetherness
was as good as it's been all year. You could really see that. It was evident
on the court.  
  
Q. What makes Maryland such a tough team to play?  
KEVIN McGUFF: They're extremely talented, and they've done a great job this
year with their defense. They mix their defense up. They just make it really
tough on you to generate quality shots, and they're long and athletic so they
can switch a lot of things. I think that's probably the biggest difference is
they've really taken a jump defensively from past years to this year, and it's
really put them amongst the best teams in the country.  
  
Q. Rebecca, I saw her on the sidelines, do you have any expectations for
NCAA Tournament time?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I don't know yet. We're hopeful. I think she'll be back by then,
but she's got a high ankle sprain, and she's getting better. We've got time,
so hopefully we'll get her back.  
  
Aaliyah Patty  
  
Q. Was depth maybe a little bit of a factor in this game?  
AALIYAH PATTY: I mean, for sure. Playing four games in a row is really tough.
Your legs get dead. But hey, you've just got to fight through it, I think, and
we didn't do a good job of doing that.  
  
Q. Even in a loss, how do you look back at this tournament? You win
three of the four games you make it to the finals. What do you make of them as
a whole?  
AALIYAH PATTY: I think we know how it feels now to make it so far and then let
up. I just feel like we're going to use that as fuel for the next tournament,
to work harder and go farther.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys made a statement this week? Obviously today
's game notwithstanding, just what you guys were able to do over the past four
days? Do you feel like that raised some eyebrows?  
AALIYAH PATTY: Yeah, a lot of people weren't expecting us to make it this far,
not even being ranked. I think a lot of people didn't see Ohio State in the
championship. I think we did a great job of proving everyone wrong, although
it wasn't the final result we wanted.  
  
Q. Do you guys kind of enjoy that underdog role?  
AALIYAH PATTY: I mean, for sure. It's always good to prove people wrong. I
feel like a lot of top teams get beat, but being an underdog and being able to
beat those top seeds is always a great feeling.  
  
Madison Greene  
  
Q. You started off kind of strong in that first quarter but then
Maryland starts to gain some steam. How did you see this game going overall?  
MADISON GREENE: I feel like we fought strong. I feel like we fought until the
end, we just ran out of gas towards the end and they started hitting shots,
and our defense started falling off.  
  
I'm just proud of what we did, but we could have did better I feel like.  
  
Q. With this loss, like you said, you still made it all the way to the
final as a 6 seed. How do you reflect on this experience as a whole?  
MADISON GREENE: You know, it was an exciting experience because nobody
expected us to get this far, so I'm just proud of where we've gotten. We've
got more to prove, so I'm excited for the future.  
  
Q. For such a young team to have this kind of experience, how much do
you think that 's going to help come NCAA Tournament time?  
MADISON GREENE: I feel like it's really going to help us, understanding like
how we've got to really take care of our bodies and stay locked in every game
because every game, every quarter, every second matters.  
  
Jacy Sheldon  
  
Q. How difficult a team are they to play?  
JACY SHELDON: They're a great team with a lot of great players. Like she said,
they're great in transition. They're really aggressive on the boards, and
yeah, they're really deep, too. They're a great team overall.  
  
Q. What 's kind of the focus when you do play Maryland? Was there a
strategy of who to shut down or anything like that?  
JACY SHELDON: We knew we had to stay on their shooters and their bigs are
obviously really aggressive, too. They really do have a great team, so we
really focused on all of them to be honest. But yeah, they played a great game
today.  
  
Q. As a freshman, this being your first Big Ten Tournament experience,
how do you take this sort of experience and move it forward in the NCAA
Tournament?  
JACY SHELDON: Yeah, I think we're all going to learn from this and we're going
to use it as motivation in the tournament. I think overall we played a pretty
good tournament. Obviously it didn't go the way we wanted, but we'll use that
as growth for the future.  
  
Braxtin Miller  
  
Q. What makes them such a difficult team to face?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: They've got a lot of great players that come in. They are
super long, lengthy, athletic. They are great in transition, play good
defense, and they're able to switch 1 through 5. So it just creates some
challenges.  
  
Q. What do you take away from a tournament experience like this, to win
all the way to the final. How do you take that forward into the NCAA
Tournament?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think it's just a great confidence booster. A lot of people
didn't think we'd be able to get to this point. I think we knew, but most
people didn't, so to be able to prove that to everyone else is just huge for
ourselves and huge for everybody else watching us, as well.  
  
Q. How much have you used this underdog sort of mentality as a motivator
both in this tournament and just throughout the season?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think we've definitely used it, but I don't think we've
personally ever felt like an underdog. I feel like we feel we're right there
with everyone else. We can compete, and I think that we've clearly proven
that. Today obviously wasn't the results we wanted, but I think that it's
motivated us to hear everything that people were saying and just be able to
try to come out and prove everyone wrong.  
  
Dorka Juhasz  
  
Q. This is the third time you 've played Maryland; what makes them such
a difficult team to play night in and night out?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I mean, they have great upperclassmen leaders, and they're very
aggressive, and obviously they force some turnovers. You could see we were
down on the boards by I don't know how much, a lot. So they were really
aggressive. They looked like they didn't play two games before. Obviously we
felt that this was our fourth game, so we kind of like ran out of gas, I
believe. But we have to give them credit because they're an amazing team, and
obviously they're No. 1 seed in the tournament for a reason.  
  
But I'm really proud of the team because we fought really hard. Obviously it's
disappointing right now, but we're looking forward to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. You started out strong from the field in that first quarter, but it
kind of started to slow down. Do you think fatigue played a factor in that?  
DORKA JUHASZ: Definitely, but just also obviously just fighting and
rebounding, and I think we didn't get those loose balls that they got, and
they were more aggressive, so that led them to like easy baskets in
transition, and we couldn't go back and we couldn't match up in transition
defense. Obviously those were really easy points, and they could get up
easily.  
  
Q. Even in the loss, this is a pretty remarkable run for a 6 seed to
make. What do you take from this entire tournament?  
DORKA JUHASZ: It was just a great opportunity for us, and it kind of showed us
our character and how we can play together if we're really together. Obviously
I'm disappointed right now, but looking back, I think it just got us closer
and even more hungry in the NCAA Tournament to do some big things. But
obviously we've got to look back, we've got to watch film, we've got to see
what worked, what didn't work, and I believe we have like a few days off now
to rest, and then we've got to go to work.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys made a statement this week? Obviously
tonight 's result notwithstanding, just the run that you guys have been on, do
you feel like that raised some eyebrows?  
DORKA JUHASZ: Oh, for sure. I don't think that many teams and many people who
watch women's basketball thought that we were going to get in the finals this
year, so we were kind of the underdogs this year. So definitely I believe we
just like left a mark here, but obviously it didn't turn out how we wanted.  
  
It's just like really we have to give credit to Maryland because they're an
amazing team, and they were ready to come out, and obviously they showed why
they're this good.  
  
Q. Do you guys kind of enjoy playing that underdog role?  
DORKA JUHASZ: Yeah, I think we were really enjoying it, just like listening to
media, like hey, who do you pick, who's going to be in the finals. Nobody
picked us to be in the finals. I think it just gives us an extra fuel to work
harder and just to show that even if we're really young, we're literally
babies, like freshmen and sophomores, like we can do some big things if we are
together. We're enjoying it a lot.  
  
Q. Winning 10 of the last 12 games coming into the night, what can you
attribute that change in the season to?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I mean, I'm just really proud of us, like how -- we had like a
lot of ups and downs in the season, and obviously March is the most important
time of the year, and just -- it's just we worked so hard for this whole
season, and actually we were here in the Big Ten Tournament, so we came in
like hey, we've got to work, we've got to show what we have.  
  
And I think we did a great job, obviously. As I said, we lost and everything,
but I'm really proud, and I think everybody improved. This is a young team, so
hopefully in the next two years, we can get to the tournament again, so now we
kind of have a feeling like how it's going to go in the future, too, and like
you've got to be tough for four games, if it's four games. If it's five,
three, you've just got to be tough.  
  
Yeah, I think we got better, and that's the most important thing for March?  
  
Q. Where do you go from here?  
DORKA JUHASZ: Well, hopefully dancing (laughs). We've got to rest, and we've
got to prepare and just get better, maybe do some individual stuff as we can
and then like hopefully if we're dancing, then just always prepare for the
next game, and it doesn't matter what's coming after, it's just game by game
we've got to prepare, scout and get better.  
  
Janai Crooms  
  
Q. What was being said to kind of attempt to make this upset happen?  
JANAI CROOMS: Honestly, just sticking with the personnel and watching film. I
mean, I feel like throughout the game I feel like we did an okay job knowing
the personnel, knowing the shooters, the drivers. I feel like they're a really
great team. They have really good depth, so I think that's pretty much what
the focus was before the game.  
  
Q. Have you felt yourself try and become the energizer for this team? I
see you before the games trying to pump everyone else. Is that a role you 've
taken on?  
JANAI CROOMS: Yeah, I take on that a lot. That's kind of my role in practice,
in games. All throughout the season it's just been my role, and I think I've
lived up to that.  
  
Q. How do you use this sort of result maybe as motivation moving into
the NCAA Tournament?  
JANAI CROOMS: Honestly, a lot of people didn't project us to get this far,
especially in the Big Ten Tournament, but getting this far with a young team,
I think we can do a lot of big things in the NCAA Tournament and get pretty
far if we just stay together, keep our mindset all on the same page. I think
we can do some great things.  
  
Q. You said not many people have expected this. With such a young team,
were these kind of your expectations to do this in year one with all these
freshmen and sophomores?  
JANAI CROOMS: Honestly, it was, but at the same time, I already knew -- even
last year coming into it as a freshman, we didn't get that far, but I knew my
next year, just trying to teach them like take it game by game, just live in
the moment and just play your hardest when you're out there.  
  
Q. How have you seen these freshman guards? They say they don 't even
feel like freshmen. Do you see that in their persona and how they've played?  
JANAI CROOMS: Yeah, I see that, especially as the season went on. Back in
November I would be like, wow, you could tell these were freshmen, but as the
season went on, they matured. They got so much mature. I feel like Madison has
handled her role being the point guard of the team, and just being able to
come in as a freshman and being able to take that role is really big, and I
think she has done really good with that.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 82, Ohio State - 65  
  
Q. What do you think of those three games?  
BRENDA FRESE: I mean, it's unreal. It took an entire team. A different player
stepping up for us each game, every quarter. It took a lot of grit and
tenacity, obviously. An incredible day for Maryland with our men winning this
afternoon, to be able to follow it up, and just so incredibly proud of this
group, to go through what we went through in the regular season and then to be
able to come out and take the conference championship, as well.  
  
Q. What about Ashley; three really consistent games, and she got the MVP
obviously.  
BRENDA FRESE: She was undaunted. No moment is too big for her. I mean, she was
the engine that made us go and really made plays for so many players. You
know, obviously that was why she was the most valuable player.  
  
Q. Obviously Stephanie Jones had a big game, as well. She was outside
the spotlight a little bit this season. Talk about her.  
BRENDA FRESE: Miss Consistency. I thought the MVP could have went to either
one. She really brought it I thought every single game for us, and had to have
those minutes from her from the offensive, as well as the defensive end.  
  
Q. This game seemed to really be a game of little tiny spurts on
offense. How big was especially Taylor Mikesell and Blair Watson?  
BRENDA FRESE: I mean, it's going to come down to that in March. You're not
going to have a lot of possessions to be able to take away, so those threes
were critical, and just being able to chip away offensively as well as
defensively.  
  
Q. How much focus was there on actually finishing the job here, after
what happened the last couple of years in Indianapolis?  
BRENDA FRESE: I mean, it's a different team. Having a point guard allowed us
to be in position to be successful. Just very gratifying, obviously, for our
seniors. To come out empty-handed the last two, couple years, to be able to
send them out the right way.  
  
Q. You 've been talking about stringing three games and three days
together for the freshmen. Ashley's performance not just tonight but over the
weekend, what does that say about her growth?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, she was just undaunted. She wanted the big moment. She
was built for it. I told her she won four straight titles in high school, so
all that kid does is win. But most importantly just watching the growth over
the course of the season for her to be ready for the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Finally getting this title after coming up short two years, how does
this help the confidence in your team moving forward?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I mean, the season has prepared us for what lies ahead, so
conference schedule, now the Big Ten Tournament, we're definitely excited for
what lies ahead.  
  
Q. I believe this is your fourth in six years; how does this compare to
some of the other ones?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, this one is incredibly special because when you've had
a couple years where you haven't been standing up there and confetti is
falling on you when you go off the court, you just realize how difficult it
is. I think it's even more because this group had to sacrifice so much to be
able to put themselves in this position to be successful.  
  
Q. When it comes to rest and recovery with these three games in three
days, what did you see from your freshmen in particular this week that maybe
might have set them ahead of some of the other groups?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, again, they were just fearless. They wanted to make plays
for us on both ends of the floor, and the moment wasn't too big for them.  
  
Q. You mentioned -- you gave a shout-out to the men 's team, also. Does
a day like today kind of take you back to the '06, '02 era in College Park?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, just great vibes right now, great things happening in
College Park. Can't say enough. Today you could feel the chills of just being
able to win championships. You know, again, phenomenal things going on for
both teams in College Park.  
  
Q. The play of Shakira Austin and Stephanie Jones down the stretch was
kind of a big deal for you guys. Can you elaborate on how their play really
was --  
BRENDA FRESE: Shakira and who else?  
  
Q. Shakira and Stephanie.  
BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. Shakira is our enforcer down low. We needed that
rebounding. Those point beans for us and the inside presence, our rebounding
has always been really critical to our success.  
  
Q. With Ashley, her being a freshman and all, do you expect her
performance to continue into the NCAA Tournament? Are you worried about it
capping off?  
BRENDA FRESE: No, not worried at all. She's just continued to keep getting
better and better every time she steps out on the floor for practice, and
elite-level players want to be in these moments, and Ashley is built for these
moments.  
  
Q. Stephanie Jones and the rest of you guys ' seniors, you mentioned it
before, when you guys were giving your speech, during the presentation, but
again, what does it mean to your seniors and to you for them to go out and get
a Big Ten title?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, they've come up short the last couple years, so
for us to be able to send them out regular season championship and now the
conference tournament, like it's anything but easy. 18-game conference
schedule and now three games in three days, so it's only fitting this group is
truly a bunch of winners.  
  
Ashley Owusu  
  
Q. How come you 've just caught fire here in the tournament? You were
averaging 11 points through the season, but now you've exceeded
expectations.  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would just say staying confident and focused, and I give all
the credit to my teammates and coaches. I come in every day and they push me
to my best ability, and they have a lot of confidence in me.  
  
Q. Obviously passing has been another big thing during the tournament.
What 's making everything easy?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I guess just keeping my head up and reading the defense.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned you 're 5-for-5 now in tournaments.  
ASHLEY OWUSU: Yes.  
  
Q. What would it mean to be 6-for-6?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: It would mean everything. Coming out and winning a National
Championship with this team would be awesome.  
  
Q. Is this what you had in mind in your first season?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would say yeah. I have a lot of confidence in myself and my
team knowing we would come in and win a regular season and the tournament. Now
us just staying focused for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. When it comes to your personal performance, having the Freshman of
the Year, is that something you also envisioned for yourself this year?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I mean, yes and no, just coming in and playing basketball and
doing whatever needs to be done to help my team win.  
  
Q. Ashley, typically freshmen come in and won 't be like a leader right
away. What are your teammates telling you about stepping up and letting you
take the reigns?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would say they helped me a lot. I give a lot of credit to the
seniors. I'm a young player coming into a great program, and they've helped me
become the leader I am today.  
  
Q. What does this win mean to you as a player? Obviously you 've won
throughout your career as a basketball player, but what specifically about
this is different?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would say the group of people I won it with. I just love my
teammates, and to be able to come out and win the Big Ten Tournament with them
is awesome.  
  
Q. Why do you think you 've been so successful in postseason?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would just say confidence and staying focused. Playing three
games in three days is not easy. Me and my teammates just came out, kept our
heads down and worked to stay focused.  
  
Q. What kind of changed in the second quarter for you? It looked like
the floor really opened up and you were able to get some really good passes
down low and score in transition a lot. Was it defense that changed?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would say defense, yeah. In the beginning we were a little
late on rotations and things like that. Our offense comes from our defense, so
just getting out in a stance and then pushing and getting the steal?  
  
Q. What was the seniors ' message to the team before this game? What
were they telling you?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: Just stay focused. They've been in this type of position, and we
also have earlier in the season, so just staying focused and not being rattled
by what was going on in the first half.  
  
Q. Staying on the topic of the seniors, it 's been mentioned that the
last two years that you guys obviously came up short in the tournament. You
coming in as a freshman this year, how does it mean to you -- for all their
leadership for this season, for Stephanie, for Kaila and all the other seniors
to go out of the regular season and now the Big Ten Tournament title?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: It means a lot. Like you said, they lost the last two years, so
just coming out and winning it for them and winning it for ourselves.  
  
Stephanie Jones  
  
Q. Is it just a Jones family tradition --  
STEPHANIE JONES: I mean, I guess we just have that sense of urgency like it's
our last season, so you just want to go out with a win.  
  
Q. How did it feel after all of the staff from last year and the year
before?  
STEPHANIE JONES: It feels amazing, especially to come short the past two
years, and like we kind of followed the lead of our seniors our freshman year,
so just to be able to do it as a senior, it means a lot.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what it 's like to play with a
player like Ashley.  
STEPHANIE JONES: I mean, she's amazing. The fact that she's able to create
shots for herself and other people, you've always got to look for her. The
defense never can take a break with her on the court, so yeah, she's tough.  
  
Q. Once again, you battled down low, getting those easy buckets, it
seemed like people were finding you inside. Are you guys really figuring out
that offensive chemistry between the inside and outside?  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, I think that we're just being more patient with it.
We're not forcing anything, and just playing with what the defense gives us.
Yeah, like if everybody knocking down shots, we're able to go inside-out.  
  
Q. Have you ever seen a freshman with as much courage as Ashley?  
STEPHANIE JONES: No. Honestly, I mean, she's like really a silent assassin.
She doesn't play much, but what she's able to do on the court says a lot.  
  
Q. Obviously pretty much everyone stepped up tonight in little ways.
What 's it say about this team that everyone is able to contribute in big
ways?  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, it says a lot about our depth and just the fact that
everybody is able to contribute when their number is called. I mean, like they
all knew what we were playing for, so just to be able to -- just to have them
on the court and get that moment means a lot for them, too?  
  
Q. At one point you were 6-for-6 from the field. Did you have confidence
coming in after shootaround, or was your feel of the game just coming to you
early on?  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, I think it was just the feel of the game, my teammates
finding me, just being aggressive on the boards, too. And yeah, I knew what
was at stake, and just like the energy boost that I would get from my team.  
  
Q. How does this team compare to the team you were on as a freshman?  
STEPHANIE JONES: I don't know, I mean, we both won. We both won the
championship, so that was three years ago, so I don't know. It's far back.  
  
Q. Looking big picture, you guys got the first two things that you
wanted, the regular season title and the tournament title. Playing three games
in three days, how is it going to help you guys as you guys move on in the
NCAA Tournament and possibly make a run to the Final Four?  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, I think that these three games being back to back like
this and with stuff competition really prepares us for the NCAA Tournament
just because it is so tough and then just to be able to have those games where
it's like one, and then a day of rest and then another one. Yeah, and I think
it really prepares our underclassmen, too.  
  
Kaila Charles  
  
Q. How does it feel?  
KAILA CHARLES: It's amazing. This whole year we fought hard. It wasn't easy
but it was worth it. I love the fact that we did this together. It wasn't just
one person, it was everybody, somebody different every night, and yeah, it's
amazing. I'm glad that we finally won it. I've been here four years in a row
and we lost the last two, and it hurt. It hurt. I think my seniors who went
through that, we had a big chip on our shoulder, we were motivated, and we got
the W and we went out with a bang.  
  
Q. What were the feelings at the end?  
KAILA CHARLES: It was just a lot. We were all excited. I shed a couple tears
because we worked so hard, and I always believed we were going to win today. I
was just so excited in the hotel room, ready to play because I was just like,
I'm ready to cut those nets. We went out there, we executed, we grinded and we
won.  
  
Q. Ashley getting the MVP and looking so beyond her years in this
tournament; what do you think of her?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, Ashley is amazing. We call her "Cashley" because she's
amazing.  
  
I'm not surprised at all. She's just doing what she always does. I'm so proud
of her, I'm happy for her, and hopefully she can get that run of three years
in a row. But yeah, love the fact that she came out here aggressive,
confident, and that's what we're going to need moving forward in the
tournament.  
  
Q. What about Steph making the all-tournament team, she really came out
at the end of the year and it 's a regular thing?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, Steph was just doing Steph things. We call her Ms.
Consistency. She just went out there and played her hardest, left it all on
the court, and it just was working for her, finding her, she was getting the O
boards, stops, finishing through contact and all that stuff. So Steph played
amazing.  
  
Q. You guys had five players in double figures tonight, not to mention
that you guys had two players with double-doubles, and then you also had your
freshmen step up and combine for like 29 points. What does it say about the
balance of this team and how it can help you guys throughout March to
hopefully make a run at the National Championship?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, it just shows we have so many weapons. Everything is
spread out through our whole team, through all nine players. And you can't
take away one person because there's eight other people, so I love the fact
that we're so balanced and everybody can come off the bench and score 20
essentially a night.  
  
So yeah, that's something we're going to need moving forward, especially in
the Tournament, we're going to play some tough teams outside of our league,
and we need everybody to contribute, we need everybody to score and just give
us the defense that we need, offensive rebounding, all that, so we need
everybody.  
  
Q. You have so much NCAA Tournament experience. How are you feeling
about the potential of this team with everything you 've done?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, I'm ultra-confident in our team, especially with our new
defense this year. As you can see, we're one of the best defensive teams
coming out of Maryland. We hold people to a lower points than they had in
years.  
  
So I'm excited going into this tournament because we have a new defense that
not anybody hasn't seen this year, so yeah, like you said, we had so many
contributors on this team, it's not just one person; we've got two, three,
four. And so I love the fact that we have good chances going into the NCAA
because we are just so balanced.  
  
Q. You guys obviously struggled to win this tournament the last two
years, but now moving into the NCAA Tournament, what do you think the key is
going to be to moving further ahead in that tournament, as well?  
KAILA CHARLES: Just sticking to Maryland basketball, playing together, playing
for each other and sharing the ball. When we do that, good things happen,
especially when we're locked in on the defensive end. That's all that really
matters.  
  
Q. You guys played three really tough games the last couple days. It was
a really close score at halftime and you came out in the third and fourth
quarters and really grinded, as you said. Just looking forward, how is that
going to be able to help you guys as you guys maybe get to the Sweet 16, Elite
8, maybe the Final Four?  
KAILA CHARLES: Definitely. This conference, this league, they definitely have
prepared us for postseason. Every game throughout regular season and this
tournament was a battle, and we were battle tested every game. So among the
fact that we were very competitive, this league is very competitive because
it's going to help us even more, like I said, in the NCAA. I think we were
challenged a lot, and we were able to grind it out and prove what we can do,
and we've just got to keep it up.  
  
Q. What did Coach say to you going into the halftime? Because when you
came back out you stretched the lead.  
KAILA CHARLES: She was just saying that we need to lock into our defense, and
that's something she's been saying all year because our defense leads to our
offense, we get a lot of stops, that leads to our break. It's just like lock
into the defensive end and all the rest will flow, and she's saying, share the
ball, have fun, and go out there and leave it all out on the court, and that's
what we did.  
  
Q. Speaking of defense, you guys held Juhasz scoreless for the second
half. How did that happen?  
KAILA CHARLES: Just like as a collective. We know she's a good player, but we
know if we play team defense, we were able to try to limit her touches. So we
were trying to front, have help side so they couldn't get in to her easily,
and it essentially worked and we were able to build a lead because she wasn't
scoring as much. It was just a team defense and all of us coming together as a
collective.  
  
Blair Watson  
  
Q. What 's the feeling now?  
BLAIR WATSON: It's just surreal. I honestly have no words. I'm just so proud
of my team. I think it just kind of shows the grind that we had all season
long, even preseason, and I think it's just sharing it with my family, sharing
it with everybody here, I think everybody is so excited, so happy and I want
to take this momentum into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Ashley getting the MVP and looking like a beast throughout the whole
tournament, what did you think of her?  
BLAIR WATSON: She absolutely deserved it. She's a floor general for our team.
She plays offense, she plays defense, she can steal. She does anything you
honestly ask her to do. She's honestly the quietest person you'll ever meet,
but I think her actions speaks volumes to what she's capable of and what she
does for our team. I'm just so proud of her, and she definitely deserved that
award.  
  
Q. You individually in that third quarter, you hit two threes, one being
a step-back with a hand in your face. Did you feel like you guys had the game
after you caught fire there?  
BLAIR WATSON: I just felt like we were never going to give up and we were
never going to lay down. It really didn't matter who was against us, I think
we were just going to go out there and play our game and have fun doing it.
You had almost everybody in double figures. It was just a great night for
everybody. We shared the basketball, we had so much fun, and it just shows
today.  
  
Q. You guys as seniors combined for nearly a third of you guys ' points.
What was you guys' message to the team as you guys were going through your
shootaround this morning and especially in the hotel last night? Just how
major was it for you to be able to go out and get the Big Ten title as
seniors?  
BLAIR WATSON: I think Brenda holds our seniors to a higher standard because
we've been here for four years and we know the system and we know what she
expects out of us. We were going in shootaround and we were in film and we
were just talking, you've got to lay it all on the line, no matter what
happens. It doesn't even matter what the name is on the chest, you just go out
and play Maryland basketball.  
  
And at the end of the day, Coach B, she got us right. We were in the locker
room, she's like, y'all need to step it up, and she's like, you guys came out
really flat, but I need you guys to pick it up, and I think that's what we did
in the third quarter, and it really, really showed, and it helped us get that
win.  
  
Q. How does this team compare to the other three teams you 've been a
part of?  
BLAIR WATSON: I mean, I can't knock all the other teams because they were so
great and I loved everybody who was on them, but this team is special. They're
younger, they're goofy, they just have fun with everything, and I just love
them to death. I wouldn't change this team for the world.  
  
Q. You guys have had so much success as a senior class, and you guys
have had success in the NCAA Tournament. How is that going to be able to help
you guys as leaders moving forward as you guys pursue this tournament run?  
BLAIR WATSON: Yeah, I think just treating every game as if it was your last
because I mean, at the end of the day, it is. I think just going out there
with a fight and a hunger that we're ready, we're willing, and after today, I
mean, somebody better step on the court with us because I don't think they're
going to like it, but we're going to come with some fire, and at the end of
the day, we're going to go through all the little things and at the end
hopefully the result will be a win, but I think we're just looking to have fun
and play together at the end of the day.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2020

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 66, Indiana - 51  
  
TERI MOREN: Well, congratulations to Maryland. What a fantastic team they are.
We've had -- obviously we've seen them -- we saw them twice during the Big
Ten, regular Big Ten season, and then here today. We've seen them a lot, and I
do think that they are a Final Four kind of caliber team. I do think that
they're that good. They're long, they're athletic. They have help off the
bench. As a matter of fact, their two leading scorers came off the bench
today.  
  
And so we are obviously disappointed. When you have an opportunity to play a
team a third time, you always feel like maybe this is our moment, our night,
but you have to play almost perfect to beat them.  
  
But I thought we battled. I'm really proud of our guys and just how hard they
played. I thought we tested them defensively for sure. You know, the problem
that we have, we just couldn't score enough points. But I do think that if we
could have scored the ball better, particularly in the third quarter and just
kind of hung around, I think it would have been a different kind of outcome
for us. But we just didn't -- couldn't manufacture enough points, whether that
was from the free-throw line, didn't get anything easy on the inside.  
  
But I loved how our team competed, and again, we watched a lot of film on
Maryland, and I will say this: I don't know that anybody has defended them as
well as we did tonight and still came up on the other side of where we wanted.  
  
Really proud of the team in red, and just how hard they played.  
  
Q. I know you 're not looking to make excuses, but after a really hard-
fought game yesterday, do you think fatigue contributed to the trouble scoring
the ball?  
ALI PATBERG: No.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys can answer this: What is the value of playing
a team the caliber of Maryland? Your coach said they 're a Final Four team.
You've come up short against them three different times, but how does this
benefit you heading into the next games?  
ALI PATBERG: I think it's great, great experience. We stayed with them for
three quarters. We didn't have a good third quarter and they did. I think it
gives us confidence but also gives us experience. I thought we -- like Coach
said, we fought hard all night. We didn't give up, and our shots didn't fall,
and that's really disappointing. But we gave it our all, and we can hang our
hat on that.  
  
BRENNA WISE: I would just say we're getting ready for the Tournament and we're
going to see a lot of great teams that make the Tournament, so this prepares
us, we have a lot to learn from it, and hats off to them for playing well.  
  
Q. Ali, they obviously threw something different at you after halftime
and it looked like you had trouble scoring the ball. What did you see from
them defensively after the half?  
ALI PATBERG: Honestly, I think they stayed in their zone for the second half.
We continued -- I think the first quarter they were pressing us and we did a
really good job of handling that, and we were aggressive, and they ended up
getting out of it and playing their zone, and I think we just struggled in the
third quarter.  
  
We haven't watched film, obviously, but coming out the second half, I think we
had two or three turnovers right away, and that led to them hitting shots and
a couple defensive rebounds we didn't get. They made a quick run, so yeah.  
  
Q. Ali, you were visually frustrated a couple times on the court. What
was the reason for that?  
ALI PATBERG: You know, I don't know. We were playing hard and shots weren't
falling. I guess I was just frustrated.  
  
Q. Maryland is a team that scores nearly 85 points a game, and in you
guys ' three games this season you were able to play well defensively against
them, and even after halftime you were holding them to close to around 35
points. Defensively as you guys head into the Tournament, how does that give
you confidence in how well you guys can play against a Maryland type of
team?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, tonight we didn't hit shots, which stinks, but again, we
can hang our hats on that. I think we made it difficult for them, and we for
the most part followed the game plan that the coaches gave us, and we just
didn't execute on the offensive end, and we're going to.  
  
I think if we continue that mentality defensively -- and we're going to hit
shots, and we're going to get good shots, it's going to be a good rest of the
year.  
  
Q. Is there anyone on the team that you would rely on to help build on
your win?  
BRENNA WISE: I think everybody plays an incredible role when you win and you
lose, so you kind of rely on each other in that aspect, and so we're a
collective unit, and whatever happens to one happens to all, and this happens
to all of us. So we'll take it as a collective unit, and we can only go up
from here.  
  
Q. Maryland had 15 fast-break points compared to zero for you guys. Do
you think it was their press that kind of limited you guys ' ability to run,
and I guess what defensively allowed them to kind of get on a run and get
those easy baskets?  
TERI MOREN: Well, that's why you press is to limit what we do well, and that's
play fast. So that's the first answer is the press obviously slowed us down.
So without question.  
  
What was the second part of your question?  
  
Q. What defensively allowed them to get those easy baskets.  
TERI MOREN: Sure, well, they're fantastic also in transition. You know, Owusu
is like a freight train, coming down the floor. One of our goals going into
this game was to treat every made basket like a missed basket. Obviously you
sprint as hard as you can on missed baskets and you're trying to turn around
and build a wall and get your coverages in transition defense. But they're
really good. They're great at getting the ball inbounded quickly, getting it
up the sideline before some of our guys got turned around.  
  
We knew that. That was a big part of it. We had to limit their transition
points, and we had to keep them off the offensive glass. When you look at it,
they had 15 -- like you said, 15 points in fast-break points and 11 points off
of second-chance points, so those are the two areas we really wanted to do a
much better job of, but I think we made it up in other areas. I thought we
were really good defensively tonight.  
  
Q. What 's the biggest development, biggest growth or area of progress
you've seen in this team in the three times that you guys have played Maryland
this year?  
TERI MOREN: You know, I don't know. The first time we played them at their
place, obviously their transition game just continues to get better. You know,
I think the thing with Maryland is that she's played different lineups. I
think even though they're -- I would say seven, maybe eight deep at max, those
two young ladies, when you bring in Diamond Miller and Ashley Owusu off the
bench, that's really special, and on a night when I thought obviously Mikesell
only has one three and Kaila Charles, she hit some tough shots. But the rest
of that cast is not posting great numbers, but they're capable. But then
you've got the two young ladies that come off the bench, and they're the
leading scorers.  
  
I just think the experience that Diamond and Ashley have continued to give in
a hard conference like the Big Ten has paid dividends, and they're obviously
-- with the press, their length, their athleticism, I don't know if you teach
that, that's just God given, they have that. But I think they're playing
harder, I think, on the defensive end than they did a year ago, which I think
has really separated them from a lot of teams in the country.  
  
Q. You talked last night about the team 's toughness. Also Jaelynn has
the injury (indiscernible).  
TERI MOREN: Well, yeah, that's wishing for a crystal ball, wondering if
Jaelynn was 100 percent what that would look like, but we knew at best she was
probably going to be 65, 70 percent. We were really cautious. It's our
responsibility to take care of our student-athletes, and we felt like if she
was going to be in harm's way, if we're looking forward to playing in the
Tournament, we need a healthy Jaelynn, as you know. But she was insistent that
she try to go out. It's just unfortunate that tonight obviously we did see
that she was really struggling, moving laterally especially.  
  
To go back to this young man's question about Ali, I don't know her
frustration was so much about us having a hard time scoring. I think Ali was
in a lot of pain. She got -- first of all, she fell and hit her hip, then she
got kneed going to the basket. So that's a kid that you play 38 minutes in a
whole lot of pain tonight and trying just to will her team.  
  
So I don't know if her frustration was not being able to hit shots as much as
maybe the look on her face was that of I'm in pain, but boy, she's a tough nut
and I love her, and that's the most special thing about Ali Patberg.  
  
Q. Ali toward the end of the season was scoring 20-plus pretty much
consistently. Only had 16 in this one. Do you think it was kind of her being
banged up or did Maryland do something defensively against her?  
TERI MOREN: Well, as we always tell our team, everybody does a scouting
report, right. So I don't think that the media or coaches, we don't know that
Ali Patberg has been scoring the ball at a high clip as of the last probably
four or five games. And so I'm sure that in their scouting report, that was
one of their keys probably, is hey, we have to do a great job on Ali Patberg
tonight.  
  
I think it was a combination. Again, their length, their athleticism really
puts you on your heels at times. I thought Ali remained aggressive. Some of
the shots that she took were good ones and just didn't drop tonight. But the
fact that she took 21 shots for us I think is still a good thing. We need Ali
to continue to be aggressive.  
  
Q. It 's obviously out of your control but you guys seem to be right on
that line of playing at home for the NCAA Tournament. What's your assessment
of that and what's your pitch to the committee?  
TERI MOREN: Well, you know, it's always out of your hands, right? And the good
thing is that we know we're in. It's a lot different than a year ago when we
knew we had to beat Minnesota, and we were still kind of on the outside
looking in, hopeful. But we sit in a different seat here tonight, knowing that
we're going to be one of those 64 teams.  
  
You know, again, and I've said this before, since I've been at Indiana, just
how tough this conference is. I don't know that we give them credit. The Pac
obviously has the No. 1 RPI in the country, but guess what, the Big Ten is
right behind the Pac, and I don't feel like we talk enough about all the good
teams that represent this conference and how night in and night out we have to
continue to beat up on each other. There is no bottom of the barrel in the Big
Ten. If you're not ready to play every single night, whether you're at home or
you're away, I think we've proven that in this league anybody can win. The
parity has been incredible, especially this season.  
  
And so I would hope that the committee would take a look at that, just how
difficult our league has been. I think we've done a great job as a whole, as a
conference of scheduling non-conference. Our non-conference schedule has been
extremely challenging for a lot of us. We've been able to win on the road,
although it would be great to host. I think that's a different element, right,
when you're away from Simon Skojdt Assembly Hall, just the toughness that you
have to have, the focus that you have to have. And I think when you look at
what we've done in a way from the Hall, it's been pretty impressive.  
  
So there's a few elements that I would love for that committee to take a hard
look at. But one of the things, just again, the Big Ten is really, really
good.  
  
Q. Did you ever slightly lose hope in your team?  
TERI MOREN: Never. Never lose hope. I'm a prisoner of hope. You should be a
prisoner of hope. That's my life lesson for you, okay. You never give up until
the final horn has sounded. You never give up on your team, you never give up
on yourself.  
  
Q. What was going on in your mind in the first quarter of the game when
you were 13-16 and three points behind?  
TERI MOREN: What was going on in my mind? Well, that we were right there. When
you're playing a team like Maryland, you hope you get out to a quick lead and
get the lead, and if you don't get the lead, you hope that you're within a
possession of being able to tie it up, and that's what we were.  
  
So like you said, if I could have the first, the second and the fourth quarter
back, I would say, let's do that. But -- actually I'm okay with that one. It's
the third quarter that I really want back because that's the one that we
struggled in the most. But still really, really proud of our effort always and
what we were able to do tonight defensively.  
  
Q. You guys are still on that verge of hosting the first couple rounds
of the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament. How excited are you knowing --
compared to last year, that you guys know that you guys are in, even though
you came up short tonight?  
TERI MOREN: You know, like I said to my team afterwards, we had just a couple
minutes to reflect, the conversation was much different than I've had in the
past with this group because some of my conversations have been we just --
we're hopeful that maybe we can -- I don't know what tournament we're going to
be in, I just hope that we can continue to be -- to play. Last year it was,
okay, we have to get that first game. We have to beat Minnesota, we felt like,
to get in, and you do that, but yet you're still holding your breath until
somebody -- on that Monday, remember that, when they revealed, and we knew we
were in.  
  
And then tonight it's much different. We're disappointed. We are. We wanted to
advance and we wanted to play for a championship tomorrow.  
  
However, we know this: We still have more basketball ahead of us, and that's
something that we're going to look forward to, and I know that tonight we will
be disappointed and then they're going to get a couple days off and then we'll
be back to work on Wednesday.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Janai Crooms](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38898)

### [Madison Greene](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38960)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 66, Michigan - 60  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: We can just go right to questions.  
  
Q. How does it feel with a young team just to get to this place, and how
are you going to keep that momentum going?  
JANAI CROOMS: It feels great. Being so young, just coming out and getting our
names out there, I think everyone has projected us for the underdog, so I
think we're proving something, and I'm really proud of us how we came out and
started strong throughout this whole tournament.  
  
MADISON GREENE: Yeah, this is definitely big for us. Throughout the season
we've grown and matured to who we are right now and I feel like it's showing,
so I'm just excited to be in the championship tomorrow and see what we can do.  
  
Q. Tonight 's game was very different than last night's game, same
result, though. Can you talk about how different the flow was and what you had
to do to win a different type of game?  
MADISON GREENE: I feel like this was an Ohio State-Michigan game, it's a
rivalry game, so of course they're going to come out punching and I feel like
we were punching, too. I'm just proud of what we did tonight. They went on
runs, we went on runs, but I was glad in the end that we won.  
  
Q. If you guys could both answer this: What is the physical toll of
having to play -- this is your third game in three days. Obviously there 's
some adrenaline that plays into this in terms of maybe not noticing certain
physical things, but how taxing is it to play three games in three days,
especially with this one being a back-and-forth game.  
JANAI CROOMS: It's very tough, especially when we're down numbers. I think we
only have like eight players, so it is very tough. A couple players had to
play a little bit more time. So I think that is like really a downfall for us.
But I think what helps us is our depth. I think we all contribute in some type
of way.  
  
I think if we just keep that going, I think we're going to do really
successful things.  
  
MADISON GREENE: Yeah, it definitely takes a toll on our body, and even
mentally, too. It's just our job to make sure we're preparing mentally and
physically, getting our rest, eating the right things, stretching, and I feel
like our strength and conditioning coaches really take care of us and help us
prepare for the next games.  
  
Q. For you guys being such a young team, is there some value having to
kind of gut out a game like this and find a way to win on such a big stage?  
JANAI CROOMS: Yes, I think so. I wouldn't say no, but I'd say in the beginning
of the season yes, because we were so -- we weren't used to each other, our
chemistry wasn't there, but now as the season went on, I think we kind of
learned each other's roles, and I think we've all contributed in some type of
way, so as the season went on I think we did a really good job of doing that.  
  
Q. Greene, you had a great game tonight. What was the deciding factor in
making you play 33 minutes? You played substantial minutes tonight. How did
you feel about that, and how is it going to move forward? What did Coach tell
you at halftime?  
MADISON GREENE: Well, I'm just happy that they trust me to bring the ball up
and give it to the people that I need to give it to. I'm just blessed to have
great coaches.  
  
Q. How did it feel to play almost a full game?  
MADISON GREENE: Well, I just had to take care of the ball, do what a point
guard does and I feel like did my job. I may not have scored with the threes
or lay-ups, but I contributed like with the free throws at the end, which were
very important. So I'm just glad my teammates believed in me, got me the ball,
and I'm just blessed to make them.  
  
Q. It seemed like down the stretch there late, you guys got the stops
you needed to hold Michigan off when they went on runs. What was the focus to
be able to do that?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, we certainly had to pay attention to Naz Hillmon. She was
outstanding tonight and she's so hard to guard. So a lot of our conversations
were trying to keep the ball out of her hands, which is very difficult to do,
and then keeping her off the glass. She's a great player and showed that again
tonight. So a lot of talk about that down the stretch defensively.  
  
Q. What 's the value of a young team like this having to play in an
environment like this, the third game in three days, Michigan goes on a run
there late, just all of those things combined to be able to kind of pull
together and pull out this win? What's the value of that not only for this
tournament but looking ahead to the rest of your season?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, I think what we saw tonight was sort of the culmination of
a lot of young players playing a lot of minutes throughout the year because
they rarely looked like freshmen tonight. In November and December and even
January, we looked like freshmen because we are, but these young kids have
played so many minutes in so many tough games that we've really grown up, and
it's really great to see the maturity level and the ability to execute in a
tight game like tonight.  
  
Q. Michigan still had a large rebounding advantage, but for the second
half you pretty much caught up. Was that an emphasis for the second half?  
KEVIN McGUFF: As a matter of fact, the last thing I told them before we left
the locker room, if we'll be even on the boards in the second half, we'll win
the game.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Kaila Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32703)

### [Ashley Owusu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38957)

### [Diamond Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38958)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 66, Indiana - 51  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, just a really intense atmosphere against a really,
really good IU team. I have no doubt that they'll have a long run ahead of
them in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But I thought obviously the third quarter our seniors really stepped up,
scoring about 15 of our 22 points there in that third quarter. But I think
what makes this team so special is just how they play for one another. That's
why it's something that we're really built for with our depth. You look at the
season and it's kind of indicative of how we've played all season long, with
Ashley in the first half, I thought made some tremendous plays for us, the
seniors in the third, and then how special was Diamond in the fourth with the
confidence that she played with. The length that she had defensively I thought
really gave them problems on top of our press and on top of the zone.  
  
Obviously excited. A quick turnaround for us tomorrow, but something that
we're excited to be playing for our seniors in the championship game tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Kaila, you had 9 of your 11 points in the third. How much of a
difference did it make for you having Steph and Blair back in to feed you the
ball and work out from under low?  
KAILA CHARLES: It was important and it was a big difference. They were finding
me when I was open, but yeah, I was just taking the shot when I was open and
they were finding me, so just being ready and making sure that I'm shot ready.  
  
Q. Diamond, this is kind of a joint question for Ashley and Diamond: You
guys scored 14 of you guys ' 17 points combined in the fourth quarter. As IU
was making their run. How was your confidence being able to lead you guys'
team late in the game and being able to pretty much seal the deal for you
guys?  
DIAMOND MILLER: I just think we were just playing Maryland basketball and
staying focused, and we knew they were on their run, but we just kept pushing,
and we had to score, too, so that's what we were doing.  
  
ASHLEY OWUSU: Yeah, I agree with Diamond. Just staying focused and staying
confident, doing what we needed to do.  
  
Q. Kaila, you 've been here for a while, but how does it feel to see
those two really shine today, especially Diamond with that 8-0 run to put the
game away in the fourth?  
KAILA CHARLES: It was electrifying. It definitely got us hyped. Gave us a lot
of energy. And it's just great to see how confident these two are playing.
They've been a great huge piece for us all year, and so I love the fact that
they're finally coming -- they've been coming into their own but they're
finally being confident, just being comfortable and just providing for us.
That's what we are going to need all year or moving forward, so we could be
successful.  
  
Q. Kaila, you guys have played IU three times now. For whoever they face
in the NCAA Tournament, what would you say is kind of the key to slowing them
down or stopping them?  
KAILA CHARLES: Just making sure to lock in on defense. They're a great team.
We know they're going to score, but just making sure that you're able to just
force some turnovers and try to slow them down with the press.  
  
But yeah, they're a great team. Every single time we've played them it was a
battle. It wasn't easy, as you can see, and they're going to go far in the
NCAA Tournament if they keep playing like that.  
  
Q. Kaila, one question for you: This is going to be you guys ' third
straight time playing in the championship game. Being able to go out as a
senior and hopefully winning a Big Ten championship, how does it feel to be
possibly starting what's a long run for you guys into March and possibly
April?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, I'm excited to get back to the championship, like you
said. I've been there four years in a row, and we lost the last two years, so
I really want to get back there and have a different outcome this year, and
that will definitely fuel us going into the NCAA Tournament. It'll give us
good confidence.  
  
And yeah, we're excited for tomorrow and we're going to play our hardest, and
hopefully we'll get the win.  
  
Q. Ashley, what was it like when you scored? Were you excited when you
scored most of the points for the last round?  
ASHLEY OWUSU: Yeah, it was exciting, just scoring and helping my team get the
win. So yeah.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to younger basketball players watching
you?  
KAILA CHARLES: Just being confident, always believe in yourself, because
sometimes you've got to be your biggest fan. Sometimes people are going to
doubt you, but if you're always confident and you know that you're capable of
doing anything, then you'll go far. So just believe in yourself.  
  
DIAMOND MILLER: Yeah, I agree with Kaila and also just keep working hard. No
matter how many bad days you have, keep pushing through because good days
should come.  
  
ASHLEY OWUSU: I would say staying confident and keep working.  
  
Q. You guys really battled hard and won that second half, but foul
trouble still kind of an issue, and I know you were kind of going crazy there
with subbing a lot. What were you telling your team to try to stop fouling?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, a lot of times you just have to adjust if they're
going to call the game tight. You have to be able to kind of just understand
the flow of the game. I think a luxury for us is our depth, but I thought
there in the third quarter we started reaching a little bit too much, so just
trying to be more disciplined with some of our slides and not putting them at
the free-throw line as early.  
  
Q. At halftime you guys were shooting the ball 37 percent, you only led
by four. What adjustments did you make to come out in the second half and
outscore IU 22-9?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, we talked about -- I thought we had a quick trigger. I
thought we had five offensive rebounds for that low of a field-goal
percentage, so we really needed to start making extra passes. We had a
negative assist-to-turnover ratio, so just a little bit more patient with our
offense, and I thought we were able to do that in the second half.  
  
Q. We mentioned it earlier, but Ashley and Diamond really were able to
give you guys a spark in that fourth quarter. How impressive and how far have
they come this season, especially when they were able to blossom in that
fourth quarter and how they 're able to help you guys in the future?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know what, I think -- obviously at halftime, I kind of
went down there and told them, our seniors were kind of struggling a little
bit at that time, maybe they were going to have to be the ones to step up and
shine. I think for them sometimes it's just having the permission to do so.
They're both so talented and just staying confident, because obviously they
bring another dimension that we really need with their athleticism, with their
penetration. So it just makes us a really balanced attack when you talk about
our shooters, when you talk about Diamond's length today and Ashley off the
bounce.  
  
Q. Obviously it 's very hard to do in any sport to beat the same team
three times in one season. Do you think you found the key to beating Indiana
because obviously they're a talented team, or how did your game plan adapt as
you went on in the season?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, we don't put a lot of stock in how many times you play
them. For us it's competition, and we want to get better every time we step
out, regardless of who we're playing. So for us, it's continuing to set our
standard and set our bar.  
  
Obviously we knew going into this game, Patberg was really hot. We really
wanted to make her have to work for everything. I thought our zone kind of
changed the game. I thought it gave them more defenders to have to look at,
and I thought that was probably the difference.  
  
Q. I asked Kaila this, as well, but for whoever Indiana faces in the
tournament, what would you say that you had to do to be able to contain them
and stop them?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I think it obviously starts with their guard play first,
between Patberg and Berger. I mean, they're so talented, and they can score
the basketball. But they're going to be a tough out. When you talk about the
inside-outside game, the number of wins that they're rolling into March with.
I'm excited to be able to cheer them on now going into the NCAA Tournament. I
hope they go as far as possible.  
  
Q. When you were tied with Indiana for the third time, did you ever lose
just a slight bit of hope in your team?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, that's a great question. No, no. I never would have
that kind of doubt in our team. We've been through too many games and
situations, and I always believe that they're going to come out on top.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Naz Hillmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36626)

### [Hailey Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38925)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 66, Michigan - 60  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I thought it was a great basketball game. Disappointed to
come out on the losing end. Ohio State played well. We did a pretty good job,
I thought, of defending them, but they did a pretty good job of defending us,
so it was a battle on the defensive end for sure, and we just had some mishaps
down the stretch, and they made plays down the stretch when they needed to.  
  
I think two great teams, two great teams that will represent our conference
moving forward.  
  
Q. Hailey, it looked like some of the shots that really won the game
against Northwestern today just weren 't falling down the stretch today. Why
do you think that was?  
HAILEY BROWN: I mean, all the shots that I was taking, they felt good. The
release point felt good, and a couple times they just went in and out. I think
I had good opportunities, I was wide open for some of them. So I mean, it was
just tough, they didn't fall.  
  
Q. For either player, last night Ohio State had to play a completely
different game. They took off running last night but you really slowed them
down. What did you do to make that happen?  
NAZ HILLMON: Yes, that was definitely in our game plan. We definitely saw how
many threes that they had last night and we didn't want them to get hot. I
think we did a really good job of defending that but that also makes our
defense a little bit more spread out.  
  
But in terms of our defensive game plan, we definitely didn't want them to get
hot. Obviously threes are more than twos, since a couple of ours weren't
falling, we didn't want to play that game with them. So definitely tried to
slow them down in terms of getting the three-point off.  
  
Q. Ohio State had very balanced scoring tonight. Was there anyone you
could focus on and really not --  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think when preparing for this game, that was
probably the most difficult part is that they are balanced and they have seven
players that are pretty much averaging the same, between 14 and 10 points. And
I thought that was really the difference when they brought in Crooms in the
first half. I thought she did a great job for them, and you're always afraid
with Bell that she can make a play at any time. I think we did a really good
job on her, but they give them really great minutes.  
  
You know, it seemed -- and maybe because they had a little bit of an easier
game last night than we did, maybe they were a little bit more rested than we
were. There was a spurt where we couldn't get anything going, and maybe it was
the beginning of the third quarter where we really, really seemed fatigued,
and I took Naz out for a minute and kind of tried to pump her up a little bit
because I know that our team feeds off of her emotion, and she went back in
there, and we really dialed it up on the defensive end, which led to some easy
buckets on the offensive end, and that's when we tied the game -- we had the
ball, we tied the game and we turned it over and they got an easy one off of
our turnover off of their time-out.  
  
I thought we fought incredibly hard after playing three days with not a deep
bench, but they made those big plays down the stretch, and I think it really
speaks volumes to their attack is balanced, and when we took one person away,
another person stepped up and made a big play. They made their free throws,
too; we didn't.  
  
Q. Naz got going early but no one else really did out of the gate. What
was Ohio State doing to prevent that?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, that was tough. We talked about that at halftime. I
think she had 12 points at halftime and everybody else 1-for-5, 1-for-6,
1-for-6, 1-for-5.  
  
Ohio State's defense, and I've been playing against Ohio State for years,
obviously, since I've been at Michigan, and we have had an easier time scoring
against them in the past. I think their defense is much improved, and I think
they're long, they're athletic. They present a lot of defensive match-up
problems, and they did especially with our point guard, too, and I think that
disrupted us a little bit.  
  
But you know, in the second half, Hailey was able to get going a little bit,
but we need more than Naz to be able to score for us to be successful,
obviously.  
  
Q. What will be your final thoughts of this season? What do you think
overall after getting a chance to breathe? What will be your thoughts of this
whole entire season?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, one is, golly, we were so close. We were one
possession away from playing in the finals, and that is something that this
team deserved. We've had a lot of adversity this year and we've battled
through a ton of different things, from losing our No. 1 fan to cancer earlier
in the year, to losing our senior, who has been an All-Star for us to an ACL
tear, and it kind of seems as if it's been one thing after another.  
  
Just I think when I reflect, just how proud I am of the kids to persevere and
to not quit and to fight and claw to get to the semifinals and beat a lot of
good teams. Our league is stronger than it's ever been before from top to
bottom, deeper than it's ever been before, and I think our team really
represents our university in the best way possible and our program, and I feel
blessed to be able to work with them every day.  
  
This was a special group. It's a special year. It's kind of a bummer to end on
a loss, but I think we put ourselves in a position with this tournament and
with our schedule all season long to be an NCAA Tournament team. Obviously our
RPI is outstanding, and we just beat Northwestern last night, and our strength
of schedule is one of the best in the country. So I would like to see us on
the national stage, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, in those moments where the offense couldn 't seem to get it
going, what was Ohio State doing to be able to fluster your team that much?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I just think they took away the passing lanes. I think we
didn't make shots, too. Like yesterday we made shots. We won the game. If it
was that easy -- we didn't make shots early, and I think when you don't make
shots early, that messes with your confidence a little bit. I think our
confidence wavered when we didn't make shots early, and then Hailey and
Akienreh got some to fall, and then we just started to go to Naz as much as we
could.  
  
I mean, she put on a display. Obviously she is one of the best players in the
country, and at her position she's just a monster. For her to finish the game
with 22 points and 16 rebounds and pretty much face two people on her every
single time she touched the ball is really impressive.  
  
So you know, we just needed more of a balance, and we've kind of been a
balanced group with obviously Naz leading the charge, but we weren't that
balanced group tonight.  
  
Q. Did you see Danielle 's hand injury impact her game tonight or during
the tournament?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: We talk about the season, so we lose Kayla Robbins to her
torn ACL, her replacement goes down with a broken hand and six pins in her
hand, and I think it's four weeks maybe to the day, and she's out here playing
in the Big Ten Tournament. So that just kind of shows you what kids that I get
to coach every day and how committed she is to our program.  
  
But obviously she's not 100 percent. I mean, if you ever watch her catch the
ball or if you ever -- she has a broken hand. She has a pad on her hand. But
she's a warrior, and she would give anything to help our team be successful.  
  
She was a kid that was playing 30 minutes before she hurt that hand, and now
she's trying to just get back in to give us a couple minutes here and there to
maybe give Amy a break. I don't think she's 100 percent.  
  
I don't know if I could play with a pad and a wrap on my hand and be 100
percent, but she came in today and she gave us a spark and she made a big
shot, and she's an emotional leader, and she's just a tremendous kid. Just so
thankful she's in our program and thankful she was able to give us a few
minutes this weekend because we're going to definitely need her in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Naz got her thousandth rebound tonight as a sophomore --  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Point. That's okay, she's probably going to get 1,000
rebounds pretty soon.  
  
Q. Is there any limit to what she can do?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Holy cow. Well, Sarah just said she hit 500 rebounds today,
too. 1,000 points and 500 rebounds as a sophomore when you're facing double
teams on most nights is really impressive. I just think she's -- and you know
the thing is, she's going to be mad because she probably took 21 shots, it
says on this thing, and she didn't make 100 percent of her free throws, so she
is going to come in and say, Coach, I'm taking too many shots. I don't need to
take this many shots. That's how she was in the beginning of the year, and I
said, no, Naz, actually you need to take a couple more shots.  
  
I think her greatest gift is that she's such an incredible teammate, and she's
another warrior, she's a worker, she's extremely talented but extremely hard-
working. We tried to celebrate for a moment her thousandth point, and she's
just really upset, a kid from Ohio doesn't like to lose to Ohio State and
really left it all out on the court, so she's kinda bummed about the game more
than anything. But she's a special player, and I think obviously our
conference has taken notice of that, being a unanimous pick, and hopefully
people around the country have had an opportunity to watch her on TV because
she's undersized, so you might be like, okay, she's -- but then you watch her
play, and her ability to go rebound the ball is incredible.  
  
When we were deeper before all of our injuries, she was at the front of our
press. She gets tips and deflections. She has a 6'7" wingspan. She's a kid
that can do a little bit of everything. But her greatest attitude is she's
just a tremendous kid and a tremendous teammate.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38869)

### [Khadaizha Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38915)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 78, Rutgers - 60  
  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: That was a hard-fought battle. I'm not surprised at all.
We had a tough game at our place, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the battle (indiscernible)?  
KHADAIZHA SANDERS: I think it was just a game that showed how tough our
conference is. Every team in the Big Ten is a contender, and I think we had a
hard-fought game, like Coach said, and unfortunately we came up short today.  
  
Q. Seemed like you specifically came out really aggressive in the second
half. Was that something Coach talked to you about at halftime? Was that a
personal thing? How did that happen?  
KHADAIZHA SANDERS: I mean, it was kind of personal. I mean, I know that
somebody else got to be an offensive threat, not just Arella. They're sending
two and three bodies at her every game. So my job is to try to relieve some of
that pressure from her, so I just wanted to be aggressive and hopefully open
the floor up some more.  
  
Q. For the most part or whenever IU did get on a run, you guys were able
to respond. Moving forward, wherever you guys do play in the postseason, how
is that going to feel, that you guys were able to do that today?  
KHADAIZHA SANDERS: I think it just goes back to what I was saying earlier. The
conference is tough, and playing Indiana got us prepared for the next level,
which is going to the NCAA Tournament. I mean, it was a hard-fought game.
Hard-fought game, obviously we're going to learn from it, we're going to go
back, watch film and just prepare for whoever we have next.  
  
Q. You 're a team that likes to press. In general, why do you like that
style? And also, in past years it's been more successful against IU. This year
as a better team they've countered it. Can you talk about in general your
propensity to press a lot as a team, that's like a style you like to do.  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: Yeah, everybody has a style, a particular style, and that
is what fires us up and gets us started, and aside from that, it's good. It
allows a lot of people to play. On the other hand, a lot of times you can do
that because you have enough people to really work up a sweat and they can
come in and they can be as effective as you would normally want to be.  
  
But if you notice, we didn't do that at the beginning, and the reason why we
didn't do it at the beginning is because we had to do it in our last game, and
so we only have like eight or nine players -- nine players really. And so it
was a bit much because it was the same two people that would be involved in
all of the running, and that is at the top, that's TK as well as Mael Gilles.
So we tried to back it off a little bit and do it when we had to.  
  
But the team jumped out to a quick lead, and that was a problem.  
  
Q. Your team had two assists today for the game. Would you blame that on
maybe Indiana --  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: I've never seen that in my life. That's the most amazing
thing. Hats off to Indiana. I mean, really and truly.  
  
But to tell you the truth, I think that if we had done a little better job in
terms of spreading our offense and allowing those passes to take place, but I
think that we got a little rattled at the beginning and wanted to hurry up and
try to overcome what was happening, and it is surprising in a way because we
know how Indiana played in the first place. But we nonetheless just found
ourselves getting into that situation where we were taking quick shots, and
the ball did not move from side to side. And when that happens, they had
touches -- they were putting -- Arella Guirantes is a special player. To me,
quite frankly, she's probably one of the best players in the country, aside
from the Big Ten. That's what I'm going to say.  
  
But what happened here was that when we made the pass to her or to anyone on
let's say the right side, then instead of us reversing and getting over on the
other side, which we knew it would open it up more, we didn't. So any time
that we attempted to drive, then there were people all around the ball. So we
needed to move from side to side to side, but we didn't, and sometimes that
happens in a coaching situation. It was just the players really desperately
wanted to win, and we weren't having shots to fall.  
  
And then if you look at it statistically, you can look at this and see that
Khadaizha Sanders as well as Arella were the only two productive people in the
scoring column. They shut down everybody else, and that's the reason why
Khadaizha was saying that she wanted to score more, because we needed the
help. It would have been great had we been able to contribute more, but we
didn't. We didn't. We wanted to, but the reason for that was we just did not
move the ball from side to side, which is exactly what Indiana did. They moved
it from side to side, and we didn't do that. So we didn't stick clearly with
the game plan.  
  
They are an outstanding team, though. Make no mistake about it. I'm not
surprised that they beat South Carolina. Not at all. And I'm sure that that's
the reason why our conference has the recognition that it does have.  
  
But that's the name of the game.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 74, Purdue - 62  
  
SHARON VERSYP: Just really pleased with our team, just the effort and the game
plan and executing it. Maryland does such a good job scoring in the paint,
especially on transition offense, and obviously in half court, but their
transition offense. They've been averaging 50 to 60 points in the paint, and
today we held them to 32 points in the paint, which was really, really
important for us to be successful, and we obviously had to shoot the ball
better than we did last time.  
  
So I thought it was a really hard-fought battle, and obviously we wish
Maryland the best of success.  
  
Q. Coach, Taylor Mikesell really found her stroke from three tonight.
What are some of the challenges of having to defend a really tough shooter
like that?  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, she really shot the ball well in the second half.
We knew that she would. In our zone we were just trying to find her quite a
bit, and when they did a lot of skip passes, we were trying to pack the paint.
It worked very well. The second quarter they only shot 19 percent, so it was
efficient. But you know, they're great basketball players, so they're going to
make shots, but she's always difficult to defend. We did a good job for part
of the game, but we did do it with the game plan that we wanted.  
  
Q. At the end of the third quarter there, I think Karissa had a three-
point shot that would have taken it down to five, they go down on the other
end and hit a three and all of a sudden it 's 11. How hard is it against a
team with the talent that Maryland has to put together any sort of extended
run?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think we did that in the first half, but there's certain --
it's always the timing of shots, and pretty much the scenario of the game, and
you have a great open look, and if that's drained, it changes the complexion,
and then going down and nailing a three. I mean, obviously you don't want to
get up and down nonstop with them. We wanted to control the tempo. I thought
we did that well. You always want to be able to shoot that dagger when you
can, but that's always going to change the momentum a little bit. But we got
behind, and we still sustained and made a run, so that was what was really
key.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about what happened at the start of the fourth
quarter after that three-point shot. All of a sudden you go from being in the
game to down 20.  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, in the beginning of the fourth quarter, we took too many
quick shots, and we weren't controlling the tempo. We didn't control the tempo
during that time, and that's what happened, and called a time-out, and then we
got it back within 12 and then get it back to nine, and it just kept
fluctuating. They want you to do that, so if you're missing, that's when they
take advantage, and obviously we were missing during that time, so we called a
time-out, calmed down, and then we were able to make another run.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Teri Moren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27752)

### [Aleksa Gulbe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38916)

### [Ali Patberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36606)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 78, Rutgers - 60  
  
TERI MOREN: Well, we're excited about the opportunity to move forward and
advance in what I think is going to be a really great tournament. Really happy
with our guys and just how we came out. The double bye is sometimes a blessing
and a curse in the sense that you want to get your kids out there on the floor
as quickly as you can, and get that first game under your belt because I just
think that that's the most important game in any kind of a tournament format,
and so I was a little bit -- not worried, but as I said to these guys, we've
got to get off to a quick, a fast start, a good start, and if your shots don't
fall at the beginning, just settle in because sooner or later they will.  
  
But I thought our guys, especially this one to my right, Ali, she came out
just being super aggressive. I've said it here probably in the last month over
and over again, when Ali Patberg is aggressive the way she was this afternoon,
the entire team gains a lot of confidence, and because of that, everybody else
is scoring steps up and feels confident.  
  
So we're going to need Ali to remain not just confident but aggressive as we
move forward until tomorrow, but I thought Lex came in in the second half and
just did a tremendous job just battling, not just scoring the ball, but I
thought she battled on the boards and I thought she did a tremendous job
defensively, and we needed an X factor today.  
  
Grace Waggoner struggled a little bit from the outside, obviously Jaelynn went
down there in the second half with that ankle. So we needed somebody else to
step up, and I thought Lex just -- she did a tremendous job.  
  
Q. Ali, it was a physical game, and as Coach has alluded to, the and-
ones that Aleksa had in the fourth quarter, how big were those?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, they were huge, as Coach said. She was the X factor. She
brought a lot of energy. She battled on every board, even if she didn't get
it. I thought she was making plays at the ball, and a couple times I told her
because I think I threw her the ball a couple times and she shot a jumper, and
I told her, I said, you've got to just attack her, be aggressive, and she
finally did, and she was awesome. She was huge in the second half for us.  
  
Q. For Aleksa, just kind of looking at it the other way, when Ali gets
off to a like that, what 's going through your guys' mind to try feed her? She
had 20 points in the first half, keep going at her and letting her attack?  
ALEKSA GULBE: I mean, we know what she's capable of doing, and when she is hot
like that, we just give her the ball, and she does her job, and we were all
confident in her, and we believe in her that she's going to score and she's
going to do all the things that matter.  
  
Q. With Ali having a great first half with 20 points, the rest of the
team only had 18. Were you anticipating Rutgers to start helping out on Ali
and trying to force the ball to other people and how did you game plan for
that?  
TERI MOREN: You know, I don't know that we anticipated them just solely
worried about AP. I think we were worried about their press, that we felt like
they were going to come out in the second half and be aggressive on both sides
of the ball. We anticipated that we were going to have to handle the press
after made baskets, after free throws, dead balls, in which we had to do that.
And so, you know, I think -- again, the one great thing about this team is
that we have proven night in and night out that we are balanced, and we have
other players that can step up, and I thought we got to see that today.  
  
Everybody is a threat out there, and I think AP would allude to that and she
would agree with that. She has a tremendous amount of confidence, but like I
said, we anticipated that second half being more fast paced. They obviously
went small and just started putting their head down and going right at us and
attacking us off the bounce, and so we put them at the free-throw line too
much. That's the one disappointing thing I think about this game this
afternoon if I have to find something that we can't do tomorrow, and that's
put Maryland at the free-throw line.  
  
Q. For Ali or Aleksa, at the start of the fourth quarter, things really
got chippy between the two teams, really physical play by Rutgers. What do you
do to tune that out and just focus on your game, just keep trying to get to
the hoop and keep trying to score?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, we knew Rutgers was not going to go away in the second half
as Coach said. They were going to come out aggressive. They're a super
competitive team. They have a lot of heart and a lot of toughness, and we knew
they were going to come out with that energy, and we just had to weather the
storm. When they would make a tough play or they would get an offensive
rebound, we just tried to stay calm or if we made a foul -- we came together
and again, like I said, we stayed calm, just knowing that they were going to
make runs at us, and we just had to stay solid.  
  
Q. Coach Teri, it 's been mentioned time and time again that things got
chippy in the second half, but you guys were able defensively to force Rutgers
to shoot 30 percent from the field. How is that going to be able to translate
for you guys to have success tomorrow against Maryland?  
TERI MOREN: Well, you know, one of the things we talked about before we came
out is we were going to have to win the effort points, right, we're going to
have to win the toughness game. And I've got a tough group, and we all believe
and they believe in each other, and our staff believes in our players.  
  
And so one of the things that has rung true, I think, with this group time and
time again, the reason why we've had the success that we've had so far has
been a lot to do with the fact that, yeah, we're balanced, we guard hard, but
we're tough. You know, this group, I can promise you, will not go away
quietly, and that's one of the intangible things that I love about them is
that they're connected but they're tough women.  
  
Q. Ali, looking at the turnover numbers, you guys are pretty even, but
in terms of points off of turnovers, you guys outscored them by 15. How much
was that something you emphasized going into this week and pushing the ball
like that?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, you know, Coach just kept telling us stay aggressive, stay
aggressive. I think defensively we were in our spots. We were in our spots
where the coaches prepared us to be in, and we just made plays, and then once
we made plays defensively, we kept pushing it in transition.  
  
Q. Ali, you 've been on a tear like the last four or five games,
averaging over 20 points per game. Is that a conscious decision or are things
just opening up for you better?  
ALI PATBERG: You know, I just think coaches and my teammates have been telling
me to be aggressive, and I'm just going to do whatever it takes to win, and
like I said, they've been telling me to be aggressive, and I want to win, so
that's what I do.  
  
Q. What 's been the propensity this year? You've been better in neutral
sites, on the road than you've been at home. You haven't been bad at home, but
you've had like three losses all year on the road versus at home. Is it the
fans? Is it more pressure at home? How come you've been stronger on the road
and on neutral sites this year and even controlled the game more?  
TERI MOREN: You know, I don't know that I have the answer for that. What I can
say is what I said earlier; I have a tough bunch of women that are focused and
are driven and want to be successful.  
  
You know, I used to think, and I still do think, that being at home is a good
thing in front of our fans. I think that our fans have been terrific and have
been there for us, and there's this idea of staying on a schedule and going to
class and not getting out of routine.  
  
But with that being said, I think that once we've gone on the road with these
guys, we sort of eliminate some of the distractions that they may have at home
or back in their dorm rooms and apartments with friends and families and
whatnot, and I can kind of keep them contained a little bit more, and I think
we've proven that we can go on the road.  
  
But as we've moved forward with our program, that's one of the things that has
sort of been an Achilles heel for us. We've been right there, we've won a lot
of games at home, and we love being in Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall. But as we
always tell our guys, championship teams, teams that move on, teams that play
in the NCAA Tournament figure out how to win away from home, as well, and
we've got great leadership with Ali Patberg and Brenna Wise. They've just been
tremendous and have been tremendous in that locker room and tremendous in the
hotels and everywhere and just leading these guys in the right way.  
  
Q. When you see Grace Waggoner take those two charges, what does that
say about her hard work to be able to go from not being in the rotation at the
start of the year to playing these valuable minutes?  
TERI MOREN: Well, it says she's paying attention, and we value those kids that
can get into the game and have an impact, and we watch that in practice, and
she's a young lady that doesn't get a lot of reps, but she pays attention, and
she's focused. And she's athletic. She's long and lanky, and the more we watch
her in practice and against our practice guys, she has been determined to want
to have an impact on this basketball team, and she's just kind of stuck with
it.  
  
She's a great story. For her to come up big with those charges in the first
half says a lot about just the kind of tough kid she is, that Indiana kid,
that when her number is called, she responds, and I thought she did a great
job.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, obviously Maryland is a very balanced
team. The two times you faced them this year, they beat you guys by double
digits. What do you see as the key to changing the result this time around,
making the third time a charm?  
TERI MOREN: Well, you know, I don't -- we were so much better at home, right,
the second time we played them. You know, one of the things you've got to
battle is their athleticism. They're very balanced, as well. They have young
ladies that come off the bench and provide scoring for them, and so I think,
one, it's staying disciplined like we did this afternoon defensively. On the
offensive side you can't turn it over. Possessions matter tomorrow, and we've
got to deal with their press, much like we had to do tonight or this afternoon
with Rutgers.  
  
But I do think that I have a group in that locker room that really believes
that they can win, that they can beat them, and hopefully one of the things
right now that's concerning for us is Jaelynn has a pretty significant ankle
sprain, and so tomorrow hopefully we'll have some time to get her feeling
better.  
  
But if she's not ready to go, we have to rely on that bench. But like I said,
I like our chances with this group, and we'll have to obviously play almost
perfect. We realize that.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on what you said about Jaelynn, she went down but
came back in and hit the three but looked a little hobbled the rest of the
game. How determined was she to stay in the game?  
TERI MOREN: It's funny that we were in that press attack and she didn't want
to be in a spot where you have to move. She wanted to -- she was dead set on
taking the ball out of bounds, but then we get it across the timeline and she
gets settled outside the three-point line and she's not afraid to take that
three.  
  
You know, again, what does that say about her, is that she's -- again, like
the other 12, 13 guys I've got in that locker room. She's going to do what she
has to do for her team, and if that's playing through pain, she'll do that.
But that big three that she hit down the stretch, that was huge.  
  
Q. Your 24th win today, school record, most ever in a season. I 'm
curious, do you ever have time during the season, during the grind where you
can reflect on an accomplishment like that? Do you put it aside completely
until the end of the year? How do you handle those?  
TERI MOREN: Yeah, I think right now it's -- usually we have a 24-hour rule,
whether we win or we lose. We either celebrate or we evaluate, and then the
next day we've got to turn around and get ready to move forward. And so this
is 24 hours after a win, we're going to celebrate, we're going to get ready
for a good Maryland team. But we don't even -- it's great, but right now
that's something that we will reflect back, I think, after the season when we
do our end-of-the-year banquet and talk about all those great moments that we
had.  
  
As for now, I hope this season is long from being over, just because I have
such a great group. So thank you.

### [Veronica Burton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38929)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 67, Northwestern - 59  
  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, listen, hey, congratulations to Michigan. It was a hard-
fought game. They just made a couple plays when they had to. We made a run to
come back and got it down to two, and I thought we had a great chance to win,
but they made a couple big plays late, too. They were able to hurt us a little
bit inside most of the game, and we battled back. We're a resilient team.
We're a great team. But give them credit tonight.  
  
With that being said, like I told our players, before tonight, we're 26-3. We
haven't lost -- I can't remember the last time we lost. We went undefeated in
February. These guys have given Northwestern everything they have, so it's a
great season.  
  
For us, a lot of basketball left hopefully, and to play in the NCAA Tournament
coming up, to be Big Ten Conference champions in the regular season, ranked in
the top 20, a lot of great things, but more importantly is in 10 days from now
or 12 days from now, whenever we play next, you'll see a great team out there.
I have no doubt about that.  
  
Q. Last year obviously not the exact same situation, you guys had a
really tough first-round loss in this tournament, go to the WNIT, similar time
frame, make a big run there. How can you take lessons from that situation and
apply them to this year?  
VERONICA BURTON: I just think that we know we have a lot of basketball ahead
of us, and we have to move on quickly because as Coach said, we've got to get
ready for March and postseason. I think we showed our resilience in the WNIT
last year, and I have no doubt that we'll do the same.  
  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Yeah, like you said, we played a team that we've played two
times already, and it's really tough to beat the same team three times. There
was a lot of things that went on that we're going to learn from, we're going
to implement in our practices. And like Veronica said, we were really
resilient in that WNIT run, and that should propel us in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Michigan talked about trying to take the ball out of your hands,
Veronica, with Dilk shadowing you for 94 feet. Can you talk about how that
made it tough to initiate the offense?  
VERONICA BURTON: Yeah, it definitely disrupts a little -- it didn't take too
much out of us I don't think, but it definitely, one, makes me work harder to
get the ball and kind of disrupts a little bit of what we do because a lot of
the play calls start with me with the ball, but at the end of the day I think
we adapted pretty well. We trust anyone with the ball. Jordan handled it
perfectly fine. Again, it's just like frustrating a little bit, but I think we
adapted fine.  
  
Q. As a team you guys are 10-for-19 from the free-throw line. Seemed
like you left a lot of points out there. After a situation like that where you
guys know you 're leaving free points out on the court, how do you get back in
the gym and really go to work off of that?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Something that we highly emphasize all the time is we have to
make our lay-ups and our free throws. And those are two areas I feel like in
this game where we kind of dropped the ball a little bit. I just feel like
that's the thing that just needs repetition. We need to get in the gym when we
get back, have a goal set in mind to make 100 free throws, maybe even more a
day each, and then that'll just hopefully help our percentage out a little
bit.  
  
VERONICA BURTON: Yeah, as you said, we've got to get back in the gym and focus
on the little things. In a game like this and the game even before, we can't
really afford to go 10-for-19 from the free-throw line. I mean, that's enough
said I feel like, but we've just got to get better from that.  
  
Q. Jordan, what can you take from this experience? You played incredibly
well in the first half, made two buzzer-beater shots and scored 11 points.
What can you take from this breakout performance in the postseason and kind of
take it forth to the NCAA?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: This is just something that my teammates and my coaches have
been trying to get me to do. I've been -- I've kind of had not the best year.
I know that myself. But I mean, they've been pushing me day in and day out,
shoot the ball, shoot the ball. They have so much courage and confidence in
me, and I feel like it's finally clicked, and I just hope that that also
carries over into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, I 'll ask you the same question I asked them: Last year sort
of a similar situation, sort of different, but really tough loss in that first
round, Michigan State gave you guys a thumping and then you come back in the
WNIT and make a big run. What lessons can you take from that situation?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, I think that was a great. I think, growth spurt for us last
March. To play in April, when most of college basketball is watching. So I
think they also understood our team -- we have almost everybody back from that
team. Obviously we've missed Pallas.  
  
But the goal was to use that to propel us to the NCAA Tournament this year,
and I think it helped us. And I think they've done a great job of -- look,
that experience will make us better. Now everything is out there for us.
Everything opens up for us over the next two weeks. We want to -- I think they
understand that, and I certainly understand it. But I think that experience
helped us.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously been a roller coaster the last week or so. A week
ago you 're preparing to win your first Big Ten title, regular season title in
30 years; tough loss today. How do you kind of put both of those things behind
you and try to achieve your ultimate goal?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, I thought, again, like I said, I give -- Michigan is a
really good team. We had beaten them twice, come from behind at Michigan in a
great game, and we knew it was going to be a battle. But I think our players,
the biggest thing we talk about, look, you came here to play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's why I recruited you. That's why you came to Northwestern.
That's why we built Welsh-Ryan Arena and Trienens. To say we're Big Ten
champs, all those things, I think we've got to now take advantage over the
next couple weeks.  
  
I've been to a lot of NCAA Tournaments, and nobody on this team has played in
any. I'm going to have to use my experiences, too, and just get them ready.
But we'll be ready. This team, given 10 days of rest, I wouldn't want to play
us.  
  
Q. Kind of going back to Michigan being a good team, you 've beaten them
in two close come-from-behind victories this year. How did you prepare for
this game here with the postseason ramifications and also the return of Naz
Hillmon?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I think the biggest thing was they made some threes that --
I give Maddie Nolan a lot of credit, hit big shots. They bank one in, I think
we cut it two and they came down and bank one in at the end of their shot
clock.  
  
So you've got to give them credit. But I think we were ready to play tonight.
Michigan is a good team. We use this as a way to say, look, how does this help
us going into the first round of the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. You 've talked before about how you need Lindsey Pulliam to take a
lot of shots. The last two games Michigan has been able to effectively limit
her. Talk about how that affects your offense and how you can use lessons from
that moving forward.  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, it was a physical game. It was a really physical game
tonight, and I thought she got good looks at times. She's a great player. She
had 32 against Michigan at Welsh-Ryan. She's capable of dropping 32 on
somebody in March. That's why I brought her here.  
  
Again, she is the heart and soul of our team from the standpoint of an
emotional leader, captain, and she played her heart out tonight, and she's the
focal point of everybody's defense, and not just Michigan.  
  
Q. I saw you take Sydney and Veronica kind of under your arm postgame as
you walked off the floor. Can you share a little bit about what your message
was to them and really your entire team after a loss like this?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, you know, Sydney was fighting off some injuries tonight and
had a rough night, and we had to hold her out for a while. But Sydney Wood and
Veronica Burton have had this incredible chemistry together and this
incredible year, and so I just wanted to let them know how much I appreciate
them, and now they're juniors. Now you're playing in the NCAA Tournament even
though you're a sophomore -- you get another year, so it's like a new season.  
  
And same thing with our team. Nothing that -- everybody is a little down right
now because they fought hard. You know, we'll move on.  
  
But those two I think laid out every ounce of blood they had all year, and I
was just really proud of them, and I just wanted them to know.  
  
Q. Veronica talked about how you guys didn 't do the little things,
especially in that second half. What do you think was the cause of that in
this game in particular?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, we left them -- we tried to take away their inside game
defensively, and they hit some big threes. They hit that stretch, that hit
three threes in a row I want to say. I don't have a running box yet, but with
a tie game, we'd score, they'd score and it was going back and forth and then
they got up six or eight, and it was more they made tough shots, and a couple
times we had some breakdowns where we left them open.  
  
So give them credit, too. Nolan made tough shots. Johnson made a tough three.
I think Hailey Brown made a three in that stretch. They were just backbreakers
when they made them because we'd just come down, maybe score, and as you guys
mention, too, you've got to make free throws in these games. You've got to
make lay-ups. We did that all year. That's why we're Big Ten champions.  
  
Q. You spoke about Michigan being able to make those tough threes.
Tonight the Wolverines were able to limit Abi Scheid. I think she only had one
or two threes tonight. How are you going to take those abilities and the lack
of threes that you guys made tonight and try to get more from behind the arc
down the road?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, they made seven threes, we made three in a game that was a
two-point game under a minute. We hit 10 against Rutgers. We're streaky, and
sometimes we're great. Abi Scheid is the No. 1 three-point shooter in the
country, so again -- she was, or she is, I don't know, statistically. But
she's just carried us all year making big shots. She scored five straight
points tonight to give us a chance to win the game, and she'll be back.  
  
I think when you get out of your league now and into the NCAA Tournament, you
play against -- tonight we played against a team, just like they did, that
kind of knows all your plays, kind of plays you a certain way. So it'll be
good to play outside the league a little bit, too. But great respect for the
Big Ten.  
  
And Abi Scheid, man, what a year. My God, senior, and for her to be 26-4,
ranked top -- I don't know what we are, 11th, 12th in the country, and you're
going to play in March, I'm really proud of her. She's going to light somebody
up in March.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Dorka Juhasz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36593)

### [Braxtin Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36647)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 87, Iowa - 66  
  
KEVIN McGUFF: We can go right into questions.  
  
Q. How fun was that great start you guys had, and how important was it
to come out firing right away?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think it was really important to just make sure we had a lot
of energy from the very beginning. I think we wanted to send a message from
the jump and just show that we were ready and we really wanted it.  
  
I think it was great also that we had such great chemistry and we were hitting
and things like that, so it was really important for us to come out super
strong.  
  
Q. What made the zone that they were running in the first half so easy
to break?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I believe we were just moving the ball really well, and we
always made an extra pass. So it was just people were just hitting shots, and
obviously we keep like scoring from outside to inside.  
  
So definitely like when we played there, it was a little hard for us to play
against their zone, so we were preparing for it a lot, and I believe like we
moved the ball really well, so probably that's why we could break it so
easily.  
  
Q. Braxtin, obviously hitting shots makes a big difference, but other
than that, what was the difference this time around, especially early in that
first quarter?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think we came out a lot better. I think our defense was a
big factor, as well. I think that we were able to create a lot of things from
our defense and then turn that into offense and get some transition points and
things like that. I think, though, that our defense was a lot today.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys excel on both ends of the court, but moving
forward, which aspect of this game was more important for you guys, the
offensive performance that you guys put up or the defensive performance
against a team that came into this game averaging 80 points a game?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think every time it's really our defense that's going to be
the deciding factor. I think that sometimes offense can go up and down, and
you can hit shots and then go into spurts where the team is not really hitting
shots. So I think it's super important for us to be able to have great defense
and get stops, which then can turn into easy baskets in transition, where we
really excel. So I think defense is definitely the main factor.  
  
Q. What was the key for you guys defensively? What changed this time
around?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I mean, I believe just like our team defense, just like overall,
help side, also like straight line drives, and just like helping each other
was really important. Obviously they have the Big Ten Player of the Year, so
we were preparing for a lot, and also great post players and guards. I believe
everybody contributed in this win defensively and offensively, as well.  
  
But it's just effort. I believe like we were going out, we were hungry for the
win, and I mean, in the first quarter, I think we made a really big push.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of walk me through that early run that you guys had
in the first quarter? Obviously hitting shots makes a big difference, but how
were you able to do that against a team that is one of the leading teams in
this conference?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, no, Iowa has got a great team. I have great respect for
them. Really excited for what they're going to do in the NCAA Tournament. I
think they'll be a really tough out. But I thought our defense was certainly
better tonight than the first time we played them. That was the key. We were
going to have to stop them. They're really hard to keep up with, if you're
going to let them score like they normally because they're just so efficient.  
  
But we were good defensively, we forced a lot of shots from the perimeter that
we were able to contest, and then on offense I thought we moved the ball. But
the same thing, you've got to make some shots, and we made them, so that
allowed us to get off to a great start.  
  
Q. From a confidence standpoint not just in this game but moving
forward, what does it do for a team to know that they can put a run like that
together?  
KEVIN McGUFF: You know, we've been kind of building towards this, if you kind
of look at our body of work. We have a really young team with no seniors and
just one junior, and the goal for us was to continue to get better throughout
the year, and if you look where we started and where we are now, we've made
significant progress, and that's always the goal. But with a team this young
we were really focused on that, and so hopefully this will just lead us into
postseason where we're playing our best basketball.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys are peaking at this point? Is this your
best performance?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I think so. That's what I -- we've been kind of building towards
is to make sure we're playing our best basketball at this time of year, which
like I said, everybody does, but for us, with so many new people and we were
so young, it's been a real process, and that's probably what I'm most proud of
is our kids have really committed to making sure we improved as a team
throughout the year.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference for you guys defensively in this
game?  
KEVIN McGUFF: I thought we guarded the ball a lot better. They really beat us
off the dribble in the first go-around, and then also they got us around the
basket -- two things: Guarding the ball and our post defense were both
significantly better than the first time we played them in Iowa City.  
  
Q. I kind of asked them about the zone breaking. What do you think was
the difference between this time and the last time you played them?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, we moved the ball a lot better, and then we also made
shots. Yeah, I think even last night, Minnesota played a lot of zone and we
were getting open shots, we just weren't making them. So we had a hard time
pulling away from them until late in the game we finally made some shots. But
today we started out really hot from the three-point line, and that obviously
made all the difference.  
  
Q. Dorka got into some foul trouble. How did you adapt to that
situation?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, I mean, it's tough. We rely on her for so much, and she's
so versatile and she plays both ends of the floor so well. But I thought Aixa
Wone came in especially and was really good defensively. She really competed
with the post players and she really fought and gave us some great minutes.

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Shakira Austin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38906)

### [Stephanie Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36619)

### [Taylor Mikesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36620)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 74, Purdue - 62  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I thought you saw a team in Purdue that was extremely
hungry, extremely talented. I thought they battled for 40 minutes. Really
showed why we should have eight teams into the NCAA Tournament. They gave us
everything that they had for 40 minutes and really made us work. But I thought
once we were able to kind of settle in with our first game, I thought the
first quarter took us some time to be able to kind of get acclimated and get
our game legs back under us. I thought we were able to find a way to make
plays, and we were making plays for each other, sharing the basketball,
defending three players, when you talk about with double-doubles, I thought
did a tremendous job both on the glass and sharing the basketball.  
  
Q. Taylor, your second straight game of 22 points with six threes. One
point shy of career high and one shy of a new career high with triples, as
well. How are you feeling right now? Seems like you 're really on a hot
streak.  
TAYLOR MIKESELL: I feel good, but just trying to survive and advance at this
point. Really we're looking forward to tomorrow's game right now and just
trying to stay hot from behind the arc and as a team.  
  
Q. Shakira and Stephanie, you guys both had double-doubles with rebounds
tonight. Do you ever get competitive about who gets the most?  
SHAKIRA AUSTIN: Yeah, I would say we're pretty competitive. It starts in
practice, like we're always just competing, just going back and forth with
each other, and it shows on the court. She's just -- Steph is so consistent.
She's always just cleaning up for everybody else, and it just showed in the
stats with her doubles, and she's -- just the plan is to keep it going for the
rest of the tournament.  
  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, I would say we're both pretty competitive when it comes
to it. We just push each other, make each other better.  
  
Q. Shakira, how have you seen Taylor either grow or kind of, I guess,
adapt to the season throughout the year?  
SHAKIRA AUSTIN: Taylor has grown so much from the beginning. Her confidence
has maintained the whole season, but just making sure that we keep her
confidence up in this last part of the season because this is when we're going
to need her the most, and just making sure that she keeps shooting. It might
not fall, but we're still going to keep pushing for her to keep putting the
shots up and just being aggressive, like she is.  
  
Q. Stephanie, it 's obviously an interesting defense that you guys are
playing with the pressure you have. How important is it for you guys to be
able to maintain these switches in the defense, and how is that sort of
different from what you've had the last three years?  
STEPHANIE JONES: This year is very important for us to stick to our principles
of pressuring the ball and having that line knowing that we have each other's
back, compared to the last three years where it was more like of you guarding
your person. It wasn't as like a collective unit. I think this year we've done
a great job of getting to that point of trusting each other and really having
each other's backs.  
  
Q. Stephanie and Shakira, in the second half especially, the third
quarter looked like you guys kind of started to get inside more and find more
success, and I know you had a fast break lay-up and were pushing the pace. Was
that a halftime message to get inside more and take advantage of that instead
of settling for perimeter shots?  
STEPHANIE JONES: Yeah, coming out of the locker room, our message was
definitely to be more aggressive and not settle so fast. Like I mean, we knew
that we had Tay being able to knock down shots outside, but just to be able to
go inside-out first and like look for the open shot and just be patient with
it.  
  
SHAKIRA AUSTIN: Yeah, first half we were rushing a lot of shots and not
finding what we usually find, so just making sure the second half the message
was to play the gaps and play slow, and don't let them speed you up because
they're giving us whatever we want.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about the sort of slow start, trying
to get your legs underneath you. What specifically were you seeing out there,
that the defense was maybe a little lax or what was your message?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I mean, we were late on a lot of -- they did a nice job
driving and kicking. They hit some big threes that first quarter. They hit
four threes. They ended the one with a bank shot. The second quarter we were
able to clean it up a little bit more, when you talk about they were only able
to get one three off. Obviously when you get Kaila in early foul trouble, I
thought that impacted her, it impacted our team, not having her on the floor
for the minutes that we like to have her.  
  
Q. Purdue has Harris and Diagne down low. What do you do to ready the
team to go against great rebounders like those two?  
BRENDA FRESE: Man, they were a handful for us. We were trying to get some
quick box-outs on them, trying to be able to push them back, but they were
able to expose us at different times, I thought, with some of the mismatches.
But trying to put the work in early, and then they exposed us when we were
late.  
  
Q. Brenda, Taylor had a little bit shakier start to the season. Since
conference play have you seen her settle into the point guard role? Is it
getting used to the defense? Is it kind of a combination of all those
things?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I think, I keep telling her it's the rest that we've
provided for her to get to this point in March where she wasn't last year. She
definitely -- Taylor is such a winner, and again, all season we've asked her
to run duties at the point guard position, has done whatever it takes, but we
took her out of her natural position, and so that took time, and selfishly it
impacted her with how she was playing the game.  
  
But I think now as we've been able to get in some comfortable rotations and
with our freshmen settling in a little bit more, it's made it a lot easier.
We've been able to find her easier. I think of that skip pass that Blair had,
which I think really broke the game open. We're just making more plays like
that to be able to find her.  
  
Q. How important was the offensive rebounding when the shots weren 't
falling?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, I sort of joked at halftime, it reminded me of our Iowa
game there when we were getting all kinds of offensive rebounds, not putting
them back. Didn't want the same outcome, though.  
  
You know, it was important to get on the glass. We talked about it at
halftime, just settling in. I thought we got those O-boards and rushed shots.
I thought there was times where we could get those O-boards and be able to
kick them out because Purdue's length is extremely difficult to be able to
shoot over, which you saw with the amount of blocked shots that they had on
us.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kathleen Doyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33245)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 87, Iowa - 66  
  
LISA BLUDER: I kind of want to apologize for our poor performance tonight. It
really was pretty unexpected. I thought we had two good prep days before we
came here, and obviously we didn't have to play late last night like Ohio
State did, yet it looked like Ohio State had a lot more energy than we did
today.  
  
They shot the ball extremely well to begin this game and kind of just kept
that momentum going, and we just could never get any run going, any momentum
going.  
  
But I'm proud of our season. I'm proud of what we've done. For us to be 23-7,
finish third in the Big Ten, we had a good year. We'll prepare for the NCAA
Tournament. We know we'll be in that, so we'll just prepare for that and then
try to get better.  
  
Q. You came out of the game twice but you came back in. What was that
determination to keep getting back in?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: I mean, it's postseason play, I'm going to be on the floor as
much as I possibly can. It was disappointing those things happened, but I just
tried to be out there fighting with my teammates, so I just tried to get back
out there as fast as I could.  
  
Q. Kathleen, what was the difference this time around, especially just
having to go against their offense?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, we didn't play good defense. We needed to move harder in
our zone and play with more energy and tenacity on defense, and we didn't do
that. We didn't get the job done, and credit to Ohio State for shooting the
ball well.  
  
Q. Obviously this is fresh, but what do you take away from this game in
terms of what you guys need to do differently moving forward, especially on
the defensive end?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I think we just have to be locked in earlier. Like I
said, bring more energy and tenacity and make people uncomfortable. They were
just kind of doing whatever they wanted on offense, and we need that to not
happen.  
  
Q. When you 're in the midst of a run like that that they were on, I
think it was a 19-0 run there in the first quarter, how hard is it mentally to
slow things down and change the tide?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I mean, it's obviously hard, but that's the game of
basketball. It's a game of runs, and whoever does a better job of withstanding
each other's runs is going to prevail, so they did a better job of that
tonight.  
  
Q. As the leader of this team, kind of moving forward, how do you
motivate the team and get them prepared for the NCAA Tournament?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I mean, it's do or die now, just like it was tonight.
Now that we have that experience under our belt, I can tell you we definitely
don't want to feel this way again. So we're going to hit it hard the next
couple weeks preparing for the NCAA Tournament and try to make a deep run at
it.  
  
Q. Coach, in the midst of that run there in the first quarter, what did
you see from Ohio State and what they were doing offensively to allow them so
many looks?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I mean, we tried to call a couple time-outs and tried to
stop the bleeding a little bit there, but that was pretty impressive shooting.
I mean, if they shoot the ball that well -- that's really -- you asked what
the difference was between at our place or here, to me it was that; they
didn't make those kind of shots at our place. And they really -- when you're
shooting that well from three-point range, it opens up the inside. Now the
paint point becomes a lot easier.  
  
They really stretched out our defense with the range of like Bell coming in,
hitting those back-to-back threes.  
  
Q. In a game like this with the performance that Ohio State had
offensively, especially in the first quarter, the first half, how much of that
for you is an anomaly versus something to be concerned about moving forward?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think we have to watch the film and kind of figure that
out. I know that our -- our offensive problems tonight I think were an
anomaly. Our defense, I have to watch that. I just feel like we missed a lot
of shots that we usually make, a lot of bunnies inside, a lot of lay-ups, and
that is a momentum killer when you miss those kind of shots that you know are
supposed to be going in for you.  
  
So I think that was a combination of those things, so I know the offense was
an anomaly, but defensively I'm going to have to watch the film and figure
things out.  
  
Q. When did you know that your team was in trouble tonight?  
LISA BLUDER: I mean, it wasn't a very good start at all, so it was rough. That
was a rough first quarter.  
  
Q. Moving forward, do you try to focus on this game or kind of just wipe
it away from your team 's memory and move on?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think a little bit of both. I think you want to learn
from it. As far as coaches, we want to learn from it, but as far as kids, I
don't know that they're going to really get much out of this game as far as
rehashing it and watching it over and over again except for destroy their
confidence, and I don't want to do that going into postseason. I kind of want
to remind them of the good things that they've done so far and try not to,
like I say, show this film a whole lot for them, but us coaches certainly can
learn.  
  
Q. When it comes to seeding, what do you feel are the best attributes
your team has accomplished this year, and do you feel like tonight might have
cost you home court for the first two rounds?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I don't know. I hope they look at the body of work
because we have I think five top-25 RPI wins. It's one of the top in the
country.  
  
No, we didn't play as well as we could tonight, as well as we should have
tonight, but again, I hope we're not resting this on one game but instead on
the 29 games that led up to this. 29 games leading up to this had us hosting.
Is one game going to knock us out? I don't know, we'll have to wait and see.
Now it definitely puts us on pins and needles, though, waiting, right?  
  
Q. Obviously you want your team and you want your players to be focused
on this game, this performance coming in. As a coach, is that something you
think about coming into a game like this, is kind of what the longer-term
implications are of a performance, win or lose?  
LISA BLUDER: I think that you know that as a coach. I think you understand. I
don't think you want to add pressure and dwell on it with your team. They're
smart kids and they know stuff, but yeah, I don't think I want to hammer it
home with them, either. There's a of pressure on kids anyway, coming in here
playing -- Ohio State is a really good basketball team, a really good
basketball team.  
  
We didn't lose to a bad team tonight. Am I disappointed the way that we
played? Yes. Did we lose to an inferior opponent? I don't think so. I think
they played really, really well tonight, and I think they will continue to
play well in the postseason.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Naz Hillmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36626)

### [Maddie Nolan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38924)

### [Hailey Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38925)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 67, Northwestern - 59  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I thought it was a heck of a ball game. Northwestern is an
exceptional team. They've had a tremendous season, and they've received so
many honors, and I have the utmost respect for their coach and their program.  
  
But we had an opportunity to play them twice this season, and both times we
played them pretty well, and the last time we had to play them without Naz,
who had an injury, tried to come back in that game but wasn't 100 percent. So
we felt coming into the game that we would be able to give them a real good
game.  
  
We also knew the importance of this game, which I think was really important
to our team, to put ourselves in a position for the NCAA Tournament and for
the best seed possible in the NCAA Tournament. So when you have an opportunity
to beat a No. 9 RPI team, it's a really great win for your program.  
  
Just proud of our team, proud of the way that they responded, proud of the way
that they handled themselves down the stretch. Real great win for us.  
  
Q. Maddie, you 've had to grow in the second half of the year. How would
you describe kind of this journey; now you're stepping up and taking critical
shots compared to, let's say, January and how would you describe what you've
had to go through?  
MADDIE NOLAN: Obviously a new role for me just starting the season, but I
think I give a lot of credit to my coaches and teammates, instilling that
confidence in me to shoot the ball. I think a couple of games ago I wasn't as
confident and they'd be like, you're wide open, you need to shoot it. So just
putting that in me really helped.  
  
Q. Hailey and Naz, can you talk about how once the shots started falling
for Maddie how that kind of picked everyone else up?  
HAILEY BROWN: I mean, I think that it's been consistent all year. Whenever
we've proven to hit the outside shots, teams have had to come out in the
paint, can't be as clogged, and it opens things up for Naz.  
  
So yeah, it has really helped us and when we moved the ball we're getting
those outside shots.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: Yeah, I think it definitely helps us, like Hailey touched on a
second ago. It really opens up the floor for us. That's when Amy can get her
drives or AK can get her drives, and we can dump down into the post.  
  
We just get so excited for Maddie. We know how much hard work she's put in,
and her hitting those shots gives us a momentum boost. So we really enjoy
that.  
  
Q. Naz, another 20-point game, and you started five-for-five. What led
to that hot shooting start?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think my teammates really focusing on getting me the ball
early, trying to get me early touches to determine that we wanted to get the
ball into the paint, we wanted to try to draw fouls. That's how we wanted to
get our quick scores, but my coaches and teammates put me in great position to
get those close-to-the-basket shots and also rebounding on the offensive
glass.  
  
Q. A couple times there in the fourth quarter after you guys extended
the lead, Northwestern was able to punch back, get it back within one
possession. What was the key to kind of maintaining your composure, finding a
way to score a bucket and extend the lead back again?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think our first thing was making sure that we got a stop on
defense. We often say that our defense is what fuels our offense. We can't get
transition buckets if we don't get a stop first, because then they're able to
pick up our point guard 94 feet.  
  
So really just try to get stops, making sure that we made the right reads and
the right plays. Trying to put everybody in the right spot. Oftentimes you saw
Maddie was in the right spot. Hailey was in the right spot. I was in the right
spot. Focusing on defense first and then making sure we're putting people in
the best positions that we can so they can get their best shots.  
  
Q. Maddie, there was that play early in the fourth quarter where you got
the ball, shot clock winding down and you hit a tough shot. Can you talk about
how the confidence has helped you with shots like that?  
MADDIE NOLAN: I mean, just clock winding down, I got the ball passed to me. I
knew I had been kind of hot from three from the previous shots. So just kind
of getting a ball up on the rim at least because we know Naz, HB, AK are going
to be down there to O-board it if I do miss it. So just getting a shot on the
rim.  
  
Q. You mentioned you 've had the chance to play Northwestern before
today twice; can you talk about the decision to really focus on defense on
locking down Lindsey Pulliam tonight?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, we did a tremendous job the last time we played as
well. So the first time we played them I think she had 30 points against us.
She's obviously an exceptional player, can score in so many ways and has
really improved her game from last season to this season, but we have a great
defender in Akienreh Johnson, and we really challenged her when we played her
at home, and I think she was 1-for-10 against us the last time we played them
at home, and tonight we did a great job on her, as well.  
  
So our kids take pride in their defense just as much as they do on the
offensive end, and I think that was a focus of Akienreh, is I'm going to lock
down the other team's best player, and she really stepped up to that
challenge.  
  
Q. Maddie has obviously grown a lot as a scorer the past two games. Talk
about what you 've seen from her.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, Maddie is playing with an extreme amount of
confidence. You know her story probably as well as anybody, and if there are
any Indiana people in the room, they probably know her story, but she's a kid
who had a significant, significant injury in high school, and at the beginning
of this season, we weren't even sure she would ever make it back on the
basketball court, true story. And Hailey and Naz spoke to how hard she's
worked, and she had to play with a knee brace just to be able to go out and
run around. In the beginning of the year as a coach I wasn't even sure she was
going to be able to get any minutes, and now here we are, six weeks ago she
was playing 30 seconds a game, and now she's playing 38 minutes a game.  
  
But just perseverance, hard work, and playing with a ton of confidence. She
had an incredible high school career at Zionsville and she is off to a
tremendous start as a freshman for us.  
  
Q. Can you expand on Akienreh 's game? She totally filled the whole stat
sheet up.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, that's something that we talk about in the locker room
a lot because sometimes Akienreh's numbers don't show up in points. Sometimes
they do. She's had plenty of 20-point games. But sometimes they don't show up
in points, and she's not the one coming to the interview, and she's not the
one going on the TV screen. We just try to tell each person in our locker room
how valuable their role is, and really to try to embrace that role because her
stat line is incredible. It's not necessarily points, but her rebounds, her
assists, her steals, and her ability to guard the other team's best player has
been something special for us.  
  
So she's just had an incredible game, and she's been great for us all season
long.  
  
Q. Yesterday you had a slow start, but today was a different story. What
was the change in your approach for today 's game?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: You know, I just think we got going early, and I think that
helped our confidence really. We didn't have much time to work on their match-
up, and they play a different defense than anybody that you're going to face.
But thankfully we have played them twice, so we kind of went through our sets
today at shoot-around that we typically run against them, and we found Naz
early, and she got going and she rarely misses. She really got us going early,
and then to knock down some outside shots when Maddie started doing that, I
think that gave us a lot of confidence.  
  
But even though that's the case, we knew Northwestern was going to make a run.
I mean, they're such a great team. And yesterday we talked about we were on
the opposite side of that, and then we had to make a run. We knew that they
were going to -- it was going to be a game of runs, and we just had to put
ourselves in a great position, and thankfully we were able to do that down the
stretch.  
  
Q. You mentioned how you guys were able to take Pulliam out of the game
in that second match-up, and really their offense was really limited in that
match-up. Did you guys do anything differently schematically or in terms of
focus in this matchup than in that second one?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, we talked about this in the locker room afterwards, as
well, and I don't know if you guys picked up on this, but Amy Dilk went 94
feet against Veronica Burton, and I thought once she took the ball out of her
hands, that changed -- they couldn't get into their flow of what they wanted
to do because she typically brings it out.  
  
And Amy is a player that has to face that every day because she's our primary
point guard, so she faces that 94 feet of pressure all the time. So finally
she did it to somebody else, and I think it really got them out of rhythm
because I think somebody else had to initiate their offense, which is
something that they weren't accustomed to. I thought that really helped us
down the stretch.  
  
I also think if you have a defender like Naz Hillmon who's strong and physical
and can guard any post, but then she can guard your 4, your 3, your 2, your 1,
you're able to do a lot of different things. So when Abi Scheid was coming off
those flare screens and trying to present mismatch problems for our post
player, Naz Hillmon is a player that doesn't get caught up in all that stuff
because she can move so well as a post player. So I think she really provides
a great defensive match-up for us.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Amy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32621)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 81, Nebraska - 75  
  
Q. Talk about the way your bench responded to foul trouble by Kate Cain
immediately at the start of the game.  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I thought Izzy Bourne really came in and gave us a major
spark in the first half there when we had to play without Kate, and kind of
our team rallied behind that surge and kind of additional production from that
freshman off the bench. We had some really good contributions, I thought, off
the bench.  
  
Q. Talk about how important it was also in the first half after Kate got
in foul trouble, just a few minutes later and Naz Hillmon got in foul trouble
for Michigan and how your team took advantage.  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think it really just kind of counterbalanced having both
of those two good bigs in foul trouble at the same time. It just allowed that
to kind of really contradict each other and kind of counterbalance the foul
trouble for Kate Cain, which then forced, I guess, other people to really get
involved offensively. I thought both teams found ways to find other people to
step up.  
  
I thought Michigan, Amy Dilk really stepped up for them and carried some of
the scoring load, and on our side Leigha Brown and Izzy Bourne really stepped
up to help.  
  
Q. You go to the second half with a lead in the second half. Michigan
comes out on the attack. They 're at full strength, and they start cutting the
lead right away and you struggle to score. All the points that you had for
your team in the third quarter were by your posts and you didn't get guard
scoring. Was there anything Michigan did well to prevent your guards from
contributing?  
AMY WILLIAMS: I just thought they played more physical. They got a lot more
physical in the second half and really got up and really trapped and were
aggressive and guarded our ball-screen action very aggressively, and just the
more physical they got, the less production we got.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter after Michigan takes the lead, they come out
and really you didn 't get a stop really in the first five minutes of the
fourth quarter, but your offense got rolling again. How important was it for
Michigan to not turn the ball over in the first 15 minutes of that second
half?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, I thought that they did a good job of really kind
of taking care of the ball. We were trying to do some things to kind of
scramble around. We tried some zone defense. We tried some trapping. We tried
to mix things up a little bit just to try to force something kind of
defensively. I thought they did a great job of kind of handling things, being
in control, and unfortunately we were just trading baskets there in the fourth
quarter and dug ourselves a hole there in the third quarter, and then just
traded baskets with them there in the fourth.  
  
Q. Michigan got a double-digit lead midway through the fourth but your
team didn 't go away; got it back to a five-point game late in the fourth. Did
you still feel like you had the ability to finish off those final two minutes
once you got it to that point?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, I think that our team was confident that we could
make some comebacks because we've done that at some times this year. So I
think they were going to scratch and claw until the very end, but down the
stretch we knew it was going to be a foul game, and we were going to have to
hope for them to miss some free throws and to be able to come and get some
quick attacks, and down the stretch they made what they needed to.  
  
Q. Leigha Brown gave you a big lift in the fourth quarter when you were
cutting the lead, and she was also strong first half. How big was Leigha in
this game for you keeping you in the ballpark?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, Leigha was good, and she's been good really all year, just
she's competitive and she finds different ways. I thought they did a nice job
kind of early just being physical with her. Akienreh Johnson kind of got up in
her and was very physical and caused some problems maybe early, but once
Leigha settled in, she found ways to contribute for our team, and she's done
that quite a bit this year and had some success from behind the arc, and then
that becomes more difficult to guard her off the dribble. And so she did some
nice things out there today.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Lindsay Whalen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13926)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 77, Minnesota - 56  
  
Q. What did you see in the fourth quarter?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: I think there was a couple plays where -- there was one where
Taiye almost had that steal, a bounce here or there goes their way, and then
they got on a run in the fourth. But I felt like maybe one more stop and we
could have tied it up or at least gotten closer, but they made some tough
shots down that stretch, as well.  
  
Q. Did they switch up their defense?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: No, I feel like during that stretch, it took us a while in
that third to get some scores, and I feel like there were some turnovers down
the stretch that we ended up having that got some run-outs and some easy ones
for them.  
  
Q. What do you tell the guys now? Obviously you 're hoping you get a
call on Sunday from the NIT, right?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, we'll go back and wait and see what we hear for the rest
of our postseason.  
  
Q. It was such a strange game; in the middle quarters you shot pretty
much 50 percent, but in the first and the fourth you just couldn 't buy a
basket.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, yeah. It was -- yeah, I felt really good going into
half, and then we struggled in the third to score, but our defense was great,
and then the end of the third we started to feel really good on offense, and
we go in having tied that third, only down six again in the fourth, and it
just -- yeah, then unfortunately the fourth, the floodgates opened a little
bit.  
  
Q. You switched to a zone. Was that a big part of what slowed them down
a little bit?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, I think so. You know, at the start we came out and just
player-to-player defense and we struggled at that point to keep in front, and
we felt zone was the best option, and we ended up making a run. So yeah, it
ended up being a good adjustment for us.  
  
Q. Seemed like Sconiers had a lot more playing time tonight.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, yeah, because even when we went to zone, they were still
able to get offensive rebounds, so they were able to still get that. So yeah,
I think that it was a night that we needed two bigs in the game.  
  
Honestly, I thought Klarke was really, really good. Did a lot of great things
out there for us.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38869)

### [Danielle Migliore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38870)

### [Tekia Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38871)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Rutgers - 63, Wisconsin - 55  
  
Q. Start us off with an opening statement on today 's Big Ten
Tournament.  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: Well, first of all, Wisconsin was well prepared, and it
was a scary situation simply because when you play a team three times, and
they've had very close games to the top teams within the Big Ten, so we were
nervous. And what happened at the beginning is that we weren't nearly as
impressive as we needed to be, but we did know that we had to step it up,
which is extremely taxing, but the team willed themselves to win, and it
worked out for us.  
  
Q. How relieving was it to get that first win?  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: Well, we've got a long way to go. You've got to start with
something, right? So we're happy, we're excited about the first win, but we
know that we've got plenty more. The biggest issue that we're concerned about
is getting everybody back home, getting some rest, getting their legs in ice
because we don't have a lot of players, as you know. So that was key because
it was a tough game, a really tough game, and we appreciate everybody's
contribution.  
  
Q. It was a really great game; Indiana tomorrow, how is that turnaround
going to feel like for the team?  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: Well, we're going to do our best to make sure that
everybody is in the ice and we've gotten the therapists ready and getting our
legs up and getting rested because that's what's going to make all the
difference. Indiana is outstanding, as well, but to have played this team
three times is a bit much.  
  
Q. I want to ask about Migliore, she had a couple of big threes in the
first half. Mack 's defense, and Arella's all-around game play. This team
seems to be coming into its own the last few games.  
C. VIVIAN STRINGER: Yes, well, thank goodness. We were talking to Danielle
about was that she needed to be a better defensive player, and she got four
steals, so she did obviously step it up. She was playing tough on the 55, and
that's extremely aggressive, and there's no question about that.  
  
And then of course Arella is going to play the normal game that she plays. But
the contributions from T-Baby is huge, and it's the engine that really fires
us and keeps us going. Everybody, it looks like we are really hitting our
stroke at the right time, so we're going to continue to do that.  
  
Danielle Migliore  
  
Q. Two big threes early on, and you go into halftime tied after a
buzzer-beating shot from Wisconsin. What is it in this team that makes you
guys not quit?  
DANIELLE MIGLIORE: Fight. Even during practice every day, we just fight, we
compete, and I think that we want into the locker room thinking it's 0-0. Just
to step on their throats in the third quarter, and I think that's what we did.  
  
Q. Now looking forward to Indiana on pretty much no days ' rest, coming
right back tomorrow, how is this team going to be prepared, ready to go just
one day later?  
DANIELLE MIGLIORE: Yeah, I think the season prepared us for that, playing some
back-to-back games without a lot of days of preparation. I think we're fine.
We know what we've got to do, and we're going to stick to this plan.  
  
Tekia Mack  
  
Q. The team defensively, walk me through that big and-one late in the
second half to put you guys up big.  
TEKIA MACK: I played defense on kind of like a big guard, so I could tell that
she was in the lane because she was backing up as I was going forward, so I
kept pushing into her because I knew she couldn't block my shot. I elevate so
high when I get to those lifts, especially on my left-hand side, and at that
point I'm just thinking, it's all or nothing, just go get the and-one or just
risk taking the charge.  
  
But I had played outstanding defense on the other end to get the steal, so why
not go ahead and take it? I got the foul on the and-one. Unlucky that I missed
the free throw, but even getting the steal and the bucket, that was a huge
push for us.  
  
Q. How do you individually prepare for a game in just 24 hours?  
TEKIA MACK: I really don't prepare. I'm just going to be honest, I don't
prepare for games. I just know it's me against them, and I know I should have
been Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, but sometimes that works out
differently. I just show up every game, just like I did the last play. You
can't out-dribble me. It's me, you and the basketball, and if I want the
basketball, you're not going to stop me from getting it. That's my mindset all
the time.  
  
I just take it or leave it, and at the end of the day I get the steal or I
don't, but I just play defense, like Coach said, I'm the engine to our team.
If I'm not hyped, then, as you can see, when I got hyped in the second half,
we went on a run. Like it was over for Wisconsin at that point. That's what I
pretty much did the first year we played them at their school. And I knew that
I could get steals, and I picked my poison with certain players, so I just
study personnel, watch a lot of film on how people dribble and what go-to move
that they have and I just study from that. That's really how I prepare, just
study people's go-to moves, especially in the backcourt when they're trying to
get it over before they get a 10-second count.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Kayana Traylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38855)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Michigan State - 63  
  
Q. The good start seemed to energize this group today. How important was
that first 10 minutes in particular?  
SHARON VERSYP: First 10 minutes we really keyed in. We were just due to really
connect and play well, and we wanted to get the ball inside immediately, and
we did -- our first, probably eight points, (we) got inside, so that just
really elevated the confidence. So that's what we wanted to do. The three
things was transition defense, get the ball inside as much as we can, and then
get three stops, and I thought all those three things worked out very well for
a good three and a half quarters.  
  
Q. 11 assists on your first 14 buckets I think was the number there. A
lot of hands touching the ball. At that point you had to feel pretty good
about that early on.  
SHARON VERSYP: That was big. We finished the game 20 assists on 27 field
goals. And when we share the basketball inside-outside, not trying to do a lot
of one-on-one stuff -- we're not a one-on-one team, but I think building that
confidence, having Karissa really start out hot and having Ae'Rianna start out
hot, that kind of just built the confidence. But that's what we talk about is
building confidence in the defense.  
  
Q. How much did the switch to the zone midway through the first quarter
kind of throw them off, or did you want them to potentially beat you from the
three, make them shoot those shots?  
SHARON VERSYP: We did that combination, because obviously Clouden is just so
good off the dribble, and she can just dissect you, and McCutcheon was, so we
went to that zone and they missed a lot of shots during that time. Then you
get more momentum, so you can get down in transition buckets. So I think doing
that was a big key for us to kind of get that lead and then sustain that lead.  
  
Q. You 're kind of considered a bubble team as far as the NCAA
Tournament goes. What was your message to your girls during the week? There's
potentially something bigger to be played for here.  
SHARON VERSYP: We talked. I mean, everything that we've done, our strength of
schedule and the teams that we've beat, the things that I've seen, we've been
a 10 seed or 11 seed. We see that. We don't talk about that. We knew today was
going to be an important game, and we did what we needed to do, and obviously
we'll get Maryland. Maryland is one of the top teams in the country, but it's
going to continue to build our strength of schedule, so that's what the NCAA
wants, that's what we give them.  
  
Q. How have your seniors handled this week in particular?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, they've been really good leaders. They've been talking to
the sophomores and freshmen about just the energy and what needs to be done
here and how we do things, and it's totally different. The level is different,
the feel is different. You know, and I think that's been good, and our staff
did the same thing. But Ae'Rianna and Nique have done a good job through the
whole year.  
  
Kayana Traylor  
  
Q. How important was the good start for this team today? It felt like it
really energized everybody this afternoon.  
KAYANA TRAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, we always emphasize energy in just the first
four minutes. So I thought we got off to a really good start, and then that
carried us for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Being able to kind of withstand their late run, this team kept its
focus for all 40 minutes today.  
KAYANA TRAYLOR: Well, we knew they weren't going to lay down and give it to
us, obviously. They played for their seniors, just like we did, so we knew we
had to play the whole 40 minutes. So we did a good job of sustaining their run
and being able to go on a run, also.  
  
Q. This team is still maybe trying to play for an NCAA Tournament berth.
Was there a little more energy to the whole week getting ready for potentially
a long weekend here?  
KAYANA TRAYLOR: Of course, yeah. This is the Big Ten Tournament, so this is
what we prepare for and look forward to, so it's always fun.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Rutgers - 63, Wisconsin - 55  
  
Q. Give me your initial thoughts on the game today. I know you played
well up until the fourth quarter.  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, I think the basket they scored at the end of the third
helped, as well. Obviously we got the five-point lead, and were trying to rest
some people, and they turned the pressure up to start the fourth quarter. And
we didn't handle it the way I think we're capable of. How we handled it even
at their place when we lost last week, we did a good job handling the
pressure. So it was a little bit of the shades of that game to start the Big
Ten Tournament.  
  
You just want to go down if you miss shots, and obviously we out-rebound them
and just playing your best basketball.  
  
Q. Last couple of years you really kind of built a culture here at the
Big Ten Tournament of being a scrappy underdog. Talk about how your team has
performed the last couple years in the Big Ten Tournament.  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Well, I think the last two years the seniors have done a
tremendous job. Obviously last year Kelly Karlis and Marsha Howard had great
games, obviously, all the way through all three that we were able to play, and
obviously Abby (Laszewski) had a great game yesterday, and just the -- and
some people, what Kendra Van Leeuwen does doesn't show on the stat sheet
sometimes, but her getting us into things, running our defense, getting 50/50
loose balls, good things happen, and she's done that for four years.  
  
And then obviously I think that they have that confidence after what happened
last year. They have that confidence that it is a new season. As much as
that's "coach-speak," I think they believe in it, and to play better
basketball both yesterday and today than maybe we had down the stretch is
really important for us moving forward to next year.  
  
Q. You talk about next year, and really you 've got a young team coming
back, a lot of kids coming back next year, and they performed well in what is
probably the strongest conference we've had in a long, long time. Talk a
little bit about the future of your program.  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, I think it's real easy to get caught up in wins and
losses, and it's what competitive level are we on, and I feel like obviously
Imani Lewis has been an all-conference level player for the first two years,
and you have somebody like Sydney Hilliard, who has started most of her
freshman year, and Julie Pospisilova that started and is contributing. And
some great things ahead, also: Obviously, Niya Beverley's senior year and Sara
Stapleton providing us great minutes in the post, especially at the end of the
year.  
  
I thought Imani did a great job of enhancing her role with Marsha leaving, and
again, similar to the field in the Big Ten Tournament, you hope you take that
momentum and you take that challenge, and now you start putting in the work
individually as a player, that shows once you start doing team activities and
things in the fall.  
  
So I'm excited. It's a great group coming back. Obviously we had some kids
that we're really excited about on the recruiting front, and again, it's
important for us that we sit there and see the level of competitiveness
outside of the Maryland game, even a game if we got behind we scrapped, we
fought, we got back into games. Even if we didn't win that, we got back in and
had big leads, at Indiana, at Iowa, against Rutgers the first time. Just,
again, I think we're going to spend the spring and the summer figuring out how
we can do things that emphasize finishing.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Michigan State - 63  
  
Q. Coach, is there a particular reason that Kayla Belles didn 't start
tonight?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, the day before we left, she rolled her ankle up, and
that's why she hardly played. We were lucky she was even able to move. Typical
end to our season, I guess, if you're looking at what's happened to us. All
the good players get hurt. She was one of them. We were just doing a quarter-
court basic work on a 2-3 zone, because those guys play 2-3 zone. She came
down on someone's foot and she could hardly walk. They gave her a shot and
tried to tape it up, but she could not go.  
  
Q. Do you have any updates on the status of Moira Joiner? Looked like
she was really trying to play through something in the second half.  
SUZY MERCHANT: I don't have any updates on her.  
  
Q. Can you just walk us through the fourth quarter push.  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I thought it was great. Obviously Shay is a big part of
that. We haven't hardly seen her all year, so it was nice to finally see what
a veteran guard can do and how they can kind of put a team on their back, and
I thought she's a big reason why that happened.  
  
Q. You guys struggled shooting the ball, especially in the first half,
right around 20 percent or so. What do you think was the cause for that?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I don't know. Honestly, we just put up 99 points and shot the
heck out of the ball the game before. I just think it's youth. Some of these
kids, they just aren't consistent in the way they score the ball from a field-
goal-percentage standpoint. I think that's been hard. That hasn't been their
fault, just meaning that Shay, Drekia, CoCo, those kids were starters with
Clouden and Taryn, and those three kids knew what to do. You saw what Shay did
in basically one quarter. So it's like they needed -- those freshmen needed
time, and they didn't have time. So their confidence is like all over the
place. I mean, some of them aren't physically ready to play. They're not --
they got thrown into a fire. I'm not sure they were ready for because they
didn't have great scoring leadership around them. You know, so it made it
difficult for them, and I think that's why you saw the fluctuation of highs
and lows from a scoring standpoint for us. I told them even fouling or whatnot
at the end, we still were able to be in a position to get where we needed to
get. We just need consistent scorers.  
  
And not having Kayla killed us. I mean, absolutely killed us. I felt like we
were really going to struggle in this game without her. She's been playing,
giving us 13 points, eight rebounds, then Taiyier can come in and sprinkle in
six, eight, ten. We've been getting about 23 points a game from those two. Now
we really don't have Kayla. All we have is Taiyier, and she got in foul
trouble, and then our next choice is Cydni Dodd, who is not ready and
struggles and basically I think had some kind of exercise-induced asthma
problem because she played an extra minute or whatever it was.  
  
So I think you're just looking at kids that weren't ready yet and that we
didn't expect to be out there, and that's a problem because we lost CoCo in
that position.  
  
So it's just like, all those kids that were up here that are all-conference
players, starters, kids -- you can't substitute that. You just can't. And you
can look at any team in the country, and if you take out like their big dogs,
you can maybe handle one but you can't handle four. Four will kill you. And in
the women's game, in our game, it really -- not having Kayla here tonight, I
felt like we were going to be really out of sync, especially defensively.  
  
Q. And Ae 'Rianna Harris and Oden both left about midway through the
third quarter with three fouls. You guys really didn't start the run until the
fourth quarter. What kind of happened there at the end of the third?  
SUZY MERCHANT: We just couldn't buy any baskets. I mean, you look at it, I
thought we did a pretty good job of getting looks. Taryn had some good looks,
Clouden got to the rim, we were missing lay-ups. We got to the free-throw line
a couple times, came up empty. It was kind of simple a little bit that way
where we just didn't do a very good job of putting the ball in the basket when
those kids were out.  
  
Q. Hopes of the NCAA Tournament are most likely gone. How are you going
to go about preparing for a possible WNIT berth?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I don't even know where we're at. We're so injured right now, I
don't even know if we could go, meaning field a team at this point. That's a
discussion I'll have with our higher-ups, but right now it's more about just
like celebrating these kids right now and figuring out -- we're just very beat
up, and there's things that you guys don't even know that are on paper that I
have that you'll never know, and there's other issues, too. So it's like we've
got to kind of weigh that out a little bit.  
  
We're just really banged up, beat up, tore up. I don't know where we stand
with that quite yet. That's a decision that we'll have to make in the future.
But certainly not today.  
  
Q. Despite all the injuries and the lack of shooting in the first three
quarters, down 15 starting the fourth, you guys made a great comeback, led by
the seniors Taryn and Shay. How important is that to have a team that 's
resilient even though they came up short?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I think you can see teams that quit. That's pretty
obvious, and this team didn't quit, and they hadn't quit all year. We've gone
into games where we have people in the hotel room throwing up and another one
with a concussion and couldn't make a trip, and then the next day someone
tears an Achilles. It's just been insane.  
  
So their resiliency to me has been pretty positive. I know they're
disappointed in what could have been. I think this team 100 percent healthy is
probably a top-17 team, -18 team, fluctuates depending. But it wasn't that. We
didn't have those kids all year long, and when you don't have that, you don't
have the leadership, and that's the thing that I think you want to put more
value on. Mo goes out there and plays hard, but Mo has never been here, right,
so same thing with Julia. It's like they don't know what they don't know. Next
year they'll know a little bit better, but you can't force experience.  
  
And I think if there was one thing I would say about the group that was left,
Taryn and Clouden in particular were the two kids that played the most minutes
over the course of their careers that were the veterans, per se, I think those
kids did as good of a job as they can trying to bring along a very young
class.  
  
But a lot fell on them, and it wasn't always easy for them to live up to that.
They needed some help sometimes, and when they got it, we were really pretty
solid team. But when we didn't get it, then we had some issues, as you can
see, scoring droughts, tough match-ups, missed assignments, things like that.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Ohio State - 77, Minnesota - 56  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter I guess it was kind of coming back to you on
that long run. What were you seeing in that fourth quarter?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, we just finally started making some shots. I thought we
got good shots throughout, but we were really kind of inconsistent with our
shooting, and once the shots started going in, it kind of fueled our defense a
little bit, too.  
  
Q. Just on that line, Dorka kind of had a little bit of a struggle on
the offensive end. She had 16 rebounds. What did you make of her
performance?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, she played really hard. I thought she was good
defensively. She had some huge rebounds, and she missed some shots she
normally makes, but that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. Do you see fatigue being an issue in this round?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Well, we'll see. They're young kids. Hopefully we can bounce
back. I told them at halftime, don't worry about tomorrow, don't worry about
anything other than give everything you have right now, we'll regroup tonight
after the win and move on to the next one.  
  
Q. Balance has been so key for you guys all year long. It showed up
tonight in a game where you guys just kind of got contributions up and down.
How key is that?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, that's huge. We're at our best when we have balance in our
scoring. I thought Janai in particular was great off the bench. I thought that
was a really great performance by her, so we need more of that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You said you enjoy the team win, but what do you make of Iowa?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Great team. They can really score the ball. They're going to
probably play a lot of zone, so it'll kind of be similar in that we're going
to have to be really good defensively, and we're going to have to make a few
more shots than what we made today.  
  
Q. They were running two bigs against you guys to try to counter your
big people. What was part of the game plan to stop them?  
KEVIN McGUFF: Yeah, they can play a couple lineups. They can go a little
smaller and spread you out or they can go a little bit bigger. We kind of
tried to stick with what we wanted to do and just guard them accordingly.  
  
Janai Crooms  
  
JANAI CROOMS: It felt great. My teammates found me, got me the ball in
transition and had confidence in me, and I just think my teammates gave me the
ball, got me open, and just had confidence in me throughout the game.  
  
Q. You started out with a 17-point lead and then you had the big run at
the end, kind of the iffy part in the middle. What did you see out there that
were some of the positives?  
JANAI CROOMS: Honestly, our defense. I thought we were in the gaps. I thought
we kept our man in front of us, and I thought that really transitioned into
getting the ball in transition on the offensive end.  
  
Q. And for you, you 've been coming off the bench for a while now. How
do you feel like you've transitioned into that role?  
JANAI CROOMS: Honestly, just coming in the game and being there for my
teammates and doing what I have to do on the offensive and defensive end.  
  
Coming off the bench is kind of different, but whatever it takes to get the W
and playing together with my teammates.  
  
Q. With Rikki not being able to play this year, how have you seen her
deal with that situation and still be a part of the team and all that?  
JANAI CROOMS: I mean, she's a really energetic kid on the bench, even in
practice. We're always hyping each other up, and I like that a lot with Rikki.
I feel like she does that all throughout the games and in practice.  
  
It is tough for her to not play with us this year, but next year I'm really
happy to see her play and get on the court with us.  
  
Kierstan Bell  
  
Q. Kind of came back within a four-point thing and then you made a long
run at the end. What did you make of tonight 's performance?  
KIERSTAN BELL: I think we did pretty good as a team staying together. Just,
you know, doing what we do best, executing. We got like a lot of weird shots
but they was falling, so that was pretty good, and we just stayed in it.  
  
Q. It seemed like it was kind of one of those odd games where some weird
shots were falling, like you said. Does that change how you play the game at
all?  
KIERSTAN BELL: Not really changes the game. It's just kind of funny moments.
But we've got to get back to our regular shots and just make sure they fall
in.  
  
Q. How have you felt in these past two games?  
KIERSTAN BELL: Just feeling good being back part of the team. We've got Iowa
tomorrow, and we're focusing on that.  
  
Q. You 've played a little bit more power forward than you usually do.
Does that change how you attack the opponent, if it's a big guarding you as
opposed to a smaller player?  
KIERSTAN BELL: Yeah, I think that's a big difference. A lot of times when I'm
in the 4, the person is either smaller than me, or when I'm a guard the person
is smaller than me -- I meant to say the person that's the 4 is either taller
than me, so I can just shoot the ball or if they're a guard I can take it to
the rim.  
  
Braxtin Miller  
  
Q. (Inaudible) on a night like tonight when things maybe aren 't going
the way you want them to for the whole game?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think so for sure. That's one thing I've always really loved
about this team and I think people can all kind of realize, any person on this
team is able to have a great night at any time. So when you look up at the
board and we're -- with 10, 11, 8, 15, 15, 9, that just kind of shows all the
versatility that we have and how good everybody kind of is and what everybody
can bring to the team.  
  
Anybody can step up at any moment, and I think that makes us a threat.  
  
Q. Obviously during games, you guys just find a win and you don 't care
who scores, but when you have so many players who can do so many things, is
there kind of an edge a little bit to try to match what your teammates are
doing on the floor?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I don't think so. I think that we all kind of respect, like
maybe some nights it's not their night maybe, so we're going to get it to the
person that it is their night and so on. I think we all know that.  
  
From the very beginning since the team came together, we were all like, we are
so individually talented, it's honestly insane how individually talented we
are. So I think that we just kind of like feed off of each other and want to
be better for each other, and we respect each other so much in our games, and
so when we see somebody is having a really great game, we just want to keep
getting them the ball. And we know that anybody can step up if things aren't
going well.  
  
Q. Honestly by the end your offense was kind of clicking on all
cylinders, but in the middle when you guys were struggling offensively, it
seemed like you were still able to create pressure, create turnovers. How
important is that ability to be able to turn the ball over and create
additional offensive opportunities?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I think that's crucial for us. I think we're really great in
transition, so for us to have good defensive possessions and be able to get in
the passing lanes and apply a lot of pressure, so that they might not be
getting the best shots that they want and put us into fast transition really
works well for us.  
  
So when our offense isn't really working out, it's crucial for us to get in
passing lanes and things like that to get some transition buckets, which is
probably our best asset.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 81, Nebraska - 75  
  
Q. It seemed like there was a big defensive turnaround. What do you
think sparked that?  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: Coach really emphasized in the locker room that yeah, we're
down eight, but we haven't played our best basketball, and it's not even
scoring on the offensive end, it's that we weren't getting stops. We weren't
playing defense. We weren't getting rebounds. We weren't doing the things that
make us a successful team. So she challenged every single one of us
individually, called each one of us out individually and told us what we had
to improve on. So me specifically she said I had no rebounds and my player had
11 points.  
  
So I really made sure I stepped in in the second half and tried to make sure I
got rebounds and tried to limit the other team's -- the opponent that I was
guarding.  
  
Q. And then whenever you guys needed a basket, Amy seemed to get it
today. How important was that for you guys?  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: It was very important. I think a lot of us had a little bit
of a slow start, so our shots weren't really falling, kind of lost our
momentum, lost some confidence. And then we seen Amy get in there, she was
making passes, she was rebounding, she was defending. She was making plays for
us, so it was very important. She had zero turnovers, so we're very, very
proud of her.  
  
Q. She had six assists today. How did that help you guys?  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: Helped us a lot. She was able to drive so much and score
that people started to collapse on her, so she started making extra passes and
making the right reads, so it's been very important for our point guard to be
able to play at a level that Amy has been playing at the past few games.  
  
Danielle Rauch  
  
DANIELLE RAUCH: So it was four weeks post-surgery today, and I was working
really hard in occupational therapy. And every appointment I went to I would
ask the doctor, so what do you think about the Big Ten Tournament? Like do you
think I can make it back? Because originally I got like a 10-week diagnosis of
when I could come back, but my motion was really good and it was feeling
great, so I kind of tried to get myself in practice a little bit this week and
get it feeling good again, and yeah.  
  
Q. And then Amy obviously, how important was it for her to get going
today?  
DANIELLE RAUCH: Yeah, it was definitely really important. She sets the tone
for our team. When she goes, we go. So it was really great to see her play
amazing. Had zero turnovers, just lead the team in every aspect and really get
it done on the defensive end, as well.  
  
Q. What do you think sparked that second-half turnaround for you guys?  
DANIELLE RAUCH: Coach came in the locker room at halftime and really just
challenged us, and we took that challenge seriously, and just knew that people
have done this to us multiple times throughout the season, and we wanted to
turn the tide and have a really great third quarter, and we came out strong
and we were able to do so.  
  
Amy Dilk  
  
Q. Talk about coming out, how much you like playing not just here at
this time of year but in your home state?  
AMY DILK: For sure. We have two others Indianans, like we like to call them.
Just coming back to our home state, home city, having people in the building
that have been supporting us since we were little girls up to our careers now
makes this experience so much more special, just hearing their cheers in the
crowd, knows that it's our people and they're putting the maize and blue on
for us is just amazing.  
  
Q. You had a big night tonight. What do you attribute that to?  
AMY DILK: I want to give a lot to credit to my teammates and my coaches who
just put so much trust in me to take those shots and to take the decision
making that I have to have. But we made a huge second-half adjustment, and
props to us for making that adjustment and actually going through with our
plan and sticking with coach's game plan. That was just amazing to see just
the run that we had in the third quarter and the fourth.  
  
Q. You obviously were in this spot a year ago. Can you talk about
Maddie, how she showed the nerves early on and settled in and did what she 's
been doing for the last month or so?  
AMY DILK: For sure. Just what you just said. She's been taking such a big role
this past month and a half. We say every day how proud we are for her, not
only being a freshman but just stepping up in a role that she didn't think
that she'd be in this season, and she owns that, and she's doing great, and
she's a competitor. High-level IQ is definitely what leads her in charge, but
her athleticism and her ability to just make decisions is just amazing.  
  
Naz Hillmon  
  
Q. How were you able to get back in that game when you have to sit right
off the bat?  
NAZ HILLMON: It's definitely frustrating, having to be a coach on the bench
instead of on the floor. I wanted to get in, but also making sure that I was
focused and locked in, seeing what was working and wasn't working, applying
that when I got to the game, while also trying to stay warm and being ready as
soon as my number was called.  
  
Q. What worked for you when you got back in because clearly momentum
started to shift back towards you guys?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think we really locked in on defense, really tried to force
them to get out of their comfort zone and making that transition from defense
to offense, so we could get our stuff going. So really trying to emphasize
defense and then everything else would follow that.  
  
Q. When you guys get a put-back or an and-one and stuff like that, what
do you feel like that does to your opponent kind of mentally?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think that it deflates them. We've all gotten an and-one scored
on us, so we know how much we hate it. The other team just gets really rowdy
and the crowd guys wild, so getting an and-one is definitely a momentum
booster and we all just tried to feed into it and feed off of that energy.  
  
Q. This is probably the healthiest the team has been in a while. You get
Danielle back. Talk about how you feel physically during this point in the
season.  
NAZ HILLMON: Yeah, it's great to have those -- everybody healthy right now
just because people can get a couple of blows when needed, that we weren't
able to get just a little while ago.  
  
So really happy that everybody is healthy. We love the team chemistry that we
have right now. We're just ready to keep rolling.  
  
Kim Barnes Arico  
  
Q. Coach, you made an unbelievable comeback. Big differential in the
offensive rebounds. How key was rebounding today?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Rebounding was our number one goal. We knew we would have an
advantage on the boards, and that was really key for us. For us to go in
halftime only down eight as well as Nebraska was shooting the ball and Naz
being in foul trouble, we felt like we would be in good shape, and we just had
to continue to fight and claw and do it on the defensive end, and I thought
our defense was a lot better in the second half, and we were able to find Naz
and Amy did her thing, and it was just a great win for us.  
  
Q. The whole complexion of the game seemed to change when Naz came back
into the game. Did you have to say anything to her in particular on the bench,
or does she just go on her own motor?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I mean, Naz is special, and I hope everybody in the country
is having an opportunity to see that. She's a difference maker on so many
ends, on the defensive end, on the offensive end, but especially on the
rebounding end, and she was upset she was on the bench when she got out there,
there was a fire in her and a refuse-to-lose attitude, and I think everybody
had a chance to see that tonight.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Lindsay Whalen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13926)

### [Jasmine Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38840)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 85, Penn State - 65.  
  
Q. What didn 't you do in the second quarter that you did in the
third?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: We sat down in stance and defended. They only had 23 points in
the third. In the second half we said, we have to get to McDaniel. We had to
get to McDaniel. They only scored 13 in the third, and Frazier. So I felt like
we did that better. I think we helped in more on those guys.  
  
So overall it was just a much better just attention to those two, because at
the end of the second quarter, they were just getting anything they wanted
because they were putting their heads down and going. Us clogging the paint,
making them kick was what we needed to do.  
  
Q. A lot of offense off your defense, too.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, that's the name of the game. That's when every team is
really good, if you can get stops and then run and you're playing in more
broken-floor situations. Against a team like that, when you have two dynamic
players as they do, it's all about getting to stop them, making them kick to
somebody else and then closeout and respect that they're good players and
they're here for a reason, but make somebody else but those two beat us. I
thought that we did that in the third quarter.  
  
Q. Were you a little frustrated after the second quarter?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, we all were, but you can't play frustrated and you can't
show it. You have to dig in, and that's something our team has worked on time
and time again, over and over and over again this season, and when we fight
through it, when we get through it, really good things happen for us, so it
was exciting for us to see as coaches us just be able to power through and
stick together in that third.  
  
Q. How important was it to get off to a good start after the last game?
You said you definitely didn 't want to end the season that way.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, so up 13-3, that was big, coming out and making a
statement right away. We always say we need to punch first, and I thought we
did that. All in all, it was good for us to come out and have that start that
we had. Obviously you don't want to have the second quarter and even the lull
at the end of the first, but to start the way we did was definitely good.  
  
Q. I 've heard of players playing out of their mind but not out of their
shoe.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, it was tremendous. She gets her 1,000th rebound as a
Gopher, so nothing but good things to say about her and her performance
tonight.  
  
She struggled in the second quarter, but man, her start and the way she played
in the third quarter was really everything we needed, and I thought she was so
good at both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Seems like when you guys are going well offensively that Powell is
just a part of it in some way, whether it 's a steal or whether it's passing.
She seems like a spark plug.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: She was. She was. She was somebody who was there all night. A
couple turnovers early, but you know, I thought that whether it was an assist
or hitting the roll-around in the drive-and-pick, hit a big three, hits a big
step-back jumper at the end of the third, which was a big momentum play to get
us back up 12 going into the fourth. That was big for us.  
  
It was fun to see her, and it's been fun to see her maturity continue to grow
and grow this year.  
  
Q. Career high for Brunson?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Brunson, career high, yep. She had four threes. Then we went
to just some mid-pick at the end, and she hits two jumpers. Just nothing short
of amazing for her tonight. Got to go back, get these guys off their legs and
get some rest because we've got another one tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were pretty unhappy with the way that last Ohio State game went.
Are you glad to have another crack at them?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Absolutely. You know, there's been a handful of games this
season that I feel like got away from us, and that was one of them. They're a
great team, he's a great coach, so we're definitely coming out here with a
mindset that it's a new game, a new day, and we're excited to still be here
and moving on.  
  
Jasmine Powell  
  
Q. You came in and really changed the tempo every time you were in. Is
that part of your game plan as a player, or is that different just for every
game?  
JASMINE POWELL: That's what I try to do like every game. I think maybe that's
part of my game. That's what I try to implement is changing the pace when I
get out there and try to do my best to change the way the game is going,
whether good or bad. But yeah, you could say that's in my game.  
  
Q. This is your first Big Ten Tournament; how does that feel?  
JASMINE POWELL: It feels great. As you could see in the beginning, I was a
little nervous, but I just tried to get rid of the butterflies and put us out.  
  
Q. There was a big difference between the first half and the second
half. What changes did you make at halftime that really fixed that?  
JASMINE POWELL: I think my mindset, going in, just a little bit nervous and
kind of turned the ball over a little bit, not playing my game. And then the
second half, kind of just slowing down and getting more comfortable out there.
I think that was the biggest change.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Abby Laszewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38832)

### [Imani Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36567)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 71, Illinois - 55  
  
Q. How does it feel to come out of day one victorious?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, you're still playing. I think at this time of year in
the postseason, we had a good sense of urgency. I hope the seniors are able to
lead the charge on that, and I thought Abby Laszewski did that.  
  
Having we have a tough task in having played Coach Stringer's team twice, once
at the beginning at our place, and then obviously a week ago exactly it'll be
at the RAC. Excited that I think our kids understand after the run we made
last year how not to get ahead of ourselves, so we haven't talked one minute
of Rutgers going into the game with Illinois. Obviously it's a quick
turnaround, but they've been used to that process, and that's part of the
reason we play tournaments over Thanksgiving where it's back to back, to get
them into that recovery mode. It's a huge challenge, but we're still playing,
and that gives us the opportunity.  
  
Q. Abby Laszewski 24 points and 10 rebounds, really did lead the charge.
What kind of separates her from the rest of the group?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Well, I think we're built around our post play. Obviously
Imani Lewis was a second-team all-league player, and Abby was an honorable
mention. I thought in the first half after about the first five minutes --
again, Abby took shots she's very capable of making. She's got a good touch
from the free-throw line, short corner. She got to the free-throw line. Same
thing with Imani, so I think they're able to play off each other.  
  
I think even the more important thing for the post players is our guards
obviously were able to get them the ball in position to be successful. But I
thought the jumpers that Niya Beverly and Julie Pospisilova knocked down in
the first half started opening some things up to make it easier to get it
inside.  
  
Obviously it's a tall task defensively, Rutgers is, but again, you hope the
seniors are able to play with that sense of urgency knowing that they're only
guaranteed one more game, but if there's still one more game to play, anything
can happen.  
  
Q. Looking forward towards Rutgers, tomorrow the second time you guys
are playing them in just a week, obviously not able to come away victorious
last week against them, but what did you see in the last game that 's could
change tomorrow's game?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Well, we've got to keep them off the free-throw line.
Obviously Arella Guirantes really hurt us, going 14-for-14 from the line. I
thought we did a really good job; it's a three-point game at halftime. It's a
four-point game with four minutes left in the fourth quarter. Ironically
enough she hits two free throws coming out of the media break.  
  
She's a tremendous scorer. She scores in a lot of different ways. We held her
to one field goal in the first half. We've got to be able to make her as
uncomfortable and take as many contested shots without fouling because again,
when you start putting somebody early on the line, it becomes contagious, not
only for her but for other people on the team.  
  
You have to handle the pressure. I thought we did a good job against them the
last time versus when we played them at home. But again, we've got to be able
to break that and score and take advantage of, if they are going to commit two
people to the ball, how can we get it to a spot where we can be in advantaged
situations.  
  
ABBY LASZEWSKI  
  
Q. Just to start off, how does it feel to get that first win under the
belt here in the Big Ten Tournament?  
ABBY LASZEWSKI: It feels good. That was the goal that we had coming in,
obviously. So just to play hard and get that win is really big for us.  
  
Q. Obviously a big day for you today. What was kind of working out there
and what were you seeing on the floor that allowed you to have that success?  
ABBY LASZEWSKI: I mean, like Coach said in our talk just then, he just thanked
the guards that had 20-plus assists, so they were just really looking for us
and looking for the posts, which helped us be successful.  
  
Q. You guys talked about how you guys like to go through the posts. Is
that something you feel comfortable with, working down there and getting the
shots up?  
ABBY LASZEWSKI: Yeah, that's something we've been doing all season is just
kind of like you said, work through the posts and get inside-outside looks, so
we just stuck with it today, and it worked.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Rutgers, what 's something you think you need to do
well to get the victory?  
ABBY LASZEWSKI: I mean, always against Rutgers you've got to be able to handle
their pressure, and I think if we can handle it for four quarters, we have a
really great chance to win.  
  
IMANI LEWIS  
  
Q. First of all, how does it feel to get that first win here today on
opening day?  
IMANI LEWIS: Feels amazing. It's a blessing that we were able to come this far
and also that we're playing together as a team, and we all want to win, and we
all have the same mindset.  
  
Q. You had an 11-0 run at the end of the first quarter and into the
second quarter. Do you feel like that was kind of a catalyst for your success
today?  
IMANI LEWIS: Oh, yeah, it was a catalyst, and even into our halftime, we were
constantly motivating each other, "Let's go, let's go, like keep it pushing,
keep it moving."  
  
Q. What was something that you guys really focused in on coming into
today? And do you feel like you executed that?  
IMANI LEWIS: Defensive rebounding, yeah. I think we've been struggling
defensively a lot, just mental lapses, and I think today we played really good
defense.  
  
Q. How important is Abby to the success of this team? Obviously 24-10
today, just really a big part of it being out there today.  
IMANI LEWIS: Yeah, she's very important, just her big body, her presence, and
she just uses that very well. On defense she's stretching, using her body,
blocking shots.  
  
Q. As one of the leaders on this team, how do you guys get your group
ready to go again tomorrow? It 's a quick turnaround.  
IMANI LEWIS: Like I tell everybody, you have to have the winning mindset. We
can't hang our heads, like oh, we played Rutgers twice and lost. We've got to
go in with the mindset that we're going to win, and then lay out the
foundation, like how we're going to win, what can we all contribute to the
win.  
  
Q. And then this is your third time playing Rutgers now. What 's one
thing you know that you have to do to have success tomorrow?  
IMANI LEWIS: We've got to stay on 24. That's their go-to player, so we've just
got to lock her up and use that as motivation to keep going.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Kamaria McDaniel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34684)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Minnesota - 85, Penn State - 65  
  
Q. First, thoughts on your team 's performance today?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I loved our fight there in the second quarter. I thought
we shared the basketball well, our time per touch. Second half I thought we
got really selfish on offense. Our discipline and our lack of habits and our
bad habits show up during a 40-minute game, and we just got to spend this
entire off-season to get better. We've got to be way better.  
  
Q. Kamaria McDaniel today, what did you think of her performance?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, she drew 11 fouls, and the way she attacks the rim with
the ball in her hands is elite. What we're working on is trying to make her a
complete player, I'm excited for an off-season to work with her and fine tune
her game and help her understand what it means to be an elite-level guard.  
  
Q. How much improvement did you see from Anna Camden today?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I thought she shot the ball really well. She spaces the
floor for us. The whole freshman class, we've got to learn how to play some
defense. It's a huge liability for us, and we're spending a lot of time in the
off-season working on that.  
  
Q. Where did you see improvement over the course of this whole season?
Tough season, but you had to see some improvement.  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I think where I saw improvement was our offensive
spacing. I thought improvement was culture and holding each other accountable,
seeing and telling the truth, and work habits, and that's the foundation and
that's where we start.  
  
Q. Where do you go from here?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, we keep recruiting. We keep making our players better.
I'm really big on player development, so I'm really excited for an off-season
to push this team to another level and to push the individual players to
something bigger than they've ever seen and work harder than they ever have.  
  
Kamaria McDaniel  
  
Q. Just your general thoughts on today 's performance from both you and
the team?  
KAMARIA McDANIEL: I thought we started off strong. I was disappointed for us
to kind of let up and let them take the lead like that, and it's something
that's hard to claw back from. I thought our first-half performance we
persevered, but it wasn't enough, and we've got to stay consistent in the
second half.  
  
Q. What do you think allowed you guys to get ahead there in the second
quarter, take that lead into halftime?  
KAMARIA McDANIEL: We had a lot of energy, and our confidence was high, and I
think that's half the battle. If you're not confident, you can't do much. I
think we were very intense in that second quarter, and that's what leads us.
It's not skill, it's the intangibles, and I think we brought that in the
second quarter.  
  
Q. You were able to draw 11 fouls today. What did you see out there from
the defense and what allowed you to get to the bucket with ease?  
KAMARIA McDANIEL: Coach encourages us to be aggressive in transition, and
that's what I try to do for our team.  
  
Q. You 're going to be heading into your senior year next year. How can
you use the momentum of this season and your performance this year to kind of
lead the team in this new direction?  
KAMARIA McDANIEL: I just need to focus on learning the game so I can help my
team win, and that's the only thing I'm focused on. None of my personal
accolades matter. I'm trying to win.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Nancy Fahey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34685)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 71, Illinois - 55  
  
Q. Coach, you had kind of a moment there at the end of the game. Can you
talk about how special that was to bring each of those kids off individually
and have them be recognized in their last game in an Illini uniform?  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, it's emotional. Most of those kids, I came here when they
were sophomores, when I just joined the program. But believe me, it's about
more than wins and losses. It's about relationships. It's a moment you're
having.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the match-up today with Wisconsin; what was it
that caused some struggles for you? I know you had a good presence on the
front line from Ali and Kennedi, but of course the size disadvantage has been
an issue all season long. What was it today that sort of turned the game, I
guess, in your mind?  
NANCY FAHEY: I guess size. We didn't score. I'd have to look at the film to
kind of break it down, but I guess I was -- they hit some shots. We kind of
tried to open it up and get some easier buckets as the game progressed, and I
thought they came out and did a pretty good job of defending us.  
  
Q. Kennedi had another double-double tonight. That 's her eighth of her
career. She has now set the freshman single-season record for rebounding at
Illinois. Can you just talk about her effort throughout the season, what
you've seen from her growth throughout the season.  
NANCY FAHEY: I mean, I think our three freshmen did a really good job tonight.
That's something to build on. She's been playing undersized all year, so we're
looking forward to having a little bit more balance next year.

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 80, Fresno State - 76 (OT)  
  
COACH WHITE: Not our best game. I thought we kind of hung in there and we made
a run in the first half and got that score where we wanted it to. And at the
end of regulation I thought we had some opportunities to knock it down. I
don't think we shot the best from the free-throw line. At this point we needed
every single one we could get. We shot 81 percent. Can't blame it on that
either. We could have shot better from the 3. But our kids gave everything
they had.  
  
Every night you're not always in control of some things. And I thought our
kids battled and they did what they had to to make that game winnable. And
unfortunate that we did not win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. At the end of the game who called the timeout?  
COACH WHITE: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Still a little bit of a blur to me.
So we told them in the huddle, but the game is tight. And I think we made a
great play at the end. Hey, we made the first one. We missed the second one.
We got the rebound. So we did everything we could do in our power. And then I
guess you saw it; it was on national TV, wasn't it?  
  
Q. What was the explanation the referees gave you at the end of the
whole fiasco?  
COACH WHITE: Yeah, you know, they talked about an audible and that if the
official hears it then they have to call it, I think, because I don't know the
rules so much. But Lacy did a good job trying to explain to me as best she
could. I still don't understand it. It's really hard when there's a lot of
emotions going on.  
  
Q. Could you still just talk about the journey that it was to getting to
this moment, because I imagine getting to the championship finals is not easy
and you guys had a lot of success throughout this entire year.  
MADDI UTTI: Yeah, we definitely had to work really hard throughout the whole
season. And I think that shows with our record in the conference. And no game
was easy. No game is ever easy in this conference. So it was definitely a
grind. We had new players that really stepped up. And so I'm really proud of
them for that.  
  
And, yeah, coming to the tournament we were the No. 1 seed. We knew that
people would want to beat us. And we knew that nobody was going to back down.  
  
HALEY CAVINDER: Yeah, just going off what Maddi said, just fighting to the end
of every game no matter how close it was or whatever the score was, we were
just going to give it until the final buzzer came off. And also what she said,
going off a record that shows that we're going to fight until the end and
unfortunately it didn't happen today, but we'll be back.  
  
COACH WHITE: I think this team showed a lot of grit all year long, extremely
proud as a coach to see these young kids. I mean at times we had four freshmen
on the floor battling five seniors. And Maddi, a junior, we didn't play our
seniors.  
  
So I'm excited about that, obviously, but they showed that grit and that hard
work and that energy all year and as young freshmen and juniors that haven't
been on this big of a stage, they're ready to win that thing. And that's all
that a coach can ask for.  
  
Q. Maddi, how would you describe just kind of the roller coaster of
emotions from that third quarter to the fourth quarter and then overtime and
then to now?  
MADDI UTTI: Yeah, we knew that we could catch up. We were coming from behind.
We've done it before against Boise. So we knew we could catch up, so we were
pretty positive going into the third and the fourth quarter. And then Haley
hit that big 3. And at that point we thought we had it.  
  
But then overtime happened and, yeah, you guys saw it. It just didn't turn out
the way we wanted it to, necessarily. But I think we just kept fighting and
that shows a lot about our team.  
  
Q. What was your impressions of the timeout call at the end and the
decision that the referee made?  
MADDI UTTI: I don't know. I guess you just have to go by what the official
says. You don't have any control. And so --  
  
Q. I know it 's hard to think about right now but you guys will be
playing on in a postseason tournament, in the WNIT for sure. In a couple of
days, is it going to be at least something, some solace that you get to start
working towards that a little bit, do you think? Can you talk a little bit
about that?  
MADDI UTTI: Yeah, we just have to look forward to the tournament. And we're
really excited about that. And we still have more games ahead of us to grow as
a team and look for getting a different championship.  
  
Q. Coach, could you still talk about some of the successes that you guys
had tonight, being able to get 40 points in the paint and also being able to
win the rebound margin to get those extra possessions?  
COACH WHITE: Yeah, I mean, so one of our -- we met almost all of our numbers.
We want to get 40 rebounds. We want to stay under 12 turnovers. We didn't
quite get that. We have been scoring over 40 points or 30 to 40 points in the
paint, so that was good. We won on second-chance points, I think.  
  
When we're maybe -- I don't want to say outmatched -- but when we're not as
tall as everybody else, we have to do different things, and we've been doing
that all year. Our speed and toughness and athleticism has overcome a lot of
those areas. So I was proud of our girls.  
  
I mean, this is one you're going to go back over and you're going to say, oh,
we could have done that there; oh, we could have done that there. And, again,
we kept battling. That's all a coach can ask for -- put your players in a
position that they believe in it and they did that.  
  
Our first quarter was pretty good. We wanted our third quarter to be like
that. It wasn't as bad -- and now that I'm looking at it it wasn't as bad. I
think our second quarter was the biggest deficit. So if we can correct that,
we would probably have had a lead going into the last little bit.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier how at times during the season you had five
freshmen going against five seniors. How could you say about like the
foundation that you guys have and just the future being bright with this
program?  
COACH WHITE: It's exciting. Anytime you have young kids, and I think we've
done that consistently, we've had young kids come in and be able to play right
away and get that experience. I think this year's been more special than some
of the others in that we have so many.  
  
Clearly we have Haley and Hanna, who have added scoring and defense and
rebounding and so many things that have helped us to be successful. And the
young group is so competitive. They've made everybody around them better
because you know when those freshmen come in and they're pushing, those
upperclassmen don't want to lose their territory so they work a little bit
harder. And that's been fun to see.  
  
As a coach, it's nice because I felt we were talented and very capable and I
was able to be able to -- Maddi can play any position, so we're able to move
people in different areas. And that's been fun this year for me.  
  
Q. Could you just speak on the range of emotions there in those final
few seconds because it looked like you tie the game up, you do everything the
right way. And then it 's waved off and there's the technical call. Just the
range of emotions right there on the floor at that moment.  
COACH WHITE: 1 to 10.  
  
HALEY CAVINDER: I think we just did everything right, like Coach White was
saying. We missed the free throw that we needed, get the tip back in. At that
point it wasn't in our control. And that's what's hard about it is that play
kind of decided the game. And the emotions were high. Clearly we wanted to win
it.  
  
MADDI UTTI: I agree with Haley. When the shot went in we were all obviously on
a high. We thought we tied the game again. And so when it was waved off, it
was a little bit disappointing. Yeah, we wanted to win, for sure.  
  
Q. Game planning-wise, you knocked out Boise State 's two best players
in Coleman and Hodges. What do you think was the shortcoming, once you knocked
out the two best players going into overtime, what prevented you from getting
over the hump at that point?  
COACH WHITE: You know, I just think that -- okay, so Mallory comes in and then
Mallory gives you a bigger post inside. And so it wasn't like we were going
against their nonstarters. And I thought we did a good job attacking them and
really trying to get to the rim.  
  
I think at that point we continued to try to attack and weren't getting as
much as what we thought we would get from that. So that's probably the best
way I can say it.  
  
I think we were excited when they did go out. We felt like we could adjust and
turn some things around. I do think on the defensive end -- so we switched up
our defense a little bit, which was very effective. It stopped them from
hitting 3s.  
  
And then their No. 30 made some big plays. I thought she made some big plays.
And I'm not taking anything away from Boise. Boise was a preseason number one
pick for good reason, obviously. I think they had a lot of parts that were
good, and I don't want to take anything away from their championship either.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 80, Fresno State - 76 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Gordy Presnell and
student-athletes A'Shanti Coleman, Braydey Hodgins, Ellie Woerner, Jade
Loville and Riley Lupfer.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: First of all, I want to congratulate Fresno State on a great
regular season and a great tournament. It was a great game, I thought, and one
for our memory banks, that's for sure. I want to congratulate them.  
  
Then I want to thank our administration, our president and our athletic
director, Curt Apsey, and our senior women's administrator, Christina Van Tol.
So just incredible support.  
  
And I thought it was a great game, and I thought our kids had some adversity.
We talked about adversity before the game and how we've gone through it
before. And I thought that they just really stepped up.  
  
I'm really proud of A'Shanti for being MVP of the tournament. And I just
thought it was a great night and everyone contributed. And it was one for the
memory banks for me. I can't tell you how proud I am of our six seniors. And
then we had a sophomore, Jade Loville, stepped up tonight and hit big shots
down the stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jade, there was so much talk about all the seniors and veterans and
yet a sophomore steps up with huge plays down the stretch. What did it mean to
you to have that opportunity and to come through with the game on the line?  
JADE LOVILLE: Getting the trust from my coach and teammates is everything. I
just wanted to execute for them and step up and let them know that I'm ready.
And they've just provided me with so much opportunity. They've helped me in
practice finding my shot within our offense. And they've just helped me grow
so much as a player, as a person. So it's all them. They put me in this
position to step up and I'm so grateful for that.  
  
Q. Coach, the final seconds of the game, the timeout is called, the
technical given. Obviously it goes in your favor. What was the explanation
that was given to you guys?  
COACH PRESNELL: The official said that she positively heard and saw the
timeout, and they didn't have any. She was 100 percent sure. When they say 100
percent sure, then they're 100 percent sure. And so we were able to get a
chance to get the free throw and get the ball back.  
  
Q. Braydey, you look to your right, you have three senior teammates that
you 've been through the war with. What's this moment mean to you, and what
does this night mean to you?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: It was definitely different not being in control on the bench
there for the last eight minutes. Felt like the longest eight minutes of my
life. But with all we've been through, I knew they had my back. And they were
going to get it done. And that's what I kept reminding T when she was sitting
next to me.  
  
These girls would do anything for us, and they wanted it as bad as I did. And
A'Shanti and everyone wanted it. And we knew there was nothing getting in
between us. Whether it be starters fouling out or anything else they were
going to get it done. Jade Loville stepped up huge, and we made amazing plays
on defense and offense to get the W.  
  
Q. In these championship games you 've had buzzer-beater, you've had a
couple that were wider margins. And I think you knew coming in this was going
to be a battle. Just for a couple players, just the back-and-forth nature, the
lead slipping away in the fourth quarter and being able to in overtime to win
it, how were you able to pull this one out.  
RILEY LUPFER: I think we came here on Friday. We had this vibe. We didn't
really want to talk about it and jinx it. But we kind of had this feeling,
like, it was going to be ours again. And I feel like we had this and you saw
it during these games. So it gives us composure because I know at the end of
the day we're on the same page and you count on each other. And we did that.  
  
Q. What did you guys tell each other after Fresno State had made that
3-pointer to tie the game up at the end of regulation?  
ELLIE WOERNER: I think the whole, like, fourth quarter, down the stretch, we
just kept saying, we've got this, we've got this. We had confidence in each
other and we were composed and we've been in those situations before. So I
think having that experience helped us play calm and know that we could still
do it. And so just giving each other that confidence was crucial for us.  
  
Q. A 'Shanti, Braydey talked about it. What was it like for you fouling
out and having to sit there? Couple times you got up, almost seemed like you
were trying to be a coach. Not be able to play at that point, how tough was
it?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: It was very tough. When I fouled out I was kind of mad. As
soon as I came off I think the tears started rolling down. I knew they would
pull it out. You just wish, especially in a tournament game -- they've never
seen me cry -- you always want to be on the floor. But I knew they would pull
it out.  
  
Q. You guys had a goal when you started the season of wanting
desperately to get back to the NCAA Tournament, and there were moments where
it seemed maybe it wouldn 't come true. And to come through in the title game,
what are your thoughts, Braydey?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: We were doubted after we got on a skid. We hit our lowest
valley at that point that I've probably had since I've been here. We all came
together. Our coaches worked their butts off to get us to the point where we
are, and we had to come together and believe in each other more.  
  
There's so many weapons on our team. It took a while to find where everyone
fits in. We have scorers and defenders across the board. We probably have so
many starters on our team that it just happened that five of them were out
there.  
  
So we have such a deep team. And it just took a little bit longer. And so to
be able to get here and be up here talking as four-time Mountain West
Tournament champion, there's no better way to go out with these girls here.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously this game, a lot of even stats across the board for
both teams except for one area obviously and that 's 3-point shooting. Your
thoughts, particularly in that fourth quarter, on your squad's defensively
being able to shut them down from beyond the arc? It was a big, big aspect for
your team tonight.  
COACH PRESNELL: Yeah, I thought that -- I didn't know how well the 3-point
shooting would go, especially in the second half because that's three games in
a row and their three guards are so ball dominant for three games in a row and
they all played, I don't know, over 100 minutes probably. I thought fatigue
would become a factor.  
  
But also I give credit to our players for defending. And I thought they did an
outstanding job, especially in the second half, of just kind of staying in
front. And you want to -- they're so quick, and you want to back off a little
bit but you can't. And so I was really proud of them.  
  
Q. Last couple days you 've been asked what would it mean to win four
and you said we'll talk about it when we do it; we haven't won it yet. To be
sitting here for the seniors, to be 12-0 in the tournament, to know exactly
what's happening, who is cutting down the net and in what order because you've
done it so much, what's the feeling to know you'll forever be 12-0 in this
tournament and tell your grandkids what you did some day?  
RILEY LUPFER: Something you can't ever take away. It's something that I wish
could last forever. I love these girls. They're my sisters. I love them to
death. The coaching staff, they deserve it. Without them we wouldn't be here.  
  
It's such a great feeling. This three days just take it one moment at a time
because as seniors we wish we could stay forever. It's like enjoying the
little things, recovery, every little moment together. So to finally be
sitting here, I never want this feeling to go away.  
  
Q. Braydey, you talked about how there was so much depth on this team
and how there 's so many veteran players and everybody in the conference talks
about the depth you guys utilize night in, night out. What was it to see that
tonight with 30 bench points in a high intensity game like this?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I think we displayed it all year. It can be anyone's night,
kind of the same thing we were in last year. But last year we had a little bit
more consistency, I guess you could say.  
  
We have players coming off the bench that are scorers and that helps us
tremendously, and be able to -- it gives you that grace period; well, if I'm
not having a good night I know Jade will step up, I know Ellie will step up.
And I know other people have my back, so it gives you a sense of calmness.  
  
And that's something we had to utilize down the stretch of the season. There
was no reason really for any of us to fatigue out. We have players who can
play and we played them.  
  
Q. Jade, what did it mean to you to have such a big performance off the
bench tonight?  
JADE LOVILLE: I was just telling Braydey I just did my part. They've done so
much, these seniors. I mean, they've left a legacy that is so spectacular. So
I just wanted to do my part. I didn't want to let them down. I didn't want to
let my coaches down. And I'm just so happy. I'm so happy that it all fell into
place.  
  
Q. You talk about the depth of the team. Braydey, when you and A 'Shanti
both fall out, I know you've got a lot of depth, but how much does that help
you going forward confidence-wise when your team knows you two can be missing
and you still can win a game like this?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: It helps tremendously. From this point on and for the last
three days it's win and advance. We know we have a lot of special weapons and
a lot of cards we can play on any given night. It was comforting on the bench,
knowing that -- I mean, there was nothing I could do there. All I could do was
talk to T and tell them, they've got this; they got this. They're going to get
a board and get a stop.  
  
And to be able to trust them like that is something super special. And like
Riley said, we're sisters and we've been through the highs and lows. And it's
super awesome to have these people to lean on in times like that.  
  
Q. [Inaudible]?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I would say for sure we're always going to look back on this
night as something special. Like I keep saying over and over, we have weapons.
And so I think this brings extra confidence to the players on the bench. And
then also takes a little load off the starters that we don't have to do it
all. We have people who have our back and do a spectacular job at that.  
  
Q. Coach said on the floor his two main goals is to not fall off the
ladder or cut himself with the scissors. For those who haven 't ever had that
opportunity, what's it like seeing your teammates cutting down the nets? You
guys are getting pretty used to that.  
ELLIE WOERNER: It's indescribable, the feeling. And the best part is doing it
with these girls, especially us seniors who have gotten to do it. When you
hold the net looking back at each other, just knowing how much love we have
for each other and how hard we've worked to get here, you can't even describe
it.  
  
Q. Coach, winning in Vegas is something -- you 've just become
accustomed to it. I think you make a lot of visitors to the city jealous
because you win so much. What's the secret and just what changes for your team
when you guys get to this tournament?  
COACH PRESNELL: I think we've had, for a number of years really good culture,
and we've had leaders that passed down the way we do things to the next
person. And these guys had -- Brooke Pahukoa and Chaita (phonetic), and Brooke
Pahukoa and Chaita had Deanna Weaver, and the way we do things in the weight
room and how we handle ourselves on the road and the way we do things in the
classroom in a certain way. And they pass it down to the next group.  
  
They're an amazing, amazing group. And I just can't say enough good stuff
about them because they mean so much to me personally. And what they've done
for our program and for each other and for the university is really pretty
remarkable.  
  
The seniors had eight chances to win a championship and they won six of them
in their careers. That's pretty good.  
  
Q. Ellie, I was going to ask you, you left a starting role at Portland
State -- Portland -- and were the leading scorer to play a limited but vital
role as we saw tonight. What made that choice worth it?  
ELLIE WOERNER: I think I played a lot of different roles over my few years
here playing. And I just did my best to embrace whatever role I was in and do
whatever I could to help the team.  
  
And like Braydey has said, every night someone else can step up. And I think
just staying ready -- and these girls and my coaches and everybody just
supported me the whole way in whatever role I was in and gave me confidence in
if I'm open, shoot it. And I think all the confidence that they gave me I was
able to have tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 94, San Jose State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
  
COACH WHITE: I thought we had a good start. Held a team to 11 points was
great, especially a team that can score like they can. And then our scoring
was excellent. I thought our kids were really ready to play, focused. Knocked
down big shots, drew fouls, got to the free-throw line.  
  
So to have 20 assists means we were sharing the ball. Clearly these three have
put us on their backs more than once, and again they did it in a big game, in
a big time.  
  
Q. What was one of your biggest points of emphasis to limit Basallo to
only 12 points tonight?  
COACH WHITE: Well, at our place we held her to four. So we put Hanna on her to
kind of keep her at bay, keep her from driving, and hopefully keep her off the
free-throw line. She's a really good free-throw shooter.  
  
We've just seen her play and put up numbers. We know she has quickness and
speed. And Hanna's job was just to stay in front of her. She really did that
well. Also we have to have an awareness of where the shooters are. And she's
definitely one of those.  
  
I thought everybody in our zone got out and got a contest up, and just stayed
with it the whole game. Because a kid like her, she can score at any time, so
you've got to keep it up, all 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Are you noticing a different intensity in your team right now?  
COACH WHITE: We had a rough end of our season with our Air Force game and
going to Wyoming. And I think part of our intensity and our focus right now is
because we realized there's still some things we can do and we can get better
at.  
  
So I think that's part of it. But we always are excited to come to the
Mountain West Tournament. We know what it means. And I think our girls are
hungry, hungrier than I've seen a team at Fresno State for a while.  
  
Q. What 's going to be your message to the team before a big-time
opportunity -- the Mountain West championship game, a trip to the NCAA
Tournament on the line?  
COACH WHITE: Be ourselves. We've had a good season. We've played well. We've
beaten all the teams in the conference, so we know that we can do that. We
need to be really good at being us, which means we're going to transition,
we're going to contest shots, we're going to rebound, we're going to drive and
draw fouls. And we're just going to do the things we've done all year. And
then just value the game.  
  
It's such a special game. Not a lot of people in the country get to be in
championship games. And I think we always grow as we test ourselves. So, it
will be a challenge. But if we come together, I think all things work out.  
  
Q. Maddi, you guys played a couple of barn burners with San Jose State
during the regular season. What was the difference tonight? Why were you able
to win by so much?  
MADDI UTTI: I think we definitely had an attention to rebound better on the
defensive end. We didn't let them get very many offensive rebounds. So I
thought that was a big point. And also we knocked down some shots early, which
was really beneficial to us.  
  
Q. Just the opportunity to -- starting with you Maddi -- just an
opportunity to play in a Mountain West championship game, when you think about
it, what do you start thinking about and what are the emotions?  
MADDI UTTI: I'm excited. It was definitely something coming in freshman year I
wanted to get to. My first few years we obviously didn't. Now it's here and
I'm just really excited.  
  
ALY GAMEZ: It's a special moment. This is all of our first time. So it's going
to be very special for us. And I'm very excited. That's all I can think about
right now.  
  
HALEY CAVINDER: I'm really excited, just like they said, but I just don't
think we're done yet. We want to win it. And we're not satisfied, and we're
going to go out there and prove it.  
  
Q. This is my first time seeing you guys actually play live but in
person. You killed it tonight. What 's the method to the madness? I see you
guys you're super good at communicating as a team. And passing the ball, it's
amazing. I haven't seen this type of play as far as college girls passing the
ball so smoothly, all your shots are so smooth. What's the method to madness
as far as communication and being able to cope with your teammates with just
knowing how to all play the same way?  
ALY GAMEZ: I think it starts with chemistry. It starts in practice. We've been
together all year. So bonding together and knowing where everyone's going to
be. Knowing everyone's strengths and weaknesses. I think that's important. And
I think just us playing as a team at the end of the day.  
  
Q. What will you do to celebrate if you end up making it?  
HALEY CAVINDER: Ice cream. (Laughter).  
  
Q. The first quarter, to close it out, you went on a 20-2 run. Is that
the best this team 's been playing all season?  
COACH WHITE: That felt good, yeah. That felt good. As a coach you're like,
okay, what are we going to do next quarter.  
  
I felt like against a team like that, to feel comfortable at all, you would
need to have a lead. And in my mind I thought, okay, if we he can go in the
locker room with a 20-point lead we can regroup and work on some things and
get better in the second half.  
  
It was nice to be able to play our bench. And I thought, too, we were able to
get some different combinations in there. I thought Kendyll came in and did a
good job. Brooke has been giving us good minutes. Wytalla has been giving us
good minutes. And it's important that the whole team feels that out on the
court. So that was nice to be able to get everybody in.  
  
Q. Maddi, tonight you had 22 points, 15 rebounds six assists 9-of-10
from the free-throw line. Walk us through your success tonight.  
MADDI UTTI: I just think I was ready to play. I think also the whole team was
ready to play, which really helps. We all had a lot of energy coming out. So I
think that that just affected everyone. And, yeah.  
  
Q. Haley, you 've been sitting up there looking very intense all evening
long, except you mentioned you were really excited to have some ice cream.
When we talked about Maddi's performance, you got really excited. Are you
already moving forward and looking toward the championship game? What's your
thoughts on tonight's performance?  
HALEY CAVINDER: I was really happy with how our team played. And I'm looking
forward to that game. I think that's what's on everyone's mind, is can 8:00
come sooner tomorrow.  
  
COACH WHITE: Let's move the game up. (Laughter). Like 6.00 a.m., so Boise's a
little tired, or Wyoming.

### [Riley Lupfer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32836)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 79, Wyoming - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: Congratulations to Wyoming on a great season, and they played
so hard. And we had a hard time keeping the ball -- they kept driving the ball
at the rim, and their post player really established post play early.  
  
I thought we had a great, great second quarter. And our second quarter created
some space so they never really -- they came close to recovering that space,
but they didn't.  
  
And so proud of our kids. Proud of these two here. And we got great lift off
the bench as well. So it's a good night. We've got to do some serious recovery
because we've got our hands full tomorrow.  
  
Q. That fourth quarter they kept cutting it to six and you would can get
a couple of buckets and they 'd get it back to five or six. What was it about
your ability to hold them off there down the stretch?  
COACH PRESNELL: More than anything we've had our share of failures down a
stretch of games, but this group has had a lot more successes down the
stretches of a game. And we were in the huddle with three or four minutes, and
we were, like, we've got to get this done.  
  
It was real positive and we just went out and executed pretty well and then I
thought Braydey was outstanding at the free-throw line, a lot of pressure on
when they were trying to closing the gap.  
  
Q. Coach, this will be your fourth trip in a row to the championship
game. You saw the Fresno State Bulldogs in 2017, a little bit of a familiar
foe. What will you be telling your team tonight?  
COACH PRESNELL: Actually, in the morning we'll talk about their ability to get
to the rim. They're very highly skilled team. Utti is really great at up-and-
unders, and the twins are so good, not just them, but the rest of their guards
as well. Hitch drives and running through your shoulder and hip and getting
themselves on the line, that's one thing that concerns us.  
  
We still play old-school basketball where we have a bunch of special plays
trying to get five people together. And the new style is spreading it out and
just attacking your hip and shoulder and trying to get to the free-throw line.
We probably score, I don't know, nine points a game, maybe eight points, nine
points from the free-throw line. And at our place I think they made 24, 26.
And I think tonight they made 24, 26. So we've got to be able to stay in front
of them and keep from fouling them.  
  
Q. Riley, similar question for you. Is it going to be any different when
you and Braydey lay down your head on your pillow tonight knowing you can make
history with 4-for-4 than it has been going into any of the last three title
games?  
RILEY LUPFER: Yeah, it will be on our mind. Yes, we've been here three times
before. But we always know that Fresno is a very good team and there's a
reason they're number one.  
  
But at the end of the day, we're just going to enjoy the moment. Four times in
a row something special. So just embrace it all. Just to do it with these
girls, you can't even put it into words.  
  
Q. Coach talked about how some of the games you let some leads slip away
and stuff. What was the difference in the fourth quarter? I was asking Coach,
but just being able to hit some big shots and not let it get closer than five
or six points. Just seemed like you never panicked, your veteran leadership
took over in key spots.  
RILEY LUPFER: I feel like at the end of games we know who to give the ball to
when they're fouling and that's Braydey Hodgins. But then at the end of games,
I feel like Jayde and A'Shanti just kind of play off each other. And you know
T is going to set that ball screen and roll and then she's going to get that
layup. And I feel like we're just so composed in those times.  
  
Q. A 'Shanti, fifth straight 20-point game, only the third Boise State
player to ever do that. The game was different today as opposed to the
transition game. What was working for?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: What was working for me? I missed a few shots in the
beginning, but I didn't let that get to me. My teammates were encouraging me
because sometimes I tend to focus on the shots that I miss. But overall we
were just working well with each other, the chemistry. Finding people the
shots, like getting Riley shots, Braydey, telling Jayde Chris to take the ball
down into the paint because no one can guard her. I believe we all did pretty
well.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: I believe A'Shanti scored her thousandth point. And it's
pretty remarkable to have three seniors with 1,000 points, and a point guard
that's number two in the country assists. Pretty good group.  
  
Q. Gordy, we talked about in the past trying to enjoy this --  
COACH PRESNELL: Yeah, I'm not. That's okay.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: All stress.  
  
Q. Maybe it 's a question for tomorrow night, but are you just -- being
11-0 with this senior class here at the tournament what you guys are able to
do, are you able to appreciate the rarity of what you guys have been able to
do here?  
COACH PRESNELL: I appreciate them, that's for sure. And they've meant a lot to
me to in my career and my life. I love them and I'm getting emotional.  
  
But anyway, we just need to go 40 minutes. They have to hear me yell at them
for about 40 more minutes and hopefully we'll have sent them off on a
wonderful career.  
  
Q. It 's one thing to actually talk about doing something, but it's a
very different thing to actually do it. The last time, about a month ago, I
guess, maybe a little more than a month ago, you guys said you'd love to have
a rematch with Fresno State, and it will come to fruition tomorrow. Why was
this team able to make that happen and not just talk about it?  
COACH PRESNELL: We got beat by the 11th place team in our league, and -- on a
side banker at the buzzer. And we had had an 11-point lead with about 3
minutes to go. And since that moment, we've actually played very good
basketball.  
  
And we went down and San Diego State, and A'Shanti hit a buzzer-beater -- and
she has played at completely another level. We've kind of have gotten on a
roll. Everyone has those hump games, and maybe ours was losing the number 11.
And we played pretty well since.  
  
Q. I think you guys were up 17 at one point in that game. To lose the
game at home like that, how much did that sting, and how much are you guys
looking forward to another chance at playing them?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: We're definitely looking forward to that second go-around,
because we only played them once. I definitely think that we shouldn't have
let that slip. So losing that game, it really did hurt us, because there's
some things we needed to work on and I think that we'll work on it tomorrow in
practice and then scout and film. So I think we'll be able to get it down.  
  
Q. Pretty unusual stat tonight, to see a double-double from Jayde
Christopher in assists and rebounds. What does she mean to this team and what
does she provide to you guys?  
RILEY LUPFER: Big guard. She's strong. She can go get those boards. Are you
ever not surprised by Jayde Christopher? Tell me. That would have been cool to
get a triple-double, but we are very focussed on guards going in and souping
up those defensive rebounds when they have base down there. So it is different
for Jayde to get 10 rebounds but not even surprised.  
  
Q. How nice is it to have so many seniors and veterans that have been
through the battles and weathered the storms and when the other team 's crowd
is getting into it and they're making a run, just didn't really seem to faze
them; you didn't panic, how much of a benefit this time of year is it to have
the seniors and veteran leadership you have?  
COACH PRESNELL: There's a camaraderie there. We've been through the wars
together. And I've just really enjoyed being in their company. And I'll miss
practices and just coming and listening to them talk and joke around. And
they're just full of personality. And not only so successful athletically but
really successful academically. And just proud to be around them, proud to be
their coach.  
  
And one thing's for sure is we get to keep playing. And so it will be fun.
Tomorrow will be fun.  
  
Q. They had 50 points in the paint and they only hit one 3. Was that
kind of how you expected the game to go or what worked, at least to slow them
defensively?  
COACH PRESNELL: They tried to establish post play really early. And I thought
they did an outstanding job doing it. And then they started driving the ball.  
  
And one of the things that we've done real well through the course of the year
and haven't done well at the end is three-quarters of the game we play pretty
good defense and everyone attacks the rim. Everyone attacks the right side of
the rim or the left side of the rim, depending on what hand they are. And we
have not done well with that at the end of games. And that's what's going to
happen tomorrow for 40 minutes. So we've got to get ourselves prepared for.

Boise State - 79, Wyoming - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
  
COACH MATTINSON: I thought it was a hard-fought, scrappy game. Both teams had
to dig and scratch. We started out like gangbusters, kind of let some things
get away from us, but we battled back, fought the whole way through.  
  
And Boise is a very talented team. They're well-coached. And they played very
well tonight and took us out of some of the things we wanted to do. And we
just came up short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. In that second quarter I think they shot 73 or something from the
field, but outside of that I think they only hit like 36.5 percent. What was
it in the second that they were doing, was it making shots or defense, what
would you say?  
COACH MATTINSON: I couldn't tell you without looking over the film. We were
playing. You look back, I know some shots were good shots. Some shots I think
they banked one in, something during that period.  
  
Without looking at the film I really couldn't tell you what happened. I know
they shot the ball well. I know we got confused a couple times on what we
wanted to do with their on-ball screens. But without looking at the film I
really couldn't give you a good answer.  
  
Q. You spoke a little bit about it yesterday but you brought up that New
Mexico game in February as kind of a major turning point for you guys. I think
you win six in a row after that until this one. What was it about that game
specifically that kind of turned the corner for what ended up being a strong
season overall?  
COACH MATTINSON: I think that with a young team there's a couple of things
that you have to do. And we're a young team. I know we have Taylor as a
senior.  
  
What has to happen is that they have to buy into what they're doing. They have
to really want something bad and at that point of the year they were prepping.
They were preparing. They were studying. They put a lot into it and we made a
couple of mistakes and they knew it and it hurt. And it hurt and it hurt some
of them bad.  
  
And the next day in practice, or in film, they stepped up and said, you know
what, this one was on me, this one was on me, this one was on me. Each player
to a T bought it, took the accountability. And from that point on that's a
growing phase that you need to have to be able to do what this group did.  
  
Q. You had the most wins of a first-year coach in Wyoming history.
Obviously this loss hurts, but what can you take forward moving into next
year?  
COACH MATTINSON: I take forward, obviously we don't take Taylor forward, which
means a lot to our program. She's had a great four years. But what goes
forward is a great group of young women who have, like I said with the
previous question, have learned to study the game, who have learned to apply
the game, who come every day hard and compete in practice, who come every day
hard and play. We don't always do the right things but that's the game of
basketball.  
  
So going forward I have a great group of young women who we just talked about
in the locker room. Now, they've had enough experience that they've got to
take some things upon themselves and go, what do we need to do now in the
offseason to take the next step. And I'm looking forward to being able to work
with this group and see how those next steps go.  
  
Q. Quinn, you have different perspectives on this. You 're coming back
next year. But likely your last game unless there's a postseason berth of some
sort. I believe there's 11 players coming back for next year's team. From your
perspective, Quinn, how optimistic are you about what's to come? And, Taylor,
what do you see the future of this program looking like?  
TAYLOR RUSK: Like Coach said, we were really young this year. So that was not
a disadvantage this year, but next year they can definitely use that. A lot of
girls got experience, big minutes and had to step up. And they definitely
learned a lot of things this year and can move forward into their sophomore,
junior and senior years.  
  
QUINN WEIDEMANN: I agree. I think we got most of our starters except for
Taylor got a lot more experience this year. We didn't have those minutes that
we played last year.  
  
So I think it was a big learning experience to kind of be in those tough
games, close games, whatever, and be able to win.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 3, 2020

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Fieme'a Hafoka](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38805)

### [Ayzhiana Basallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38806)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 94, San Jose State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State.  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: As hard as it is for Spartans to give credit to Bulldogs, I
thought Fresno State played a terrific game. We couldn't hit shots early. Got
in a little bit of a hole. Couldn't seem to keep them in front of us. They got
to the free-throw line a ton of times and that makes it really difficult.  
  
But I'm super proud of my team. It's the second team that's gotten to the
semifinals. This group, for the most part, will be coming back. I'm excited to
see what they can do in the future. But I'm really going to miss the senior on
the end here, who has played her heart out for us the last four seasons.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the growth this team has had, especially
from last season going into this season, and like you said, one of the only
teams going into the semis?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: They worked. We came back last season and said, we're not
going to have a season like we had had the previous two years. And we felt
like we had some really nice pieces. And obviously Zhiana was a big part of
this group and Ty.  
  
And I felt like we were a little bit older, mature, more experienced. They
played so hard all season. Our defense got better. We could score. And
obviously tonight we couldn't find the bottom of the basket enough.  
  
But they just did what you do. You're resilient. You fight. And you find ways
to be better. And I'm just really proud. They learn a lot at this age and
playing sports is really humbling. And we're kind of feeling that right now.
But they've done a great job.  
  
Number one turnaround in Division I women's basketball with our win total.
Hopefully we get to play on. That's our hope.  
  
Q. This isn 't the outcome you hoped for, still one of the best seasons
in the program's history. Can you talk about what this season has meant to
you?  
AYZHIANA BASALLO: It's meant a lot. Like Coach said, we're like the first,
what did you say, Division I program turnaround. It was great playing with
everybody. We proved a lot of people wrong. We've just got to keep going from
here.  
  
FIEME'A HAFOKA: I'm just sad, not just because we lost, but just because I
know we could do a lot more. But at the end of the day I'm not going to let
this game tonight take away from what was accomplished this whole season. And
I think that, I know for a fact that next year these girls are going to come
back even stronger. Everyone's coming back.  
  
But I also think that not a lot of people knew we were going to be here today.
We were picked last. I think the fact that like media, like media doesn't mean
anything. And here we are. We played for the semis and we play sports. And I
think we proved a lot of people wrong. And I hope next year these girls are
going to go back and hopefully they're not picked last because we showed what
we've got. And I know next year they're going to come.  
  
I'm proud of this team I'm proud of everything we accomplished but this team
ain't done yet. And I know they're going to come even harder.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk a little bit about Megan and Danae, as far
as their influence on the program and how they 've kind of been maybe a
steadying force in being a part of this turnaround at San Jose State?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: You obviously know what they accomplished in their high
school careers. And when we were recruiting them, we knew we were recruiting
winners -- character people, glue people. Megan is by far one of the best
shooters I've ever coached. I'm excited she's not graduating. We're losing a
pretty good one on this end, too.  
  
And Danae, she's that resilient kid that doesn't have the height, doesn't have
the speed, but man her heart is bigger than anybody on the court.  
  
And they bring a lot to our program, and -- like everyone does. But we were
fortunate we felt like at the time when we didn't have anything to show them,
there wasn't a bunch of wins to show them, and they took a chance on us. And I
feel proud as a coach to be able to go into Fresno State's backyard and steal
a couple of kids from them. And obviously recruiting is always the name of the
game. And we feel like we have a really good program and we're excited that
they came and they just have been great additions.  
  
Q. How did you guys feel about the officiating today? Fresno State had
over twice the amount of free throws as you guys. And foul disparity was
27-15. How did you feel about that disparity?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I mean, that's not what determined the game. I thought that
their kids were very aggressive from the start. And they played in that 2-3
zone, and I don't think we attacked it enough and got ourselves in the paint.  
  
At the end of the day, we've got to make shots and get stops. And it's a lot
when you look at the free throws, 34-15, but ultimately we could control
things that we didn't control. And we can't do anything about the officials.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Haley Cavinder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38803)

### [Hanna Cavinder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38804)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 75, Nevada - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
  
COACH WHITE: I thought, I honestly thought the first half was pretty good to
get out of there with the lead. They made a little push at the first half, but
our kids played tough. We kept answering. And didn't feel like we rebounded as
well but we tied them in rebounds. I thought we grinded it out.  
  
Obviously Haley had a great game. She was able to score, especially in the
first half; we really needed that.  
  
We scored a lot in the paint. I was happy with that. Just one of those games,
kind of that first game in the tournament, always get the jitters out. And
Nevada had a great win last night. So they were ready to go. I thought we kind
of -- we kind of braved the storm and finished strong.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Hanna and Haley, you guys had obviously fantastic games. What were
you seeing on the court that really allowed you guys to not just get to the
basket but score baskets the entire game?  
HANNA CAVINDER: I think we just took what the defense gave us. And I think our
teammates did a really good job of just setting the screens and getting us
open and working the ball and reversing it.  
  
HALEY CAVINDER: Yeah, I think going off what Hanna said, just giving -- they
were taking away my left-hand drives, so I was trying to penetrate to the
right. And just taking advantage of what -- they were going to give up
something for us, so we just hit the shots that they were giving up to us.  
  
Q. You mentioned Nevada was coming off a big win against New Mexico, and
you guys are in the same position where less than 24 hours from now you 'll be
back on the court playing another game. How do you prepare both as a coach and
players mentally and physically to get back on the court in less than 24
hours?  
COACH WHITE: It's less time than we're used to, but we'll do the exact same
thing. Just probably shorten it up a little bit.  
  
We're going to play a good team, whether it's UNLV or San Jose. And we've had
great games with both those teams. I do think there is somewhat of an
advantage that we have beaten both teams. So we have that confidence going in.  
  
But we've had really good close games with both of them. So I feel like just
getting this first game under our belt kind of calmed everybody down. And now
we know what it feels like and get out there and just play.  
  
We know that the best team's gotta win, and -- or the best team is going to
win that day and we've got to be that best team.  
  
Q. What did you see defensively tonight? And is there anything you 'd
like to see cleaned up for tomorrow?  
COACH WHITE: Well, we had to do a lot of different things defensively. I
thought Nevada did a great job just mixing things up.  
  
I would like to see us rebound better and finish -- we finished in the paint
pretty good. And other than Haley I'd like to see us hit a couple more 3s than
that. But, again, I think this team all year has found a way to win and under
whatever circumstances and whatever height is out there and whatever speed is
out there. And I think we take pride in that.  
  
So I think going into tomorrow, I think, one, we've got to make sure we get
rest and we have energy and effort and everything else will take care of
itself.  
  
Q. Brooke played sizable minutes this game. She didn 't necessarily show
up in the box score. But what did she add to the game, bring to the table
today?  
COACH WHITE: Nevada has great post players. And we felt like -- I think Imani
had a great game last night. I don't know what she got tonight. She still did
a good job, but we had to have a bigger presence in there to rebound and to
contest. And I thought Brooke did a good job with that. Also she's quicker at
times to move six to eight feet and we need that in the zone.  
  
Q. It seemed pretty physical out there on the court today and you two
seemed to hold your composure along with being unintimidated out there. Walk
me through your mindset in a game like that.  
HANNA CAVINDER: I just try to be as physical with them or try to finish around
the rim differently, so that I know I won't get blocked. But if they're going
to be really physical, you know they're either going to give a pull-up or give
something to you. And I think we just have to do a better job finishing even
if there's a lot of physicality going on.  
  
HALEY CAVINDER: Going off what Hanna said, just boxing out, getting the
rebound no matter if they're bigger or taller. I think that we don't really
get scared. We just want to come out and just get the win. No matter what it
is, no matter what it takes, that's what our whole team goes on. And I think
that's what we did today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Jayde Christopher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38808)

### [A'Shanti Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34913)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 73, Air Force - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State. Coach, start with you, just some
thoughts on the game?  
  
COACH PRESNELL: I thought it was a good game for us. They've done a
magnificent job, Coach Gobrecht has. And it was a great finish. But we thought
that it was their fourth game in eight days, and that we would just really
push the tempo as much as we could and try to wear them down a little bit.  
  
And so we transitioned at every single opportunity. And these two here, Jayde
and A'Shanti, are terrific at transition. And Jayde will find you if you're
open. And A'Shanti can finish -- except that one basket, holy cow.  
  
But, anyway, it was a good night for us. And Air Force, they get all those
kids back next year and they finished winning six of nine. And they really did
a nice job.  
  
Q. Air Force coach was in here and she said maybe she thought during the
regular season at times you guys were just bored, waiting for the tournament
to start, and that she expects you guys, she 'd be surprised if you didn't win
the tournament; you guys kind of turning it on at the right time. Is there a
new mindset or new sense of urgency once you're down here in Las Vegas to kind
of turn things up a notch?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: Well, I definitely think we are definitely at our peak
playing-wise. It is a little bit sense of urgency, but coming into the
tournament we kind of have a cool mind about it because we have a bunch of
people on this team that are pretty experienced, so we don't let that get to
us. I think we're doing pretty well. I think the tournament could be ours,
yeah.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about the ball movement that you guys had tonight
with 20 assists?  
JAYDE CHRISTOPHER: I think just being able to work the ball around and get
other people involved is most important. I would say it makes the game more
fun to watch and be in the game to work the ball around. So, yeah, I guess
that's where the 20 assists came.  
  
Q. The 19-2 run there in the second quarter, you guys were only up by
one; it was kind of a back-and-forth game. And then you kind of blew it open
there in the second quarter. What was the difference during that time?  
COACH PRESNELL: I think we got the ball in the middle of the floor, and Jayde
made some plays. I thought Riley hit some big shots. A'Shanti finished.
A'Shanti got off to a great start. And we just kind of got on a roll.  
  
But, also, I go back to they've played a lot of basketball in the last week
and we haven't. I don't know if the bye at the end of the year is good or bad.
I'm a pessimist, so I thought it was horrible. But when we got to play a team
that had played four games in eight days, I think it was really helpful.  
  
Q. Jayde, I think you probably knew coming in that you were right there
with the Mountain West single season assist record, but to get it tonight on a
big stage in the Mountain West Tournament, how did that feel?  
JAYDE CHRISTOPHER: I'm excited, but not complacent. I want to continue to keep
going. I mean, we still have two games and hopefully some more to play. But
I'm going to continue to dish out like I do and just play basketball, I guess,
yeah.  
  
Q. Gordy, you smiled when I was referencing the Air Force coach
comments. But did you get any sense with what you guys had accomplished at any
point in the middle of the conference play, it was like the dog days of August
or anything? It was just wanted to get to this tournament and kind of get to
this point?  
COACH PRESNELL: Yeah, it's not been a smooth-sailing year and we probably
overscheduled a bit before Christmas. But A'Shanti, especially, had a big
basket to win a game for us at San Diego State and has been really playing at
a pretty high level. And it's been -- we're just starting to play a little bit
better and a little bit faster.  
  
And I think there's a sense of urgency, like the question you had with six
seniors. And so they want to do something that no other team has done in this
conference. And so we got through the first one and we're 33 percent there.
Now we have a great opponent tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What can you say about your defense tonight having them commit 22
turnovers and making the most out of that and scoring 23 points?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: Well, just from the start, our coaches said this team is
going to look to -- they've got a bunch of players on the team that score. We
had to pick up defensively just so they didn't get hot.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: I think our assistant coaches, Caiann Ramirez and Heather
Sower, have done an outstanding job since the middle of the year with our
defense. Since Cariann became a full-time assistant I think we've never lost
in this tournament. So they both were outstanding in the game planning of it
and we just went into it. We're going to defend like crazy and switch like
crazy and then transition as much as we could.  
  
Q. We 've seen over the years, Riley Lupfer was the MVP two seasons ago,
Braydey scores a tournament-high 37 last year. And A'Shanti gets a career high
in this game. Jayde sets the assist record. What is it about this group that's
made them so talented and so well rounded?  
COACH PRESNELL: I think they've all sacrificed their own personal, maybe,
stats for each other. And they've all bought into the culture that we have.
And they're all a big, big part of it. They're unselfish and they're fun to be
around and they're good people and they've just done a wonderful job
representing Boise State and they just get along. They fit.  
  
And it doesn't happen very often in coaching that you get to coach a group
like this for as long as I've coached them because even A'Shanti has been here
four years. She redshirted her first year. But they're just wonderful people.  
  
Q. You guys obviously started your careers elsewhere. You come here, and
here you are seniors sitting up here, two wins from another Mountain West
title. What 's it been like, I guess, just to this point of the ride? And how
motivated are you guys to win a couple more games here and finish this out?  
JAYDE CHRISTOPHER: Very motivated for sure. We have a really good -- I have
really great teammates, really great coaches. So being able to play alongside
and underneath a great staff is just really fun. And it just makes basketball
a lot more easy, I would say.  
  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: Yeah.  
  
Q. A 'Shanti, I don't know if you realize but you got to be part of
Jayde's history today, while making history for yourself as well. Was the game
plan today to really stretch the floor and run against this team?  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: Yeah, I believe so. I mean that's one of our strengths with
our playing style. Everyone runs their lanes, two guards leak out, posts run
the floor. We have a point guard that's leaking the pass. I think that was
definitely part of our game plan.  
  
Q. Coach, I know back in Boise you were asked about A 'Shanti the other
day, but fourth straight game with 20-plus points, I think that's only
happened seven times in school history where a player has had four straight
20-plus games. This run she's on down the stretch here, what's this meant to
the team?  
COACH PRESNELL: It's raised us to another level because now people gotta worry
about slacking off Riley to take care of A'Shanti. And we stretch the floor so
well when she runs down the middle of it. And Mallory even fits pretty well
with A'Shanti because Mallory can hit the 3. So it's been pretty fun to see
this. I hope it keeps going. And hopefully we can have another good game
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. During the regular season, you guys have a couple days, sometimes up
to a week, to scout out a team and prepare. But in the tournament now that you
guys have won you have a quick turnaround where you play one of two possible
opponents the very next day. How is that different in terms of preparation?  
COACH PRESNELL: Sure. We kind of have an idea and we divide up our staff with
scouts and then one of them does personnel and one of them does like defense
and I kind of do the offensive part of it. We kind of come together. And I
don't know who will play tomorrow but the scouts are both prepared already and
we'll go over it with the team. I don't know if we'll watch film tonight with
the team. But like last night we did. And tomorrow we'll have practice and
watch film again and get ourselves ready and just kind of go through the same
routine, the same food, every single time. (Laughter).  
  
A'SHANTI COLEMAN: String beans.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: Same breakfast and same dinner. Don't want to get out of
whack.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Kathy Olivier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19395)

### [Rodjanae Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38807)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Jose State - 67, UNLV - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV Kathy Olivier and student-athlete Rodjanae
Wade.  
  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, you know for us, we just played San Jose State, and to
come back and turn around three days later and play them again, that was
tough. But our players were very determined, and they really wanted this one.
An incredible performance by R.J.  
  
She had just so much heart and so much drive and so much spirit the entire
game, in the huddles and grabbing all those rebounds. To have a 20/20
performance, I wish we could have been better for her. But you've got to give
it up for San Jose State. They did a really good job of hitting shots when
they needed to. And we just turned the ball over too many times and they took
advantage of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. R.J., you went out in the fourth quarter. Looks like you were clearly
frustrated. Did you feel like you had to almost carry the team on your back
today?  
RODJANAE WADE: Not really, I felt like we have a lot of weapons on our team. I
feel like at certain times I get frustrated with myself because of things I
feel like I could do better. But it's never, like, within the team because I
know that we'll come together and we'll make things work. So no.  
  
Q. And to get a 20/20 to end your college career -- I know you wanted a
win, but from a personal standpoint to go out like that, what does that mean
to you?  
COACH OLIVIER: It means a lot. It's big time, excuse me, but it's big time.
And it sucks that we didn't come out with the win. But it just feels good that
I was able to contribute and play for this team for four years.  
  
Q. If you look back at this season, what are some of the lessons that
both of you will take on this season and then moving forward into next year?  
RODJANAE WADE: So hopefully I get to take my career to the next level. So,
right now I just think about leadership and I know I'll be coming in as a
rookie or whatever. So just take the things that I learned from here, my
fundamentals, my happy spirit and try to just take it over to wherever I go
and make the best out of it.  
  
COACH OLIVIER: For the returners, I think obviously the coaches are going to
sit back and evaluate the season. But we think about player development and
how far R.J. has come, and for her to record back-to-back 20-20 performances
is incredible. Her first year she didn't play a lot, probably played five
minutes a game, if we look at the stats.  
  
She's come in as one of the top double-doubles in the country, which is
amazing. Hopefully our freshmen, we're going to talk about that with our
freshmen and how better she can get. With R.J., she played with a lot of
talented upperclassmen, and I thought R.J. paved the way for our freshmen to
see what it's about and to see how to play hard and play with that kind of
passion for UNLV and the Lady Rebels.  
  
When I think about it, I love our freshmen. We have eight new players. We're
super young. And we have four seniors that really did a good job of being good
leaders, like R.J. said. She takes away the leadership. She did a great job
being a leader along with TT, Haley and Mara.  
  
And for us it will be a new beginning. And I know R.J. will be right there.
She'll be texting just like these other people did. Today, I had Linda
Frohlich, who, I believe -- R.J. might have beat her double-double
performance, which is incredible. Linda Frohlich was one of the best players
in the country, let alone at UNLV.  
  
So for us, we're very proud of R.J. We know she's going to have a great
future. And we're proud of the people we have in our program. We had a great
little winning streak. We just need to know that the intensity and that kind
of drive and passion has to be there every day. We can't be inconsistent to be
a successful team.  
  
Q. San Jose State had over 20 turnovers as well. Did you feel like if
you cleaned things up on your end a little bit this is a game maybe that could
have been right there, a chance to win? If you cleaned it up on your end,
considering that they were pretty sloppy too?  
COACH OLIVIER: I thought our defense was good. I thought they were ready for
our defense. But they do a good job of playing fast. I didn't think that we
did a lot with their turnovers, where I felt they did a lot with our
turnovers.  
  
And they scored probably -- it says in here that they scored 29 points off our
turnovers. So that just kills us. We're not a team that's going to score a lot
of points. I was mad at R.J. for not getting a 30-30. She just got a 20-20.  
  
But we're a team that, we hang our hat on defense. We talk about it all the
time. I thought we were very active in that first quarter. But San Jose kind
of got used to it. And Jamie's done a great job with her team.  
  
And I think they're a team that's playing well right now. So we'll see what
happens. Anything happens in the Mountain West Conference tournament. Anything
happened all year. I thought this has been a very competitive season for the
women's Mountain West and it's been fun. You can't go into any game thinking
you're going to win. You have to go in ready to play no matter who you play.  
  
Q. Not just today, but coming down the stretch, where you leaned so
heavily on R.J., was that the issue, that other players probably didn 't come
through to maybe take pressure off her?  
COACH OLIVIER: You know, I actually said to our radio guy, Wyatt, I said, it's
kind of like the Michael Jordan; you know how people used to kind of just
watch, watch Michael Jordan play? I felt we were standing and waiting for R.J.
to make something happen with two or three people on.  
  
You can't do that. I love that R.J. said we have a lot of threats, which we
do. But we have to have better spacing. We have to move better without the
ball. And we know that and we did that at times this season but we just didn't
do it consistently. And that's something that coaches have talked about, just
our spacing and our ball movement along with our body movement.  
  
We've got to continue to move and our defense. It's one of the best in the
country. We're super proud of that. We played some really tenacious, gritty
defense all year. But we have to get better on the offensive end, and we all
know that.  
  
Q. R.J., Coach noted a little bit the struggles on offense. Anything in
particular that San Jose State did that took you out of any chance to get in a
rhythm?  
RODJANAE WADE: I would say they played a lot of pressure. They're really good
with clumping up on us and making it hard for us to see things, like, as far
as getting to the basket and stuff like that, as to where they're pretty
spaced out on their team.  
  
So they always have us spaced out on defense. But we don't know how to space
out enough to get them out of, like, the way. They're more of a clumped-up
team. So I feel like at times that was frustrating for us to find out what to
do and what moves to make, but we went through it.  
  
COACH OLIVIER: They collapsed. They play a lot of zone. And that's hurt us all
year. And then our defense, we're more -- we're going to play man and we're
going to be early digs. And San Jose liked that. They did a really good job.
Come on, Jamie's done an amazing job this year.  
  
I'm sure they're going to take care of her over at San Jose and for us we have
to get better at zones. It's been our bugaboo all season.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Gerald Mattinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38809)

### [Tereza Vitulova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38810)

### [Quinn Weidemann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38811)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 64, Utah State - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
  
COACH MATTINSON: Well, I take my hat's off to our women. We got down early.
Utah State played very well. I thought they came out, played very well. We
were able to come back and battle our way back into it in the second half. And
I'm so proud of the way these guys responded at halftime and the defensive
effort we had in the second half.  
  
You hold a team to five points in the third quarter and 20 for a half, that's
-- we held them the second half to fewer points than we gave up in the first
quarter but that's a credit to these guys and our team.  
  
So some things worked out. We didn't give up. And came away with a win
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Talking about how Utah State, they had that 16-point lead. I think a
lot of teams would have folded at that point, but you guys showed resilience
and came back. Could you talk about what the keys were to coming back to win
the game?  
COACH MATTINSON: All we did is talk about at halftime -- we just talked about
at halftime what we had to do was get back to the way we defend.  
  
To my team's credit, our team's credit, they've defended well all year. That's
kind of what we've laid, put our hat on or put our brand on. And we just
talked about -- all we have to do is in the third quarter go out and defend
the way that we defend. And if we could just cut it by six or seven points
then we're right where we need to be.  
  
And these guys responded to that. And then with that defensive effort,
obviously that led to some offensive spurts. That's what I took away from it.  
  
TEREZA VITULOVA: I agree with Coach, like, defense is a thing that get us
here, and we didn't execute the defense scout well in the first half. And then
after halftime we talk about what we need to get done, and what is going to
get us a win. And we executed well.  
  
QUINN WEIDEMANN: Basically what they said. I also think a big thing is, within
ourselves, we're, like, okay, let's take a deep breath, like, we got that
first half out of the way; the jitters whatever was going on. And then I think
we came back in the second half and played a lot more loose.  
  
Q. When they came out swinging, they kind of had that "team of destiny"
feel. Yesterday they became the first 11 seed to win a conference tournament
game. And they came out firing the way they did. Did that kind of catch you
off guard how well -- I think they shot 60 percent from the field in that
first half?  
QUINN WEIDEMANN: I think definitely in the first half it caught us a little
bit off guard. And, like, I don't think we executed our scout, our defensive
scout in the first half as well as we could have. But we fought back.  
  
TEREZA VITULOVA: Yeah, we knew that it was going to be a tough game because
it's a tournament time and everyone wants to get the best that we can. So I
just think they played really, really well the first half. But, also, like
they had a game yesterday, they were tired. And we knew that if we were going
to push the ball, defend, that we can get them. I think the most important
thing is we didn't give up.  
  
Q. Tereza, I think you made the first couple of baskets in the second
half, there was the 2 and then the 3. And Utah State 's coach said that was
kind of a turning point. You really kind of got you going. Did you feel that
was kind of big to get you started early there?  
TEREZA VITULOVA: Yeah, I think I didn't know what to do that much in the first
half because I didn't get that many balls or anything. And also we didn't
score that much in the first half.  
  
So I just thought about it and what I needed to get done what I needed to get
done the whole season, like shooting and stuff like this. And I think when I
scored the 3, I was, okay, I can do this, I have my teammates with me. And we
can get this done, yeah.  
  
Q. When you 're propelling a comeback the way you guys did, how
important was it to win the rebound margin and box out and grab those extra
possessions?  
TEREZA VITULOVA: Like the rebounding part, I think it's like one of the most
important parts in a game. Also, we're not the tallest team in the conference.
So we need to really, like, fight under the basket and get all the balls.  
  
And when it gets to crucial times like the rebounding, it's really important
because giving second chance to teams, it would push only down. But I think we
executed really well.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys get Boise State again. You guys split the two
regular season matchups. They obviously beat you in the championship game last
year. Just how emotional do you kind of expect that matchup to be tomorrow?  
COACH MATTINSON: We're going to show up and play. I mean, I don't look at
Boise State tomorrow as -- I don't care about last year. I don't care about
the other two games. I care about tomorrow.  
  
Can't speak for these guys. I hope they're the same way. That's what we've
talked about all year is we're going to do one game at a time, and we're going
to just try to get a little bit better each game.  
  
Hopefully this is a learning experience for us. But we won at home. They put
it pretty good on us at their place. That has nothing to do with what's going
to happen tomorrow or next year. And I don't know what's going to happen, but
we're going to show up and give it the best we have.  
  
TEREZA VITULOVA: Yeah, I think we cannot look at them like they're Boise
State. We need to look at them like they're the same players that we are.
Like, we're going to come up -- we're going to defend what we can defend. And
hopefully it's going to end up good for us.  
  
But it's going to be a battle from the beginning. And of course I think we
cannot do what we did today because tomorrow it will be much harder to come
back.  
  
QUINN WEIDEMANN: I think that we're a very different team than we were last
year. I think Boise is a different team than they were last year. I even think
we're a different team than we were at the beginning of the season. So, like
Coach said, it's a whole new game. The two times we played them before, it
kind of doesn't matter now.  
  
Q. You guys ended the regular season on a strong note and now you get
this first win in the tournament. Can you guys talk about how you 've been
able to take that momentum that you had in the regular season and use it now
towards heading into against Boise?  
COACH MATTINSON: I just think that these guys have bought into what we're
doing. It's hard at this level to play every night. It's hard to play defense.
Sometimes offensively we struggle. Everybody knows that.  
  
But what these guys have proven all year, game in and game out, especially
during the stretch, I think there was a couple of defining moments for this
group that's really helped them grow and will continue to help us not only
whatever happens tomorrow or the rest of the tournament but for all these
guys, both of these guys are young. They're going to be back.  
  
I think what happened to us at home against New Mexico, when New Mexico came
in and was able to get us in overtime, I think these guys bought in and that's
not going to happen again.  
  
You could see the pain on their faces as a team. And then we went in, with a
battle with CSU, a 43-40 battle where every possession was huge, they started
to believe even more and just have grown and grown. And to me that's the
process that we wanted to be at.  
  
I've said all year this is going to be a group, especially early, who we're
going to be able to beat somebody and they're going to go, wow, they beat them
and then maybe a week later they're going to turn around and go, oh, they lost
to them.  
  
But right now I told these guys all year long, you stick with us, you keep
working and stay on the plan, we will be playing our best when it's time. And
to our team's credit, that's what they've done and that's where we're at.  
  
Q. You guys have a pretty big fan base that came out to support you
guys, almost made it feel like a home game. Could you just talk about that?  
TEREZA VITULOVA: Yeah, our fans are amazing. They're coming to our games all
year long. They're supporting us. It doesn't matter if we win or lose, like,
they're always behind us and supporting.  
  
And I think the atmosphere they create is just amazing. And it feels like
we're playing at home, which is so important for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Amanda Levens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34803)

### [Miki'ala Maio](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38802)

### [Imani Lacy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38788)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 75, Nevada - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Nevada.  
  
COACH LEVENS: Just first congratulations to Fresno State. I thought they just
played a little better than we did today. Made some timely plays down the
stretch. And I think just showed why they were our conference champs this
year.  
  
From our team, I just didn't think we did quite enough to win, unfortunately.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I thought you had some big shots down the stretch to keep yourselves
in the game. Was it frustrating there at the end or did you just battle
through everything?  
IMANI LACY: I would say just being frustrated is not a good way to want to end
a game. So you always have to keep yourself, have good composure, I guess you
could say, and just battle it out to the end.  
  
MIKI'ALA MAIO: I'd say I'm just really proud of our team and how we still got
shots off at the end of regulation time. And we still executed our plays well
and our trapping well. But we were definitely frustrated.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it 's a tough turnaround like that, but I thought your
players gritted it out. You feel like you played as hard as you could and just
didn't fall right for you?  
COACH LEVENS: Yeah, I think the second half of the season I'm just really
proud of the way our team finally, I feel, like got it. They kind of got the
bigger picture of everything that goes into being a good team. And obviously
we had a great second half of Mountain West Conference.  
  
We started the first nine games really poorly, and it's tough to dig
yourselves a hole like that. I think if we could have been half as good as we
were in the second half, we finished in a higher place and you're not playing
the 1 seed in the second game of the tournament, maybe even earn a first-round
bye.  
  
But we only lose one place in our rotation, I think there's a lot of great
lessons for our team. By the end of the season, as a coaching staff, we really
liked our rotation and the way everyone was really committed to playing their
roles and doing a great job. And I feel like we had nine starters and
different people step up on different nights and make up for other people's
absences.  
  
And I think there's a lot of positives for us to build on. And going home this
early we'll have a lot of time to reflect have spring workouts and get a lot
better and hopefully be really hungry going into the next season.  
  
Q. You kept it pretty close the entire game. What were you seeing from
Fresno State both on the court and as a coach to kind of keep making those
shots you guys were making as time was winding down?  
COACH LEVENS: Did you say what was I seeing to help us keep making shots?  
  
For us we just wanted to try to move the ball against the zone. When we played
at Fresno the ball really stuck and we just didn't get a lot of movement
against it. And I feel like if we were able to cut in and out and make a lot
of passes in the half court, we would get a good shot eventually. And I think
we did. Also, with that it helped us offensively rebound.  
  
I thought in transition we were pretty aggressive too, and we were able to get
some good things going there. We work a lot on certain types of zone shots.
And both times we played Fresno State this year we didn't really shoot those
shots at a high percentage. That's disappointing from our aspect.  
  
And for our players, because they know those are shots we're capable of
making. And we just didn't do a good job either game of doing that.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Chris Gobrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30464)

### [Kaelin Immel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34802)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 73, Air Force - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force. Coach, general thoughts on tonight's
game?  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: Well, I thought Boise State played really, really well. It's
the best I've seen them play in a long time. And I think when you've got a kid
that shoots 20-something percent from 3 and she's burying 3s right and left,
you know you're in for a long time.  
  
But at the same time they should have -- that's a senior-dominated team. That
entire team is seniors playing a team that is predominantly sophomores and
freshmen.  
  
So I think they showed up and played like seniors, and we showed up and played
like the young kids that we are.  
  
But I also think -- and I think this is something that the Mountain West has
got to get figured out, because I felt we were really disadvantaged by the way
the scheduling goes.  
  
And we were on the road last Saturday. We were on the road last Monday. We
came back and played a game on Thursday. We played a game on Sunday. And then
we have to turn around and play a team like this that it's basically a track
meet on Monday and they haven't played since last Monday. They've been sitting
around eating bonbons while we've been chasing all over the country and
playing basketball games. And something like that has got to be figured out.  
  
Q. You mentioned you had success in the season. How do you reflect on
that success late in the year? I think it was six of the last nine games you
did win, obviously advance in the championship, did have some all conference
honorees. How do you reflect on that success in the league late in the year?  
KAELIN IMMEL: I think we've learned a lot through this year. I think having
predominantly freshmen and sophomores, getting the opportunity to play that
many minutes in all these games and having all these close games -- throughout
the season we've only -- all the games we've lost have been within 10 points
or so besides a few.  
  
And getting that experience and learning how to play through those close games
and finally coming out on top towards the end of the season has been really
beneficial for us. And I think we can take those experiences and learning how
to push through close games from those and take that into next season. And
hopefully we can start from the get-go knowing how to come out on top.  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: Yeah, I think one of the biggest disappointments for these
guys is that we have been extremely competitive in every game. This is only
the third game -- if you don't count Arizona State -- this is only the third
game that has not been -- less than double digits.  
  
If you took so many of those close games, and we get even half of them, we
potentially have a 16-, 17-win season that could take us into postseason play.
I think that's what we have to remember. I feel badly that this group and all
that they've accomplished had to end it that way because that's not the team
they are.  
  
When we've played Boise State the last two times, they've been very close
games. So I just feel badly that had to happen. But I do think it's also the
kind of thing that gets your attention maybe and has you a little bit more
dialed in during the offseason.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask about Boise State. You see what they do with the
combination they have inside and out and they 're all basically seniors and
veteran players. I know they didn't have the regular season they wanted, not
winning the league, but how good are they?  
COACH GOBRECHT: I think you saw tonight how good they are. That's a very, very
talented team that's been playing together for four years. Those kids have
been together for four years. And they're very skilled.  
  
I think Coleman had the game of her life. But I wasn't surprised, necessarily,
by anything that they were able to accomplish offensively. I was obviously
disappointed in us defensively. But I think they spent a lot of the year being
a little bit bored because they've been playing, they've been doing the same
thing for so long, and it sort of lost its luster a little bit for them.  
  
But now they're -- it's home stretch. I'd be shocked to tell you the truth if
-- not shocked, but I'd be a little surprised if they didn't win the whole
tournament.  
  
Q. You talked about the team being competitive all season long, outside
the Arizona State game. And even tonight, even though the score doesn 't
reflect it with the outcome, if you look at three of the four quarters, the
team was very competitive. It was just the second quarter that kind of got
away. Can you pinpoint anything that happened that quarter?  
COACH GOBRECHT: Yeah, Briana Autrey-Thompson got in foul trouble. That's what
happened. And unfortunately we had to turn to freshmen and it was just a
really tall order for those young kids.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Ben Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38793)

### [Hailey Bassett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38794)

### [Emmie Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38812)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 64, Utah State 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: I think you guys can see that we fought hard and that we
finished strong. We played our best basketball the last three games of the
season. And couldn't be more proud of our group for that. Obviously the seed
wasn't what we wanted at the start of the year, but we made the most of the
draw we got.  
  
And credit to our players. Two or three weeks ago we kind of had a turning
point and we just talked about how we needed to finish strong and finish on a
sprint. And many teams in that situation kind of fold it and go home and don't
respond in a positive way, and they're kind of ready for the season to get
over.  
  
That was not this group of girls and that speaks to their character. We made a
big push at the end. And we're disappointed to lose this one because we came
to win a championship and so the disappointment is there. We feel it deep.
It's a hard loss for us because we played so well.  
  
But at the same time there's a certain amount of pride that goes with it, too,
because of what we did yesterday and throughout the entire season.  
  
I thought Wyoming played really, really well. They're a good team. We knew
that going in. We got off to a good start. And that's obviously what we were
here to do. And then they responded. And we knew they would, but they've got a
lot of firepower and they made good plays and they're well-coached.  
  
And I thought they played great obviously in the second half. They just went
on a barrage on us and they're capable of doing that, and they did. And so
good job on them.  
  
Q. At halftime, with that big of a lead, what was the talk in the locker
room to plan what we were going to see in the third quarter?  
COACH FINKBEINER: The talk was basically we came here on a business trip and
we came here to win this game. And we didn't want to be in a position where we
felt like we were going to give it to Wyoming. We wanted to make sure that we
took it, and that we went out there and did everything that we needed to do
and everything that we could control, not just to hold the lead but extend the
lead.  
  
I thought leaving the locker room, I thought we were in a really good place.
And I thought the whole second half we were in a really, really good place.
But obviously the shots we hit in the first half we didn't make in the second
half. The shots that Wyoming hit in the first half, they made in the second
half. And that's sometimes how basketball goes.  
  
We didn't do anything particularly different. We didn't have any lower
intensity or anything like that. Just the shots kind of went differently,
which happens.  
  
Q. I think in that fourth quarter they scored the first 10 points there.
Especially in the second half Vitulova had 16 of her 19 or whatever. What was
it specifically that kind of caused that barrage to start the fourth? And what
was Vitulova able to do that she wasn 't able to do in the first half?  
COACH FINKBEINER: If I remember right they went to her the first play in the
second half of the block and that really got her going. And then she had the
ball on the perimeter. We didn't close out the way we wanted to close out
because of her 3-point percentage. We obviously know she can shoot the ball.
We closed out a little bit short and a little bit late, and that one dropped.  
  
And a player like that, if you give her a low block position and she scores
it, and then if you give her an open 3 and she scores it, then things start to
kind of roll.  
  
But what makes them so tough to guard is who are you going to help off of. You
go up and down their stat page and there's nobody that you can really show
help for. So you need to play team defense, but ultimately you have to leave
something open. And in those situations, we left her open, which wasn't a
decision of ours, it just happened that way.  
  
And obviously she took that opportunity and went with it. And obviously there
was a reason why she's their leading scorer and leading rebounder and all the
stuff that she's done this year. She's incredible.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for a game like this with such a short turnaround?
And I know you touched on it already but what was working for you guys in the
first half?  
COACH FINKBEINER: The preparation obviously is short. It's late night for
coaches. The preparation we've got to do as coaches is stay up all night long.
And we wrestle with scouting reports and watch film and we're short on rest
and we get tired.  
  
And the opposite is true for players. We rest the players. They go to sleep
and they rest in the morning and early afternoon and they turn around and go.  
  
At this point in the year anybody in the conference would say that we have
scouting reports on everybody already, seeing everybody twice. And so it was a
fairly simple straightforward scouting report for us just because we played
them three weeks ago or two weeks, whatever it was.  
  
We didn't execute when we were at Wyoming the way we wanted to. We said if we
do what we were supposed to do at Wyoming, if we actually do it the way we've
been coached to do it then we should get a different result. And I think we
saw that. We just played better here than the last time we saw them.  
  
The preparation is all about rest for our players and being mentally ready.
And the conversation we had at the start, when we were talking about
preparation was we've already played a game at Thomas & Mack and what we've
got to do is we have to start where we finished.  
  
Hailey hit a game-winning shot. We have to start where we finished. It's not a
new game; we keep this thing going. And we did that. And Wyoming came out a
little hesitant, which we expected, and of course they came back in a hurry
because they're so good, obviously.  
  
Q. With the past couple of games and you mentioned that you 've been at
the season with a lot of tenacity, how do you reflect on the season?  
HAILEY BASSETT: Reflecting on the season, obviously it hasn't gone the way we
wanted it to go. But we went into the tournament wanting to finish strong and
I feel like our chemistry as a team has gotten stronger and stronger. And I
think that's what made us come out this tournament. And didn't end like we
wanted it but I'm still proud of our team.  
  
EMMIE HARRIS: I think these past two games have really reflected on what we
really can do as a team and how we're capable of playing and the fight that we
have. And to be the first 11 seed team to win a first-round was amazing. And
we came out in the first half and showed we can play with anybody in this
conference.  
  
And I know we did it for our seniors and especially for Marlene since she was
out, and especially since she was out the last two games and for us to play
like that.  
  
I know it hurts to have her out but it shows how capable we are and how our
past games haven't really reflected how we can play. So I'm really proud of us
and the accomplishments we've made this season.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: For me, I'll remember this team. It's my first year as head
coaching. So it will always be something that I hold close to my heart because
of what these young ladies did for me.  
  
We had some unique situations with the associate head coach and then into an
interim sort of role and then losing the games early on and then an ACL at the
end. It's been an interesting year. So you remember all those little things.  
  
But most young ladies going through a season like that don't respond the way
that we responded in the end. And it speaks to the character of the young
ladies that we recruit at Utah State. It speaks to our coaching staff.  
  
My dad, Coach Fink, on in to all the assistant coaches through the years that
I've been with, it speaks to the recruiting job and it speaks to these young
ladies and the character they have to compete like this to the end given the
unique situations. So of course I'll always remember that because each one of
them obviously means so much to me.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 2, 2020

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Fieme'a Hafoka](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38805)

### [Ayzhiana Basallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38806)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Jose State - 67, UNLV - 48  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I thought an excellent defensive effort by our group, maybe
not as good offensively. But it's nice we get to play tomorrow and maybe fix
that. But great effort by our kids. I thought we showed up when we needed to.
We hit shots when we needed to, got rebounds when we needed to.  
  
It's tough to beat a UNLV team. I've got a lot of respect for R.J. Wade over
on that side. She's a tremendous player. And we're excited to be moving on.  
  
Q. You were pretty tight first and second quarter but started to pull
away third and fourth quarter. What adjustments did you make at halftime to
allow yourselves to get that separation?  
AYZHIANA BASALLO: We had to play harder and play our game. Defensively we were
kind of missing something, so we just adjusted to that.  
  
FIEME'A HAFOKA: I think also we just limited, like, their offensive rebounds.
I think we just played, like she said, harder on defense. And we just played
together and locked down when we needed to.  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: We shot it well enough, obviously, too. And we were a little
bit more aggressive in the second half. We looked a little bit tight in the
first quarter, like you said. And that's just tournament time. It's March;
everybody knows what's on the line.  
  
They settled in and played their game and got a little bit more people
involved. Megan Anderson hits some big shots, and when she hits shots it takes
the pressure off everybody else.  
  
Q. You had four players score in double digits. Could you talk on how
huge it was to have balanced scoring in this game?  
AYZHIANA BASALLO: It's nothing new for us. All of us can score the ball pretty
well. So we're just playing together and getting everybody shots and everyone
just doing what they've got to do.  
  
FIEME'A HAFOKA: Also just hitting, like, the shooter who is on fire. For
example, Megan, when she's wide open, give the ball to her, or whoever is on
fire, give them the ball; they'll hit it.  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: We talked about ball movement and getting everybody involved.
I thought in the second half we did a better job of that. Ayzhiana got going a
little bit. I think obviously Ty can play better than that, and she was
frustrated. But she had some big baskets in the second half for us as well.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, a little over 24 hours from now you guys will be back
on the court playing again. How do you prepare mentally and physically to have
that quick turnaround? And then it 's going to be your third meeting with
Fresno State. How do you guys prepare for that third meeting as well?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I mean, we've been mentally and physically preparing for this
all year. And we're excited for the chance to play Fresno State.  
  
They're our rival. They're our in-state rival. They're not far from us. But
we've had two heck of good games against them and it's been just both teams
battling. We're excited to get them again. I know these guys will be ready.
There's no time to be tired. No time to be injured.  
  
They play a lot of minutes. Their kids do. They're going to gut it out; we're
going to gut it out. I think it's going to be a great basketball game.  
  
Q. Going back to the defense in the second half, it was a 25-3 run over
ten minutes in the second half. How does it feel to put together a good
defensive performance like that against a newly awarded Defensive Player of
the Year on the same court?  
AYZHIANA BASALLO: I think we are one of the best defensive teams in the
Mountain West. I'm not sure how the voting goes, but I know that Tyra
Whitehead is a great defensive player. I think we have the best one in the
conference.  
  
FIEME'A HAFOKA: I think the same thing, what she said. Numbers don't lie. If
you look back, you see the numbers, compare them, I mean that's all I can say
for it. But I think just defensively, if we lock down together as a team, play
together, I think we can do big things.  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Our game goal was to hold them under 50. So as a coach, I'm
really proud of their defensive effort. We know that R.J. is going to score,
and we kind of try and take everybody else away. But Ty put up some terrific
numbers this year. Kudos for to Bailey Thomas for getting that award. But we
think our defense is good and we think we can play with anybody.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2020

  

### [Ryun Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25027)

### [Makenzie Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38791)

### [Andrea Brady](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38792)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 60, Colorado State - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Colorado State.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Just didn't play well. Air Force really came out in that first
quarter and had a big quarter. I think four 3-pointers in that first quarter.
It really kind of set the tone positive for them, not so positive for us. And
just could really never get anything going. So for whatever reason, one of
those nights, but obviously needed to play better. Not a good time to not play
well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You 've played Air Force before; you know they're not a strong
3-pointing team. How much shock value was there to hitting four, five, in the
first quarter and especially their first two shots?  
ANDREA BRADY: I mean, obviously, like Coach said, it just allowed them to have
a strong start to the game. And it was hard to come back from that 15-point
deficit that we had at the half.  
  
Q. Did you look at this game as something (indiscernible)
uncharacteristic? They did some things well that they don 't normally do; you
did some things not so well that you normally do?  
MAKENZIE ELLIS: Yeah, I think those players that shot a lot of those 3s have
that low percentage, so we did take that gamble. But we also had assignments
that we missed that we could have done better defensively. And those are
things that I think would have evened us out in the first half.  
  
Q. Your shooting improved immensely from the first quarter to the third.
Was there a specific message going into halftime?  
MAKENZIE ELLIS: Yes, personally I know I got together with the team and I said
we have to play together. I think the first half we played very separate and
very individualized. And, so, playing together, that's what got us those
really good shots. And that's what pushed us, I think, to start to come back
in that second half.  
  
Q. Although this wasn 't the result you were looking for is there
anything you can look back on the beginning of the season and think, wow,
we've really improved on this looking at today's game?  
ANDREA BRADY: We kind of talked about it in the locker room after the game. It
was a tough year, and like Coach said, we lost a lot of games within two to
five points, and it's hard to just come back and keep competing. But this
group did that every night. It was a tough year but a fun year.  
  
Q. Obviously not the outcome you want but when you look back at the
season, five years from now what are you going to remember about this year?  
MAKENZIE ELLIS: I think the biggest thing I'm going to remember, this was my
favorite year to play. I got only one year here, but I had a great time. The
girls are -- that's what I'm going to remember, that's what I'm going to take
away, and know that I actually had fun playing basketball and got to know
these people. And Coach Williams is phenomenal giving me this opportunity. And
those are the things I'm going to remember.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys have a game plan for a reason and it 's based off past
results. How stunning is it when it kind of backfires that way?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It kind of did that first quarter. There's some unexpected 3
balls go in, or what have you, but that isn't what really hurt us. I mean, it
was -- we could not get any rhythm offensively.  
  
Still, at the end of the day, you hold the team to 60 points and you still
can't -- we cannot muster any offense. That's just been a huge, huge struggle
for us here the latter part of the season.  
  
And we just got our wheels spinning the wrong way and it's just been hard for
us to go on big runs and that sort of thing.  
  
So -- but give Air Force credit. Those kids made plays. And then we let Immel
kind of get going a little bit. And then Snyder got going a little bit. And
the kids that were supposed to be dedicated to, they got into some rhythm. We
kind of got hit from all angles for most of the night.  
  
Q. When you looked back, if you looked at the first half they had 12
offensive rebounds. You had 14 total. Is that really more of the story?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think the two things there in that first half, the offensive
rebounds, absolutely, were crucial. They just crashed and we did not answer
that.  
  
And then the turnovers, I think we had nine first half turnovers. So you give
them so many extra possessions and they converted a fair amount of those. And,
thus, the big lead there at halftime.  
  
Q. Talking about that, the assists were pretty much lopsided for that
first half. You came out with four more in the second half versus the first
half -- you had one registered assist. What was the difference going from
first half to second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We tried to drive the ball a little bit in that first half and
obviously didn't make those plays. Second half we just played some ball
reversal and moved our bodies a lot better and kind of went to more of a
little passing game.  
  
And you make some shots. I mean, let's face it; you'll have more assists when
you make some baskets. And I think our top guards went 4-of-19 tonight. We got
a double-double out of our posts again. Our posts have been pretty solid all
year. We needed to be better in the guard play and just didn't get that done.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about the things you didn 't like to see from your
team today, but what specifically did Air Force do that made them tough?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Air Force really competed. They crashed the glass. They played
very physical and they played with great intent and great purpose. They really
did. They really played to win, not that we didn't, but they did a better job
of it.  
  
And I think Immel's a really good guard. I think she kind of gets going, we
stat some things. They had some how many banks did they have tonight? I mean
nine points maybe on -- just how it goes sometimes.  
  
Q. When you look at the third quarter, Makenzie scores 10. Does that
epitomize why you added her one year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Makenzie has been so good for us in a lot of ways. You can see
she's a special young lady and brought great maturity to our roster. And
obviously very competitive. And so it doesn't surprise me she was going to go
out guns a blazing. And she had a really good third quarter.  
  
I'm proud of our seniors. They can walk away with their heads held high. They
gave it a great try. They gave us their very best. Yeah, you always want more,
but they gave us their best. And it's nice to have Makenzie here for one year,
absolutely.  
  
Q. Like you said, you always want a little bit more. You look at Annie,
two more offensive rebounds, so she climbs up but she falls one short of total
rebounds to finish in the top 10.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Annie, she has a tremendous competitive mindset. She has a
great motor. She really fights and wants to go get the basketball. And, so, it
would have been nice to move and advance just for Annie Brady because she's
been such a warrior for our program. And coming back from that knee injury,
she fought like crazy in that rehab to get back to playing this year.  
  
So it was -- it's tough when seniors don't have a really positive experience
in this tournament. But Annie was a special player for us.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 81, San Diego State - 79 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with San Diego State University.  
  
COACH TERRY-HUTSON: Well, this one really hurt. I thought both teams played
extremely hard, obviously wanting to get the victory to survive and advance.
It was a back and forth game, a good college basketball game. And I thought
our kids showed a lot of grit, getting ourselves into a position to get back
into the game when they went on that run and to get us to a position to win.
So a lot of big shots made by both teams.  
  
And this hurts. Obviously our expectation was to come in here and compete for
a conference championship. I thought we were very confident. I know we were
very confident because we had played so many close games and played our
conference opponents so close. We've talked how wide open this race is this
year. I think the Mountain West has stepped up the level of competition, and I
think it's going to be an exciting tournament.  
  
But I just am proud of these kids and I thought they played hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I know it 's a little bit of seeing the forest through the trees for
the moment, but how do you guys reflect on this season and what you've
accomplished this year?  
SOPHIA RAMOS: This season was definitely something special, and I'm so happy
to be part of it. The coaching staff really put a lot of trust and had high
hopes for us. And I think we lived up to a lot of the hype of San Diego State
women's basketball.  
  
We have great leaders from our seniors. Taylor came in and shocked the
conference. I think she might have gotten robbed a little bit for sure.
Monique came in, did big things for us. And everyone just played their role.  
  
This season was something huge for us, I can't wait to come back next year
with a great coaching staff and great team and go ahead and upset some others
this time next year.  
  
COACH TERRY-HUTSON: When we look back on this season it's going to be -- the
word we keep using is "growth". Our seniors have really pushed the needle and
changed the culture of this program. We have leadership in our locker room.
Our young people have also stepped up in so many different ways. We've done a
lot of good things for the program this year. And I know sometimes it's not
always reflected in our record, but this felt good. This felt good, obviously
this year.  
  
We've had some adversity with some of our players going down. And we've had
opportunities for others to step up. And it played out like it should.  
  
I'm so proud of Monique and what she was able to do. She filled a big void for
us this year. Sophia and Taylor were consistent all season, being the go-to
guards.  
  
We had two kids, obviously, on the all-conference team, so we're very proud of
that. And I thought Kennedi has accepted her role and was huge for us today.
Had some great defensive possessions and actually scored the ball for us,
which is always just gravy on top of it. But she did -- we got a lot still
coming back in this locker room. And they're going to be hungry and ready to
compete next season. But we're going to miss our seniors because they
definitely helped push the needle.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how coming into this game a big part of what you
guys wanted to do was get production from the bench. You got 21 points and a
big spark from Kennedi. And large part of that, she had a new career high in
points and rebounds and also tied her career high in steals. Could you just
talk about the contributions that you got from your bench today?  
COACH TERRY-HUTSON: I think it goes back to what we were talking about, our
culture. These kids have bought into what we're trying to sell. And Kennedi
Villa, whose role has just changed -- she's just one of the pieces to this
puzzle, they never complained. They always just put their head down and work.
And it's nice to see some of their hard work pay off.  
  
I mean, these are great kids. I love this team. They're good people. So this
is so much bigger than basketball for us. It's being able to be part of
something, and sometimes you don't always get rewarded like some of our stand-
out guards do. But like Monique and Isabela and Kennedi Villa and some kids
off the bench who continued to work and filled roles for us, it just shows
what this program is about.  
  
Q. The start to this game was kind of shaky one for both teams. Was that
just a good defensive matchup that we saw, or was it a mix of a little bit of
nerves or --  
SOPHIA RAMOS: I think it might have been a little bit of nerves for both
teams. We had the late game so we're staying in the hotel kind of bunched up
all day kind of anxious and ready to play.  
  
I think it was just nerves for sure. Just looks like it hurt us a little more
at the beginning than it hurt them. Like Coach said, we put ourselves into a
position to succeed and win. Just one basket better.  
  
Q. In the second half you guys really made a push and you guys were able
to outscore them in the third and fourth quarter. What can you say about the
fight that this team just has where you guys were down by as much as 15 and
forcing it to overtime and being in another one of those close games?  
MONIQUE TERRY: I think it was just defensive mistakes on our part. I feel like
we knew what it took to win, but we just were making defensive mistakes that
we knew we could have done better at. I just feel like we just made too many
mistakes at this time.  
  
TAYLOR KALMER: We know how to fight. We've been in that position quite a bit
of times in overtime. We've been there. We've done that. Sometimes it just
turns the other way and unfortunately that's happened to us quite a few times.
But we always knew how to fight and we kept pushing game after game, practice
after practice. And that showed in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach has talked about how each of you have contributed in a certain
way, a type of leadership to the locker room. Is there anything that you guys
had said initially when you went to the locker room to kind of motivate your
teammates to keep their heads up and stay positive?  
TAYLOR KALMER: Naomi told Mo and Baylee to keep their heads up. And there's a
lot of love in that locker room and a lot of support from the coaching staff
and from the rest of the team, knowing that a lot of these younger girls have
more opportunities coming and to just take what they've learned from us and to
keep that going and to keep the culture strong because right now it's at a
great spot.  
  
MONIQUE TERRY: I don't really think anything had to be said after this game
for everyone else to know what to do next time. I feel like we felt this one
hard. So I feel like next year they're going to ball everything up and just
take it next year and run with it and run with it hard.  
  
I'm not going to be surprised with everyone coming back and the coaching staff
coming back, I'm not going to be surprised if we surprise everybody.  
  
SOPHIA RAMOS: I think we had some great leadership this year. A lot of what
helped us and a lot that helped me was when I got down on myself, Taylor and
Te'a were the first ones to come over grab my hand, look me in the eye and
say, you're good -- positive attitude. That's all you can ask for from great
teammates like them.  
  
From the top-down, the coaching staff, they're everything. This is a staff I
will go to war for and I know they have my back and I'm excited for next year
with them. We have some great leadership. It's going to be a good year next
year. I'm really sad to see our seniors go, and I hate to see it go out like
this. But they were great. They were great to be a part of. I'm tremendously
happy to have had them by my side.  
  
COACH TERRY-HUTSON: We haven't talked at all about Utah State. I just want to
say this. I thought they played a great game. Made big shots after big shots.
Coach did a good job putting them in a position to win. And like I said, I
just can't speak enough about the coaches is in this league. So many close
games. So many upsets.  
  
It was just -- just stinks to be on this side of it, but I thought they played
a really good game. And Bassett was just one basket better than us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you told me that coming into this one that the one thing to
watch out for in Utah State was their 3-point shooting. And they were -- they
made 11 on the night. Could you talk about what was difficult, I guess, to
sort of match up against their shooting from deep?  
COACH TERRY-HUTSON: Right. I didn't think we did a good job taking away the
3-point line tonight. Our defense wasn't what it needed to be and hasn't been
of late. We've done a good job -- I think we're first or second in the
conference in 3-point field goal percentage. And that obviously didn't show up
tonight.  
  
We did some uncharacteristic things tonight. And when we go back and watch
this they'll see we just made too many errors to come out on top.  
  
We didn't do a good job there. And I thought those uncharacteristic plays
really put us behind the 8-ball and we were playing catch-up the entire time.
We did a good job getting ourselves back into the game, I thought. But
sometimes it's just challenging.  
  
I thought we should have had a better game plan and executed defensively a
little better in the first half. Tonight our offense was pretty good. Anytime
you could score 79 points you put yourself in a position to win -- but you
just can't give up 81, not in this league, and expect to win.  
  
Q. You guys had another positive trend to sort of end a regular season
on a good note, on winning the rebound margin. And tonight you guys had 49
rebounds, being able to get 16 offensively. Could you talk about what you guys
did collectively to put yourselves in position to just box out and grab those
boards?  
TAYLOR KALMER: It's been an emphasis this whole season, especially with teams
who crash a little bit more and their guards crash. So I mean that's something
that we worked on quite a bit. And made sure that we had that nailed down.  
  
KENNEDI VILLA: Like TK said, rebounding has been an emphasis this whole
season. We watch a lot of film on rebounding, and when we see ourselves not
rebounding it's pretty embarrassing. So I think we tried to be more mindful
and (indiscernible) a couple girls on there that got a lot of rebounds. So I
think that was an area we tried to focus on a lot more today.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2020

  

### [Amanda Levens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34803)

### [Imani Lacy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38788)

### [Da'Ja Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38789)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 74, New Mexico - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada head coach Amanda Levens and student-
athletes Imani Lacy and Da'Ja Hamilton.  
  
COACH LEVENS: We knew it was going to be a battle. Our game at their place
this year, we never were really in the game. We didn't play very well and they
played extremely well. And at our place it was really back and forth and we
just kind of found a way to win.  
  
And we knew today was going to be pretty similar to that. Obviously they have
some really great senior players that you feel for those players when their
season ends.  
  
But I'm just really proud of our team. I thought Imani and Da'Ja did a
phenomenal job stepping up today and Amaya West rebounding and Nia Alexander
rebounding in the second half. I just thought a lot of different individual
people stepped up and did really great things at the right time for our team,
which is what you need to do at this time of year.  
  
Q. Imani, could you take us through your performance -- 20 points, 17
rebounds? How did you feel out there?  
IMANI LACY: I feel great because, one, we won; two, it was for the team. Like,
yeah, my personal performance was good, but at the end of the day it all comes
down to what I did for the team. And I think that that's, like, my overall
energy like, I did it for the team and we're here and another night.  
  
Q. And, Da 'Ja, for you guys it was a close game throughout. You were
down a little bit there throughout the third quarter. What did it take for you
guys to find the will to win?  
DA'JA HAMILTON: We kind of just stayed together and we found a way to win.
When times got rough we stayed together. We hustled, we executed well and we
kept people in front and we didn't foul.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about these two and their performances today?  
COACH LEVENS: Imani's performance, I almost spit my water out -- I didn't know
she had so many rebounds, just an incredible performance. And last game at San
Diego State, we were really on Mar and Imani that they needed to play better
for us to win. And we just challenged them. They both need to be close to a
double-double for us to be competitive in games.  
  
And Mar, she really struggled today because she was in foul trouble and never
got in the flow of the game. And Imani basically goes and gets two double-
double by herself.  
  
And I just think for her to respond to that type of challenge, I know my buddy
is struggling and she's not able to play a lot because of foul trouble -- for
her to go and rebound like that, it was an amazing individual performance.  
  
Like she said, she understands that she needs to do that for our team to win.
And she understood how important it was to rebound against Jordan Hosey
because she's one of the best rebounders in our conference. And I thought we
did a good job trying to make it hard for her to get second shots.  
  
And Da'Ja, just amazing, like, shooting the ball from 3, making free throws,
making plays -- and I know she's upset about turnovers, but I thought she
hustled back on those things and she tried to make it hard for them
defensively, and she has her hands full guarding their really good guards. And
I thought she played really well on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. Coming into this tournament as the No. 8 seed, with such a young
squad, what does it do for the team 's confidence to win today's game and look
forward to the quarterfinals?  
COACH LEVENS: I think they definitely believe in themselves, but when you
actually have results when you believe in yourself, I think it just builds on
that. And we've had kind of a really -- our season has been interesting. We
struggled the first half of Mountain West, only won two games, then kind of
went on a terror in the second half and won four straits and five of six. And
then we finished 0-3. And we have been really up and down.  
  
And I think in all those games our team really believes they're going to win,
but just having the discipline to do things consistently to help us win is
another thing. But coming down here on a neutral court and just give it their
all and see what happens, I'm proud of them.  
  
We talked about, like, enjoying this opportunity. I feel like teams that have
a lot of seniors, they start to get, like, a great sense of urgency when
they're at this time of year. And we've talked to them about not waiting until
you're a senior to have that kind of urgency because nothing is guaranteed.
There's no guarantee you'll be back in Vegas and playing in another Mountain
West Conference tournament, so make this one the best one you could possibly
make it.  
  
Q. Da 'Ja, knowing that your performance as a team was not what you
wanted the first time you played New Mexico this year, but at home you had a
tough hard-fought overtime victory. Was there anything that surprised you
today in the game against New Mexico or was the game plan perfect for what you
did in the overtime win?  
DA'JA HAMILTON: I knew that was, like, when we played them at home, it was the
first time ever beating them. I knew they were going to try to play harder and
compete.  
  
So I thought this game was going to be like this is a rivalry game to an
extent. We were going back and forth, just a lot of competition and playing
hard.  
  
Q. Same question for you, Imani. But also you were such a dominant force
on the boards tonight. What gave you that power in the middle just to be able
to take over the game?  
IMANI LACY: I would say I just saw the ball, went to go get it. Saw the ball,
went to go get it. So I just know that rebounding is always a pressure that is
put on to me and this game I did the job.  
  
Q. Coach Bradbury referred to how tough your defense was today and made
it hard on them. Was there something different you did tonight?  
COACH LEVENS: No. For us, we've been on our team to play better defense for
much of the season. And even for us I feel like we can even get better at it.
But again, like with our team, the discipline to do things right every single
time and obviously we started that first quarter. And I thought we let them
play to their strengths. And they're a good team. They have really good guards
that can score one-on-one. And we did not do a good job on them. We settled in
after that, did a great job.  
  
And with our young team, we're trying to get them to understand that if you
want to be a really good team, you do it start to finish; you don't have those
let-ups and don't have those lapses. And for us, we need to start games
stronger and that's been an emphasis for us, especially recently.  
  
And I think against Fresno, that's a huge key if we come out, let them jump us
on early, they're a team that's really explosive offensively. If we get down
early, it will be hard. We'll talk a lot about our defense tonight, trying to
start stronger, do a better job especially than we did the last time we played
at their place.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2020

  

### [Chris Gobrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30464)

### [Kaelin Immel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34802)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 60, Colorado State - 48  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: I think the fast start had everything to do with us getting
that win. Colorado State is an outstanding defensive team and we've struggled
so much to score against them. I think that's the first time we've had over 50
points against them.  
  
So us being able to come out and hit some shots early, it just made you feel
like, hey, everything's going to be okay. And then we continued to defend
really tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of hitting big shots early, how did hitting those
big shots early build confidence and set the tone for the game?  
KAELIN IMMEL: I don't know, like, when you hit shots you feel good about
yourself. It makes you play harder on defense. It makes you get in passing and
makes you do all the extra things that make you feel good. And I think
starting off well, hitting from 3 just gave us that extra boost to be able to
play harder.  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: This team, these guys have been doing some great things for a
couple of months now. And statistically I've been fairly pleased with how
we've been playing. It's just been tough for us to get over the hump.  
  
I don't know how many close games we've lost. And so in that early going, we
were getting the possessions. We were outrebounding people. We were forcing
turnovers all the time and getting the hustle points, just doing so many
things.  
  
At no point was I necessarily upset with how they were playing. We just knew
we had to start clicking a little bit offensively. And that happened in
February. We started to click offensively and we haven't looked back since.  
  
Q. You know that this season has had a lot of lows and now you 're
turning the county, you're on a three-game win streak, and, Kaelin, you're
back in the quarterfinals for the second time in your career. How do you keep
this going and how do you look forward to moving into the next game?  
KAELIN IMMEL: Honestly being that we've never been here as a group motivates
us to play harder and feel more confident in ourselves. And I think, honestly,
going into that unknown with such a young group of players, knowing that we
could be here next year, too, gives us that extra boost of confidence to just
trust each other and do everything we can to make a run here.  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: This team's been good because everybody's been doing their
job. And they've taken a tremendous amount of accountability for getting some
things figured out. And I'm just so proud of how far they've come. But it's
totally them.  
  
We were the same coaches back in November that we are today. And these guys
took it on themselves to get some things squared away, and they've done an
incredible job and we're really proud of them.  
  
And this is a really special Boise State team, very talented, has had a lot of
success, almost all seniors. It's just a huge challenge to play them, but it's
the kind of challenge you can get pretty excited about, especially since I
think we all know this is our last chance to play against this particular
Boise State team.  
  
Q. Less than 24 hours from now you 'll be back on the court playing
Boise State. How do you prepare for that quick turnaround and for the
challenge of playing the No. 2 seed?  
COACH GOBRECHT: That's what we were talking about. We're trying to figure out,
this room, this hotel room I have happens to have a big jacuzzi right in the
middle of my room. I'm not sure why. But, so, I'm thinking how many of them I
could put in there to have an ice bath or something.  
  
We definitely are concerned about their legs being fresh, especially since
Boise State. This is one of the things I sure we could get figured out in the
conference. We just played three games during the time that Boise State has
played no games. And the last game they played was last Monday. And we played
on Thursday. We played on Sunday -- well I take it back, two games in the time
that they've played no games. We also played on Monday, then played Thursday
and then played yesterday. And they haven't played since Monday because their
bye happened to come at the end of the year.  
  
We'll see how much of an advantage that is, but in terms of being fresh it's
going to be an advantage.  
  
KAELIN IMMEL: I do think being cadet at the Air Force Academy gives you that
ability to push through adversity and push through just being tired and tough
times like that.  
  
So I think us knowing how to do that, having that mental toughness will be
able to push us through being tired, maybe having no legs, stuff like that. So
I think we'll be ready. And I think it's really just how tough are you.  
  
COACH GOBRECHT: I do think that the one advantage to having played is our
elbows are a little sharper right now just because we've been competing and
they haven't been. So I think there's that tradeoff.  
  
But Kaelin's right; there's not much that fazes these guys. We had them walk
back from the restaurant last night to the hotel, and we didn't realize how
far it was. It was lot further than we thought it was.  
  
So they hiked all the way back, and I was thinking, oh, my golly, I shouldn't
have done that. I should have had the bus come pick us up. And then I thought,
no, it's like when they go back and forth to the dorms on the hill. It's about
the same distance, so we're good.  
  
Q. You also outrebounded them on the offensive end 6-to-18. That 's
triple at this point. How did getting those offensive boards help maintain
your momentum and make sure that Colorado State didn't really creep back in?  
COACH GOBRECHT: Well, offensive boards are always a little bit of a back-
breaker, when a team is -- we don't want it to happen to us and we know how
much it can affect the other team when they've worked so hard to stop you and
then they get another possession.  
  
It's huge for us to have those possessions, particularly against a team that's
as good on defense as Colorado State is. It was huge to winning the game, for
sure.  
  
KAELIN IMMEL: I think we've come to understand how important those rebounds
are. And we've made that emphasis and we've decided that we're going to be the
team that goes and gets those. And I think that's what's helped us turn the
corner here.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 1, 2020

  

### [Ben Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38793)

### [Hailey Bassett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38794)

### [Steph Gorman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38795)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 81, San Diego State - 79 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: We wanted to show up here to Las Vegas playing our best
basketball. And I think our girls did that tonight. We competed really hard.
We hit shots obviously when we needed to. And our team was just really focused
and just really into it the last two days. And I feel like our best product
that we can put out happened tonight. And obviously we want to continue that
throughout the tournament as well. I thought San Diego State also put a great
product on the floor. When you see a women's basketball game that high a
level, obviously it's a very exciting thing, in March, to see two teams
fighting into overtime.  
  
Their seniors and all of their players made big shots when they needed to and
they forced us to play at an extremely high level. And we had an opportunity
to have the ball at the end. And obviously Hailey hit a big-time shot for us.
And we just needed that. San Diego State made a lot of really good plays and
they had a great season, obviously.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I want to ask about Emmie Harris ' night, what you thought of her
night. She played almost the whole game and looked like she was instrumental
in most areas of the court. What do you think of her performance tonight?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Good observation, great observation. Emmie played a lot of
minutes tonight and she played at multiple positions and she hit shots in the
first half that were huge for us, when we talk about getting a 15-point
cushion, I think it was, in the second half. Emmie hit shots when we needed
her to because instead of playing tight and instead of coming in and not
performing very well, I thought Emmie kind of led the charge for from the
start in area of toughness. And throughout the game, whether she was playing
point guard or 2 guard, the girl executes exactly what we want to do.  
  
When you see shots like Hailey's go in and you see shots like Steph hitting
shots, there's girls like Emmie and Taylor, and Lindsey obviously hit shots,
but it takes all those girls to execute what they do. And Emmie is right there
on the top of the list of girls that understand what we are trying to do.
Sometimes she doesn't get the praise for it, but, man, the big minutes is
huge. And we haven't even talked about defense yet. She was unbelievable on
that end as well.  
  
Q. Hailey, with the game-winning shot, the clutch free throws at the end
as well, battling through four fouls, what kind of mentality do you have to
have to play your game, play physical but not too physical at the same time?  
HAILEY BASSETT: Honestly, it was really scary. Going into the third quarter I
was -- with four fouls, I was kind of, like, not trying to get another foul,
obviously, because I wanted to play in the game.  
  
But I just kind of focused more on not -- because every time I go up to block
a shot I always -- Coach always says I wind because I want to block it. So
this time I had to kind of control myself. And I had Steph here controlling
me, grabbing my jersey, saying Hailey, no, stop. So I just kind of -- it was
more of a mental thing. So I tried to stay in the game for as long as I could
and tried to do my best.  
  
Q. So for the first time in Mountain West women 's championship history
you guys have moved on to the quarterfinals, the 11 seed. How are you feeling
right now, for Coach or any of the players?  
HAILEY BASSETT: I'm really excited. We just celebrated in the locker room and
now, once we leave, we're going to make it back to business and get another
win tomorrow.  
  
STEPH GORMAN: I definitely just think it showed how good we can be when we
play to our potential. So it's really good to see.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: It was big for these players, because they have been working
extremely hard, as has so many other teams in this country. And not everybody
gets sort of reward for it. There's no guarantee on that.  
  
And with us obviously struggling a little bit this season, the fact we're an
11 seed, tells you we've been through adversity and injuries and different
things. But to have a little bit of a pay-off on the end with the tournament,
it's great that the girls have that sense of, if we work hard and if we
continue the course, then there's some reward there.  
  
And then like Hailey and Steph both already know and have said, the reward
isn't winning a first-round game necessarily. It's nice to have that but
nobody comes to Vegas, Utah State or Wyoming or anybody, nobody comes to win
just one game. So that's going to be our focus moving forward.  
  
Q. You 're now in a unique position where less than 24 hours from now
you're back on the court playing Wyoming. How, from a coaching perspective and
a player perspective, are you guys going to keep yourselves sharp both
mentally and physically to move into tomorrow's game?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Good question. It's going to be a fine balance on rest and
then getting what we need to get in and obviously between now and then it's
going to be a lot of mental reps. We don't have a whole lot of opportunity to
go out on a practice floor, go 5-on-5 and run line drills, whatever you must
do.  
  
But it's important for us to realize -- Hailey mentioned it -- we're
approaching it in a business sort of way that we're going to rest our bodies,
going to rest our minds but at the same time we've got to have this super
amount of focus for tomorrow because it's a tough position to be in. Wyoming
has had a good season and they've earned the ability to have a bye. No doubt
about it; it's an advantage. But at the same time we're playing really well
right now. So hopefully we can play our best tomorrow again because I feel
like we did that tonight.  
  
HAILEY BASSETT: Being a player, it's going to be tough on, like, the legs and
everything, but I feel like it will be important to go to bed early and get up
early and just focus and be business-like and go through the day in a good
manner.  
  
STEPH GORMAN: Just trusting that we're prepared early, like put the work in
early. Now we can just rest and get it done tomorrow.  
  
Q. Steph, you guys, against New Mexico, took a lot of really confident
3s but didn 't necessarily see a lot of them fall. But how did it good to see
the early 3s falling tonight?  
STEPH GORMAN: It's always a confidence booster when the first one goes. It
definitely helped my confidence just being able to shoot them and having that
trust in the team and the coaches to be able to shoot them, knowing if I do
miss we have phenomenal offensive rebounders down there ready to put it back.  
  
Q. Coming in as the underdogs, what kind of mentality do you feel you
have to set for yourself or do you set for yourself in general to get your
head in the game for --  
HAILEY BASSETT: To me, I'm actually really excited because I like going,
coming in and no one believing in you and proving them wrong, that's kind of
mentality.  
  
STEPH GORMAN: Having the pressure is really nice, but just being able to leave
it out on the floor, giving it our all, it felt good today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 1, 2020

  

### [Mike Bradbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32780)

### [Aisia Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30429)

### [Jaedyn De La Cerda](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38790)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 74, New Mexico - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of New Mexico head coach Mike
Bradbury and student-athletes Jaedyn De La Cerda and Aisia Robertson.  
  
COACH BRADBURY: I thought it was a little choppy at times. I give Nevada
credit. They make you play that way. They're really good defensively. They're
well-coached. And they made it hard for us to get any flow offensively,
especially in the second half.  
  
And I thought in the fourth quarter we struggled to rebound it and that's
where they really beat us up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aisia, will you reflect on your two years at New Mexico and just
everything that you 've gone through, your time and what you're going to take
most out of it?  
AISIA ROBERTSON: What I learned in these two years is that I should have
committed to Mike out of high school. He's by far the best coach that I had
throughout my career. I've learned so much from him in these past two years.
He made me a better person and a better basketball player.  
  
But the list goes on about what I learned coming to the University of New
Mexico. I just appreciate the university and the coaching staff.  
  
Q. Jaedyn, the way the team had to reinvent itself throughout the year,
later on in the year, where you (indiscernible) played today as well, just
talk about your performance in this championship?  
JAEDYN DE LA CERDA: I wouldn't be able to do it if it wasn't for Coach Mike
and my teammates. He just said be aggressive and attack, so that's what I did.
And I got open looks from my teammates and stuff like that.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2020

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

### [Ashten Prechtel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38976)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 89, Stanford - 56  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think we started out very well. We had a very good first
quarter, and we just really struggled after that. And a lot of that, give the
credit to Oregon. They are a terrific team. They shot the ball well from the
perimeter. A lot of different people stepped up for them. They have a great
inside game.  
  
You know, we really struggled offensively, but I thought we had a real bright
spot off the bench with Ashten. She came in, hit some big shots for us and
competed.  
  
And Kiana led the way for us. Playing every minute of the tournament, putting
her team on her back every single game. I hope that this is a very positive
motivation for our team looking forward to playing in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
I don't know that any game that we would play in the tournament would be any
harder. Again, that's a real credit to Oregon and the great team that they
have this year.  
  
Q. Tara, were you getting shots that you liked, that you thought were
good shots? It seemed like there were some good shots that just weren 't
falling?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think especially early, you know, I can think of
kind of a really nice shot on the wing that Lexie got, you know, just, you
know, we -- I think sometimes things almost -- I don't know want to say are
contagious, you know, if you hit a shot, then somebody else hit a shot, then
it can build that way.  
  
We struggled. We struggled hitting shots. You know, Lexie has had a great
tournament, played really well last night, and just -- you know, you can't
control the shots. People worked really hard defensively, and they are very,
very difficult to guard, but we worked very hard and they still -- I mean,
you're right on people and they're still hitting some really big shots.  
  
Q. How much pressure does your offense feel or does an offense feel when
playing against Oregon to keep up?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, I think one of the things, you know, like when
we -- if you look at who played really well for them, I mean, you know,
Sabally did so well last game, and she was 3-11, 0-5, a total of seven points.
Someone else picks up the slack for them.  
  
You know, so like Boley and their starting lineup, we did a really good job on
her, but then Ruthy goes 9-11, Sabrina, 7-12. So they -- if one person for
them is struggling, someone else is picking up the slack. That does put a lot
of pressure on our team because like we may think we're doing such a good job
here, and then someone else is stepping up for them.  
  
We don't -- our team I think is really young. We don't have the depth that if
Kia has a bad game or Lexie has a bad game that somebody else can step up and
get it done for us.  
  
Q. Tara, we know they 're the most efficient offense in the country, but
how good would you say they are defensively, and how big of a factor will that
also be for them going forward?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think they have worked really hard on their
defense. You know, defense -- they're athletic, big, I think that maybe they
really -- they learned from their experience at the Final Four that, you know,
offense wasn't going to be enough.  
  
But, you know, they're big, they're strong, they rebound. You know, you get
one shot, and they're going the other way pretty fast. I think the consensus,
number one player in the country running their offense, and they have got
lights-out shooters.  
  
Again, I don't think there is a game that our team is going to play that's any
tougher. You know, I mean, this -- just I give them a tremendous amount of
credit and, you know, just -- we're not the only team they have beat this
year, I think they beat a U.S.A. team early on pretty well too.  
  
They are extremely talented.  
  
Q. Kiana, going with Tara 's point of explaining this as a positive
experience, how would you put Lexie's season into perspective having taken a
big step forward in being the second leading scorer, and how it helps you when
she had a game like last night?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Lexie is a great player, two-way player. She takes on the
scoring role and guards the other team's best perimeter player. She's had a
great sophomore year, and she's been playing extremely well. She struggled
tonight, but other people have to, you know, step up. But I'm really proud of
Lexie, proud of our team, and she's going to finish out this year and even
have a great rest of her two years here.  
  
Q. Kiana, what will you guys take from this game and move forward
with?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Partially I'm just going to take -- this is like learning.
They have great chemistry. Their chemistry is amazing. I think for our team
one thing to take away is just learning to stick together. I don't think we --
like showed any bad body language or anything when things weren't going our
way. That starts with me.  
  
I'm just proud of our team for, you know, keep fighting, Ashten came in and
kept playing until the final horn. So stick with things. It didn't go our way
tonight, but no one gave up or started pouting or anything.  
  
Q. Tara, with so many young players, and then the injuries, some of them
pretty key, has this season been a little bit like a jigsaw puzzle for you
where you just keep moving the pieces around? And even this late you 're still
sort of working on what that needs to look like?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, that's a great question. You know, we're so
excited to have Maya back, what, this may be maybe her ninth game, you know.  
  
And I think she's doing very well, but for her to absorb all the plays, the
out-of-bounds plays, everything we're doing, it is just I think a lot to ask,
especially a game like this.  
  
You know, again they don't ask what year you're in when you check in the game.
I'm very proud of our young team and how they battled, whether it is the
injury to DiJonai, whether it is to Haley, you know, take three starters off
of any team, and they would, you know, give their right arm to be sitting up
here as a No. 2 team in the best conference in the country.  
  
You're exactly right. We don't dwell on it. There's nothing you can do about
it. I think that the experience of playing in a championship game, playing
against a great team, we want that to be a positive for our team going forward
into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Similar question there: Nadia returned for you this season, and she
's been so steady with you, but kind of with that other spot, when you have
Ashten, Fran, Maya now back, Alyssa, at the same time how difficult is it to
maybe see how tough it may be for them because there are so many minutes to go
around, but at the same time trying to get them to a point where you can get
all four of them helping you at this point in the year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, because Maya is just coming back, she really is --
I'm not going to say limited, but her stamina is not where she can go more
than two, three minutes at a time. She's working really hard, running the
floor really hard.  
  
That's a good situation for a freshman, not to have to play too much where
their bodies break down. You know, I look at, you know, Nadia has really had a
-- she's having a great senior year. You know, I think that three games in
three days is -- it is a different kind of competition, like we don't ever
have to do this again, but there's plenty of time for them to get valuable
minutes.  
  
I'm looking at -- you know, I think maybe Fran, Ashten playing 18 minutes, 20
minutes a game is going to be what it is going to be. We have moved Alyssa to
the 3 a little bit. I think there's 20 minutes for each of our post players.  
  
Q. Last night we asked both Adia and Cori about the next two weeks and
how much improvement a team can make in the next two weeks. Would you address
that? How much better do you feel you can be in the next two weeks?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think that's true. I hope our team -- you know, I --
there's like a little bit of a kind of mixed bag, you know. Our team is
disappointed we didn't compete and do better. But we know that this is what I
call the dress rehearsal, and the NCAA Tournament, we're confident that we'll
be a top seed in that.  
  
And I think this can give our team a really good taste of this is what's it
going to be in the tournament, this is the sense of urgency and how hard you
have to play.  
  
To beat Oregon State and to beat UCLA and to be sitting here, I'm really proud
of our team. But at the same time, we're disappointed we didn't do better. We
can use this two weeks and get better. I'm very excited to have such a young
group to say, hey, this is what it is going to look like, what it really looks
like at the top.  
  
Q. Tara, if I could ask a big-picture question, you have played
basically every great team that 's been around, and you have been one of them
for the last 35 years. This Oregon offense in particular, how good is it when
you compare it to some of the best that both you have seen and some you have
coached yourself?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, like tonight, they -- I think they looked really
good tonight. You know, just maybe their Arizona State loss motivated them, or
the Louisville loss or their loss last year in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
I think the jury is out. You know, great teams win championships. I'm not -- I
mean, I think they -- I think they do have a great team. I don't think it -- I
don't think you can, you know, crown a -- we have had, you know, I don't know
how many Pac-12 championships, but those -- you have to -- I think you have to
prove it in the NCAA. Again, this is a great tournament and I think great
practice for a tournament atmosphere, but the test is to come.  
  
Q. This is for Kiana and Ashten, the Coronavirus has impacted your
campus. I 'm wondering as either players or students what -- I guess how you
may have felt the effects of this and going forward, you know, into sort of
what's a great unknown? I don't know, just maybe your thoughts on how this may
impact the tournament, your practices, those sorts of things?  
ASHTEN PRECHTEL: I mean, we have -- we have the rest of our classes, they're
all online now. I mean, we hopefully won't be interacting with people who have
it. We just will continue practicing and getting ready, and, I mean, hopefully
we'll stay safe. You know, we're just going to keep on getting ready.  
  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Yeah. We're just getting updates from our coaching staff and
stuff, looking out for emails from our professors and whatnot. Yeah, just
washing our hands, doing all that, the little things and, you know, trying to
stay healthy.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 89, Stanford - 56  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Stanford on a great
year. You know, they have set a high bar for this conference for many years,
and I think they have helped everybody else elevate the league.  
  
It's not that they're coming back to us, I think we're all elevating. And
that's due to Coach VanDerveer and her great team.  
  
Tonight they just met a better team. We played great. I just thought
defensively we were on point. Offensively, it is one of the most efficient
games I have seen us play. Everybody contributed. When we needed different
players to step up, different players did.  
  
That was super, super nice to see. I'm really proud of them for their effort,
and we validated a very hard-fought two-month grind Pac-12 regular season
championship now with the tournament championship. We don't have to share it
with anybody.  
  
Q. Congratulations on the win. Can you talk about the energy that the
whole team brought and specifically the defense and presence that Minyon
brought tonight?  
KELLY GRAVES: You know, it's funny, your great players find a way to step up
in the biggest moments, and, you know, Minyon -- you know, there have been
games where she's struggled, but she's got the heart of a champion.  
  
And on the biggest night, on the biggest stage, she was able to step up her
game. And that changed I thought the whole game. By her making those shots, it
was like, yeah, we know what Stanford was trying to do, and it wasn't going to
work.  
  
She stepped up to that challenge. You know, Ruthy I thought was huge all night
long. Sabrina gets a lot of credit, she should. The person that puts this all
together is Ruthy down low. If we don't have her, teams would play us
differently. We wouldn't be able to make the plays we do from the perimeter,
shoot as well as we do from the perimeter.  
  
Then when you have someone like Sabrina, who then puts it all together, she's
like that conductor of the orchestra. She is -- she's got everything exactly
the way she wants it.  
  
All three of these guys really stepped up tonight. It was great to see. I'm
really happy for them. They worked hard for this. There's been a lot of
pressure on this team this year, maybe more so than any Pac-12 team I can
remember. And they have done it. They have answered the bell each and every
time.  
  
Q. I have a two-part question to start with Minyon and then for the two
ladies. There was a point in the second quarter where you 're going for a
rebound, it looks like Lexie sort of dropped you on your backside. And the
look on your face, that you went up for a rebound on the same sequence, took
it to the other end and you were just possessed for the next couple of
minutes. It looked like it fueled your fire even more. You had your game face
on, then it just intensified. For you two ladies, when you see something like
that, what does she bring out of you two?  
MINYON MOORE: I have some crazy game faces I really can't control. But, yeah,
it's just putting fuel to the fire, kind of like: Oh, you're to push me over?
All right, let's see what we can do.  
  
It wasn't intentional. It is just a game thing. I can't control my faces.
Yeah, it just fired me up.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: It is fun to see her, her face change, because she's such a
competitor. And I'm like, oh, gosh, look at Yon, she's trying to screen her,
she gets through it, she gets her hands on the ball, just really fun and hypes
the whole team up.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: When she plays that hard, we want to play that hard for her
as well. So I think she set the tone defensively, which fueled her offense and
our offense as well.  
  
Q. For Ruthy, you guys I thought tonight -- I watched you walk an
interesting line between winning a game you wanted to win very badly and
looking pretty businesslike doing it. Like the celebration was you guys
celebrated it, but it wasn 't crazy, it wasn't -- it felt like it was sort of
a check off the to-do list. Am I reading that right?  
RUTHY HEBARD: We're really excited to be -- Stanford is a such a good team,
but I think we know that we have a lot more we want to accomplish before we
finish this year off. We're really happy for the win, and we're really excited
for what's next to come.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Can I just touch on that? You have been around our team a little
bit. They celebrate and have fun every day. I think we're the loosest team you
will ever see. I don't think we need moments like this to celebrate and let
loose. I think it is kind of who we are and, you know, I think it is in our
DNA, this is how we act each and every day.  
  
Q. Two questions. Ruthy, you had kind of a tough game last year in the
championship game. Did that kind of fuel you a little bit today?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Everything fuels me. Of course we remember last year's game. We
wanted to get them back, and I'm just happy with how I played and how my
teammates were able to put confidence in me and get me the ball.  
  
Q. Minyon, it looked early in the game you were maybe as aggressive as
you have been in quite a while offensively. Is that fair to say, that you took
the challenge and really were aggressive offensively?  
MINYON MOORE: Yeah. Teams have obviously helped off on me, and I know that it
kind of hurts our offense and hurts our inside game with Ruthy. I took it to
heart and I know shot the shots tonight, I'm happy they went in, my teammates
and coaches have faith in me. Yeah, I took it to heart, yeah.  
  
Q. I have this for Sabrina, and, Coach Graves, if you want to answer it
too. One thing that Coach VanDerveer said is you guys are the most efficient
offensive team in the country, she really feels like defensively you have
taken it up a level, individually and as a collective, as a team this season.
Can you talk about that and how much maybe that is an extra comfort factor, if
you will, going into the NCAA Tournament, that your defense has gotten as good
as it is?  
SABRINA IONESCU: It is for sure. I mean, especially us two that were here for
the last four years, we have relied on our offense a lot in games when we were
not shooting the ball particularly well, when we maybe have gotten in foul
trouble, we haven't been able to rely on our defense, and I think last year we
realized that we fell short due to the fact that we needed to defend better.  
  
So this year, I mean, our whole focus coming into this year was defense, and
obviously it starts individually and then it joins in collectively. I think,
you know, from us, that play and start to the bench, we all are focusing on
our defense and trying to be the best we can because you can impact the game
regardless if you're making a shot or not.  
  
We know that some nights our shots aren't going to go in, and we need to be
able to rely on our defense. And we're just continuing to get better in that
aspect of the game every day.  
  
Q. To piggyback off that, I don 't know how many times we have asked you
over the course of the year how much Minyon has played a role in increasing
that defensive identity, but as a collective, as a group, especially down the
stretch here, how has it become this one person leads the charge to now
everybody has bought into that mindset?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think it's come from a couple of different areas.  
  
Number one, if you remember this time, and you mentioned Ruthy in this
championship game last year, she was playing on one leg. You know, at this
time last year, Maite had the flu, Taylor Chavez was out for the season. We
actually suited up seven players.  
  
When you're playing 40 minutes a game, like our guards had to do, you know,
the energy you have to exert at the defensive end may not be the same.  
  
We have depth this year. We have gone from the 191st most efficient defense
into now a top 30 defense. I think that's critical. It starts because we have
better depth, we have had good health. We have a couple of players that come
off the bench, Jaz Shelley and Taylor Chavez, who lift us defensively, not
just offensively, but lift our defense, but Minyon gets a lot of the credit.
It has been Minyon not necessarily that she's disrupting people, but she's
slowing transition down. We gave up no transition points to one of the best
transition offensive teams in the country today. They got zero transition
points. That was our number one key tonight. Minyon is the one that is slowing
the ball down in transition.  
  
Number two, she's our best talker. Number three, she's a bulldog and is tough
as nails. And if you're not holding up your end of the bargain defensively,
she's going to let you hear it.  
  
She's the one that I think has really driven that bus, everybody else has
hopped on, and I think we have now seen the benefits of playing both ends of
the floor.  
  
We're still the most efficient offense in the country, and it is not even
close. But now we can play both ends of the floor, which makes us really
difficult to play I think.  
  
Q. Minyon, I 'm sure you watch these guys postseason runs the last few
years on TV. What's it mean to you? I saw you doing snow angels in the
confetti, you have the net around your neck. What's this mean right now?  
KELLY GRAVES: She's no angel.  
  
MINYON MOORE: Joke chokes. It means everything. Yeah. By this time I'm at home
with my feet kicked back watching them on TV. Yeah, it means a lot. Obviously
I idolize Sabrina and Ruthy, so I've obviously supported them in the
postseason. To be a part of it now, to be a part of a program who is not only
all about basketball but about family and pushing you to be a better person
off the court and on the court is everything.  
  
I'm just really blessed to be able to do it alongside these amazing people.
And we still have a lot of business to take care of. Yeah. This is a great
conference win and conference championship, but we have a lot more to
accomplish.  
  
Q. During the regular season you outdistanced teams by 28 points; in
this tournament, 23. How important was it to continue to not just win games
but dominate, to fuel that run going into the NCAA, basically never letting
your foot off the jugular?  
KELLY GRAVES: Number one, we just wanted to win the game; however, we did --
we knew the entire nation was watching. This is the time of year that
committee members are watching as well. It's not why we try -- you know, we
don't play harder because of that, but I think it's important the way we
played this game, the way it played out.  
  
We showed really everything that we can do tonight. This is a very effective
team. We have ten wins, ten wins against teams that were in the top 16 in the
last reveal. Ten. That's more than the other three projected No. 1s combined.  
  
We have five of those were on the road, okay, more than twice the number of
those other three combined. We had two on a neutral site. So we have shown
that we are a really good basketball team, and it doesn't matter where we
play, and we play the best, and we have beaten the best.  
  
So I really just look forward to now the next six-game tournament to see what
we can really do. Yeah. This team at times have been very dominant in their
play.  
  
Q. This is for Minyon. You know, you have had quite a journey to get to
this point between the injuries and USC and now here. You know, this is
between the US -- USA, excuse me, and the UConn game, probably one of the
bigger stages that I would imagine you have played on with Oregon now. What
was it about that first quarter and the second especially where you just kind
of had it in a zone? Did you kind of know you were in a zone, especially
shooting from the outside early?  
MINYON MOORE: Yeah. I mean, they have all been great experiences. And once I
see the ball go in once, it is kind of I have more confidence going from
there. It is just a matter of seeing the ball go to the basket.  
  
Yeah, in a zone, when my teammates are hot, too, we're all hot together, it is
kind of like unstoppable. So yeah, they're all great experiences, and we still
have a lot to take care of, like I said. So hopefully I keep hitting these
shots.  
  
Q. This is for anyone who wants to take it. You all lost to ASU back in
January, and after that it just -- I saw you guys just take off. Was that game
just a motivator for just the rest of this season?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, it proved to be because we played pretty well since. That
game was on me. I did a poor job. We're up 12, seven minutes to go, I have to
help us win that game, and I didn't. I thought we played through it.  
  
These guys, although they did give up 30 points in the fourth quarter -- we
reminded them of that, at least on 50, 100 occasions? But I think it really
did motivate us. We -- I think watched that game a lot after, and just, you
know, we went through the motions.  
  
And I think from then on we determined that's not going to happen again. We
will not not play hard. And they got the message and have continued to do it.  
  
Again, I credit this senior class. These guys, I'll tell you, it's a pretty
damn good group. They're fun to coach and fun to be with each and every day.  
  
Q. Second question. This is the second year in Vegas, and you know it is
through 2022, but what are your all thoughts on it being in Vegas, how this
tournament went in general?  
KELLY GRAVES: You want me or them?  
  
Q. Anybody.  
KELLY GRAVES: I love it. I have been a proponent of it from the day I got into
the conference because, you know, my previous school, we played down here, I
see the benefits of being in Las Vegas.  
  
You know, you have been in Eugene in March, sometimes you want to get out and
get to the sunshine. And so I think, you know, the longer we have it here, the
more comfortable the fans become and the more they look forward to it. You
will see a good portion of this fan base that was here this weekend, they will
get their tickets next year in the next month or two. You watch it, they'll
start to plan their vacation time around this tournament.  
  
I went for a walk this morning on game day, and I got goose bumps. As I'm
walking, I see Mom, Dad and two little boys, couldn't have been six or seven,
okay, they're in their Duck gear, out walking around: Hey, Coach.  
  
You know, they're making memories. I think this is so cool. They have made
Vegas a destination to go to. It actually gave me goose bumps this morning,
got me fired up.  
  
And I was a little fired up there a couple of times tonight. But I think it is
great. It is a great venue.  
  
Las Vegas Aces have really helped, you know, that connection with them. I saw
A'ja Wilson throwing some shirts out, right, when I should have been paying
attention to the timeout when Sabrina was blown by on defense. No. I think
it's great. I hope we stay. You got my vote.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Me too.  
  
MINYON MOORE: Same.  
  
Q. Kelly, I noticed there 's a bunch of players in the postgame, they
were plotting to hit you with cupcakes. You turned around on the ladder. You
knew it was coming. What was that moment like? You knew you were going to get
blasted?  
KELLY GRAVES: Little did they know I could have taken a lot worse, right? As a
coach, I always have the last laugh. So they need to remember that as well.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's coming. Not for a while.  
  
I'm actually going to give the team a week off. We have always done that.
We'll meet back up Saturday night for a light shootaround, and it gives me one
week to prepare in how I get back to them.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: The seniors were not a part of it. I didn't touch you at all,
actually.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah. Sure. I'm sure there is a lot of video that may suggest
otherwise.  
  
However, I think it's great. You know, I would -- I welcome that anytime,
because we're celebrating. We're celebrating something special, Pac-12
Tournament Championship.  
  
Q. Kelly, I think you guys will probably be the No. 1 overall seed. The
resume you outlined, I think you 'll be the No. 1 overall seed. Would you like
to enter the tournament as the No. 1 team ranked in the country?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't care. I just know we're playing. I think we'll be No. 1.
Honestly, I don't know how much that matters. In the end, you have to play
really good teams. Everybody is going to be good.  
  
So we're praying for Portland. I hope that's where they put us. I think that
would be special. I've got a feeling that if they do, we're going to break
some regional attendance records up there.  
  
I think the people in the Northwest are really energized about this team.
That's beyond my pay control. I can lobby, but I'm not going to. I'll let our
work do the talking.  
  
Did I mention that we've won 10 games? Yeah.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Every single time.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Five of those on the road? Did I mention that already.  
  
MINYON MOORE: It is his favorite stat. I was just waiting for it.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: You know, we didn't play South Carolina, so I don't know. You
know, I know they're a really good team. I don't know. You know, we didn't
play any SEC teams either.  
  
I look at the Louisville loss against a very good team and a game where we
just weren't quite ready for a new defense. That was on the islands. I think
sometimes you can discount any game played on an island tournament over
Thanksgiving, you know. But the reality is we are 10-0 since December 1st.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Write it down just in case.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: The loss we had was in November. We're 10-0 against the top 16
since December 1st. Can I say that again? No.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Lexie Hull](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37086)

### [Nadia Fingall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38961)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 67, UCLA - 51  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, we are thrilled to be playing for the
championship of Pac-12 Conference. I think tonight was a battle of two really
talented teams. UCLA is a great team, they'll be -- they're going to do
extremely well in the NCAA Tournament. They're very well-coached team, and
they have a terrific talent on their team.  
  
We just -- we had Lexie. She really was the engine of this train today. She
really scored for us really well. You know, got to the basket, rebounded
almost a double-double there. Just willed our team I think to win. We came out
in the second half, ran a play for her, she knocked it down, she got steals,
getting lay-ups. I thought Anna Wilson's defense and ability to run our team
was special for us. She stepped up, had a great game also.  
  
Fran was big for us. I love that full court pass that Nadia threw to her,
showed a lot of confidence throwing that to a freshman. And Kiana, she's
steady.  
  
You know, there are probably things that we could do better, but that's a
credit to their defense. We turned it over a little more than I wanted to.
Maybe we could have rebounded a little bit better. Again, they're a great
team. I'm really proud of our team.  
  
These two women up here tonight.  
  
Q. Tournament Tara is what they like to call you. Have you ever been in
a situation in the post season in the first half, maybe you 're not playing
well, and you're panicking a little internally? Are you sitting there thinking
we're going to make great halftime adjustments?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I don't think panic would help me or our team at all. I think
it is a puzzle to figure out. You know, I hate to say this, my mother, we were
talking today, my mother was like don't ever -- I never worry about the first
half, because the second half is the ballgame. That's how -- that's what I
think too.  
  
You know, we came out in the second -- we can make adjustments but it is not
the adjustments, people just settling in, playing hard. I mean, we were up
after the first quarter -- no, we were down. We came out, we played -- we were
up at halftime. We came out. Our third quarter was really strong.  
  
I thought people just maybe were a little tired and, you know, we didn't maybe
sub as much as maybe I should have in the fourth quarter. I don't -- you know,
we're a team that we have confidence, and I have a lot of confidence in our
players.  
  
Q. For the players, not to look past what happened tonight, because it
was a big win for you guys, you 're playing Oregon tomorrow. We know how the
first two games this season went against Oregon, they'll be super motivated to
avoid the same situation they faced with you last year. What do you expect,
what has to be different tomorrow?  
LEXIE HULL: I mean, I think as a team we're excited to play them for the third
time. We know it will be competitive, and we know we'll have to really lock in
and follow our scouting report. Just give it everything we have.  
  
I mean, I look forward to tomorrow. I know that's what we're going to do is
give 100% effort.  
  
NADIA FINGALL: We're excited to play with them, excited to be in the
championship game. Excited to -- if it was anyone else, we would be excited to
play them too.  
  
You know, we're looking forward to it. You know, the game is earlier in the
season, definitely want to take things from it and learn from it. Just focus
on tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lexie, you came out aggressive and almost set a new career high. What
was the mindset tonight? Was being aggressive something you and Coach
discussed?  
LEXIE HULL: Every single game is a new game, and I think that's definitely
something one of our focuses, every game, is to be more aggressive than the
other team.  
  
I think just coming out with that mindset that helped tonight, especially
against a team like UCLA that's really intense and a lot of pressure. Just
focusing on staying more aggressive than them.  
  
Q. For both Tara and Anna, Anna has been playing really well lately, not
just tonight, last couple of weeks she 's done a lot on both end of the court.
Do either of you attribute that to anything?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I mean, Anna has been playing well all season. She is --
she's the consummate team player. She comes off the bench for us and she gives
us a great spark. She can play the one or the two. She always -- she plays --
she's a two-way player, playing defense and offense.  
  
I think what she's been doing that's helped our team the most is that she's
being more aggressive offensively. You know, she's looking for her own shot
more. And she knocked down a big shot for us. She had big steals, she had a
big steal last night and steals tonight. She rebounds as a guard. She's in
there scrapping.  
  
You know, I think Anna understands the big picture. She has a sense of urgency
and plays hard and works hard in practice every day and plays against Kiana or
Lacie or Lexie. She's a great team player, I love coaching her, love having
her on our team.  
  
ANNA WILSON: I get to play against two of the best guards in the Pac-12 every
day in practice, Kia and Lexie. You know, my focus is to make them better as
much as I possibly can defensively, like playing defense on them as much as I
can in practice. You know, and they help me become a better defensive player.  
  
But really, for me, I think it is just like trying to get better and just
having a bigger picture focus.  
  
Q. Playing Oregon again tomorrow, there are good things certainly that
you can take from those first two match-ups, obviously that first half of the
first game you were right with them, and you played really well in the second
half of that second game. What are the things you need to do tomorrow?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, I think Oregon is the number one team in
the country. They're the number one team in the country because they execute
extremely well offensively. They have, you know, tremendous three-point
shooters with, you know -- whether it is their starting lineup or off their
bench.  
  
They have arguably -- they have an All-American post player. They don't have
any weaknesses. They have the number one player in the country, they have
first, fourth draft picks. Honestly, you know, our team is I think a lot
younger, not as experienced, and we just -- we're going to have to figure out
something to do that will really help our team be successful. We didn't figure
it out the first few times.  
  
I think we're just going to have to really figure out what will give our team
the best chance of being successful. Number one, taking care of the ball,
taking good shots. What I say is when we have the ball, they're not scoring,
and they have an extremely potent offense, we have to work extremely hard
defensively and we have to rebound. It is not -- I don't think it's rocket
science. They're a tough match-up because they are so skilled and so good at
every position.  
  
Q. What happened to your hand, Tara?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I break blood vessels in my hand when I'm clapping, and I had
a lot to clap about tonight.  
  
Thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Erin Boley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33293)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 88, Arizona - 70  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, we're very grateful and excited to be moving on. I
thought at times -- tonight was actually a really good basketball game. If
you're just a basketball fan, you would have had to have enjoyed it. It had
back and forth, offensively, both teams were on point, I don't think either of
us, you know, wanted to guard anybody tonight.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. I thought we gutted it out. That was kind of a
grind-it-up kind of win. I give Adia a lot of credit. She's done such a good
job with that team. Who would have thought that, you know, they're in the
Semifinals this quickly, and battling us toe-to-toe. Hats off to them. It kind
of had a feel of a Sweet 16, kind of Elite Eight game out there tonight. I
won't be surprised to see Arizona at that level this year. They have got a
really good basketball team.  
  
In the end, we had a great shooting night from the three again. You know, I
thought they had to gamble a little bit, gave up open looks, and we knocked
them down tonight. These two especially came to play and, you know, proud of
their effort as well.  
  
Q. Coach, as you said, it was a great basketball game in terms of the
offensive, came out firing. When you see that 23-20, back and forth, two teams
that eventually broke the record for most threes in one game, do you like that
kind of tempo knowing you have the shooters and the scorers, or do you make
adjustments to slow things down or at least defend? Obviously you want to stop
them. But do you like the tempo?  
KELLY GRAVES: Absolutely. 88 is barely above our average. This is kind of an
average game for us.  
  
Offensively we're the most efficient team in the country, by a long way. Our
true shooting percentage is best in the nation. Our turnover ratio is the
best. This is a good basketball team offensively, we're an elite team, one of
the best of all time, quite frankly. So when we get it rolling and get to that
tempo and find shooters and knocking them down, we become really difficult
because you have an inside presence who can, you know, command a double-team.  
  
And when she didn't get it tonight, I thought in the second half she was a
little more aggressive, we got it to her, that opens up, you know, more
opportunities for shooters, if shooters are hitting, that spaces the floor,
and then you've got playmakers like Sabrina and Minyon and Satou that can make
plays.  
  
When we're firing on all cylinders, like we have a couple of moments in
tournament, it looks pretty good. He can't give up 70 points and expect to
play too long. We have to do a little bit better job there.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you had an incredible game tonight, can you speak on -- also
you became the Pac-12 leading scorer of all time. Can you elaborate on your
efforts tonight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, my team came ready to play. I mean, when Erin shoots
how she did, when Taylor shoots it and Jaz shoots it like they have been, it
makes my job easy. So they're attracting so much attention that I got open
shots, vice versa.  
  
Really just trying to provide anything I can in order for to us win. Had some
open looks tonight, missed a few, but made enough for us to win.  
  
Q. Sabrina, many coaches and people have said that you 're a
transcendent player. What is your reaction to those notions?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Just really happy to be on this team. I mean, I don't really
think too much about myself and what I'm doing, just honored and humbled to be
a part of something bigger than myself and playing for these people around me
that I love and excited to see how, you know, our team is really changing
society and society's view on women in sports.  
  
That's something I'm really proud about and proud to be a part of.  
  
Q. You have set an example and off the court, inspiring so many people.
How cool is it that you have impacted so many young girls and their interest
in basketball?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, that's always, you know, humbling to be an
inspiration for those that need someone to look up to, especially the younger
generations. We put ourselves in their shoes, and we realize that we were
those kids -- we were those kids trying to find someone to look up to and
someone to be inspired by.  
  
Just trying to be the best mentors and the best individuals on and off the
basketball court that we can is something that we pride ourselves on.  
  
Q. For Sabrina and Erin. Sabrina, you addressed it, when Erin comes out
hot, hits a couple of threes right away, really gets you guys rolling, is it a
barometer for you when you know that Erin starts dropping threes that it will
be a good night?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Oh, yeah, especially when she hit the first couple and she
was coming aggressive to the basket, getting in the paint. We're a hard team
to beat when that happens.  
  
So seeing Erin come out with that fire inspired me to want to be better
offensively and get in the paint and dish. So we did that. I think we played
well together. If they were collapsing on me, we made the extra pass, and vice
versa.  
  
So continuing to learn to play with each other and those around us, but we're
a hard team to beat when Erin is shooting the way she is right now.  
  
Q. Erin, when you hit a couple of early shots, do you feel like it is
going to be a good night as well?  
ERIN BOLEY: Yeah, I think, you know, it was a good start to the game, and I,
you know, tried to get into a rhythm with the rest of the team. Like Sabrina
said, if -- once I hit a couple at the beginning of the game, it starts
opening things up for other players too. It helps us get into a good rhythm.  
  
Q. Sabrina, as you pointed out, you broke another record tonight, kind
of what you do at Oregon. Outside of winning a national championship, I just
wondered if there was any other records you had your eye on that we should be
aware of?  
SABRINA IONESCU: What record did I break?  
  
Q. You 're the Conference tournament all-time leading scorer?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Oh.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: That's good. Congratulations.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Thanks. What was the question?  
  
Q. Besides the Final Four -- excuse me, a national championship, which
you have been pretty open about, is there any other record that you have your
eye on, paying attention to?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No. Absolutely not. Cutting down nets, it if that was a
record, that's one of them. Hopefully three more to go.  
  
Q. Kelly, can you talk about somebody being as great a distributor and
playmaker as Sabrina is and the all-time leading corer? We know this triple-
double thing, how amazing it is, but to have the all-time leading scorer to be
this type of playmaker?  
KELLY GRAVES: Again, to be the first to go 2K1K1K is an incredible feat. It
has never been -- it's never been done in college basketball ever, so who is
to say it will ever happen.  
  
It would be pretty neat to be in a club all by yourself, wouldn't it? Unless
you're in a Vegas club? No, not tonight. No.  
  
I think they're just equally impressive, you know, the scoring. It is not like
she's the only scorer on our team. You know, look at her average this year,
she's not even averaging 20 points a game, but it is just so consistent. The
assists, her elite vision.  
  
And I coached one of the best in Courtney Vandersloot, and I'm often asked
about the comparison, they're both equally, you know, phenomenal.  
  
I think of all the stats that I think are pretty neat are the 1,000 rebounds
from the guard position. That's just unheard of. You know, so just the well-
rounded nature of the game, I think she's become a better defender, a much
better leader. He's a super nice person, four, five days a week that I have to
deal with her.  
  
But, no, it's really been a blessing and an inspiration to coach her each and
every day and to see the greatness that she displays not just on game nights,
you guys, but what you see on game nights is what she's doing in practice
every day.  
  
Q. Coach, I got a chance to sit behind the huddle, I never get to do
that at a game. There was a time when you barked at Sabrina a little bit, you
were on Ruthy, you got on -- it is like everyone is treated equal in that
huddle. Can you speak a little bit about how you manage the team and how they
respond to you?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, they know I love them. So my job isn't
always to just pat them on the back, and there are times that -- you know,
that everybody can use some coaching, and sometimes it is harder than not.  
  
Did you see that Sabrina also came back at me? Which is good. It is an equal
partnership. I like that. You know, she sees it one way, I see it another way.
I think it is healthy.  
  
Same with Ruthy. You know, Ruthy, it is mainly just a challenge, you know, to
get deeper position and just let us get to the basketball and take over the
game. Because if they double-team, we're the best passing team in the country.
So she's a willing passer. So every once in a while you just have to, you
know, just have to get on them, kick them in the ass, that's all right. Right?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: You still love me? I still love you too. Just sometimes I want
her to make the pass to a different spot.  
  
I think we have a healthy relationship, the coaches and the players, all
throughout the team. You know, it's not always you know Romper Room.  
  
Q. Kelly, this probably sounds like a silly question, but tomorrow
night, win or lose, it is not going to change how you 're put on the NCAA
bracket more than likely. What does it mean to win this tournament? Is it the
feel of the mental feel going forward, cutting nets down, that stuff? Just --
I don't know if it is a practice run, but what does it mean I guess to win
something --  
KELLY GRAVES: We're on a mission. We don't want to share the regular season
title with someone else that wins the tournament championship. We want to
continue to build the resume as well. Right now we're 9-1 against teams that
were in the last top 16 reveal. 9-1. Five of those games on the road. South
Carolina, 4-0. Baylor, 1-1. Maryland, 2-2. We actually have more wins against
the top 16 than the other three projected number ones combined, including five
on the road, and the other two -- other three have two combined on the road.  
  
Our resume is solid, but we want to -- you know, that's nice and everything,
but we want to cut down the nets. We don't want to share this. We don't want
it to be tainted. Yeah. They won the regular season championship, but what did
they do in the tournament?  
  
They'll get our best shot, whoever we play tomorrow. And they're both equally
impressive. They both offer great challenges to us. But if we play our
basketball game, we're the best team. I don't mind saying that. We just are.
We proved it over a two-month grind in Pac-12, and now we have three days. We
have two of them down, now we have one more.  
  
It was all the bald guys in the front row. I like it. I like it. You should
get special preference.  
  
Q. Erin, earlier this week you called this a shooter 's gym. Can you
explain what that means?  
ERIN BOLEY: Yeah, Coach was asking me if it was a shooter's gym, and I said
that every gym is for us. Yeah. We were just talking about getting into a
rhythm, no matter where we're playing at. It is really important for us to be
shooting well as a big part of our offense. Yeah. I think it showed over the
past two games.  
  
Q. Coach, I 'm just -- we have been sitting pretty close to fans, and I
have noticed them, you know, really laying into the officiating. I'm wondering
if you think that fans and people in general are a little harsh on the refs?  
SABRINA IONESCU: They're taking after him.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I'm going to go on record and say I think the Pac-12 officiating
has been the best in the country this year. So, yeah, those fans need to
lighten up a little bit.  
  
You know, I kind of trained them. I always tell them, you can yell at the
referees, you just can't yell at the coach. They yell at both. It doesn't
really matter. I don't know. I thought the officiating was fine tonight.  
  
You think I'll get any Christmas cards from them now? No.  
  
Q. Sabrina, before the game, I was in a position to see you and Ruthy
holding hands during the anthem, having a moment together. I wanted you to
talk about, you have come through this experience together, and what 's the
significance of the two of you sort of standing side by side in this moment?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah. I mean, it is special to come through these four years
with a best friend and someone that you met here and that's going to be your
best friend for the rest of your life.  
  
Being able to go through all the ups and downs, adversity, championships with
her, it is truly special, and we have always lined up in the same spot at the
National Anthem, and we're a very superstition team.  
  
So that's something that we have done since our freshman year, it has just
kind of grown. Being able to grow our relationship off the court but on the
court as well with her is special, and I think everyone sees that from us.  
  
And then, you know, I think they want to carry that into their friendships and
relationships, and our team is the closest I think it ever has been this year
because one of the main reasons is obviously we have a lot of us returning
from last year, but even the new players, I think, they see how tight we are
and how we rely on each other for a lot of things non-basketball-wise, and
they want to do the same.  
  
Q. For Kelly and Sabrina. You sat, Sabrina, I think right after the game
up at the networks with Kelsey Plum. You two have done a lot of incredible
things in conference over the past few years. I wondered, has she ever given
you any advice? But also, Kelly, for you especially, what 's it like to just
see how this conference -- how individuals keep raising the bar within this
conference?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, she's one of the best players to have ever played in
conference and to ever play in this conference. I know from my freshman year,
being able to watch how she worked and how much time she put in to her craft,
was something that, you know, I didn't take for granted. I was able to watch
her game in and game out and continued to get better and better and really put
this conference on the map.  
  
So, obviously, friends with her now, and able to talk to her about stuff,
U.S.A. Basketball and here in the conference. It is awesome to know that we're
friends now through this conference.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, look at the game tonight. We had four of the top 15
Naismith finalists playing in this past game. We're going to have some more
here. We had some play last night that lost and are going home.  
  
We not only have really good teams, and I think we've positioned ourselves
well for the NCAA tournament, all of us, and that comes down to we have
really, really good players.  
  
It is not going anywhere. You see the young kids in this tournament that are
really shining. So I think it is neat. I'll tell you this, Pac-12 prepares us
like no other conference. With all due respect. We'll see how it plays out in
the NCAA Tournament. Now we have to all go win. But it prepares us like none
other for what we're about to go through.  
  
I told the team tonight, every game we play now from here on out is against a
team that will be in the NCAA Tournament, or is in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
There's no gimmes now.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Charisma Osborne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38962)

### [Michaela Onyenwere](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37106)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 67, UCLA - 51  
  
CORI CLOSE: It was the tougher team tonight. They outexecuted us. They played
with more unified purpose than us. And, you know, when you're playing this
level of a game, you have to -- we have to control some of those things.  
  
You know, obviously as head coach, it starts with me. So I have to go what led
to that, how do I lead us to a point -- I can handle losing, but it is really
hard to swallow when we get out-toughed, out-executed at that level.  
  
Credit to Stanford. They'll make a great, deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
Hopefully a spectacular final tomorrow.  
  
And the Pac-12 is the best conference in the country, and hopefully some of
the things that got exposed in us today will really inform our next two weeks
of practices.  
  
I can pretty much guarantee you we'll come out different for the first couple
of rounds of the NCAA Tournament, and we'll be much tougher, we'll be much
more together, and we will be able to execute through difficult circumstances
at a higher level credit.  
  
But credit Stanford. They were the better team today.  
  
Q. I 'll start with Maya. The early part of the game was pretty much a
slog, the score was low, you guys were kind of slugging it out a little bit.
What changed in terms of -- like Stanford's third quarter, they had a really
good offensive third quarter. What changed there, and what did you guys not
respond to?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: In the first half, we had good defense, we kept them to 25
points. Which is great for Stanford's offense. But we didn't come out with a
sense of urgency and competitiveness and focus like we had in the first half.  
  
That was something we need to continue to get better at, even when shots are
not falling for us.  
  
Q. Can you speak on how competitive the Pac-12 is and how does it
prepare you, and does it motivate you all to play better in the tournament?  
CORI CLOSE: I'll take the preparation part, they can take the motivation
party. There's no doubt, playing in this conference, I think the success in
the postseason speaks for itself. You know, there's only seven teams in the
entire country that have been as successful as us in post-season play over the
last four years, and three of those seven are in the Pac-12.  
  
So the reality is not only is it such a grind, forces you to deal with
different styles of play and your strengths and weaknesses, things -- bad
habits are exposed right away, different styles of coaching and different
styles of play, I think you're ready for whatever seed or matchup you get.  
  
A lot of other conferences aren't as prepared, not only because it's not as
deep from top to bottom in terms of excellence, but also the styles of play
are more narrow within that conference. And so if they get the wrong match-up,
well, you know, it is too bad a little bit. You have to adjust to those things
in the Pac-12.  
  
I'm very grateful for how it prepares us. Right now, of course, we're
disappointed, and it stings. But I don't think anything but good can come from
these environments. It is like your dress rehearsal for the NCAA Tournament,
and it gives you a taste of the intensity that will be required, the attention
to detail, what must happen to be able to play your best when your best is
needed, and now you get a chance to regroup and address some of those things.  
  
But the duration of the entire conference from tactical standpoint is the best
preparation you can ask for.  
  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: As far as motivation, I think this will motivate us. From
here on out, it is one and done, and we don't want to go home. I believe in my
team, and I believe we'll get better and come back better.  
  
CHARISMA OSBORNE: Yes.  
  
Q. Stanford 's depth makes them -- makes them built for three games in
three days, you don't this. Nobody does this all season?  
CORI CLOSE: No.  
  
Q. Was the depth a factor in anyway tonight?  
CORI CLOSE: We played a lot of people too. I don't think they're -- I think
their consistent purpose was more of a factor than their depth.  
  
I think we turned them over 21 times, you know, we -- I mean, that's a big
number for Stanford. You know, even we got 20 offensive rebounds, so I don't
think -- you know, effort-wise, I think we forced them to do different things,
we were not as productive out of those things.  
  
The reality was they played to their identity together more than we played to
our identity together. You need all five people. That doesn't mean other
people can't -- we tried to create one on one match-ups for Mikaela, they
sagged in, tried to double her up everywhere we went.  
  
That means there is a chain reaction that needs to happen for everybody else.
I think when we made them make some really tough decisions, they were able to
find their chain reaction in a unified way, and that's something we have to
grow in.  
  
Q. Cori, last night Scott made a joke about I think every Pac-12 team is
sick of playing each other, we 're all ready to play someone else. Do you feel
that? The conference is great, right, but there is also no nights off?  
CORI CLOSE: No. I think in a joking way, I think we all are ready to face
somebody else. At the same time I don't think we would be as ready to face
somebody else if we didn't have to face each other night in and night out.  
  
I tell our team all the time you have to embrace the hard. You have to led it
refine you. When it is -- nobody grows the most drinking Mai Tais on the
beach, right. You don't. You grow the most when you have to conquer really
hard things, when you have to really be uncomfortable. You know, I think maybe
that's a bad analogy.  
  
The reality is that I think it is both and. Right? It is both and. I'm ready
to play somebody else, and I'm ready to take the fruit of our labor of
grinding it out against each other and go apply that to someone else, and I'm
so thankful for what grinding out versus each other has done inside of us.  
  
Q. Coach, Stanford went on a 23-4 run in the third quarter and pulled
away. What do you think went wrong during that stretch?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think a lot of things went wrong in that stretch, right.  
  
We knew that if we didn't disrupt -- if they were able to get in an offensive
rhythm, you know, we really didn't see their offense much in the first half.
They had to make really difficult play, late in the shot clock, they scored
six of the first points off of offensive rebounds and then we tightened that
up.  
  
All of a sudden in the third quarter, what did you see? You saw all their
passes, cutting, getting the ball who needed it, coming off screens, getting
in rythm shots, getting to the cup one on one, and that does not bode well for
us, they're too good at that. They're a really high-level execution level
game. We let them be that. We knew we had to disrupt them.  
  
I thought we played really good defense the first half. I mean, I thought -- I
told our team, if we could maintain that intensity on defense and clean some
things in on offense we would be fine.  
  
It was a 4-point game at the half. So really disappointed that we weren't able
to come out and really assert that same kind of defensive prowess in the third
quarter, and that's what got them going.  
  
Q. Cori, at quick glance, Mikaela, Charisma, Japreece, they all scored
in double figures for you. That 's nothing new. Not to discount the quality of
the opponent, but 7-30 in the those two quarters, where does the offense have
to come for you guys? What didn't happen tonight that maybe disappointed you,
you expected to happen?  
CORI CLOSE: I think we have been talking -- I was talking to the team in the
locker room, in March everyone is going to know what everyone does. You know,
we know what they like to do, they know what we like to do. You're going to
have to go to your -- Tara said it -- they were asking her about her secret
sauce, she talks about how she takes away their first and second options, what
they like do the most.  
  
Everyone does that. We did that to them in the first half. Then who can move
to the third and fourth option? Who can stay patient in purpose later in the
shot clock? You know, the points in March always go down because it becomes
much more of half-court game, we're one of the most high-tempo games in the
country, but you have to in March be able to survive and grind it out with
more half court games when you're not able to get your transition game going.  
  
You're not going to turn people over in live ball situations as much in March.
The reality is that we didn't -- I don't think it's one person, I think it is
when they take away our first look at Michaela, they take away our first
isolation for Charisma, going down the line, what's our counter, the backside
of that action? What are we doing at seven seconds left in the shot clock
that's still together, putting people in positions of strength?  
  
I thought we got good actions and we weren't tough enough to finish them. We
got to be -- we didn't pass -- I mean, it sounds really simple but if you look
at really good offenses, they catch, screen and pass really well and with
rhythm, with purpose, and with awareness of whose around them, and we need to
grow in that because everybody's game plans will start with Japreece, Charisma
and Mikaela. Not everybody not that simple, we have to know what we're doing
and creating those together so we make a higher percentage of those shots .  
  
I really appreciate all of you guys and covering the tournament. This has been
one of the best years for Pac-12 women basketball not only on the courts but
in our coverage of telling the stories of the women. As frustrated as I am in
a loss that stings I'm very grateful for the work you put in and the way you
tell these stories.  
  
We need you. Our game needs you. We really appreciate how you're telling these
stories. Thank you for your work and for your efforts.

to come out and really assert that same kind of defensive prowess in the third
quarter, and that's what got them going.  
  
Q. Cori, at quick glance, Mikaela, Charisma, Japreece, they all scored
in double figures for you. That 's nothing new. Not to discount the quality of
the opponent, but 7-30 in the those two quarters, where does the offense have
to come for you guys? What didn't happen tonight that maybe disappointed you,
you expected to happen?  
CORI CLOSE: I think we have been talking -- I was talking to the team in the
locker room, in March everyone is going to know what everyone does. You know,
we know what they like to do, they know what we like to do. You're going to
have to go to your -- Tara said it -- they were asking her about her secret
sauce, she talks about how she takes away their first and second options, what
they like do the most.  
  
Everyone does that. We did that to them in the first half. Then who can move
to the third and fourth option? Who can stay patient in purpose later in the
shot clock? You know, the points in March always go down because it becomes
much more of half-court game, we're one of the most high-tempo games in the
country, but you have to in March be able to survive and grind it out with
more half court games when you're not able to get your transition game going.  
  
You're not going to turn people over in live ball situations as much in March.
The reality is that we didn't -- I don't think it's one person, I think it is
when they take away our first look at Michaela, they take away our first
isolation for Charisma, going down the line, what's our counter, the backside
of that action? What are we doing at seven seconds left in the shot clock
that's still together, putting people in positions of strength?  
  
I thought we got good actions and we weren't tough enough to finish them. We
got to be -- we didn't pass -- I mean, it sounds really simple but if you look
at really good offenses, they catch, screen and pass really well and with
rhythm, with purpose, and with awareness of whose around them, and we need to
grow in that because everybody's game plans will start with Japreece, Charisma
and Mikaela. Not everybody not that simple, we have to know what we're doing
and creating those together so we make a higher percentage of those shots .  
  
I really appreciate all of you guys and covering the tournament. This has been
one of the best years for Pac-12 women basketball not only on the courts but
in our coverage of telling the stories of the women. As frustrated as I am in
a loss that stings I'm very grateful for the work you put in and the way you
tell these stories.  
  
We need you. Our game needs you. We really appreciate how you're telling these
stories. Thank you for your work and for your efforts.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

### [Aari McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36596)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 88, Arizona - 70  
  
ADIA BARNES: Today we played a really good team. Oregon is one of the best
teams in the country with so many offensive weapons, and just really hard to
match up with.  
  
You know, you play a zone, they have shooters; you play man-to-man, they get
you in rotation. They're a really good team with a potential to win a
championship. Or go very, very far in the tournament. I'd be shocked if they
don't go to the Final Four.  
  
For us, of course, we wanted to win today. We wanted an upset. We knew we
would have to really play, bring our A game. But I'm not disappointed, we were
close at times, but a lot of the small mistakes, they don't win games against
the top three teams in the country, they win games against the top 20.  
  
So it is a learning lesson for us. We see where the bar is set really high. We
see where we're going to be in the near future and what it takes to get there.  
  
I'm glad that we're in this conference that can prepare us for the tournament.
I don't know any other conference where every other weekend you play teams
like Oregon but the Pac-12. So good and bad.  
  
Q. You anticipated a lot for quite a long time. Did it just get too hard
to keep answering? Because there was a point where they might hit a three, you
come down, hit a three, but then they come down and they hit -- you just get
in that cycle where they keep answering your answer?  
ADIA BARNES: I think there were small runs. I think the backbreaking moments
were the offensive rebounds. So there were times we played solid defense. I
think our defense was disrupting them for sure. I think our zone disrupted
them, our zone baseline out of bounds had them stagnant.  
  
Things that hurt: Offensive rebounds that Sabrina got in the first half. The
easy put-backs. Those were easy six, eight points that those are deflating and
those are tough, because you're locking down. At one point we were on defense
for a minute and 20 seconds, because of offensive rebounds, so those are the
mistakes that can't happen in these type of games.  
  
You know, we lost on the boards, I think 39-22. 14 offensive, I mean, if you
would have told me that, I would have said we would have lost by 40.  
  
You know, we just have to do a better job in that area.  
  
Q. Every year you have had success coaching at Arizona. Can you talk
about just the things you 're excited about in the future?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, haven't had success every year, we were bad a couple of
years ago. First year -- felt like a couple of years. Yes. Yes. So it is --
just kidding.  
  
Yes. We have gotten better every year. First year, it is the part of the
process of building a program. This is a first year with all my players. You
know, that took four years. We have gotten better because of young women like
this, Aari took a chance on Arizona, wanting to build something special, she
did that.  
  
Sam wasn't going to stay in the Pac-12, she was born in Michigan, thought
about going to Michigan. We reeled her in. She stayed in the Pac-12, and she's
built this program with us.  
  
So players like these have built the foundation.  
  
I said this in the last press conference, you know, it was a dream, it was a
vision of what Arizona was going to be like when we were there.  
  
We're no longer rebuilding, we're climbing, and the climb is fun. I'm seeing
what I want the climb to look like, that we'll look like this in a year or
two. I'm very happy with three graduating seniors. We're going to get there.
There is no doubt in my mind.  
  
I said that when I got to Arizona, we were going to be good. It wasn't a
matter of if, but a matter of when.  
  
We're going to get better in the next two weeks. You'll see a better team in
two weeks, and you'll see a team that will be successful in the tournament.  
  
Our program hasn't been in the tournament in 15 years. We're there. We have a
chance to host now. I'm excited about it. Normally Arizona, our season would
be over, it is not over this year. So, you know, we have prepared all season
long playing against the best teams in the country, so I feel and I hope they
feel too, we're prepared for the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think it was beneficial tonight that the refs let both
teams play a very physical type game to get you ready for the tournament?  
ADIA BARNES: I hate answering questions about the refs after a loss. I'm not
going to complain. We have really good officials, I thought we had a good
crew. I was happy with that crew.  
  
I thought there was some calls in the beginning, Aari was being bumped, it was
physical, also I think they let it play -- they let us be physical on both
end, I appreciate that. I prefer if it is going to be physical, you're not
calling a lot of fouls, I like that. I don't think there's ever been a half
this year we haven't shot a free throw, that's the first time. You know, it is
what it is.  
  
I don't -- it's never -- it never comes down to officials whether we lose, we
win, because we're smart enough, good enough defensively to make adjustments,
it is never a reason why regardless of the way it is called.  
  
So I think they did a good job. I think we have very good officials. I think
we just have really good players, and I think people when they watch women's
basketball they want to see dynamic scorers, they want to see it and this is
the type of product they want to see. They want to see Aari and Sabrina go
against one another, they want to see Sam and Satou. I like the way it is
officiated.  
  
Q. Did you guys expect that there would be 25 threes made tonight?  
ADIA BARNES: I expected Oregon would probably hit 25 threes. They shoot a lot
of threes. I didn't really -- I knew they were going to hit some threes, I
didn't -- I be thought we shot the three pretty well too.  
  
Yeah, i mean, they were 15 for 31, we played zone, 10-21. I'm not upset about
that stat at all. It is just I think for us, rebounding out of a zone is
difficult. Rebounding out of a box and one. I think if we did a little bit
better on the boards, I think we had a better chance to win the game.  
  
Q. I want to ask the players, I know you 're disappointed about tonight.
Two weeks from now you'll be playing in the NCAA Tournament, and I want to
know how excited you are about that?  
AARI McDONALD: I'm really excited, I haven't been to the tournament since
freshman year in Washington. I'm excited. I'm ready for my team and I to make
some noise.  
  
SAM THOMAS: I never have been. I'm really excited to go for my freshman year
and now junior year, we have potential to host it, I'm really excited.  
  
Q. I have to ask too, did you get proposed to after the game?  
ADIA BARNES: That was the highlight of the day, of the night. That's the only
thing that happened postgame.  
  
Q. Could you maybe walk us through what happened? A lot of people didn
't realize w hat was going on?  
AAR MCDONALD: We were walking off the court, and I see my brother gesturing,
like, hey, come here. He had his phone on. I'm like, what is he doing? And
then I seen my boyfriend, Devon. I'm like, wait. What? I looked at the sign,
will you marry me? With all my family there.  
  
ADIA BARNES: The whole family had signs.  
  
AARI McDONALD: I have never been speechless in my life. I literally had
nothing to say.  
  
ADIA BARNES: She couldn't say no, it was on TV. This is someone -- they're --
they're a very good couple. They have been together a long time. He's a great
man, and, you know, we all knew she would get married. I didn't know today,
honestly. But the head coaches are always left out of the loop. We knew that
it was just a matter of time, and we're happy for her.  
  
Q. Do you have the ring on right now?  
AARI McDONALD: I do.  
  
ADIA BARNES: He has good taste. She had to say yes. We're all very excited
with her. It was an exciting moment to share with Aari.  
  
Q. Tell us his name again?  
AARI McDONALD: Devon.  
  
ADIA BARNES: He played football at Arizona.  
  
Q. Can you beat him one on one?  
AARI McDONALD: Of course.  
  
Q. I have a basketball question for you, you brought up you have two
weeks off before you play, that 's a long time. Last year, how much better do
you think you got in the two weeks that you had between the conference
tournament and when you obviously went on an incredible run in the WNIT?  
ADIA BARNES: A lot better. I think -- multiple reasons. I think mentally just
to have a break is good. Physically, you know, we're a bit banged up, giving
Aari rest time, Dominique, Cate. It is good timing for that.  
  
Rebounding is a focal point, just getting up shots. I think it is a positive
-- it is a lot of time. I think it's a time to celebrate each other. It is a
fun time. I think the only bad thing for the players is they don't get a
spring break, but in this program we're not going to have a spring break
anymore from now on, we'll plan for that.  
  
I think it is just a time to -- we can get a lot better in two weeks and we'll
be better. We'll put in different types of defenses and work on the stuff we
do well so still working on our bright spots and we will be improved.  
  
Q. Lindsay sort of touched on this already, congratulations, Aari.  
AARI McDONALD: Thank you.  
  
Q. I wonder, going from a competitive moment to a very human moment in
life that 's such a shock, I'm sure you're still decompressing, but I'm sort
of interested in knowing how will you all celebrate as a team, personally with
your fiance, family, what happens from this moment from the presser on?  
AARI McDONALD: We'll probably go out to eat with my family. My teammates and
coaches are welcome.  
  
ADIA BARNES: We have to give her alone -- we haven't even had time to talk
about that. They'll have some free time tonight and have a curfew. Most of
them have families here, they'll all go with their families. They don't want
to hang out with their coaches. That's okay.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just wondering your thoughts on Sabrina 's game and just
how important she has been to basketball with her impact on and off the
court?  
ADIA BARNES: Sabrina is a phenomenal player. She's the best -- one of the best
point guards in the country. I think she made the best decision of her life,
and that was to stay in college. I think they would have been very different
if she would have gone pro because I think they have a chance to win a
championship.  
  
I'm proud that she came back and had unfinished business, her game has
improved from last year to this years. It has to. Playing in the WNBA is not
easy. She's been a great ambassador for our game. Things like speaking at
Kobe's funeral, different things and the way she's connected a lot of NBA
players to our game, it only helps our game and she's a good representative,
her work ethic, just who she is and how she leads her team is remarkable.  
  
It takes more than her. I think she's got a really great side kick, Ruthy, her
and Ruthy have had tremendous chemistry I have watched grown in the four
years. Then when you add Satou to that mix, they're dynamic. Not many teams
have a star point guard, a dominant post player shooting 70% and an All-
American and All-Star three that's 6'4". There's not too many great 6'4" wings
in the country.  
  
If you think years ago, the best wings that were that tall were Evan
(indiscernible) and the WNBA, Tamika Catchings, Lauren Jackson, those type of
players. But they're unique.  
  
So with three All-Americans and Naismith candidates and three top five WNBA
picks, they're a phenomenal tem. The catalyst and the person that started that
whole program and built Oregon with Kelly Graves was Sabrina.  
  
It is very similar to what Aari is doing in Arizona. Because we will get
players, and great players want to play with other great players. What it does
is it brought a player like Satou to be excited to come play at Oregon, and
they have done well. She had unfinished business, so for her to go and have a
possibility of winning a championship, I think it is a great thing, and
possibly to be Player of the Year. I think it is pretty remarkable for our
league also.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

### [Lacie Hull](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37085)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 68, Oregon State - 57  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First I would like to just say that this is a great win for
our team. Oregon State is a terrific team. They battled for 40 minutes. They
have grit players, and Scott does an outstanding job with his team.  
  
They're an extremely well-coached team. I thought we came out of the gate
fast. Lacie got us going with her three-point shooting, to be a double-digit
scorer for us. We count on her defense, and she worked very hard defensively
against excellent players.  
  
And Kiana, this is how she's playing, she's a March basketball player. She
kind of starts out, gets everybody involved, and then when it's time, she
asserts herself really well.  
  
I thought that Maya Dodson had a really big game for us, running the floor
hard, she was having 5-for-5 at halftime. Ended up having an excellent game
for us and just getting back. This is, like her seventh game back, and she's
doing really, really well.  
  
Q. Coach, you swept this team in the regular season, but both wins by
three points. How important, you touched a minute ago on, was it to come out
fast and sort of establish that dominance from the start?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I thought it was really important. I think at the end I
thought our team was trying to make it a three-point game again. I was like:
Wait a minute. Hey. We don't have do that.  
  
You know, again, they're a type of team that -- in this league, it prepares
you for this type of game. You know, basketball is a game of runs. And we came
out, and, again, Lacie I thought, key, but really got us out going. Knocking
down some big threes for us. We got the big lead. We need to really continue
to sustain those leads.  
  
Q. Kiana, can you talk about how you feel about how you have been
playing over these past few weeks? It seems you 're starting to put your foot
on the gas.  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I don't think anything has really changed beside me making
shots. I think early on in the season I wasn't shooting the ball well. My
teammates, they have confidence in me. My coaches have confidence in me. I
have to find that confidence within myself, and we're just playing hard for
each other.  
  
You know, March is all about winning. You have to up your play a little bit.
The stakes go up. It is win or go home. Yeah. Just we're playing hard for each
other, playing hard for our seniors and taking it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Kiana, you guys did a great job defending Slocum. She had hurt you
the first two games, even though you had won. And you obviously played
awesome. I wonder if Tara, anyone else, issued a challenge to you to be the
best guard on the floor tonight, to that teammate?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Tara does challenge me with that aspect. I take it upon myself
best to be the best guard on the court. Credit to Lacie and Anna. I didn't
really guard Slocum that much. She's a great player. Lacie and Anna, they did
a terrific job taking away what she likes to do, making it tough for her our.
Our bigs did a great job when they had to switch on her. It was a team effort.  
  
Q. Tara, looking at last night for Oregon State, they 're three-point
shooting is what put them ahead against WSU, tonight you guys held them at
bay, especially Tudor and Goodman, especially in that first half. Was that
just length and good match-ups, closing out? What do you attribute to how well
you defended those two especially from three?  
TARA VANDERVEER: What we try to do as a staff, and Tempie Brown was -- scouted
the team, and Tempie is an extremely knowledgeable basketball coach, we just
try to really identify what teams' strengths are and try to take away their
strengths, not allow them -- like, you know, I don't -- my mother is 92, and
she said: Guard Tudor. I mean, like, come on. Really?  
  
You know, you just have to know that you can't leave a great shooter like
Goodman, Tudor, Slocum open. And it is obviously a lot easier said than done.
I mean, Kiana worked hard to get through screens. Anna Wilson, Lexie and
Lacie. And they still got good looks.  
  
But the focus is take away the three-point shooting because they're so
efficient. Obviously that's not their only -- the only part of their game. If
you're coming out on them, they're attacking the basket. And, I mean, they're
just -- they're a very talented team, and I'm proud that our team stepped up
and got the job done.  
  
Q. Tara, this is not a fun question, but Coronavirus panic is sweeping
the nation. Earlier this week Stanford announced they were going to limit 150
spectators to each Stanford athletic event. Late tonight they announced they
would cancel in-person classes on Monday. How do you anticipate that affecting
the first and second rounds of the tournament? You think you 're still going
to be able to host? Are you ready to play in front of no people?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I guess, first of all, you know, we have to really appreciate
every single day that we are healthy and enjoy -- that's what I tell our team,
just play as hard as you can. You know, I think the Pac-12 has been working
really hard to sanitize everything. You know, we're washing our hands, you
know, I mean, as much as we can and everything.  
  
It's hard when we see like our friends, we are all hugging, we're trying not
to, but that's just I guess -- we may have to change some of that behavior.  
  
As far as Stanford, we have terrific leadership at Stanford, and we all have
confidence in the leadership at Stanford, and we're going with their -- we
know that our best interest is why they're making these decisions. So we're
just going to wait and see what happens, and hopefully none of our team or
none of our staff gets sick.  
  
Q. Tara, I know you take it one game at a time. I imagine it is probably
hard not to see those two teams, especially Oregon on the other side of the
bracket. Does it feel a little bit like last year in the sense where you know
you came off a big loss to them and then turned it around and came into the
tournament and ended up winning that championship game? Was there added
motivation from the last time you met, or does it feel at all like last
year?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm really excited that this is this year's team, and I'm
excited that we're playing in the semifinal game. You know, we didn't play as
well as we needed to against UCLA. I'm all about blue. You know, we have to
focus on doing what we have to do to be successful and to sit up here tomorrow
night and be excited about playing whatever team comes out of the other side
of the bracket.  
  
I don't look ahead. I don't watch video ahead. I just -- I'm very focused on
UCLA and us playing as well as we can tomorrow night. I hope our team is too.  
  
Q. Congratulations on the win. On Sunday we get to celebrate
International Women 's Day. I was wondering if each of you could share
someone, a woman that's impacted your life in a meaningful way. It doesn't
have to relate to hoops, just whomever has touched you.  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I'll start off with my mom. My mom is here. The love she has
for me is unconditional. The love I have for her is unconditional. My mom, my
grandma, my aunts, my nieces, you know.  
  
Tara does a great job of trying to support women in sports, and it shows with
the coaching staff. And we have a really huge family environment.  
  
Just off the top of my head, I'll say my mom.  
  
LACIE HULL: I'll piggyback off of that. I would also say my mom. She's taught
me so much growing up. I'm so thankful for everything she has done for me and
taught me.  
  
Also, I mean, we're surrounded by such amazing women that have impacted me in
so many ways, from our coaching staff to, I mean, all my professors and
grandma, Nana.  
  
I feel really blessed to be surrounded by such amazing women that teach me so
much and impact my life on a day-to-day basis.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I have to say my mom too. She's here, you know, she's 92 1/2
and cheering and everything and just -- also I'm inspired by the women I
coach, and just, you know, I learn things from Kiana and Lacie on our team. So
it's great to be celebrating, you know -- is it worldwide? Women's
International? That's awesome.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Mark Trakh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30760)

### [Endyia Rogers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38935)

### [Aliyah Jeune](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38936)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 73, USC - 66  
  
MARK TRAKH: Yeah, I'm really proud of these kids. They battled, they fought,
they have improved during the year. Like I said, we played five freshmen, a
sophomore and a senior for the last month of the season, and these kids just
grew up, and they played with a lot of poise, a lot of heart.  
  
They left everything out there on the floor today against No. 8 team in the
country, a great UCLA team.  
  
Just terribly proud of these kids, of Aliyah Jeune, sitting next to me here,
who came back from a solid knee injury about three weeks ago, and she's back
to help our team. And Endyia Rogers, who had a great game as a freshman, the
way she handled the pressure. And Kayla, who played her heart out.  
  
Just really proud of these kids and what they have done. They have come along
way. The future looks good. We'll hopefully make a run in the WNIT.  
  
But I'm really happy with these kids. I'm really happy with the resolve they
showed and the pride they showed and the fight they showed.  
  
So, you know, hats off to UCLA. You know, they're a great team. I love this
team. I love their culture, I love how together they are, and I love how they
fight. I can't say enough about my team. You know, just very, very proud of
them.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned WNIT. I 'm guessing Arizona ran last year as the
springboard to what they've done this year, are you hoping with a young team
you're doing the same thing, a good run there --  
MARK TRAKH: I just used the exact same words you used, springboard. You know,
I tell the team let's use it as a springboard like Arizona did. That's what we
intend to do. We're going to get a few days off and get ready for it.  
  
Q. Endyia, for you, tough, your teammates in foul trouble, you play with
so much pride, so much heart, wanting to give a spark. Not necessarily to take
the game over, but provide some kind of spark. At one point you had missed
eight or nine straight, you had some good looks, the ball was rattling in and
out. Is that tough for you when you 're coming down, to decide you're going to
dish, look for an open person, or take the shot yourself?  
ENDYIA ROGERS: No, it's not really tough for me. I just read what the defense
gives me. I knew I had to pick it up a bit because they were keying in on
Alissa. So when they take her away, I have to step up, and so do my teammates.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of that question, can you talk about what was going
through your mind when you saw Endyia taking over the game and you were trying
to tell her slow down, and you said slow down, she scored anyway?  
MARK TRAKH: Yeah, the reason I told her to slow down was because we were in a
2-for-1 situation. We wanted to make sure we got the 2-for-1, but she made the
bucket anyway, so we got the 2-for-1. I just needed her to -- we give her
freedom, but I need her not to force the issue too.  
  
You know, I need her to be smart when she goes and when she goes toe the hole.
It is the fine line between letting your kid have freedom and, at the same
time, not too much freedom.  
  
She's learning. She'll learn that as we move on.  
  
Q. You did pretty good taking care of the ball the first three quarters,
and things fell apart in the fourth. What happened in the fourth to cause all
of the turnovers that ended up leading to points for them?  
ALIYAH JEUNE: UCLA applied a lot of pressure. They're a pretty good defensive
team. So the pressure, they turned it up on us, and we were ratted at times.
But we're used to it. We played them twice already. So it is just unfortunate.
We turned the ball over. Just simple mistakes.  
  
MARK TRAKH: Yeah, we kind of -- playing as hard as we had to play last night,
we ran out of gas a little at the end there.  
  
Q. You had a phenomenal second half in that game, you know, leading the
team. Towards the end of the fourth quarter, I noticed you started to limp a
little bit with your leg. Is everything okay? Did you tweak it a little bit?
What do you think the status is?  
ALIYAH JEUNE: Everything is fine. My knee is still in the healing process, so
it just hurt a little bit, I had a cramp too. I'll be okay with this rest.  
  
Q. Endyia, how frustrating is it when you feel like the game is not
being properly called? How do you handle those situations? And you as a
freshman, what did you learn through this experience?  
MARK TRAKH: She probably can't comment on the officiating at all. You can
comment on your play.  
  
ENDYIA ROGERS: Well, I mean, we just have to play through it, stay poised
throughout everything, and just keep moving.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, Michaela took over for them, she scored 18 of their
final 29 points. When you 're in foul trouble hike that, Coach, you see her
take over, is there anything you can do other than tell them to get in the
way?  
MARK TRAKH: When we start out, our player-to-player defense was good in the
first quarter, but then we got in foul trouble and had to go to the zone. That
opened it up for Chou to make some threes.  
  
Had we not gotten into foul trouble, we would have never gone to that zone.
For a number of reasons. We have a short bench. So by fouling, we have to sub,
we have to put people in different positions that hadn't practiced those
positions, and we had to zone, and we're a player-to-player team because we
have to protect our players. So the foul trouble really affected the game.  
  
Q. Aliyah, you 're a senior, so you guys get to go to the WNIT. I know
you were probably hoping for a NCAA when you came here, but for you, these are
your last games, what are your emotions and what do you tell some of your
teammates who are just freshman, like Endyia, as you go into this WNIT
tournament soon?  
ALIYAH JEUNE: You know, this loss is a little encouraging, you know, because
it's like we have momentum, we know we gave everything. We have another
opportunity to play together as a team. We'll be well rested. We'll be going
over our sets and all the extra we need to do.  
  
We're going to go into this WNIT with a winning mindset and a lot of momentum
to win the whole thing.  
  
Q. On Sunday we 're all going to celebrate International Women's Day.
I'm wondering if each of you can speak about an important female figure in
your life. It doesn't have to be tied to basketball, just somebody that's
really touched you.  
ALIYAH JEUNE: Well, of course the most important figure in my life is my mom.
She's my rock, my motivation, and she's always, you know, been in my corner.
So that's who I would pick.  
  
ENDYIA ROGERS: My mom is my motivation as well. She keeps me going, gives me
encouraging words. When I'm down, she's always there. She helps me with
everything literally. I do everything for her.  
  
MARK TRAKH: Same question? Can you repeat the question? Yeah. My girlfriend,
Carmen Garza, who is like the team mom and just a very strong, independent
woman. She's a federal judge out of Las Cruces. She's been a lawyer, she's
been a public figure, she's strong and she's a good role model for our kids.
She's around them all the time helping them, mentoring them. So I would have
to give a shoutout to my girlfriend, Carmen Garza.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Charmin Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16117)

### [Jazlen Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38914)

### [Jaelyn Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34704)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 86, California - 73  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: Well, obviously, we're disappointed that, you know, our journey
comes to an end today, but super proud of the team that we were all year.
Proud of the fight that we showed, the growth that we showed and, you know,
proud of the tone that our seniors set for this program and the foundation
that was established. Thank you.  
  
Q. Jazzy, I saw you nodding your head at your coach. I would love for
you to talk about, you just fished off your first Pac-12 campaign, what you
learned from both of the people sitting besides you up there?  
JAZLEN GREEN: Starting with my senior, I learned about the growth that happens
between the time you get here and the time you leave and what you can
accomplish. She taught me a lot about, like, my will, what I can do myself,
and having her for -- to display what type of player I can be and, when I put
in the work and stuff, how I can come out of that, is what she taught me most,
which I thank her so much for. I'm going to miss it too.  
  
Charmin, this is new, I got three more years with her. She just taught me to
keep being a fighter. No matter what. You step up to the plate, you have all
of these opportunities, and it is up to you whether or not you take those
opportunities.  
  
And she basically just over the time I have been playing and, like, started
the season was like: Take your opportunity. Stand your ground and approach it,
be a fighter that you are.  
  
Q. Flipping that one around to you two, Jazlen Green got her first
Pac-12 start at Oregon in front of a sell-out crowd, and balled out. From the
time she arrived on campus until today, what 's it like seeing her growth?
Charmin?  
CHARMIN SMITH: I think, you know, Jazzy just has this light about her, and she
always is smiling. And I think the reason she's been able to grow so fast in
her freshman year is that she is not afraid to make a mistake. And she owns
it. She's extremely coachable.  
  
And I think that's allowed her to speed up the process in terms of her
development. You know, she doesn't back down from a challenge. So Oregon,
she's, like -- we were just talking about it on the way over here, we want
another shot at them, you know. She's a competitor.  
  
I think the ability to take criticism, to laugh at yourself, and just to not
take yourself too seriously is what helps her step up and keep fighting time
and time again.  
  
JAELYN BROWN: Charmin pretty much said it all. I can be on Jazzy too, me
trying to be a leader, she just takes it on the court, off the court. We're
just trying to help her out, she understands, like, her role and her
abilities.  
  
Q. Jaelyn, we have talked about how much Jazzy has grown, how much have
you grown in your time here and with Charmin?  
JAELYN BROWN: I really think I have grown into like being a leader and just,
like, trying to get the freshmen acclimated, just being a college women's
basketball player, trying to help them through everything. That would be my
thought.  
  
Q. Charmin, with all of the ups and downs this year, and there have been
a lot of ups, and everything that goes with the first year as a head coach,
how would you describe your first year here?  
CHARMIN SMITH: It's been a lot of fun. I really have loved it. I know we
didn't, you know, get as many wins as some other teams out there. I have told
this group several times, like, you know, I don't want to be Kelly Graves, I
don't want to be, you know, Tara, anyone else, I'm so happy to be coaching the
team that I had the privilege to coach.  
  
You know, as a first-time head coach, I think it's really important, like,
that your team show belief in you, and every single day they just made me feel
more and more confident because they stuck with me and they continued to work
hard, even though we weren't getting the wins, and that was extremely helpful
and it made it a lot easier and I think it helped my growth as well.  
  
Q. Coach, first year obviously coaching this team, do you have a
favorite moment that really stood out to you that you can describe on, reflect
on, now that the season has kind of come to a close?  
CHARMIN SMITH: A favorite moment, gosh. There are a lot that come to mind. You
know, I think Cailyn's big free throws against Arkansas, I think of Jaelyn,
the putback against Arizona just last week, I think of the team rushing me,
you know, at the -- hmm, on set -- thank you. Thank you, Jazzy -- on set
there.  
  
So we have had a lot of special moments. But overall, I think it is just going
to be the feeling every single day that we had when we were on the bus, you
know, in the locker room, just the fact that it's always felt like a family.
And even when we had lost I think eight, nine in a row, we were still enjoying
one another.  
  
And those are the things that are most precious to me because there are going
to be more wins, there are going to be more losses, that stuff is going to
happen with different players and such, but I do not take for granted the
positive attitude and the togetherness that this squad had during the really
rough Pac-12 play.  
  
Q. This Sunday is International Women 's Day. I wondered if you would
each take a moment to celebrate a special woman in your life or a mentor.
Doesn't have to be hoops related, just whomever you want to give love to.  
JAELYN BROWN: Honestly, Charmin Smith, she's been a leader and just shows me
every day how hard she works, day in and day out, and I just appreciate her,
her effort and commitment to our team.  
  
JAZLEN GREEN: I will go next. As much as I love Charmin, I have to say my
grandmother. She's a very hardworking lady. She's very gritty, strong,
independent lady. And she just goes for what she wants, ambitious, and never
puts her head down. Grammy, I love you.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: I'm going to name a few, and kind of all. Like, I hope I don't
forget anyone, but from Adia to Charli, to Tara, Jody, JR, everyone, Lynne,
everyone has been -- Cori, thank you, everyone has been extremely supportive
of me in my first year, even when we have gotten a win over a couple of them,
and that just made me feel really special.  
  
And it is something I'll never forget; that the women in this conference were
-- you know, they had my back and they were happy for me. And when we were
down and we couldn't get a win, I got text messages from people saying hang in
there, and it really meant a lot.  
  
So I think every female head coach in this conference, I'm grateful for them
and I'm so proud to be a part of this Pac-12 Conference as a head coach.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 68, Oregon State - 57  
  
SCOTT RUECK: I was really proud of our team for battling how they did tonight.
I thought, I mean they played a phenomenal second half to battle back and they
just showed the heart that they have. It is a very, very special group and I'm
very proud of them, playing very good basketball.  
  
You have to give Stanford a lot of credit. They came out, set the tone
shooting the ball so well right off the bat. Put us in a hole. I thought we
pressed a little bit in that first quarter offensively as we tried to respond.  
  
And, you know, give them credit defensively as well for making us
uncomfortable. And so a lot of credit to them. And then Kiana seemed to make
every play they needed to keep us at bay. So once again, you know, she seems
to really enjoy playing against Oregon State for whatever reason.  
  
But they did a great job on the boards. We outrebounded them the first two
games, and they got us this game. We used our small lineup a lot. So that had
something to do with that.  
  
I loved the fight and the tenacity that we played with to give ourselves a
chance to get back in this game. We had a shot to get it to five with a couple
of minutes. So that just speaks volumes about who these people are, and I'm
proud of them.  
  
Q. Actually, for Mikayla and Destiny, what 's your perspective on
getting in the hole quickly and how hard it is to climb out of that,
especially with such a big momentum push from them at the beginning of the
game? And then also defensively what they were doing that was working?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, it is never the start you want. We dug ourselves a big
hole early, and you want to get out to the best start possible to give your
team a great start to win the game.  
  
When you're down, all you can do is chip away and try to make momentum and get
as close as we can throughout the rest of the quarters. And it was a big fight
at the end, but when we dig ourselves that big of a hole, it is hard to come
back from.  
  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Defensively we were getting the shots we wanted, we had to
come off, hit those. I mean, take care of the ball. That was one big thing in
the first half. So I don't think they really did a ton to disrupt us, we have
to come off a little bit more confident.  
  
Q. Scott, looking at what Cal was able to do last night, and Aleah has
been such a threat from three as a spot-up shooter over the course of the
season, what was it that they were able to do in the first half? Was that
length on the perimeter? Closing out? Where were they able to be so disruptive
when you were trying to spot up there?  
SCOTT RUECK: If you've watched our games over the last ten years, you know
that we take each other's strengths away for the most part. You know, they --
they choose to take the three away. They just chased us everywhere and hugged
us all over the three-point line. They were committed to it. They didn't help
off our shooters.  
  
We have to beat them other ways. Taylor was limited tonight because of foul
trouble. And so we didn't have an inside presence like normal. So then that
made it tougher. And so that made us beat them off the dribble. And they're
long, and they're good defenders.  
  
And so these are two programs that's identity is built with just a stingy
defense. And then efficient offense for the most part. So, you know, that's
what we pretty much do to each other all the time.  
  
You know, last time we played at their place, I got the same question, you
know, a few weeks ago at Stanford. Then I just reminded people, you know, when
Karlie Samuelson was playing a couple years ago, we chased her off of the
three-point line. You have a shooter like that, she didn't get one attempt up
that game.  
  
And so we assumed that would be a focal point of their defense, not only based
upon last night, but historically.  
  
Q. One for Mikayla and one for Scott.  
Mikayla, with the smaller lineup, one, what opens up, what do you see that
's a good thing for you guys out there? And secondly, what are the additional
challenges that you might face when you downsize?  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, challenges, rebounding, and then defensively I thought we
did a pretty good job on guard versus post match-up, keeping their post out,
but it is a mismatch, they tried to look at that. And I was proud of how we
fought defensively.  
  
But creating space offensively, trying to exploit their post on the guard
match-up, and then spot up and shoot. And when they help inside, off of those
post drives, when we drive, the posts are there, that's the advantage.  
  
But, yeah, we didn't do a very good job of taking advantage of what they were
giving us today.  
  
Q. Scott, the opportunity for Madi because of injuries, how is the
demand on her changed in this new role? What do you see from her now as you
head into the NCAAs with her as your starter now?  
SCOTT RUECK: She's dynamic. When Kennedy went down, she moved in the starting
line-up. She was there a year ago at the five, you know, and this year moved
back to the four and played some five as well.  
  
So undersized certainly at this level to be a back-to-the-basket post player,
but that's where she is. You know, she has the ability to knock shots down.
She's one of the smartest players I have coached. She knows our system inside
and out from both positions.  
  
You know, tonight you saw her switch. We're able to manipulate defenses just a
little bit differently and a little more flexibility with her out there
because she's played some three in her time at Oregon State.  
  
So she identifies as, you know, a wing to the five. So she makes us very
versatile. And when she's playing energized like tonight and she's such a
factor on the boards, she's dynamic look for us.  
  
Q. Scott, tough loss, but Mik did something special tonight in becoming
the programs all-time leading rebounder, and for roughly 80% of her career she
's been a guard for you. I just wondered when you recruited her, you knew she
was good, a big-time recruit, but did you ever imagine that she would do that
as a rebounder?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's incredible. Congrats, Mik.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Thank you.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: An unbelievable accomplishment. And, no, I -- that's something --
I knew she was a great rebounder. That's one of the things that just stands
out, you know, when I watched her, stood out when I watched her play high
school ball, AU ball, my goodness, she has an effortless way of gliding around
the floor and swooping in to get every 50/50 ball, it seems.  
  
And it is just one of those things, you know, Jamie Weisner was on our team at
the time, and I thought that Jamie was the best guard rebounder I had ever
coached, just because of her effort and desire. And I'm like, I think Mik
might be better.  
  
I couldn't imagine coaching somebody that competed from a guard position
harder for boards. And so here Mik is surpassing Ruth, you know, to be the
all-time career rebounding at Oregon State. That's a phenomenal
accomplishment, one that kind of defies logic, actually. But it doesn't, if
you know Mik. She's just -- she has the hugest heart, and I think it's --
she's near the top of several categories statistically in Oregon State
history.  
  
But how cool that she's the career leader in rebounding, because it is the
most selfless thing you can do. And that's who she is. I think it is very
fitting.  
  
Q. I have to ask a follow-up. Mik, you 're pretty much emotional right
now. Can you tell us what's going through your mind?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah. Just sad that we lost. The individual stuff doesn't
really mean as much to me, just sad that our team doesn't get to play more in
this tournament.  
  
So couldn't do more for our team, and that's why I'm sad.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Unselfish.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk about having time off, being able to regroup,
circle the wagons a little bit and still having hosting on the table and your
case for why you think you 'll still be in that mix?  
SCOTT RUECK: I mean, I think if you look at the teams we lost to, we have one
bad loss, you know, when you look at everything, and the way that team is
playing now, it doesn't look quite maybe as bad as people think. And also the
circumstances around that loss, we just had lost Kennedy. You know, that's a
team that jams the ball to the post. It was a tough match-up in a tough time
for our team.  
  
I think everybody has seen how competitive we have been all year. You know,
this team has been on the cusp of being ranked number one to pushing top ten
teams to the limit all year long.  
  
Now I feel, you know, we're playing great basketball. You know, it takes a top
five team to beat us, it is kind of what it seems, or some odd circumstances.
You know, so this team has been through the wars. We're playing our best.
We're more prepared than ever. And the conference has done that for us.  
  
So grateful for the battles. You know, and this team has a lot of talent, a
lot of ability, and a lot of great times ahead. And so we're excited for that.
It's going to be fun to see a team that's not a part of our conference. I
think we're all excited about that.  
  
Q. Scott, just to piggyback off of that a little bit, do you guys care
where you go in the tournament besides being at home for the first three
rounds? Does it matter which of the four regions you go to? Potentially, if
you stay in Portland, you have to face Oregon, which would be a conference
team --  
SCOTT RUECK: Are they asking my opinion? Do I get a say in this? Is that how
this is working?  
  
Q. It 's your chance to give your case.  
SCOTT RUECK: I saw Jeff's comment today, so maybe he's choosing his spot, but,
you know, I think this team deserves to be home, there's no doubt about that
in my mind based upon everything to this point.  
  
So that does matter to me, you know, that this team gets to compete on their
home floor. I think it is deserved. And beyond that, you know, I can't -- I
don't believe I get to pick my shot. You know, I'm excited to get -- to keep
playing.  
  
Q. Scott, I was going to bring it back to the game for just another
second. Stanford is a little healthier than they were, even a few weeks ago,
with Dodson back and Lacie Hull as healthy as she 's been in a while. Does
their depth become an issue later in the game, that they have the size and the
length, but now they also are a really deep team?  
SCOTT RUECK: I mean, I think that team is so deep that they have been deep
even with injuries. I don't think it factored in tonight at all actually. I
think if anything we look like the more energetic team down the stretch.  
  
I thought our fourth quarter was phenomenal. I loved our energy. At this time
of the year, you're not going to have back-to-back games other than, you know,
conference tournament. So I think depth is a little bit overrated once you get
into the tournament itself.  
  
So conference tournament, though, I think it is a factor, ultimately. Three
games in three days or four, I think depth absolutely can factor into that.  
  
Once you get in the NCAA Tournament, I don't see it quite as much. It is nice
-- I'm happy that their team is back to healthy, and Dodson really played well
tonight.  
  
Q. I know you would like to still be playing, at least you still have a
week, week and a half here before you really get back into tournament play.
Scott, you mentioned how much of a grind Pac-12 play is. Is it nice to at
least kind of have some time to sit and reassess, get healthy, refocused ahead
of the tournament?  
SCOTT RUECK: No.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Much prefer playing.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: No. We would rather be playing Sunday night. That would still
give us plenty of rest.  
  
Q. This weekend is International Women 's Day, and I wonder if each of
you would highlight a woman in your life or a mentor or model that's inspired
you and please share their name, if you can.  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I probably would say my mom, Christina. She's been my rock,
you know, sacrificed a lot for me to have this opportunity, battled a lot,
raised five kids pretty much on her own. So she's my -- my model for sure.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: You're next.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I mean, the most impactful teachers in my life have been
females. You know, I don't know if I responded better to female growing up,
but they were just awesome.  
  
So Mrs. Berry, Mrs. Day, Barb Customoano (phonetics) at Oregon State.  
  
And then, you know, I can't not say my mom. I mean Mary Lou is here every
night, you all know her. You know, I also had Mary Jamison, my grandma, and
ElleMae Rueck (phonetics), all rocks in our family, all of them.  
  
So my sister is the one, though, that taught me what a female athlete could
do. I was -- she's four years younger than me. I go off to college, and, you
know, I drug her out to the driveway for years, sometimes she wanted to be
there, sometimes she didn't, sometimes it would end in two minutes and she
would go running in the house mad at me and then right back out there five
minutes later, but she became a state champion and All-State player and then
NAIA All-American.  
  
And she taught me what a female athlete could be. She cared more than any guy
I ever saw, worked harder than any guy I ever saw. It taught me that a female
athlete can -- it is just an athlete.  
  
So that has shaped my perspective of how to coach and how to hold them
accountable and how to hold them to what I know they're capable of. At the
same time, you know, to love them and care and to build a relationship and let
them know that, you know, I've got your back, but you can do more. They're
like wow, you know, I can. That's what those teachers did for me. They showed
me what I was capable of.  
  
So I could talk a long time about it, as it sounds like, but that's an awesome
question and I'm grateful to do what I do.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I like to talk about Stephanie Tastad, my cross country and
field and track coach in high school. She's somebody that is one of the most
positive people there is, always looking for what she can do to help other
people feel better or feel more confidence about themselves.  
  
And she went to my high school as well. She was a state champion in cross
country and track, and so she just is a role model in my life and somebody
that I still keep in touch with.  
  
Q. For Scott and the players, obviously you want to keep playing, but
you 're going to have almost two weeks off. How much better can you get in two
weeks, Scott, do you think? Can you get a lot better in practice in that time?
I know you'll take time off because their bodies need rest.  
SCOTT RUECK: I think an example of that was two years ago, Marie's senior
year, we had had a good run, third in that league or something, we adapted --
we changed actually quite a bit over that time. And that was our run, you
know, where we beat Tennessee and beat Baylor, you know, we played our best
basketball at the end.  
  
That's what I think anybody who has watched this team has sensed. We ran into
a buzz saw tonight, and you have to give Stanford credit. But this team has
played good basketball over the stretch. I feel like we're in the best
coach/player learning situation we have been in all year, the receptiveness in
practice, the way that they're evolving, the way that they're communicating.  
  
I don't know if you watched our time-outs, if anyone ever focuses on time-
outs, to see how much input is coming from the team. That's my favorite thing.
That's my favorite part of this job, is when everything starts to turn over to
them. And that has happened more over the last couple of weeks, three weeks,
once we have kind of gotten into a rotation now that's been sustainable for a
while.  
  
Our best is ahead. I think we can get not only better, but just I think we can
maybe shift some things and give people different looks, and I think we're as
mobile as we have been. I'm excited about that.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Lynne Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30341)

### [Brynna Maxwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38872)

### [Lola Pendande](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38919)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 79, Utah - 59  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: First off, congrats to Oregon. I thought -- obviously, you
don't need me to sit up here and tell you how good they are, how talented they
are. So congratulations to them.  
  
I think as I have said, I do think they, you know, have the potential to win
the whole thing, national championship. A few teams in our conference that
have that potential. So congratulations to them. I wish them all the luck.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. You know, the score may not be indicative of
kind of the fight that was out there. And, you know, other than that second
quarter, they hit eight threes, and I think we had eight, nine turnovers. We
played them completely even in the first, third and fourth.  
  
I'm proud of our young players for that. And this is just a great experience
for these guys in that environment and that atmosphere as we move forward. I'm
excited about, as I just told them, I'm proud of them, I was -- I was proud to
coach them today. Every minute of it I enjoyed because they just -- they
emptied their tank. They gave it everything they had. They followed the game
plan. They just -- they represented our program really, really well.  
  
We will regroup and, you know, in a weird way I'm excited to get to work this
offseason and we'll get a little break, but we have such a talented, exciting
young core that I'm really, really looking forward to working with.  
  
So kudos to Oregon. They're just tough. But I'm really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that that second quarter, I think Utah -- sorry,
I think Oregon rattled off eight straight three-pointers. Can you and you
ladies also talk about kind of what happened in that span, how that ended up
happening?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: They turn your mistakes into points quickly. I don't know -- I
haven't looked at the film obviously. I would guess half of those were in
transition off of a turnover of ours. Usually those things go hand in hand,
you turn it over, you give their playmakers and shooters a chance to just
sprint and line it up.  
  
I know it was correlated with our transition D -- it is hard to get back on
defense off of a live ball turnover, especially with their speed. So that was
part of it.  
  
The other part of it was our pick-and-roll coverage, they started to figure
out, and they were shooting behind the screen. And so in the second half, as
an adjustment, we changed our pick-and-roll coverage.  
  
We were worried about their post play, pocket passes, so we were going under
screens, and they just kind of rolling the dice with the threes, which they
were hitting. So we changed our pick-and-roll coverage, and they had two in
the second half. That's what happened in that stretch.  
  
Q. Brynna, what felt different this time against Oregon, and what are
the biggest lessons you 're taking, getting to play a team like this up close
and personal that you want to take as you get ready for your next couple years
at Utah?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Next three years, not two.  
  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: Kind of the theme for our team all year has been rebounding,
and we have struggled with that both times we played Oregon. We had also
struggled with turning the ball over, and like Coach Rob said, second quarter
we turned the ball over a lot.  
  
I think overall we outrebounded them, I don't know, the whole game, but a
couple of quarters I know we did. We took care of the ball really well. And I
think we just played a solid 40-minute game.  
  
One of the goals this game was to leave it all on the floor, and I think we
did. I think every player on that team poured their heart out, and I'm really
proud of them.  
  
Q. I got two questions for you, coach and the players. Coach, it was a
point in time you all were down 13 in the fourth quarter, and you left your
role players in. Were you trying to get them experience, any thought process
behind that?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: A good question. I don't know that they are -- you know, it is
about -- I left our seniors in, let our seniors play, and I put Brynna back
in. But, you know, Kemery Martin is someone we anticipate to be a big part of
our growth in the future. And next year when we're here, she'll be playing a
lot. I wanted to give her those minutes.  
  
And we were rolling. It's not like she wasn't getting it done. So I would
defend her to -- I don't know what the saying is -- defend her to the end. I
thought she did a really nice job in that fourth quarter, and it is just great
experience.  
  
And, you know, Dru is dog tired too, and she played so hard. Yeah, I thought
that fourth quarter we -- I don't know what the score -- we were tied. Yeah,
we just got in a big hole with that second quarter. I was proud of everybody
that played.  
  
Q. And also, Brynna and Lola, you all pretty much weren 't playing like
freshmen. Can you talk about your experience and some things you can take in
going into the next year?  
LOLA PENDANDE: Well, I think things that we can take to the next year,
especially for me because I'm an international player, is the roles, the
toughness of the game and how the referees work, and then just work through
it, work harder than I have been working throughout my whole career and go get
them next year.  
  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: I think, too, we have such a young team, it was really good
for a bunch of the underclassmen to get minutes going into the next few years
because it is going to be kind of the same lineup for the next few years
coming. And I think having that experience, as freshman and sophomores, under
our belt is going to be huge for us going in the next few years.  
  
Q. Brynna, can you talk a little bit about obviously Sabrina Ionescu is
an outstanding player. You guarded each other throughout the game. What 's it
like? What can you take from playing against a caliber of a player like that?
What's it meant to you as a freshman to get that chance since if she had
declared for the WNBA, then you wouldn't have gotten to this year?  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: She's definitely an amazing player. She's very smart. She can
make reads that, I mean, are insane. And it is almost impossible to guard her
in the pick-and-roll because they're so good at making those reads.  
  
It was definitely fun getting to play against her. I was telling the kids, I'm
playing against Sabrina, you can watch me play on TV. Going into freshman
year, I was hoping she stayed so I had a chance to play against her. She's
definitely a great player for sure.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: That's a good example of Ruthy, Sabrina, they have played
together for four years, there's -- that's something that you don't see all
the time in terms of that caliber. I think we have freshman like that too. So
you keep a group together like that, by the time they're seniors, they are,
you know, tough to stop.  
  
Q. Lynne, Kelly just referenced your relationship, how long you have
known each other. What 's your view of what they have done this year? And he
mentioned your offense too and how creative you are. In a way you're both
teams that are pushing the needle and kind of growing that area of the game.
One, what's your view of what they have done to get better and to be so good
when they're the hunted for multiple years in a row, and maybe what you want
to take, that you highlight for the team, maybe beyond scoring, the three-
pointers and all of that?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Sure. Yeah. Kelly is a good friend. He's been a mentor of mine.
You know, we talk. And he's always just been really supportive of me, which I
appreciate. Even when I was a punk college kid, he was supportive of me.  
  
He's a phenomenal X's and O's guy. I think one thing I appreciate and take
from him is that he keeps it pretty simple. And I mean that in the most -- it
is the highest of compliments.  
  
I think basketball is a pretty simple game when you think about it. You know,
beat your man. If you do and someone helps, then make a pass to the open man.
Like, that's kind of it.  
  
And he has a way -- obviously recruiting is a huge part of their -- the reason
they're so good, it is that they have recruited really well. But he keeps it
really simple and, you know, there's -- he'll find something to exploit or if
you're doing this, then he's going to counter with that.  
  
And it is kind of like a chess match, boxing match. And I have learned from
him on that. I study what they do. You know, we run similar stuff in terms of
ball screens and trying to attack, you know, a defensive coverage.  
  
But, yeah, I think what they have done in the last four years has been pretty
remarkable, even the fans, the following they have created, I think they
outdraw their men now. I think it is -- it is just impressive. He's a
tremendous leader.  
  
Q. Lynne, you mentioned Oregon and four years with these players, and
you said the words tough to stop. You have something special with these
underclassmen.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah.  
  
Q. And so many years to go with them. What 's the identity right now if
you were to describe this team and what they have accomplished? What's your
team's identity?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I think right now the word I would use is just kind of
resilient, for lack of a better one. I think, you know, I want to coach
exciting basketball.  
  
In terms of on the court, I want to coach exciting basketball. We'll score,
get out and run, and that's going to be our philosophy on the floor. I want to
coach tough teams too.  
  
As we continue to recruit the way we're recruiting, getting these high caliber
players, if we keep them together, keep them healthy and all pointed in the
right direction -- I don't want to be an underdog forever.  
  
You know, I want -- you have to be resilient, and you have to be talented to
not -- you know, I think that's -- in reference to your question as well, I
think Oregon as the hunted, that's hard to do, to maintain. To not have slips
and stuff, that's impressive.  
  
They just keep pushing and finding new things, and that's kind of -- I don't
want to be an underdog forever. I told my team, too, let's push forward and
keep these guys, you know, work, having a great offseason.  
  
But I think resilient. We have gotten knocked on our tail a few times this
season playing powerhouses that are senior driven, senior led. These guys,
they have gotten back up and keep swinging. So I can deal with that.  
  
Q. On Sunday all of us will be celebrating International Women 's Day,
so I wonder if each of you, especially Lola, could share a woman that you
admire that's inspired you. Doesn't need to be tied to basketball, just
somebody that's important to your life.  
LOLA PENDANDE: The woman that is important to me would be my friends that I
grew up with, because they're big feminists. Thanks to them I'm starting to
get in this world feminist and supporting women.  
  
And now that I'm playing basketball, and seeing throughout my career, I see
the men always get more. I never realized this. Men always get more fans, they
get better gear, anything is better than we get. Even us, because I play for
the national team, I have more medals than the men, and we still get less paid
than they do or fans than they do.  
  
I put on my social media all the time anything to support women. I don't care
whatever people say. Like, you're not going to change the world, my brother
says that to me, that's not going to change in a day. And I'm like: I don't
care. I'm working for progress. I know as long as everyone sees it, and I get
support, then I'm happy with that.  
  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: Preach. For me, I'm going to have to say my mom, actually,
more personal note on that. She played basketball. She played basketball in
college, and she kind of got me started playing basketball, and she used to
coach me until I think I was 8 or 9 -- no, until I was 11, actually.  
  
She was my number one fan, number one supporter. She's -- I mean, you probably
don't know this, but my team jokes about it, both of my parents come to almost
every single game this season. It is cool to look in the crowd and see my mom
smile, filming. Yeah, she -- I definitely look up to her.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I could name a lot of people. I think as I sit here today and
in this profession, this opportunity, you know, I think I want to highlight
Tara, just how impactful she has been. I grew up in Northern California, she
was at Stanford, and she must have lost my phone number in the recruiting
process because she didn't call. I don't know. We moved, she probably lost it.  
  
But I remember growing up wishing that I could play there and just having the
most respect for her and just kind -- what I respect about her most, obviously
she's an incredible coach, that goes without saying, again, I don't need to
sit up here and tell you all that.  
  
She's such an advocate for women. I can call her any time and she'll give me
advice. And she's so supportive. And I respect that somebody at the top is not
threatened by anybody that's trying to catch them.  
  
And as women we need to do that more to each other. Women need to help each
other out, support each other, even if it is somebody that might be a threat.
I respect so much that confidence and that big picture mentality. I would
highlight her.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Satou Sabally](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34731)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 79, Utah - 59  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, I want to congratulate Lynne and her team on a
well-played game. I thought they played really, really hard. Lynne is one of
my best friends. I respect who she is and how she coaches and what she's done
with that program.  
  
They're a good, young basketball team. You know, they got their first win I
think -- she got her first win in this tournament. They're the type of team
that will continue to be better and better and be up towards the top of this
conference soon.  
  
Happy for the win. A little displeased on how we played. I thought we were
inconsistent at times in our effort and our execution. We still won the game.
I thought after that first quarter had it under control the whole time. We
just didn't have that killer instinct tonight and we didn't put them out when
we had a chance.  
  
Then again, you have to credit them. You know, overall, we're just happy. I
think this time of the year, you take the good with the bad, you just want to
make sure you're playing the next day, and we're playing the next day. That
part we do feel good about.  
  
Q. Coach, that first -- the first quarter, was it just a little bit --
they played yesterday, maybe had some fresher legs, were in game mode, whereas
you guys -- it was the first game of the tournament, or they were just playing
well?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think a little of both probably. You know, we have been
playing really, really well. This is one of the first games in the last maybe
16 or 17 where we just didn't play our best. We weren't in sync really
defensively or offensively.  
  
Then we came out in that second quarter and, you know, played like we're
capable of playing. I think we outscored them 18, 19 points that quarter. I
don't know. We have been actually a really good starting team. We just weren't
today. So we'll have to figure out why and hope to fix it.  
  
Q. Sabrina, in the second quarter you guys had I think eight three-
pointers, but was it the defense that really got things going? That seemed
like you had a bit of problem with that in the first quarter and got it
fixed.  
SABRINA IONESCU: We were getting stops on the defensive end and, you know, our
bench players that came in helped us tremendously. They were getting in
passing lanes, getting steals that helped us get transition shots, and our
guards were shooting the ball well.  
  
Defensively really fueled our offense -- our offensive shots. And, I mean, we
were getting shooters in the right position, and they were shooting it like we
normally do. So defense played a huge role in that.  
  
Q. Sabrina, as a senior, this is your last time around in the Pac-12
Tournament. What difference are you feeling being here now compared to the
last couple of years?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, just the familiarity with being in this position and
having been here for the last three years, knowing what it is like to win and
knowing what it is like to lose as well.  
  
Coming in every game, trying to be mentally prepared, getting the team
mentally prepared, and really understanding that it is 0-0 when you come in.
Everybody has an opportunity to beat you, and every team will try do that. We
have a target on our back. We have to make sure we play to our level of
expectations and we don't let, you know, us go down or up based on who we're
playing.  
  
It's always about us and what we can control. And now that we have this first
game out of the way, I think we'll keep building from here.  
  
Q. Sabrina, for you, there was a point in the first quarter you came
down and dished across, I think Erin missed it, it was a turnover, Kelly
looked at you and said shoot that. It was a while before you took your fifth
attempt anyway. Is it important for you to get everybody involved, knowing
your game will come around at some point? Obviously you want to get everyone.
How important is that for you to get everybody else involved first?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I do try and get everybody involved, but sometimes that
doesn't always help us, and that doesn't always help me. I really just need to
be reading the defense and taking what they're giving me and understanding
that, in the flow of our offense, everybody is going to get involved at some
point.  
  
I think it is something that I need to continue to work on, just let the game
come to me, not rush getting everybody else involved.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you said prior to the season that you came back for
unfinished business. Obviously last year you all lost in the Pac-12 Tournament
to Stanford. Is winning the Pac-12 Tournament just part of that unfinished
business?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah. I mean, there's so much that goes into that. I mean, we
just won one. Now we have two more we're trying to win. It is really one game
at a time and a one-game winning streak from here on out.  
  
Obviously it would be awesome to cut down nets here. We weren't able to do
that last year. You know, we have Arizona in front of us, and we need to take
care of them first before looking too far ahead.  
  
Of course, it would be a blessing and awesome to be able to come back in my
last year and win it here.  
  
Q. It seems like you all were having a lot of fun out there. Can you
speak on the continuity of the team and what attributes to the chemistry you
all have?  
SATOU SABALLY: Our coaches did a great job of recruiting the right people and
recruiting the right players that are selfless and play like that on the
court. I mean, we're competing against the best teams in the Pac-12, so we
have to have fun outside -- off the court.  
  
And, I mean, yeah, we're just having a lot of fun. Great people, I mean,
they're my sisters, and great coaches. So, I mean, basketball is -- like we do
what we love. Yeah. Everyone should have fun doing it.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys took the day off yesterday. How did you keep
yourselves fresh, and do you think that attributed to the slow start this
afternoon?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, we had practice last night. You know, the way the Pac-12
does it, we have 30 minutes on the court as the No. 1 seed on Wednesday night,
other than the 27 minutes we get between games, that's all we get on the court
here. We shot it pretty well.  
  
No, we were ready. You know, we're in a good place right now. We're healthy,
we're hungry. You know, I think we're playing with a lot of confidence. Last
year this time there were a ton of question marks, you know, Ruthy was playing
on one leg basically, Taylor was gone for the season. You know, we had seven
-- we suited out seven players.  
  
You know, this year, we don't have that, that excuse. You know, I think we
have just kind of set a really high bar for ourselves. We should be up here
happy. We just won a game by 20, and we want to move on. But that's kind of
not who we are, and that's not how we're driven.  
  
We want to make sure that each and every game is kind of a masterpiece in some
way. We want to play absolutely the best that we can play. And when we don't
-- and I think that's why, you know, it is a testament to the greatness of
these guys. When we don't, we don't feel well. You know, we don't feel good
about that.  
  
But, no, we were good. We worked out last night. We actually practiced better
last night than we played today.  
  
Q. Coach, as you said, you just beat this team by 20 points, and that 's
kind of been the story throughout the season against Utah. You said you saw
some, I guess, prospective success in them. What do you see in that team that
you think that they may have success in the future?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, I think they have got playmakers, they shoot the ball really
well, they execute. I think they run one of the most creative offenses in the
conference.  
  
You know, the one thing, and I thought we defended the three fairly well
tonight -- we shot it well, thank goodness -- but they are capable of making
15 threes. And that's really the only way they were going to beat us. They
would have had to have that kind of a shooting night.  
  
That's what scares you about Utah, because they have done it in the past, and
they're always capable of doing it. So I think -- I think Lynne does a really
good job. She gets the right players. She knows how to fit pieces together. I
anticipate they're going to continue to get better, and I hope so. She's
really good people. I have known her since she was a player. Maybe off the
record we can talk about what kind of player she was.  
  
Q. Coach, you say that you 're in a good spot right now, healthy, but
mentally as far as not being satisfied with the game, is the toughest point in
the semifinals right now, with as talented as the Pac-12 is, the mental game,
being more mentally prepared and mentally sound to face an opponent knowing
there is a target on your back?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think you should always be mentally prepared. I mean, that's
every bit as important to the game plan as physical preparedness. I think this
time of year none of us have a ton of time to make a lot of adjustments at
this point because you have to turn right over and play quickly. You don't
have that day in between.  
  
So then it does become a lot of mental preparation, a lot of film work. And
then they have to internalize the game plan. It will be different. It has to
be different.  
  
We handled Arizona, you know, pretty well at home in our last game. They gave
us -- they were a handful at their place. You know, we have seen both against
Arizona. They're going to be -- they're going to be fired up. And I'll tell
you, I thought they looked good tonight. Yeah. We better be ready mentally, we
better be ready physically this time of year.  
  
Q. Congrats on the win. Sunday is International Women 's Day, so I would
love if each of you could shout out an important woman in your life and why.  
SABRINA IONESCU: Shout out to my mom. I think probably everybody will shout
out their mom. Obviously she showed me how important life is. She's worked
hard for everything she's gotten, and she's the strongest women I know, and I
wouldn't be here without her.  
  
I'm very blessed to be able to call her my mom and see her come out and
support me every step of the way.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: I'll shout out my mom, too, because she's -- yeah, she
sacrificed so much for me and has just been a strong role model for me, always
paving the way, doing whatever I needed to do. She showed me. Yeah.  
  
And also Nyara, my sister, because she's really been in a tough two years, and
she's been the most positive ever, and it is just a great teammate and showing
other people around there that no matter what kind of obstacles or
circumstances are happening around you that you can overcome these and, yeah,
you always have to stay positive and have a good mindset about it.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: You know, a shout out to my team, all 13 players. You know,
they're really special people. They inspire me each and every day to be a
better coach, a better person. I love the love they have for each other. I
think that's what's carried us. We have talent, no question. But there's a lot
of talented teams out there. This is a very special group, and I enjoy working
with them each and every day. I truly do love them.  
  
But really the backbone of my whole life has been my wife, Mary. She is the
greatest assistant coach that I have ever, you know, had. She keeps me
motivated each and every day. I love her. She is in tune with what's going on,
right? I know these guys rely on her a lot. She's always there for them.  
  
You know, every time I kind of come home and go, you know, honey, this and
then that, she goes, Kelly, you're on the same team. She always brings it
back, it's always about the team. Yeah. They're all my inspiration.

### [Lindsey Corsaro](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38940)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 73, USC - 66  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I want to first of all -- I give a lot of credit to USC. The
way that that young team has come along has been remarkable. I -- because
we're their travel partners, I watch almost every one of their games as the
weekend goes in preparation for your second opponent.  
  
To see their improvement and their composure today, you know, give a lot of
credit to them. Mark Trakh is doing an excellent job. I have been impressed
with their improvement and poise, especially with their youth.  
  
I also want to give credit to my assistant coaches. I am in front of the
cameras, and they are doing a heck of a job behind the scenes, to really equip
us to make great adjustments. Shannon Perry made the adjustment, I think it
was 60-60, and we were able to we press after a free throw to be able to trap
that -- we were just having them get it in, and then we were going one-on-one,
but we decided to trap it and make them and go back to their big, and we got a
turnover, an and-one (indiscernible) really changed the course of the game.  
  
There were some other ones that Tasha Brown and Tony Newnan did. So I'm
grateful for an amazing staff that makes me look better than I am.  
  
And then just our team, the way they responded. The tougher, more together
team wins in March. And it took us a while to become that, but I thought
Lindsey Corsaro's poise, she was the most steady the entire game. I thought
her emotional leadership was absolutely key for us sort of coming back
together, rallying the troops and becoming the tougher, more together team.  
  
We weren't that the whole 40 minutes. But she led us there and helped us
respond.  
  
Obviously, Michaela is just tough as nails. And she continues to amaze me
about how she improves, how she's always about the team. And she's just one of
the most versatile players in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke on these two ladies and Lindsey 's consistency and
Michaela down the stretch, but there was a crucial time in the second quarter
where you needed a spark, and Natalie Chou came off the bench and was
incredible. I think 10 points in nine minutes, and just a lot of bang-bang
plays that took USC out of their groove?  
CORI CLOSE: That's exactly what I said in that locker room: We're not in that
position without Natalie Chou's spark. And then also not in that position if
she doesn't have the selfless to see that we turned what we needed and how we
were attacking, and so I went with a different kind of lineup because in the
second half, and she was a selfless enough teammate to be fine with that.  
  
I agree with you 100%, exactly what I said in the locker room to them, was
that Natalie was a huge spark and is the reason we were able to turn that
momentum and were able to score like that, able to set the press better, take
them out of some of their sets. We weren't getting matched up well enough in
transition. I couldn't agree with you more, Natalie Chou was a major turning
point in that second quarter.  
  
In terms of turning points, I pulled Charisma Osborne aside at halftime and
reminded her about the Stanford game. She had three really tough quarters, but
I said it didn't matter. You started with your defense, and you're ready when
your time comes, and you're going to get big buckets in the fourth quarter.
You're going to come back and respond. You have proven you can do it. That
half is gone, move forward, and start it with your defense. I thought she was
a huge piece in that fourth quarter.  
  
You know, you just have to stay ready. You don't know when your time is going
to come and how the team will need you. You have to stay selfless and stay
ready no matter what has led up to that.  
  
Q. Coach, the Trojans really gave you guys a lot of problems in the
first quarter. Offensively the team only had 12 points, which is one of, I
think, the lowest so far this season, not the lowest, but what exactly were
the Trojans doing right in the first quarter that were giving you guys so much
trouble offensively?  
CORI CLOSE: I think that, you know, really was not as much about the trouble
offensively that we were having, it was about allowing 23 points. And, you
know, it is a lot harder for us to have offensive rhythm when we have to take
it out of the net.  
  
And they were the aggressor. They were getting everything they wanted, the
kind of touches they wanted. We were letting their guards get downhill. We
were letting them get off into rebounds. And it's just, you know, a credit to
them. I just think they got us on our heels, but I think the offensive end
would have been easier if we hadn't given up 23 points.  
  
Q. How important is it to have that emotional leader like Lindsey in
times of adversity?  
CORI CLOSE: I can't even -- there's a reason she led us in minutes played last
year. She has come along for us. Our whole team takes a deep breath. And
Lindsey has just been rock solid. Her IQ is great. We move her around. She
played every position from the one to the four today.  
  
So she played point guard. She played the four position when we needed to give
Michaela a break. We doubled with her out of the post because her IQ was so
high. She was the emotional leader in every huddle.  
  
You know, the statistics are never going to show. And she hit the three ball a
lot better today. That was pretty fun, too. The statistics will never show to
the extent that she influences our team.  
  
Q. Michaela, you guys had 17 offensive rebounds and forced a lot of
turnovers down the stretch. Their coach said they ran out of gas. Could you
sense that in the fourth quarter?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think that we pride ourselves a lot on offensive
rebounds. I know my teammates are going to take a lot of shots, and we might
not always make those, and so that's something we pride ourselves on.  
  
As far as down the stretch, them kind of being tired, no, I don't think I
really sensed that. I kind of was just going to the boards and took advantage
of the opportunities that were given to me.  
  
Q. Michaela, you had the first ten UCLA points to start the fourth
quarter. What was your mindset going in fourth as you were down six?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: Just continuing to fight, string along stops. We were not
playing the way we knew we could have sort of the whole game. So just being
aggressive for my team and doing whatever I could do help my team.  
  
Q. Coach, curious, you say you travel as travel partner with USC so you
're familiar with them, maybe being familiar with the fact that Mark had
mentioned they have such a short bench. Is there a methodical approach to
getting them in foul trouble?  
CORI CLOSE: Of course we always try that. We wanted to go right at them. I
thought Lauryn Miller was really important in that. I thought she was really
aggressive in trying to take clear angles and straight line pass to the
basket. She really beat Pili to some spots.  
  
And then we went right at her, definitely, and tried to get her to force her
to play defense early in the game. I thought it was a major factor.  
  
I also thought, you know, some of you mentioned how they ran out of gas, I
think the longevity of the whole entire game to execute that game plan, and we
need perseverance and focus that it doesn't always pay off early, but if you
stick with it, that's what happens in the fourth quarter.  
  
That happened several times to us. It happened -- I thought it was a major
factor in our win against Oregon State, a major factor in our win in Stanford.  
  
It didn't pay off for a long time. They were able to withstand all of our
pressure for a long period of time, but then when fatigue set in, it really
paid off.  
  
I thought, you know, that's -- she never got -- Pili never got in a rhythm,
really. I thought us going at her right away early was really, really good.  
  
Q. Lindsey, what kind of boost does it give you when your three ball is
falling like that as it was today?  
LINDSEY CORSARO: It is definitely awesome to make shots.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Look at that grin.  
  
LINDSEY CORSARO: My teammates do an awesome job as well as my coaches of
always instilling confidence in talking about when you've got it, get it up
there and be confident it is going in.  
  
Just a lot of credit to them for giving me support all year and for believing
in me. And then it's always really fun when all that pays off and it is going
in and you're getting in the rhythm that way.  
  
Q. Lindsey, we have seen Michaela grow a lot through her UCLA career.
When she does what she does, what she did today in the fourth quarter, what 's
it like watching that as a teammate, just seeing her work that way?  
LINDSEY CORSARO: It is truly amazing, just the things that she does. Being a
guard, I kind of -- I know I'm going to throw it to her in those moments
because we know she's going to make plays. So I know I can throw the ball kind
of anywhere, and she's going to catch it.  
  
And, yeah, it is amazing the things she can do. And she works every day at
practice. She's consistent in her work ethic, going 100% all the time, giving
everything she has. It is no surprise she's gotten where she has and she's
able to do the things that she does. We have all the trust in the world in
her.  
  
Q. Coach, this conference, I mean, has been a bear all season long. You
have five of the top 16 teams (indiscernible), USC giving you a great game
today. Talk for a second, I mean, there are already three of the top four in
the semifinals, and they 're good teams, just how deep is this conference is
and how it could be a good March for the Pac-12 and you also.  
CORI CLOSE: It has been a great March for us, you know, the last several
years, and it keeps getting better. Not only is it, you know, great for the
top teams, but all the teams coming up have just been amazing, and the youth
in this conference.  
  
I think the Pac-12 Conference Networks have done a great job at covering all
these young players. You know, you look at Crocker, how she stepped up in a
major way for Cal in that opening game. You look at several of -- the shooter
for Utah. You know, you go down the line.  
  
And of course when you start naming people, you forget too many.  
  
I'm really excited not only for this year. And the grind prepares you. Not
only does the grind prepare you for March, but the different styles prepares
you for March. The incredible coaching. How many close games we have all been
in. All of the different battles.  
  
I think there is no coincidence that we're prepared as well as we are to make
deep runs in March because of that preparation.  
  
Also I'm just excited about the longevity and where it is going to be
sustainable. People are recruiting really well, young players are stepping up
in pressurized environments, and I think we're poised to have a really special
March as a conference.  
  
Q. Coach, you made it through today with Japreece only scoring nine
points on two field goals. As you go later into March, how important is it to
get her going offensively as well as hoping that she can maintain doing all of
the other things she did today?  
CORI CLOSE: I think I need her leadership and defense even more than I need
her points. She had nine assists and three turnovers today. If I -- if you ask
me do I need her to score more or do I need her to lead, play defense, and
distribute more, I need the latter.  
  
So, yes, it is a bonus when she gets scoring, but we had people stepping up.
We have a lot of scorers. That's not what I need most from her. That's not
what makes her elite. What makes her elite is her ability to put pressure on
the basketball, to distribute to her teammates, and to be a competitive
leader.  
  
You know, I of course want to get her going, and that's always a bonus, but we
got the most important thing.  
  
Q. Coach, Natalie was a perfect 5-5 from the field, but you only played
her 16 minutes. Any reason you didn 't ride the hot hand?  
CORI CLOSE: We were having more trouble getting stops in the second half than
we were -- we needed scores, you know, in that second quarter.  
  
Honestly, I just thought it was a run. It was a feel thing. You know, I think
I kept thinking to myself: Do I need to give Natalie that other look?  
  
But we had some other players stepping up and making shots, and I thought we
were in a rhythm and we were making runs that way. You know, I might look back
and say what an idiot I was.  
  
At the same time, I'm just, again, so thankful for Natalie's character that
she was willing to play whatever role to help the team win.  
  
You know, I don't know. I was debating it in my own mind, and we won so we
were okay. But, you know, I go back and look at every film and rotation every
time. You know, there was a point in the first half that every single person
on the roster had a negative plus/minus except for Lindsey.  
  
That's where I went. We wanted to double the post, and we wanted to be able to
do that, and it was either with Natalie or Lindsey most of the time. I went in
that direction.  
  
It doesn't take anything away from how great Natalie was and how important she
was for this victory.  
  
Q. Congratulations on another win.  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you.  
  
Q. Sunday is International Women 's Day, it falls during the tournament
every year. I love asking you all this question: Is there a woman that you
would like to call out, celebrate that's made a stellar, impactful impact on
your life? It doesn't need to be related to hoops, just somebody that's
meaningful to you.  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I would say my mom. I think my mom is a really strong
woman, and it's something that I admire about her, her willingness to always
be there for me and my family.  
  
Every single day I can call her and come to her with my problems, even though
she's dealing with stuff. I admire her not only because she's my mom, but
she's just such a strong woman. She's a strong black woman that I really look
up to, and she's just worked really hard.  
  
And coming from -- she's from Nigeria. But just coming here and being an
immigrant, there is odds all against you. She's fought those odds and just
been a really strong person for me that I look up to.  
  
Yeah, I really love my mom, and that's probably one of the people that I
really look up to.  
  
LINDSEY CORSARO: For me, I think, like Michaela, I have been fortunate and
blessed to have a great family and support system and tons of women in my
family.  
  
On the court, to me Tamika Catchings is someone I've always looked up to.
Being from Indiana, I went to some of her workouts when she was with the
Fever.  
  
And she was amazing on the court, but I think what she stands for off the
court and the way she was a teammate and the way she cares for people and the
way she lives her life is really admirable. I thought she had an awesome
balance of all of those things.  
  
CORI CLOSE: That's so -- you know, so many pictures of people keep running
through my head. Last year I talked about Ceal Barry, and she was sitting
right here, and I remember writing her a letter when I was at UCLA as an
assistant coach and the trails that she's blazed.  
  
I have to give a shoutout to my mom too. I remember things I would say growing
up. I would say: I can't do that. She would be like: Not yet, not yet.  
  
And I think she really established a grit inside of me that it's get better.
You know, bottom line, you may not be able to do something now, doesn't
matter, get better and grow.  
  
I think her sort of persevering spirit, there was nothing I felt like I
couldn't accomplish. And I think that she encouraged me, along with my father,
but in this case, you know, honoring my mom, that to dream big if I was
willing to work big alongside of it.  
  
I have to give a shoutout to Kathy Olivier. Kathy Olivier was a coach here
that gave me a chance when I was 23 years old to go ahead and be an assistant
coach, a restricted earnings coach at UCLA.  
  
She came by our practice yesterday, and she decided to step down from her job
at UNLV today. I got really -- Pam talked to me about it on the bus. I worked
with Pam and Kathy in my first job at UCLA, and I got a little choked up when
Pam told me. I just said Pam, I just never would be here without her.  
  
You know, I look at her taking a chance on this little 23-year-old punk and
her passion for the game and for people and her energy. You know, people tell
me a lot that I lead with my passion, and that's because I saw it in her
first, and that was my first sort of exposure and who I worked with. And I
just want to give a shoutout to her. I know I wouldn't be sitting here today
without her.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Adia Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32004)

### [Aari McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36596)

### [Cate Reese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36597)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 86, California - 73  
  
ADIA BARNES: I just would like to say, you know, we play in the best
conference in the country and wins aren't easy. If you saw yesterday upsets
and so this time of year, it is a whole new season, and everybody brings their
best game.  
  
I'm proud of our fight. You know, we just played Cal last Sunday at home, you
know, the first game to match up with them again. I think it showed a lot of
character of our team. Cal is a very good team that doesn't die. Charmin Smith
does a great job as a first-year head coach. She was a teammate of mine at the
WNBA and does a great job of having the heart of her team, because they play
until the end, regardless of the score. She should be proud of that and will
do great things at Cal.  
  
I'm proud of these young women and how we fought and kept our composure
throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, what 's it mean to you that this team is in prime position and
all but locked to start and host the NCAA Tournament?  
ADIA BARNES: It is funny, I try not to think about that a lot, you put so much
pressure on yourself and the team. I didn't think of this game as a must-win
game, but it pretty much was for a lot of reasons because of that.  
  
I think that for us, our program hasn't gone to the tournament in 15 years. We
haven't hosted since 2006 when we were not in the tournament. It says a lot.
If you see our city and how we're the second best attendance in the Pac-12 and
we will probably -- I don't say probably, I don't want to be cocky, I don't
want to jinx myself, but we have a good chance of selling out McKale.  
  
We're one of the few venues in the country that can bring 15,000 people to a
women's basketball team. I think we have a strong chance of doing that. With a
crowd like that, I think we have a lot of momentum when we play at home. We
could be in a great situation.  
  
Q. Other than having talent, what 's made this team so successful from
the end of last season until now?  
ADIA BARNES: Leaders like these two next to me. You know, it's funny, Aari
could have gone anywhere in the country. She was at Washington. She decided to
take a chance on Arizona. Remember at Arizona I was selling a dream. We hadn't
been successful in a long time.  
  
She wanted to come here and go to war with me, and she did that, and has
helped build this program. And then she's helped along people like Cate. Cate
was our first McDonald's All-American. She could have gone anywhere in the
country. She chose to come to Arizona.  
  
Remember, that game she was watching us, embarrassingly enough, we won six
games. She decided to come here, do something special. They wanted to come
here and work and leave their legacy, and they both did that. They're the
people behind that. They're the people that started the foundation, and we
just turned into a good team.  
  
Q. Cate, speaking on that, career-high night for you with 30 points. Can
you talk about your performance tonight and how it felt when the buckets were
just falling down for you left and right?  
CATE REESE: I just think my teammates found me. We knew the game plan. We knew
we were kind of the quicker team, so they kept running the floor, my teammates
found me, Helena had a good pass. Aari had great passes to me. I made the
shots I knew I could make. And if I didn't, I would pass it off.  
  
My teammates did a great job, Coach Adia trusted me to step up in the game.
And I'm just happy that we won.  
  
ADIA BARNES: The big thing, what she did tonight -- different people step up
at different times, that's what we have done all year. She did that off of
13-15 shooting. So, you know, she did a great job of offensive rebounds,
getting to the free-throw line. She didn't take 25 shots.  
  
That's what this young woman does all the time too, Aari. But to have your
best player show up, because these type of games, this time of year, it shows
character. You see who are the fighters, who fights, who gives up. And these
two fought.  
  
It was just Cate's night, and she did a great job of running the floor, and
Aari did a great job of finding her. She was awesome tonight -- or today.
Feels like night because that fourth quarter felt about four hours.  
  
Q. Coach, I think I asked you this last year, local product, Sam Thomas,
this year as a junior, maybe some nights it doesn 't show up on the stat
sheet, but in games she gets the grimy work done. This year she looked like an
extension of the coaching staff, running the floor well. Talk about the little
things she does and how integral she is as part of this lineup.  
ADIA BARNES: This team is not successful without Sam Thomas. She can have 0
points, and she still helps us win in every single way. She's the most
underrated defender. You know, Aari, Player of the Year, Sam, All-Defensive
Team. Sam locks down our players. She continues to block shots. She's the only
one allowed on the team to block jump shots because she can do it. That's like
our secret rule.  
  
She's consistent. She's one of our smartest players. She knows where to be at
all times, on offense and defense. The offense runs through her.  
  
I just can't say enough about Sam. I think that she's -- I'm just glad this
year people started to recognize, because she's been doing this stuff for thee
years. I'm glad people woke up. She's always done this.  
  
It wasn't her night tonight -- today offensively, but she's still a force with
zero turnovers. She does everything so well. We're not the team we are without
Sam Thomas.  
  
So if you can find some other players in Vegas, please be sure to let me know
because I would love having more Sam Thomases. You got to Tweet at me. You
know I like social media.  
  
No, but Sam Thomas, she's like the unsung hero. And when she scores, it is a
plus for us because she's incredible defensively.  
  
Q. For both players, going off what Coach said before, what about her
made you guys want to come to Arizona?  
AARI McDONALD: I would say that Coach Barnes is relational. I knew her since
my sophomore year of high school. I knew picking Arizona would be a perfect
place. It felt like home away from home. It is just another family.  
  
CATE REESE: I would say she talked to us about leaving a legacy and building
the foundation for what we're doing right now.  
  
I'm just grateful that I made the right decision. I never regretted my
decision coming to Arizona. And, I mean, what Aari said, she really -- she
loves building relationships with her players, and it's just the culture here
is unlike any other. I'm just happy that I made it here and that, you know,
we're leaving our legacies right now.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Cate had a really good game today. Do you think it
was just a good showing to maybe show people that you have more than -- no
disrespect to Aari, but that you have more than just Aari? I have heard a lot
of people that are just like, you know, U of A is just Aari.  
ADIA BARNES: She's dynamic on both ends, awesome, powerful on offense and
defense, she's that person. But to be at this level, to be a ranked team, top
15 team, top 10 team, you have to have more.  
  
We have a good team. You know, without Cate doing what she does -- setting
screens, rebound, work inside -- we're not successful. Without Sam playing her
defense, without her hitting threes, being in the right place on offense,
having our team run -- having our sets run through her, we're not successful.
Without Dominique passing the ball right, getting -- she's like the point
guard from the post position, we're not successful. Without Semaj coming in as
a true five, altering shots, giving us size, we're not successful.  
  
So we believe we're a team. We all have different roles. And that's just part
of being successful, you have your different role. We all accept and will do
our roles. And when someone is down, you pick up the slack.  
  
That's what you do when you're a team. That's what you do when you're a
family. That's what we do.  
  
Today other people were having a tough time, Cate stepped up. Tomorrow it
could be Aari, Dominique. We have done that all year-round, and no one thought
we would be where we were. No one in this country thought that we would have a
bye the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. We were chosen 6th. Nobody
thought we would be a ranked team, but they believed, I believed, and that's
all that matters to us.  
  
I think we're a complete team. And we're still pretty young. If you think
about it, besides -- out of the starters, we don't have one player that's been
to this tournament four times. Everybody else does. We don't. Cal does, USC,
UCLA, Oregon. Aari has only been here two times. Cate has been here twice.
Dominique has been here twice. Amari has been here once.  
  
So we don't have experience. We're kind of babies in the tournament and will
be in the NCAA. But I think with their confidence and their heart and passion,
I think we can beat a lot of teams.  
  
Q. Coach, in all likelihood you could be facing off against Oregon for
the third time in the semifinals. How exactly are you going to game plan
differently against them this time, especially when they have so much talent
in the starting five and they have a deep bench as well to be able to pick up
the slack?  
ADIA BARNES: Their talent hasn't changed. I think at this time of year,
anybody is beatable. They're a very good team. All of America knows that. You
know, they have Sabrina, Ruthy. They have three top five picks and three All-
Americans.  
  
You know, Oregon has the pressure to win the Pac-12 Tournament. We don't have
the pressure to win the Pac-12 Tournament. Oregon has the pressure as the
higher seed to beat the lower seeds. We don't have that pressure.  
  
So we go into the game with zero pressure. And I'll tell you, it is hard to
play teams with zero pressure. We faced that last Sunday, and Cal had no
pressure coming to Arizona, beat us at our place on Senior Day.  
  
So when upsets happened, we saw yesterday, nobody thought Cal was going to
beat ASU, so for us, we go in as another game. We have nothing to lose. We go
fight. We play the way we fought. And it is hard to beat a team statistically
three times in one year.  
  
So for us, we're going to have fun. We're going to play basketball and try to
win. If we don't win, our season is not over. It doesn't matter. I think
that's our take on it. We know they're a very good team.  
  
Q. Congratulations on your win.  
ADIA BARNES: Thank you.  
  
Q. This weekend we 'll be celebrating International Women's Day, and I
wondered if you would each take a moment to recognize a woman in your life
that's inspired you.  
AARI McDONALD: I would say my mom. She's been the background of our family.
Very inspiring woman. She's tough, feisty. I think that's where I get a lot of
my traits from. She just is a strong woman, and I always looked up to her.  
  
CATE REESE: My mom too. She taught me so much. I mean, I wouldn't be where I
am today without my mom. And, yeah, I would be lost without my mom, honestly.
She has taught me so much. I'm thankful for everything she does for me and
that she continues to do for me.  
  
ADIA BARNES: The only thing she didn't teach Cate is how to do laundry before
she got to college. She didn't that.  
  
CATE REESE: I don't do laundry.  
  
ADIA BARNES: For me, there is a lot of strong women in my life. I think I also
piggyback on them, my mom, just because my mom -- I wondered how I got certain
traits, and now that I'm older and a mom, I realize that my toughness, my
focus, my resiliency, learning how to fall on your face and get back up, all
of those things my mom taught me.  
  
Sometimes I wonder how do some people have it and others don't. I watched my
mom. It was tough love sometimes, it was not a shoulder to cry on, but it
taught me so many things that I will teach my son as a mother.  
  
And I think having a strong woman is important for these young women. When
they see a woman that can be a mother, that can be a -- kick ass on and off
the court, it is a role model for them.  
  
And I love the fact that we can do that, our staff can do that. These young
women need role models that have been where they want to go, does what they
want to do and can do it on different levels.  
  
I mean, I think that's inspiration. I think women that coach are an
inspiration, and we can give a lot back to this game. So we will celebrate
that day.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Mai-Loni Henson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34198)

### [Gigi Garcia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38878)

### [Amber Melgoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34706)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah - 72, Washington - 63  
  
JODY WYNN: We'll start off by saying the three people to my left are three of
the most incredible female student athletes I have ever been associated with.
This game hurts as an athlete, as a competitor. I wouldn't rather have done it
with three other people. They are just great women, great leaders, great role
models, great students, and they have been that way every day this year, and
they have grown into incredible leaders.  
  
And although the game didn't end the way we all wanted it to end, to know that
every day these women came to work and were incredible in the locker room, and
you just -- you just can't be more proud of the people they have become at
Washington. I'm going to miss them so much.  
  
Q. Jody, what did you see in Amber 's performance today?  
JODY WYNN: She's as competitive as any competitor I have ever been around, and
she's time and time again not afraid to put her team on her back, not afraid
of the challenge, not afraid of failure.  
  
She's one of those kids that's just going to find a way to get it done and
never stop trying. You know, watching Amber play, you just don't ever want
that 40 minutes to ever end. It is like you could just sit and watch her drive
and watch her competitive juices flow all day long.  
  
You know, she carried her team again, you know, against scouting reports,
everything that they throw at her, and, you know, she's a warrior. She's
somebody that we all look up to.  
  
Q. A question for all three of you. You 're all seniors. Coach has spoke
highly of you, your leadership, you gave your all grown so much over the
years. Even though you didn't get the win tonight, is that something that you
can hang your hats on, knowing that you all had grown?  
MAI-LONI HENSON: I think you -- really just looking back and knowing that this
is your last game, you really just want to look at the positive things. You
want know that -- you want to look back and know that your team gave it your
all, that you yourself gave it your all, and that you just left it all out on
the court.  
  
There is nothing really to hang our heads on. Just knowing we gave everything
that we have got and that you can just go out leading with your head high and
knowing that you left it all out on the court, there is really nothing to hang
your head on.  
  
So I'm proud of these two, proud of our team, and just kept fighting. So you
can't ask for better than that.  
  
Q. Amber, you reached 500 points for the third time in your career this
season. What 's that mean to you?  
AMBER MELGOZA: Well, first of all, I couldn't have done it without my, you
know, players next to me, with the coaching staff. The little things, just
like ball screens, those are very, very important, and without those ball
screens, I can't get many points out as well.  
  
Throughout my career there's been ups and downs. You know, I gave it my all.
Like Jody always say, leave your DNA on the floor. I definitely did that
today.  
  
And I think, you know, just looking back at all the games that we have had
since my freshman year, you know, it kind of stings when you go in the locker
room and you realize, dang, I'm not going to put these shoes back on this year
with this team, I'm not going to have another film session, not going to have
another plane ride with them, not going to have another, you know, hotel,
whatever we do in there.  
  
It's just so many different things that you kind of look back now and just
realize that was the last. But, you know, like you said, we'll keep our heads
high, and we have done a lot of great things, and I could not have done any of
this without these two next to me.  
  
Q. Amber, this is for you. You have had three 30-point games in the
Pac-12 Tournament, and you averaged almost 24 points a game. What is it about
the Pac-12 Tournament that seems to bring out the best out of you throughout
the four years you have been a part of this Washington team?  
AMBER MELGOZA: Yeah. I just look at it as do-or-die. You have to put
everything out there. It is a time to -- it is March. I'm a very competitive
person, and I'm -- I want to win, you know.  
  
Sometimes when want to win, you have to put the ball in the basket. That's
something that I do because I'm a very offensively aggressive. And, I don't
know, when it comes to time, I always just focus up and just determined to do
what I can and do the best.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have an update on Griggsby? Did she suffer an injury?  
JODY WYNN: It's T.T. Watkins. No, unfortunately not. She went do you want
pretty hard. We don't know.  
  
Q. Jody, a little bit more big picture with your seniors, a group you
didn 't recruit to come to Washington. Now what can you say that they have
helped you accomplish kind of moving the needle for the program that you would
hope future prospective UW players will see now?  
JODY WYNN: I think one thing that people say about them when they watch them
play is that they play so hard and their effort is without question. And they
have helped taken our team from, you know, getting voted 12th out of 12 teams
from day one to, you know, a semifinal experience last year in the Pac-12
Tournament, upsetting top 25 teams this year as well with some of our wins
over UCLA and Iowa.  
  
You know, it's just we're growing, you know, as a program again, and the three
of them have paved the way for the future as far as taking care of business
off the court and on the court. Their competitive drive, their versatility,
whether they play with the ball in their hands or away from the ball, and
they're incredible women.  
  
You know, to me, we're here to win championships, but at the end of the day
we're here to grow our student-athletes into becoming the best women they can
be long after their playing days are over.  
  
I love them like my daughters, and I'll cherish our time together and know
that they have done some special things. They brought energy back into Alaska
Airlines Arena. The city of Seattle has gotten on board with them and really,
really supported our team again and believes that no matter if you're playing
a superior opponent or not that we're always going to be in a game.  
  
You know, you got to credit the three seniors because they were the ones as
sophomores, when we first got there, that, you know, without a lot of
returners -- I think Amber was our leading returning scorer at 2.1 points a
game, you know, and everybody is kind of looking for the answers, but they
just decided, you know what, we're going to work. We're going to stay
committed to whatever the coaching staff has asked, is asking, and we're going
to help make each other better. At the end of the day, that's all you can ask
for.  
  
When you're in a corporation, you want to make your employes better, right?
You want to work to help your company grow. And these three go to work every
day to help our program grow.  
  
Q. What advice do you have for the young women coming up in the
program?  
MAI-LONI HENSON: My advice is that no matter how hard or frustrating or
difficult something may be, it is really easy to, you know, succumb to that
pressure and that adversity. I think what we have learned over the past couple
of years is that it really takes effort, attitude, belief, togetherness to
really overcome that type of diversity.  
  
Individually, I think being able to look yourself in the mirror and look at
what you bring to the table and then mastering those skills to bring to your
team is something that's very important. And I hope that future Huskies,
future college basketball players really just take pride in what they do and
know that it is only four years. It goes by really fast. You have to take
advantage of every moment you have.  
  
AMBER MELGOZA: To add on that, I think kind of just -- you have to believe in
yourself. I think believing in yourself can take you a long way. That's
something that I have done throughout the four years myself. Just knowing a
lot of people didn't like my game, a lot of people didn't think I could do
half of the things I did through my career.  
  
I always knew that if I believed in myself, then I can accomplish a lot of
things. I think, you know, just having a work ethic, putting in work and just
the extra work, doing things that make you uncomfortable and doing things that
nobody else, you know -- do things behind closed doors where people don't see
you are doing it. Just make yourself better, and making yourself better makes,
you know, your teammates better as well.  
  
GIGI GARCIA: Yeah. For myself, advice I would give is just to take advantage
of every moment. Nothing is guaranteed. Your next game isn't guaranteed. So
compete at all times.  
  
Q. This is for the seniors. I always admire the UW athletic department,
led by Jen Cohen, and your fan base. They 're huge supporters of all women's
sports, all sports in your department. I wonder if each of you could say a
message to UW fans who have been supporting you since this is the
culmination?  
MAI-LONI HENSON: Husky Nation, we love you so much. Thank you for all of your
support. It's been fun these past four years, and thank you for sticking with
us regardless of, you know, the ups or downs. We just thank you and we love
you, and we're going to miss you guys for sure.  
  
AMBER MELGOZA: Yes. Thank you. Thank you for always believing in us and
always, you know, cheering for us, no matter where, whatever it is at the
time.  
  
But I just can't thank you guys enough for everything you guys have done. I'm
for sure going to miss you guys, especially, you know, the little girls that
always come up to me after the game and just always are giving me such a big
smile or just the little autographs they ask for. It is just so amazing. Yeah.
We're going to miss you guys. I appreciate all the support.  
  
GIGI GARCIA: Thank you, Dawg fans. We love you so much. Go, Dawgs!

### [Ja'Tavia Tapley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38865)

### [Reili Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35156)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
California - 71, Arizona State - 67  
  
MODERATOR: All right. Welcome, everyone. We'll get started. Welcome to ASU,
head coach Charli Turner Thorne, we have Reili Richardson, Robbi Ryan,
Ja'Tavia Tapley. Coach, we'll have you open with remarks and we'll take
questions.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think the thing that comes to mind right now is when
we lost the first game in the Pac-12 Tournament, we lost our starting point
guard the last game of the regular season as well. You know, it is just a
tough turnaround to get -- to figure things out and, you know, have people
step up, take new roles.  
  
The great news now this year is that we'll get Kiki back for NCAAs. It was a
lot. Plus our other point guard had some issues health-wise and we didn't have
her for most of the second half. Reili, credit her for not having any subs for
most of the game.  
  
And credit Cal, they're playing well right now. They did a great job. A very
aggressive game. A lot of free throws. We can't give teams free throws and
win. And we can't turn the ball over. I think not having Kiki out there, our
starting point guard, and having our rotation, that hurt us in the press and
just taking care of the ball and with execution.  
  
KiKi does a lot of things for us. We talked about who's going to rebound for
us, who's going to have our help sides. Even just the rotation so Reili and
Robbi don't have to play so many minutes. That's not been our style all year
long. That really hurt us.  
  
MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. What do you think happened this game that was different from when you
played Cal last game that, you know, may have affected things, other than Kiki
being out?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, as I mentioned, I mean, Kiki was a big difference
in the other game, she had six rebounds, four steals and did a lot for us.  
  
Honestly, it didn't matter who we played today, we didn't have it. We didn't
play good basketball. I do credit Cal for sure. We just didn't play well.  
  
And I think it was hard with our rotation. You know, we didn't -- we didn't
foul them, or they didn't get called fouls, I don't know, whatever, they
called a lot of fouls on us today, and they shot 30 free throws, so that was a
difference.  
  
We turned the ball over last time too, but we were able to play through it. I
mean, them getting to the free-throw line was a difference in the game. We
knew that we didn't want to do that.  
  
Q. Charli, what was it about their press specifically that made it so
tough on you guys?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We threw it sideways, we wanted to go from the middle
and attack from there. I mean, I put my freshmen in there, you know, they just
played a little sideways, you know, didn't step to the pass.  
  
I mean, I thought it was mainly our young players, just weren't on page with
what we wanted to do. Finally poor Reili, I didn't sub her out, we're picking
off and Reili, you're dribbling through it and we were transitioned for the
rest of the time after that.  
  
I was trying to make Reili not have to work so hard, and we knew we could pass
over the top and look down. We did the same thing the first game. We said
we'll do this, and then we didn't do it.  
  
You know, it is a young team. You know, I mean, Reili and Robbi are the only
two players on our roster that have had any significant experience in a Sun
Devil uniform going into this year. Tap has been an amazing addition, but
everybody has learned something, it is the first year playing. Some of that
showed up today although they have been in the uniform all season.  
  
Q. Hey, Coach. Do you just throw this tape out knowing that you have at
least one more game coming up in the NCAA Tournament and that you have a
different -- you have your point guard back and things are different, or is it
a learning tool of hey, we need to work on this, that, to get back --  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I mean, obviously it is fun to play somebody
that's not familiar with you, a new opponent. This break is so needed for our
team. I mean, we're really banged up, really tired. We have a lot of people
that are going to, after the season is over, probably need knee surgeries and
stuff like that.  
  
This will be an incredible break for us just to get refreshed, but it is -- we
need to work on things. You know, we haven't practiced a lot for probably a
month and a half, just trying to get people through the season and not being
fully healthy.  
  
I love this window right now, you get great rest and some great practice time,
and we usually do really well with it.  
  
Q. This question is for the three of you. I know today stinks. I can see
it in your faces, but the best part is, as Charli mentioned, you have at least
one more game, potentially more. What are the three of you taking from this
one moving forward into that NCAA Tournament?  
REILI RICHARDSON: Getting back to practicing. Doing the little things. Like we
do you want foul, we're a team that do you want foul, we play position defense
without fouling. We usually don't turn over the ball as much. And I know we
have been having trouble breaking the press recently, so we need to get back
to just breaking the press in practice against our guys.  
  
JA'TAVIA TAPLEY: For me, one thing that's important to me that I feel like I
need to work on on this break is finishing stronger and using setup, more
setups, not going away from my strengths and for the team. I feel like, like
Robbi said, we just need to stick to the game plan and things that we know we
need to do to win. And when Charli says not to do something, we need to stick
with it and not do it.  
  
We weren't disciplined enough this game on offense and defense. So we have to
bring that together and keep communicating and getting better at that.  
  
ROBBI RYAN: I mean, just what they said. Just like the little things, little
things really caught up to us today. I guess just bring that sense of urgency
for my team and making sure that underclassmen know what it is like to play in
these big games.  
  
Q. You 're finishing your career, going to the NCAA Tournament. What's
this entire season been like? You have been such a key to the success of ASU
in your senior season.  
JA'TAVIA TAPLEY: It is really exciting to know I have a group of seniors
around me that want to play as hard as I want to, wants to win as much as I
do. They trust me with me coming into this program and just -- you know, being
new, and they put their trust in me. It causes me to play as hard as I can for
them and my coach.  
  
Coach trusts me. It's been fun. Even though, you know, it has been a couple of
ups and downs, I just made sure I can be the best leader I can be on and off
the court. Yeah. I'm glad we get another chance to play. We just got to take
it.  
  
Q. Robbi, this is for you. Your coach already mentioned it, you 're one
of the leaders on this team, you have been one of the leaders on the team the
last four seasons. What's going through your mind now that your team just
ended up losing in the first round and you have NCAA to look forward to one
last time?  
ROBBI RYAN: I mean, I'm obviously upset about the game. Now that it is over, I
mean, we can't hang our heads too much about it because we have to look
forward and work on the things we need to work on to go into the tournament
strong and ready.  
  
Q. Coach, Eboni Walker had nine rebounds today, had a big kick-out there
that gave you a look to either tie the game or take the lead, but what kind of
impact did she have on the game today?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: A big one. If I had to look for somebody that I thought
probably played at least close to their aptitude, I mean, it would probably be
Eboni. Everybody else would be like: I needed to play better, I shoulda,
woulda, coulda.  
  
As a freshman, she's playing her best basketball down the stretch for us,
she's fearless. A phenomenal rebounder and makes plays for us. She did a great
job.  
  
Q. Whenever something is put on tape that you guys seem to struggle
with, Reili just mentioned it about trying to break a press, teams will look
for that in the NCAA Tournament, was it something about Cal 's personnel that
you struggled with today, or was it in general where you have to focus on
certain things in practice about trying to break the press because it's likely
teams will come at you with that time and time again?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We live for people to press us, it fuels our transition.
We just didn't do what we were supposed to do. When we did it, we broke it.
When we caught it in pass sideways, which we were not supposed to do, then the
person that caught it sideways wasn't supposed to have the ball, and then they
didn't know what to do with it. And about three, four times, it ended up in a
turnover. And then I had to put a kid at the point guard that's not played
point guard for a month and a half.  
  
I'm not worried about that in the NCAA Tournament. That won't be the case.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Mark Trakh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30760)

### [Kayla Overbeck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34671)

### [Alissa Pili](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38892)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
USC - 69, Utah - 54  
  
MARK TRAKH: You know, we're happy with the effort. I think our offense, you
know, we ran our offense efficiently tonight. And Colorado is a tough team,
and they played hard. It was -- the second quarter they played at a different
speed. I knew we had to pick it up. I was happy with the way we played our
zone and the way we executed on offense.  
  
I think our kids, you know, had to rise to that level that Colorado was
playing. Colorado plays like -- I mean, you know, Peanut gets every offensive
rebound, Hollingshed. That's our main area of concern, was can we keep them
off the boards.  
  
You know, I don't know what the final stats were, but they got a lot of
second-chance points. I think when we went to the zone, I think we did a good
job, they did a good job boarding, we got a couple of loose balls.  
  
I was happy with the effort tonight. There was two good teams. It was a
battle. It was up and down, but just really happy with the way our kid
performed and Kayla went 5-5, eight rebounds. Alissa was really good tonight.
And then Endyia Rogers had a good game, and Kyra White had a good game.  
  
We had good contribution from five freshman tonight, and five freshmen have
been playing the last two months of the season for us. They have really come a
long way.  
  
For the most part, in the last two months, we've played five freshman, a
sophomore, and a senior. I'm just proud of the way they finished the season
when they could have really just said, hey, you know, we have too many
injuries, we don't have enough people.  
  
You know, they never did that. Tonight was our 17th win, and, you know, we're
going to go to the WNIT, we're invited. Who knows? You know, let's keep on
going and see if we have an outside chance at the NCAA Tournament, if we get
one tomorrow against a great UCLA team.  
  
Tomorrow will be really, really tough. You know, we'll enjoy tonight. As far
as I'm concerned, we're playing with house money right now. We're just rolling
the dice, going out and playing and having fun.  
  
I'm really proud of the kids. 17 wins, for as young as we were, as many
injuries as we have suffered all year. We're missing four players all year
that were going to be main contributors to us on the basketball floor.  
  
Just to see how the young kids have stepped up and the job they have done, I'm
really, really proud of these kids. And it's a good -- we have a good building
block to build from.  
  
And, you know, I'm really happy for Kayla, senior year, she'll see a
postseason. She's been playing really well. She's the rock and the anchor of
our defense.  
  
We'll just enjoy this one tonight and see what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you all speak on the poise you all showed tonight for being such
a young team and a few seniors on the team?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: I feel like we have had that poise throughout our season, you
know, because we have had to play our young players. You know, we lean on them
a lot. The poise that you see is the poise that we have built since, you know,
before September, playing together, really trusting each other in key moments
because it is a family.  
  
We really are happy for each other when we succeed. And then when one of us
falls down, we're all there to pick each other up.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke on the accomplishments of Alissa and Kayla and
Endyia, but I felt like the pivotal moment at a time where neither team could
shake each other was when Alyson came down, she hit back-to-back threes from
the same corner, and from there, you sort of took off. Can you talk about how
big that was at the end of the third quarter?  
MARK TRAKH: Alyson is a great shooter. You should see her in practice. Another
big freshman. Those were big threes. It sparked us. She wound up making three,
hitting three, I think she was 3-5. Those were huge. You know, for her to
accept up, again, being a freshman, step up in that situation, and the score
was I think tied when she made those two threes, that was big. Alyson was huge
tonight. Down by 1. Two big threes, yeah, that was huge.  
  
Q. As a senior, you have been here before, and then you have three
other, two who are scoring double digits, one almost scores in double digits.
What do you have to say about them succeeding in this tournament so easily?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: You know, I think it's the games and, you know, just us
needing them. So it is just easy, I guess. Not -- it is not actually easy, but
they're used to it. You know, they're ready for it. I think when they go to
shoot and they go to score and play defense and everything, they're like:
We've got this. We've been here before. We have been in so many close games,
and we're not going to quit until the fourth quarter, until the very end,
until it says 00 on the clock.  
  
And that shows a lot with the young team, because most times it is like, okay,
cool, I have three years. No, we're -- we are ready to prove something, we're
ready to play the basketball we have been doing since late October, early
November.  
  
Q. Both the players, you have short rest. Coach said you 're playing
with house money and such. You're playing a team tomorrow you know pretty
well, UCLA, a rivalry, you lost in double overtime the last time you played
them. How will that help you that you know them well that you're playing
next?  
ALISSA PILI: We beat them last time in double over time.  
  
But I think it just gives us another chance to go and compete and show them we
can compete with one of the top teams in the country. You know, just they're
very athletic team and a very good team. I think it's just our time to come
out and compete and show why we came here.  
  
KAYLA OVERBECK: I completely agree with what she said.  
  
Q. For Alissa, for you, it seemed like tonight at times, I don 't know
if it's because you're the Freshman of the Year, or what it may, but it seemed
like Peanut was coming at you. You maintained your composure and your poise
and just showed so much maturity and patience. Your mental game, could you
speak to that and sort of what it took to just stay composed with as close a
game as it was for three quarters?  
ALISSA PILI: All my life I have been just raised to keep my head and not get
frustrated. Even though I may get frustrated, just not to show it. Even
playing in high school, it was hard playing against the refs too, so I always
just had to keep my head and play poised the whole game like that.  
  
Q. Endyia Rogers played well tonight. Can you comment on how she played
again? What did you make of how she played tonight?  
MARK TRAKH: Endyia Rogers will be really, really good for us. She plays with
poise. She's incredibly skilled, and she's deceptively athletic. You know, she
doesn't -- again, she's a freshman, doesn't know any better. She thinks she's
out playing with her dad on the playground when we go play.  
  
She just goes. Pressure doesn't mean anything to her. And she's going to be a
really good player moving forward. I think she's just going to get -- she's
had some really good games in the Pac-12, had a 30-point game, a 29-point
game.  
  
I think she's really just going to continue to get better and better. I can't
say enough about that.  
  
Q. Alissa, what 's it like to get bombed on the set? I saw a link on
Twitter, and they came in at you, behind you, dancing, rallying. What's that
moment like for you?  
ALISSA PILI: It just shows how much my teammates have my back and how much
they love me and care for me and, you know, it is just -- it's just a great
family atmosphere with my girls. So just showing on TV, the love we have for
each other.  
  
Q. Alissa, this one is for you. You have had a great start to your
career as a freshman, Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, you 're in the first game
in the Pac-12 Tournament, scored 22 points. What's your experience been like
so far this season? Did you ever think you would be at this point already in
your first year, being the top scorer in the first round of the Pac-12
Tournament?  
ALISSA PILI: I really didn't know what to expect when I came in, like
performance-wise. I knew I had high expectations for myself. You know, I just
came in with the mind set of I'm just going to work hard and earn my spot, do
what the coaches ask me to do and help out the team in every way I can.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Charmin Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16117)

### [Jaelyn Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34704)

### [Cailyn Crocker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38868)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
California - 71, Arizona State - 67  
  
MODERATOR: Welcome to the Cal Golden Bears, head coach Charmin Smith, Jaelyn
Brown and Cailyn Crocker. Coach, we'll have you make opening remarks, and then
we'll take questions.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: Thank you. Obviously we're super excited to be extending this
journey. It's just really special. This group has been completely bought in
and committed for this entire season through all the ups and downs. And we
knew, if we could just stay together, that we could have more special moments,
and this is definitely a special moment. I'm so happy for our seniors.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, they build a 15-point lead, and at some point you decide to
press them and press the issue, if you will. Did you see something in them, or
was it something in your girls that you knew if you were able to force them to
possibly cause mistakes, or is it something that you saw in their game, some
flaw at that point?  
CHARMIN SMITH: Yeah. I think there was a time when I think Reili wasn't in,
and Dale, my assistant, said let's try pressing them. We saw there was a lack
of ball handlers from our viewpoint, and then it worked. And I think they got
a little bit rattled, so we stayed with it, we stayed with it, no matter who
was in the game.  
  
You know, that's a credit to these players being extremely aggressive and
having a fight mentality; that they weren't willing to go down. And it really
sparked us. The press was great.  
  
Q. What did you see in the second half, as the third quarter, you seemed
to spark the team, getting to the line, throughout the second half your
scoring ability seemed to fuel the team 's run there?  
CAILYN CROCKER: I think we just as a team knew that we weren't playing the way
we wanted to play in the first half. So I don't know if it is really something
that I saw that sparked it, but I was just like, you know what, we don't want
to go home and we know that we can play better. So as a team, we just rallied
together and took off.  
  
Q. Jaelyn, in the fourth quarter, you looked like a player possessed.
What were you thinking draining 3s, grabbing the boards, put-backs? You just
took over that game. You were the star in that final ten minutes.  
JAELYN GREEN: Cailyn said it, we don't want to go home. That would have been
my last game here. I had to give it everything I had and just play for these
guys next to me.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played ASU just seven days ago. What did you take
away from that game a helped you get the win today?  
CHARMIN SMITH: You know, in that game we got killed on the O boards, we gave
them 20 second-chance points, we gave them 19 points off of our turnovers, and
Ruden had a day with I think about 18 points.  
  
The emphasis this game was to be better in those three areas, and I think we
were better in one of the three areas. But we'll take it. It was enough.
Really, you know, I have a lot of respect for how hard Charli gets her teams
to play.  
  
Really, we just wanted to be the tougher team, and that was really the theme.
We can't let them want it more than us. We can't let them be tougher than us.
And I think we showed up in that department, and it allowed us to be able to
get the win.  
  
Q. In a game like this, what did you see from them in the second half
where your team kind of needed scoring and they seemed to give you exactly
what you needed?  
CHARMIN SMITH: It is really special to have freshman that you can call upon on
and say hey, go make a play. You know, like you said, those two have been
doing it all season long.  
  
I turned to Kai, our assistant, at one point and I say, Cailyn plays with a
ton of confidence. Kai says to her, We need you to knock down a shot. I got
you. I'm going to do it. Yep.  
  
We need you to make these free throws. I got you.  
  
She has so much confidence, as does Jazy, and it's just great to see how they
don't care who we're playing against, where we are playing, what we're ranked,
how many losses or wins the opponent has or we have. They're there to compete
night in and night out. It is just -- we have a really special freshman group.  
  
Q. Coach, you have had two huge back-to-back wins against Arizona and
now Arizona State. Then you have Arizona again in your upcoming game tomorrow.
What have you been doing right over this last week, and what do you need to
continue to do to be able to beat Arizona once again tomorrow?  
CHARMIN SMITH: I think with Arizona we for sure have to take care of the
basketball. We did a decent job there. We have to make sure that we have all
eyes on Aari McDonald all the time. She's is a phenomenal basketball player.
She makes them go.  
  
And we have to bring that toughness. That's been the difference for us. When
we play tough, you know, when we are extremely aggressive, it really changes
the whole feel for us.  
  
Q. For either one of you ladies, last year in the tournament, Kristine
Anigwe had a big first game and then had that clash with Stanford. I think
Stanford had a big fourth quarter. And a lot was said that Cal lost a lot. How
much was it coming into the game, not in terms of the middle of the game and
that non-intimidating factor, not wanting to end it, but in terms to prove
something that, yes, this team may have lost from last year, but we can come
into this tournament with just as much pride and play with just as much?  
CAILYN CROCKER: I wouldn't say that -- at least for me, at least, that I was
thinking about maybe last season coming into this tournament, but I feel like
this whole season we have been trying to prove that.  
  
So it was nothing different than every single game, every time we lace up our
shoes. It is the whole season. We're going to prove something to the world
because we believe in each other.  
  
Q. With CJ, what was it when she went down there, and how could that --
what do you think the status will be for tomorrow?  
CHARMIN SMITH: She just tweaked her knee a little bit. I think she's fine.
Obviously she came back in the game. I asked her in the locker room was it
pain or was it fear? Oftentimes when you feel something in your knee, you get
a little scared. I think there was -- she said it was more fear than pain, and
I'm hoping that she'll be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can we piggyback on that, just -- the fact that she comes back
in, not only does she come back in, but she hits two key free throws at the
end to give a cushion?  
CHARMIN SMITH: She didn't want Jaelyn to have to get another offensive rebound
like she did at Arizona. I use that in the locker room, that's an example to
me of our growth. A kid who missed two crucial free throws at Arizona turns
around, back on the line again in a very crucial moment and she's able to
knock them down.  
  
And this team has just continued to get better and better every single day. I
think that was a great example of that.  
  
Q. There was just this beautiful moment of joy when you were on the set
at postgame, Charmin, and your players came and just bombed the set. I was
looking at clips on Twitter. Have you been involved in a set storm before? If
not, or if so, what was this moment like today?  
CAILYN CROCKER: I have not. One of our support staff was just like let's have
fun. We have a lot of fun as a team. We like to dance. Chen, one of our
teammates, she was like we do -- what do you want to get out of this game to
move on? And she's like, I want to dance. So we went and danced.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: I think, you know, it is just like who we've been all year.
Just through a really, really challenging Pac-12 season, we have always stuck
together. We have enjoyed seeing each other each day. We have played hard for
one another. They have stayed committed to what I'm trying to get them to do
and to this program.  
  
I'm just really, really happy that it paid off in this moment and we did get
to dance again.  
  
Q. One question for each one of you because you have all touched upon
not just today but this whole season and about this team: One-word identity of
this team from each of you?  
JAELYN BROWN: Resiliency.  
  
CAILYN CROCKER: I was going to say EDNA.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: Are we letting them know what EDNA means?  
  
CAILYN CROCKER: No. It's just EDNA. It is a word we say to each other, along
with resiliency, at halftime. Just when somebody may shake their head, be mad,
we say EDNA, and everybody knows what it is. It is a little laugh, and just
keep going.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: That's our in-house acronym. We're keeping it in-house.  
  
For me, it is fighters. We're fighters.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

### [Kat Tudor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35191)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon State - 82, Washington State - 55  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, it's really awkward to play a team twice so quickly. I want
to give Washington State a lot of credit. You know, that's a very well coached
basketball team, it is difficult to defend, they proved that the other night
at our place beating us at the half. It took a great effort for us to put them
away in the second half.  
  
So preparing for this game, we knew it was going to take that same great
effort, that same intensity that we played with defensively, that same
offensive efficiency we played with in the second half to pull away on Sunday
tonight to win this game.  
  
And that's what I was so proud of this team for doing, they brought a great
effort against a very well-coached basketball team with a couple fantastic
seniors in Chanelle and Bobbi.  
  
So I was really pleased with our focus. I thought this team was as focused as
they have been all year. I loved our intensity. Defensively we disrupted them
from the start. Offensively we were in attack mode, and this team really moved
the ball well.  
  
Kat obviously is the story line today and just the way she shot the ball, the
way she stretched the floor. And then Mik had a phenomenal game as well.  
  
This team, when we're firing on all cylinders like we did tonight, is
excellent. I was pleased with our effort tonight and to start the tournament
off the right way.  
  
Q. This is for you both. As seniors coming in here, having such a strong
performance like that, what 's that mean to you?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: It is a big momentum game for us. Last two years we have had
really short stays, in Seattle my sophomore year and Vegas last year. When you
lose, you have one and a half, two weeks of waiting, waiting, waiting. So we
wanted to come out and give our best effort today.  
  
Q. Coach, are you aware of ASU 's loss? Are you excited to not have to
play them?  
SCOTT RUECK: That is so funny. I made a small comment after -- the second our
Utah game ended, when I was asked about next weekend, you know, I said it is
going to be a tough game, ASU plays football. I didn't say they were a
football team. I didn't say they were guys. I said they're very physical. I
meant it as a compliment.  
  
You know, I have known Charli a long time. I'm the third longest tenured coach
in this conference. So we had lost four straight games to them. It was a
challenge to my team to be physical. We needed to up it if we were going to
beat that team. Fortunately we did, you know, in a great game.  
  
So Arizona State is a great team. There are lots of great teams in our
conference. I have respect for everyone. Charli is a phenomenal coach. That
team plays as hard as any team in the country night after night.  
  
And that's the challenge of playing ASU. There's -- that was all
misinterpreted, in my opinion, and there is no real proper way to address it
other than right now. So thank you for that.  
  
Q. For the players, the last two years obviously didn 't go well down
here. How much did that drive you tonight?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I think we have those painful memories in our minds. You know,
as a competitor you think about next game, next opportunity. That's what we
came and did.  
  
KAT TUDOR: I would say it built the fire in us. Yeah. We were ready to fire
today. We were focused all day and just laid it on them.  
  
Q. Coach, considering the way that you beat Washington State and played
well all around, how do you carry that over to tomorrow and hope that you don
't come out flat against a team like Stanford? Because you do everything well,
the next day, it is sort of hard to duplicate. How do you -- what do you say
to the team or what do you do?  
SCOTT RUECK: I just think we played well. I think you have to play well this
time of year. You know, I think Washington State, we were able to get out in
transition, we were able to move the ball against them, we were able to attack
the rim, and that created open shots. We hit them. I don't think there is any
more to it than that.  
  
We know our next opponent is Stanford, and if you don't play well against
Stanford, you're not winning. Tonight is over. It's on to the next game. And
this is what we're going to have to do, we're going to have to play
aggressive, we're going to have to play well, we'll have to have another
focused great effort to win that game. That's the only option. There's no
highs, there's no lows, there's just next play.  
  
Q. Kat, it 's been a long season, I know you were waiting for that
stroke, looking for it, hitting shots in practice. It just wasn't happening in
a game. What did it mean for it finally to happen in a game tonight?  
KAT TUDOR: It felt really good. I should be making shots. There are so many
more things than go into making shots -- the passes from our point guards or
anybody else, the defense giving us momentum for the shot.  
  
Yeah, I should be making shots more. It felt good. It has been a long journey.
Yes, felt good.  
  
Q. Mik, on the same note, you 've seen how hard she's worked.  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: We see it in practice, too, what she's capable of. To see it
come to fruition tonight was awesome. Coming together at the right time. We're
excited to have Kat Tudor back. A huge weapon for us. And get ready to see a
lot more threes the rest of the season.  
  
Q. Coach, two months ago after your back-to-back loss against Oregon,
you said that you thought that your team has one of the toughest schedules in
the Pac-12 and in general throughout the entire NCAA. Do you think your team
is now more prepared to go for a deep run inside of the Pac-12 Tournament and
inside of the March Madness tournament after all the struggles and adversity
that your team has had to go through?  
SCOTT RUECK: No question. I said earlier this year that I think Oregon State
this year has the toughest schedule ever in this conference, in the history of
it. Nine games against top 20 programs. And then if you look at who we played
and when, the turnaround time, the rest, it is as hard -- I can't -- it is not
possible to have a tougher one.  
  
What that has done is absolutely prepare us. It has been an absolute grind,
you know, the transition of -- you know, Kat coming back, and we have seen
Kat, she went off against Missouri State, I don't know if you remember that.
That was like November.  
  
So we have seen. You know, Kat has been there all year doing a great job, just
working back. That was one transition that we have had, you know, bringing two
true freshmen starters into this conference, you know, there's a learning
curve there, and losing one of them, which skews our system once again in
February.  
  
There's been a lot of transition with this team. This is a very talented
basketball team. You saw that tonight. So for us to just have the experiences
where we're problem solving together, learning that same language, that we're
becoming a mature, veteran team right before your eyes, it has prepared us
absolutely for nights like this, beyond this tournament and beyond.  
  
You know, you don't want to say I love every loss we have had, of course, but
adversity makes you stronger, if you handle it correctly. And this team has
really done a great job with that.  
  
Q. Scott, it was 10-10, first media timeout, you scored 43 points
(indiscernible) the first half. Was that as good a stretch of basketball as
you have seen this team play this year?  
SCOTT RUECK: I mean -- I don't know if we have had more than 50 points in a
half. I can't remember if we have or not. We've had some really -- we had a
30-point quarter at Utah.  
  
So we have had some great stretches. So it was just good basketball. It is
this team competing. And, honestly, having fun. That's one of the things I
loved about tonight. It was all in, and they just had a blast. They executed
so well and played so hard.  
  
You know, we have been building towards this, you know. So that's what it
takes, you know, to win this time of the year. And their effort was excellent,
you know. So I would say it was absolutely one of the best stretches, if not
the best. I can't tell you for sure.  
  
Q. Scott, piggyback on your answer about your guys ' schedule. Could you
make the same argument for the Pac-12 as a whole? This conference is a bear.
You're going to have potentially five of the top 16 teams in the tournament
right now. Is everybody going to be battle tested come NCAA Tournament time in
two weeks from now that you could see two, three, four teams from the Pac-12
advancing to the Final Four and such?  
SCOTT RUECK: I feel like we have been doing that for a while now. I think back
to four years ago, I think the conference statistically might have been a
little stronger throughout that year, 2017.  
  
It is as good -- it is excellent right now, don't get me wrong. 2017 was
crazy. I mean, that was the year Oregon finished 6th and went to the Elite
Eight when those kids were freshman.  
  
You know, so if you look at what we have done in the tournament -- which is
what everybody was waiting for. You know, everybody -- we were talking about
how good we are, and then everybody saw it that year and since, that, yes,
we're -- there is no question we're prepared.  
  
I think one of the things about it, it is so well coached, but also uniquely
coached. We see so many different looks throughout the year that there is
really nothing somebody could do that we haven't seen yet.  
  
So anybody that makes the postseason -- you saw it with Arizona last year.
Arizona wins the NIT, WNIT championship, they finished 9th in the conference
last year. But they were ready.  
  
So, yes, I feel like every one of us is prepared to make a deep run.  
  
Q. Coach, what 's up with you and Scholar Athletes of the Year? You have
another one in Mikayla. Congratulations to you. Ruth, Syd. I mean, you
dominated lately. What's going on?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, you know, my background is academic, as an academic school.
For 24 years now I have coached and recruited people way smarter than I am.  
  
So that's just kind of who we're drawn to, that's our expectation, is that you
take care of business on and off the court, that you're great citizens. We
tend to recruit responsible, mature individual. Those people win in life, and
they win on the court. They're fun to be around. They're engaging and
interesting people, and they're going places in life.  
  
I know that that's who I'm comfortable -- most comfortable coaching, people
that are driven to be elite. And so you look at those individuals and what
they have done in the classroom, it goes far beyond them within our roster,
you know, but it is something we have had I think 32 Pac-12 scholar athletes
the last four, five years, something like that.  
  
I'm very proud of them. You know, our fall GPA was 3.51 as a team. That's the
expectation, that's the culture within our program, and I'm very proud of Mik,
of Syd and Ruth in the past. They don't just do it with any major, of course,
we have to put bio and then whatever other word you can add to bio, and it is
all on her resume and in her class schedule. Very proud of them.  
  
Q. Mikayla, you 're obviously excellent in the classroom, but you seem
to have a thing with 80-feet court shots, half-court shots, another one
tonight. What's the key to your magic?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Just giving it a chance, throwing it up, hope it goes in. Today
was a little closer of a shot, so gave me a better chance of making it.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: How do you get it to stop on the rim like that?  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Luck. Don't ask me to do that again.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: It seems like a long time ago. Thank you very much.

### [Brynna Maxwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38872)

### [Dru Gylten](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38092)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah - 72, Washington - 63  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Thank you. I appreciate you all being here covering the Pac-12
Tournament. It's the best basketball in the country from the women's side, and
so we appreciate so much you all being here and covering us.  
  
Congrats to UW on a great year. Amber Melgoza is tough, man. She's tough to
stop. We didn't do a very good job of it in the first half. Made some
adjustments in the second half that were effective, and we did a better job.
She still had 11 in that second half. That's when you know you're a really
good player, is when you feel like when you shut somebody down, they only had
11 in a half.  
  
So she had just a tremendous career at UW. You know, congrats to them.  
  
I'm really proud of our team today. I really thought we had three great
quarters. The first quarter we were really good. The third quarter and fourth
quarter we were great. The second quarter we were awful.  
  
Luckily we only ended up down six at halftime. Just a much different look from
our team in the second half in terms of our toughness and swagger. And we hit
some big shots at moments where we needed to bucket.  
  
But we also scored inside. Sometimes for us this year when we win big games,
we have hit, you know, 12, 13, 14 threes, and you can say that's why we scored
75 points or whatever, but today we scored a lot of points in the paint and
only had eight threes. I'm proud of that balance.  
  
And just Brynna Maxwell is a talent. She kind of got us going there in that
third quarter. And Dru is our anchor. I thought she did a tremendous job on
Melgoza there in that third quarter.  
  
These two are deserving of being up here and certainly helped us get the win
today. But it was a total team win, and I'm really proud of our group.  
  
Q. The adjectives you use to describe these ladies and the rest of the
team, the story line, or much of the season the big story line has been the
underclassmen, 73 percent of the scoring, two freshmen, two sophomores today
with all in double-digit scoring. Can you talk about the emergence, the
growth, what they meant today and just how they maybe continue to surprise you
with their maturity.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: That's been the story line of our team and our season, has been
-- you know, the way that the schedule -- the cycle of the schedule, we have
played all of the top ten teams twice.  
  
So it's tough for us to gain momentum, where we'd win a couple, two, three, be
playing well, then play at Oregon or something. And we're just not quite there
yet. We weren't at that point.  
  
But this group continued to show up the next day, ready to go. That's
sometimes the beauty of youth, too, is they move on pretty quickly.  
  
They stayed hungry, hated losing, but didn't feel sorry for themselves. I
really am excited about the direction of the program we have got. You know,
all those guys coming back, and then we signed a top ten recruiting class.
It's exciting to think about the future.  
  
But we're not done yet. But I do think a game like today really will help us,
you know, springboard, and now these guys next year and tomorrow, we have been
here, we have won, we know what it looks like, feels like, I think that's
huge.  
  
Q. Dru, the media has heard the story plenty of times about how much
Melgoza can deadlift and how strong she is. Just your point of view, how tough
is that, to absorb some hits from her and to be able to stay in place, to make
the jump shots she takes tougher?  
DRU GYLTEN: She's an amazing player, and she's a big guard. I think we knew
that coming in as we had to stop her. And even though she still had 30, I
think it was a team effort on her case.  
  
They set a lot of screens for her. After halftime, a couple of us had to step
up. We knew if we wanted to win the game, we had to shut down her. She still
scored 11, that's how good of a player she is. We knew if we could make her
miss a couple of times and get the rebound, it would come out on our end, and
that's what we did.  
  
Q. That 's two of your several good games against your home state
school, Washington. Do you get particularly excited when you play them or
pumped up?  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: It is definitely different from other games because I have
grownup watching UW, it is my hometown, home state. It's definitely a
different vibe for me. This game was just different because it's a bigger
stage. It is the Pac-12 Tournament, everybody wants to win.  
  
It is definitely different, but it is really fun. Today, I mean, I'm just
proud of our team and how we exceed.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. It has been a little more than five
years since Utah has won a game in the Pac-12 Tournament. How important is it,
do you feel like, that you broke that streak?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I think it is great. It's a kind of monkey off your back. I
don't think they knew that. I haven't been talking about it.  
  
Every year is a new group, a new journey, a new season. It's what you did last
year, didn't do last year, especially when we have, you know, so many new
faces, it wasn't something we have talked about.  
  
But I do think, like I said, I think us winning, you know, for this group,
this team, moving forward, I think it is really, really important.  
  
Q. Right before your game, you saw Cal knock off Arizona State, a big
upset, obviously, and you 're looking at what would be a big upset if you win
your game tomorrow. So how -- did you ladies see that at all? Do you take
inspiration from that? What are you thinking about playing Oregon tomorrow?  
DRU GYLTEN: I think it is just what March Madness is. It is the month of
March, and I think every team, especially this year, in the Pac-12 is just
filled with amazing players and amazing talent.  
  
We look at it as an opportunity to play the top team in the country, and we
have nothing to lose. We're going to go out there and fight like we did today.
And I think Cal also showed that; that they don't care who they're playing,
they're just going to come in ready to fight.  
  
I think that's our mentality going into tomorrow. Just bring it on. We have
nothing to lose, and we'll go out and play our best.  
  
Q. You are playing your best. Brynna, you just set the Utah three-point
field goal record. You had 76 going in the game, you have 80 now. You 're
going still. What's it mean to you personally? And Coach and Dru, your
freshmen are balling out?  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: I think -- I mean, to me personally, I mean, I didn't even
know about it. I don't really care about that kind of stuff. I think it is
more exciting for us to win this game. I think that's the thing that's going
to stick and going to last. I think that's the biggest takeaway for me at this
game. Yeah.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: It goes without saying, she isn't going to say it, because what
she just said is true, she doesn't care. But it is pretty cool. It's pretty
amazing that -- I think she led the league in Pac-12 shooting. Think how many
great shooters and players are in this league. And our little freshman here
from Gig Harbor took home the trophy.  
  
The sky is the limit for her. She'll be legendary at Utah for sure.  
  
DRU GYLTEN: It is cool playing with her. She's the first in the gym, she's
always the one going to the gym on a random day at a random time. She'll be
the one there. Kudos to her for always working hard, and she totally deserves
it.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: It is not by accident. For sure.  
  
Q. You all are working hard, freshmen, making a lot of accomplishments.
What 's the driving force that you all have to keep you all going be a part of
history and to do great things with the program?  
DRU GYLTEN: I think all of us, coming to Utah, we knew it was a program on the
rise, and we wanted to be the team and the players to change that.  
  
I think it is just leaving our mark on the program, Coach Rob is always saying
when you come in, leave it better than what you found it.  
  
I think that's our motivation, each year get better and better, and that's --
we're just baby steps, and each year, we're just going to take it to the next
level.  
  
BRYNNA MAXWELL: I think also it goes to what drew me to Utah was the fact that
we could do a thing that's never been done before. I think tomorrow is a great
opportunity to do that, and, you know, show the world what Utah is all about.  
  
Q. Obviously a whole different animal. What 's kind of the low-hanging
fruit for your team, looking back on the team before, and where do you feel
your team will be better than where you were earlier this season?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I feel the first couple of times we played them we were a
little bit intimidated, but we opened at their place, Pac-12 play, and I just
feel like we were a little bit kind of, you know -- and I think since we
played them both times, we have improved. Of course they have as well. I don't
anticipate the intimidation factor. I think that's a big thing.  
  
There's no secret we'll have to shoot the ball well and score, you know.
There's not a lot of holes in their game, not a lot of weaknesses. I think
defensively they're long and big.  
  
And so we'll have our team ready. We'll have them ready to roll. You know,
like I said before, too, out there, if we rebound defensively like we did in
the first half against UW, then we'll get blitzed. We have to box out and give
them one opportunity and just not shoot ourselves in the foot that way.  
  
You know, you talk about low-hanging fruit, things we can control, not turn it
over and rebound like crazy.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Peanut Tuitele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38891)

### [Quinessa Caylao-Do](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38085)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
USC - 69, Utah - 54  
  
JR PAYNE: I'm really disappointed in the game today. There's one quarter a
game the last several weeks that has really sort of determined the outcome of
the game for us.  
  
Our effort was phenomenal. We had 17-0 second-chance points. We outrebounded
them by a little, our effort was great. We just honestly didn't play well
enough in the fourth quarter to win this ballgame.  
  
But proud of my team always. We have a group of incredible, remarkable young
women who really, you know, come to work and are great people and great
basketball players, but today we just didn't get it done.  
  
Q. The fourth quarter obviously was the difference tonight. With a young
team, is that something you build on: Hey, we have played good teams well this
year, and came close to knocking off some really good teams, maybe some other
ones that we can build on that for the future? And then tonight, one quarter,
next year if we play four strong quarters and win a game like this?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, four quarters has definitely been our bugaboo, to be able to
be consistent enough for four quarters.  
  
I chuckle when you say that because we have had so many close games against
top ten teams and good teams like USC.  
  
I think at this point we're all really tired of saying that because there's
been so many close ones. We know that we're capable of competing with pretty
much every team, you know, that we have had on our schedule.  
  
We also know that if we don't all bring our best mental effort, physical
effort, emotional effort that every single team is also capable of beating
you.  
  
Yes, to your question. I think we know we have to play for four quarters. I'm
hoping that we'll get a chance to continue to play a little bit more
postseason, and we will definitely be sending that message about 40 minutes
and four quarters.  
  
Q. You tied your career high, 18 points. Talk about your effort tonight
and what was working down low for you against a bigger team down there?  
PEANUT TUITELE: You know, I wanted to play hard for my team. It is a
tournament, a new season. It is basically postseason, so I just wanted to give
my all down low. I know Pili a very skilled post player, so I wanted to use my
advantages with her. I'm more agile, and I just wanted to pump fake because
she has foul tendencies. I tried to outsmart her, but, you know, I could
always do better.  
  
Q. We asked Coach about the one quarter it seems every game you guys
fell a little short in. Is that something you can improve ongoing forward? And
tonight what was the difference in the fourth quarter that USC was able to do
to sort of pull away and win the game?  
PEANUT TUITELE: I think we just need to be more consistent throughout the
entire practices, rather than having a good practice halfway through, but we
need to have a good three-hour, however long our practices are, like,
consistently so that when it is game time, we know we have to show up
consistently on the court.  
  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: I would just say during the game I think we have to adjust
and know where the shooters are. Because I think they shot 70% in the second
half for three points. So knowing where the shooters are and being able to fix
the mistakes in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Coach, both times you played against USC you guys were in it, but
what is it about your guys ' style of play that allows you to match up so well
against the Trojans, even though both times, like you said, one quarter, you
dropped the ball and just fell through in the end?  
JR PAYNE: Thank you. Yeah. I think both teams, SC and Colorado, play really
hard. That's something that we take a lot of pride in. I think they have a lot
of really talented roster. They have some great veterans, and they have some
McDonald's All-Americans in the freshman class, and they're good.  
  
Our ability to stay competitive, you know, with people, like you see the stat
sheet, our second-chance points and things like that, our toughness, our grit
allow us to stay really competitive with a team like that, which I appreciate.  
  
In the end, it has -- like the earlier question, it has to be for 40 minutes.
Everyone is just too good. You know, to really play competitively for 30, it
is not going to work.  
  
Q. Quinessa, hopefully this is not the last game for you guys, hopefully
there is a postseason out there. Can you talk about the growth of the program
from when you started until now and how you feel you 're leaving it?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: I would just say from my freshman year all the way to my
senior, I think it just shows how we have been able to compete with some of
the top teams in the Pac-12.  
  
We went undefeated in the preseason, so it just shows the growth and shows
that for the team next year past the NIT, when we make it, they're really
young, but it shows that they have a lot of talent. They'll be really good the
next couple of years.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Kamie Ethridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35048)

### [Chanelle Molina](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36083)

### [Borislava Hristova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32007)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon State - 82, Washington State - 55  
  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, I would just, you know, obviously say congratulations to
Oregon State. What a great performance by their entire team.  
  
I thought Scott just had them right on point, and any time a team puts up 52
or -3 points in a half on you, you know you're going to have problems.  
  
We just didn't have an answer for their ability to make every shot that they
kind of made, and what they did miss, the nine or so, 15 or so in the first
half, they got most of those offensive rebounds. It.  
  
Was -- we had a bad about 15-minute spurt there where they just ran away from
us. And, you know, we couldn't keep up in the scoring column.  
  
Really proud of these two players and what they have meant for our program,
and, you know, it is always a really hard time to end the season with a loss.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expand on what it meant to the program?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I don't know if I have the time. These two players, I mean,
obviously we have been really fortunate to be able to coach them the last two
years. It starts with that. They were two of the best players in the league
for two years.  
  
When there is a coaching change at that point, I think five players either
graduated or transferred out during the coaching change, and these two guys
stuck it out when they probably had other places they could have gone. Even
this past summer Bobi could have turned pro and left and wanted to be a part
of this program and see it through.  
  
It says a lot about those guys as competitors, as teammates, and as Cougs.
They love it. They're invested. They have given their heart and soul.  
  
So, you know, I'm really sad for them. And they're also unbelievably awesome
players in the sense that their names are in the record books. They have done
so much that there's some records that I think anyone will touch, maybe some
of Bobbi's, and just the versatility of Nelle as a point guard and what she's
done.  
  
It says a lot about them and their legacy they left behind as basketball
players. What's most impressive about them is their loyalty and who they are
as people and who they are as teammates and how much they have given to
Washington State. It's -- you know, that's the saddest part that we won't have
that anymore.  
  
Q. For Bobi on Chanelle, to see what she did last season and the way she
leveled up her game, and then to do it again this year, what 's your
perspective been seeing her get better in a way? How is your relationship?
You've helped each other, pushing each other to get better over the years?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Whatever I say, I say won't be enough, you know, but I
have seen Chanelle go through adversity, and I'm just really proud of how, you
know, she handled it, and just this helped her grow as a player and as a
person.  
  
You know, she is showing, you know, she's shown big strides last year, and
even she's got even better this year. You know, having her on the court, it is
just another weapon that the teams have to deal with.  
  
You know, she does everything for us. You know, I'm just -- she has a really
bright future in the pro basketball, so I'm really excited to see where that
takes her, and it is just a pleasure to play with her for, you know, four
years. And, yeah, thank you, Nelle.  
  
Q. We should start first by asking Chanelle the same question about Bobi
and then we 'll move on. It has been such a joy to watch you two play
together. What's it like to play with Bobi for the last four years?  
CHANELLE MOLINA: Bobi has been unbelievable. I mean, I don't have to worry
about when we step on the floor, because she just does her job. She gets
buckets. She is just a fierce competitor, always in the gym, first shooting,
getting shots up.  
  
And you can see it in her eyes, she just -- everything she does, she just does
it with such a work ethic that I wish I have that too, but I mean -- in your
eyes, it is like -- you're so fierce, and I love it.  
  
You know, I respect it. I respect you as a player, respect you as a person,
and I wouldn't want to be playing with anybody else besides you. Love you. I
wish I had more time with you. More time with our coaches, because I respect
our coaches too. I love them. I just -- I know that the program is in good
hands with them.  
  
Q. It hasn 't been easy, the four years or five that you both have spent
in Pullman, but it has been something for us to watch, as Kamie mentioned, you
stayed, which we see so few student-athletes do these days. What's it meant to
you to be a Coug now that you're hanging up the jersey for the final time?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: I think living was the easiest decision we could have
made, and I think both of us, you know, wanted to help this program grow.
It's, you know, no matter the outcomes, I don't regret my decision. I'm sure
she doesn't regret decision.  
  
We have been -- we have been trying to help this team grow and become -- you
know, its going to take time. This team is going to be good, and I hope we did
something for them to set a foundation.  
  
And I'm just so thankful for all the support we got. You know, so I'm excited
and looking forward to see how this coaching staff and these players, where
they'll take this program.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: I just -- like she said, I hope we laid the foundation for
all of the returners coming back. I have my two sisters here, of course I have
to come back and visit -- no, I'm just kidding. No, I'm for sure going -- I
told Coach after I leave, after we go play pro, hopefully, that I just -- I
want to keep in touch with everyone, because like I said, they impacted my
life so much, both on and off the court.  
  
They just always gave me that drive and just that -- I always wanted to be
better for not just myself but for everyone else, because I love them so much
and I feel that each and every day at practice, you know, office hours,
everything, and, you know -- yeah, just -- yeah.  
  
I hope me and Bobi laid the foundation for our teammates to keep striving,
working hard, keep doing good for this program.  
  
Q. I 'm wondering if both of you can share one of your favorite memories
in the last four, five years? It doesn't have to be a game, it can just be
whatever stands out to you, if you want to share that?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Well, honestly I think being able to spend time -- You
know, there's lots of memories we have made, I can't come to one particular
one. It is just being together all the time, you know, traveling, you know,
practicing together, getting together.  
  
We always do a gathering when we cook food, and we always have fun times. In
the summer we try to do some little trips. It is just the memories we have
made on and off the court.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: They told me the other day when they asked me and Bobi to
dance and Bobi went up and did her little shoulder dance thing, and that
always gets me. I couldn't stop laughing because I love it when Bobi dances,
it just makes me -- it just makes me smile. Show them.  
  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: No. No.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: No. Yeah. That's my memory. Any time Bobi dances, I'll always
remember that.  
  
Q. Kamie, it can be so easy to make noise of the idea that you have
these two great players and the pressure that everybody else must feel to do
whatever the team needs to progress, to win games. You know, one, what did you
see Bobi and Chanelle do every day so that never happened to your team, and
generally what did you see the players absorb from Chanelle and Bobi?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: They'll probably realize what they're missing when they walk
out the door. Because one thing, again, that I think I can respect more than
anything as a basketball player and as a competitor is these guys never missed
practice, they never miss games.  
  
And then all of a sudden I said that a couple of days, and then she tweaks her
knee. They just -- they play through sickness, they obviously play a million
minutes and they come in the next day and they're the first ones there.  
  
And, you know, they're just unbelievably committed to doing the work that it
takes to be great. I don't think other players that don't have that in them
realize how big that is until that's not around them anymore. So that's what
really good players are.  
  
And I think these guys had, you know, put a lot of people on their shoulders
and tried to carry us through in a period where we didn't help them much. We
don't have enough weapons around them to probably really let their game shine
to the levels that it should.  
  
You know, they shouldn't have to carry the load every single night in so many
capacities. I think at times we have done them a disservice at times because
they haven't been able to -- again, I think they have great careers ahead of
them when they don't have to be the only players on the court that have to do
all phases of the game.  
  
But, you know, at the same time, you know, we -- I think toughness takes time
to grow. I think, you know, the right work ethic takes time to grow. And I
think competitiveness, you know, if you don't have it, you have to grow it.  
  
And I think that's kind of where we are in our program, and we have to recruit
a high-level player to replace these kind of players. We have to just -- the
players in the gym right now, they have to take it upon themselves to really
improve their game.  
  
So they have had the example around them every day for four, five years. And
we probably have all taken it for granted, but at the same time, you know, we
can all really appreciate and respect and admire what these guys have done.  
  
And Bobi I know is sitting here going: Well, why did you yell at me all the
time?  
  
Wait until next year when I'm not there to yell at -- I'll be mad about that.
Why don't we have Bobi now? Again, I just think they have been great examples
and representatives of our program and our university and ultimately our
program, being Coug.

Harrigan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32723)

### [Brea Beal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38965)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina 76, Mississippi State 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: I am joined by the student-athletes. Coach Staley will join us
later.  
  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kiki, how does it feel to be an SEC champ? What makes this team
different than the other SEC Championship teams you 've been a part of?  
MIKIAH HERBERT HARRIGAN: This was great. It's just really fun out there
playing with these group of girls. We have a lot of fun together playing. That
makes it a hundred times better. It just feels great.  
  
Q. Kiki, do you like the nickname 'Mad Kiki'? It looks like you got a
little mad out there today. Does that emotion help fuel your game?  
MIKIAH HERBERT HARRIGAN: Yes, that emotion does help to fuel my game. And I do
like the name Mad Kiki (laughter).  
  
Q. Brea, how do you think you and Ty 's leadership styles and
personalities complement each other?  
BREA BEAL: I feel like it complements each other well. Me and Ty, coming into
this year, we knew we had a young group coming in. Just to try to lead them
and be there for them on the court, that's what we've been doing.  
  
Q. Brea, you talked before the season about winning championships. This
is not the ultimate one. How does it feel to be an SEC champion? How did it
meet your expectations?  
BREA BEAL: I think a freshman, I didn't really know what to expect. Just to
see the outcome of all the hard work we put in with each other, it's crazy,
surreal.  
  
Q. What were you feeling in the first quarter?  
BREA BEAL: I think we all individually knew our roles, what we had to do. When
I went out there, I knew I had to lock in on defense and rebounds.  
  
Q. Brea, the first game with them this year was really tight. You had to
come back in the fourth quarter. How did you get out so quickly against them
this time and keep them at bay?  
BREA BEAL: I think with the last game, we looked back, a lot of adjustments we
had to make for one another, who we had to guard, who is going to guard who,
how we should guard them. It was little things like that that helped us gain
that lead early in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Staley, would you like to join us. Welcome.  
  
DAWN STALEY: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Brea and Kiki?  
  
Ladies, thank you. Congratulations on your championship. They represented you
well, Coach. They were great.  
  
We'll open up the floor now for questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. You said the other day that you only like big hardware. How does this
hardware meet your expectations? How in place is this team to win another one
in a couple weeks?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I'm happy for our players. I mean, they've worked hard.
I'm happy for our fans who worked equally as hard. Coming into this building,
all weekend long, spending their hard-earned money. I hope it's worth it. I
hope whatever they had to dish out was worth it with the excitement they
brought in the building.  
  
They allowed us to win this championship. I'm always proud to represent this
conference in this way because of the great coaches that are in it, the great
players. I mean, we're talented. Our league is talented. We'll be talented for
the near future.  
  
But when you win this league, when you win this tournament, it puts you in a
position of competing on a broader scale, that's competing for a national
championship. That's what we'll try to do in the next phase of our season.  
  
Q. You 've credited this team's chemistry all year long. How do you keep
this kind of dominant performance and attitude through the next 12 days before
you start the big tournament?  
DAWN STALEY: Rest. I mean, rest is important. It's hard to stay on like we've
had to be over the past couple of months. We mix in just days off. I mean, we
took a couple earlier in the week that put us in a position to just have
enough stamina along with our depth.  
  
We'll take a few days off. It is spring break. They'll enjoy themselves. We'll
reconvene at the end of the week and we'll take it from there.  
  
But this team has really been focused when it was time to focus. They also are
focused. Unfocused from a basketball standpoint, when it's time to be
unfocused. They will be unfocused for the next few days, and rightfully so.
They need to decompress a little bit.  
  
Q. Is there any doubt in your mind that you are the No. 1 overall seed
for the NCAA?  
DAWN STALEY: There wasn't a doubt, win, lose or draw this tournament. There
wasn't a doubt. I don't think anybody has the r�sum� that we have.  
  
But this is the way you take that out of the question. I don't know what
scenarios they could come up with. I mean, there's none that would fit the
profile that we had. All the things the committee deems necessary for a team
to be a No. 1 seed, No. 1 overall seed, I think we check all the boxes.  
  
Q. A common statement throughout the season from opposing coaches is
that this is your best team in your time at South Carolina. What do you think
would lead opposing coaches to say that? What are some of the best
characteristics about this team that stand out above the 11 others?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, it's a good team. A good chemistry team. Good team that
competes on both sides of the ball. It's a team that doesn't like losing.
Losing, I'm not talking about games or plays, but inches. If you create an
advantage, they want to fight to gain that advantage back.  
  
I think we're good on both sides of the ball. I said this yesterday, things we
aren't good at we make up for, what we're able to do on both sides of the
basketball.  
  
Overall we have great leaders, great talent. They seem to just have gelled all
season long.  
  
Q. What has been able to be the difference with this team since being
able to arrive on campus? How have they been able to grow to get to this
point?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I'm not going to say they came in eagle-less. The eagle
is the thing that keeps them motivated and wanting to be the best. They came
in with a want to win. They don't care how that looks for them. They don't
care.  
  
I mean, Aliyah Boston, we got her the ball three, four times tonight. No
complaints. They just kept gobbling up rebounds, blocking shots, running the
floor. I mean, it is that. I thought our leaders, Kiki, had a great
tournament. Just incredible focus on her part.  
  
I was happy because we can go back a few months when she said this isn't the
place she wants to be, this place doesn't make her happy. I did make sure I
got to her after the game and I just said, Kiki, I know you didn't envision
this a few months ago.  
  
She said, I didn't, but now I'm a believer.  
  
Sometimes kids, they don't operate on faith. They operate on the known, the
tangible thing that is in front of them. It's our job to paint that picture of
what it should look like, her commitment to herself, this team allows her to
be the MVP of this tournament. And that's huge.  
  
Q. How were you able to make the adjustments from that January game you
played with these guys? Mississippi State, still one of the best teams in the
country, that game comes down to the end. This one you had in control from the
start.  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I would just say we have open dialogue with our players
last night, it was 10:00 at night. We're going over our scouting report with
our players. I asked Ty, How you want to play this? How you want to play them?  
  
She was like, We need to zone them.  
  
Coach Fred's scout. He talked about zoning them before they got in the room.  
  
I'm just like, you hear it once, you hear it twice from a player, then you
just kind of formulating. Although we didn't play a whole, whole lot of zone,
we created zone concepts within our man. That was what got them under control
because they weren't having their way with dribble-drive down the lane.  
  
Our commitment to that. It's that type of team where we had very little
practice and we just talked about things. They can see it. When you have a
team like that that can visualize it and see it without having to have a
hundred reps and a lot of prep time, that's probably the difference maker in
teams of our past and this present team, that they just have a better
understanding of how to play the game.  
  
Q. There in the second quarter, things got a little testy. With a
younger team getting ready for the bigger stage, how do you stress the
importance of being able to play with emotional but not getting emotional?  
DAWN STALEY: That's really almost the first time that it got to that point. If
Aliyah is involved in it, you don't really have to worry about any
confrontation. She did say, She picked the wrong one. I'm thinking, she picked
the wrong one meaning I'm going to stand up for myself. She meant, I don't
want any part of that, I want to play basketball.  
  
Then comes Kiki, she wants all the smoke. She wants it all.  
  
For us, I think Kiki has a real good understanding of how she needs to play,
what needs to get done. We've been through that, like, three years ago with
Kiki. She's the only question mark when it comes to that. She has it under
control.  
  
We just explain to her what she means to our team. We lose her, we lose a big
part of what we do and who we are.  
  
Q. Now you 're 5-0 in the SEC tournament finals. Every win has been
double-digit. What are you telling your team to be able to have them perform
at such a high level in these big games?  
DAWN STALEY: You really don't have to say much to our team. They just know
what they have to do. When we prepped for Arkansas, again, we were up, we had
our film session. We really didn't have to go over as detailed as we usually
do because they just knew. They study the game. They watch our opponents
outside of us. They cut our work in half as far as discussion.  
  
They knew how we wanted to place. We asked them, How are we going to do this,
how we going to do that? Everybody had an answer. That's how you know when a
team is ready.  
  
Again, you don't have much prep time. We played at 12:00, not much prep time,
played 12:00 the next day. Not much prep time, no shootaround. I just know.
It's that feeling you know your team is ready to go.  
  
Q. It 's been you and Coach Schaefer for four of the last five. Top two
SEC teams for the last two years. What kind of investment from the university
level does it take to help the coaches and the staff build a program in the
way you have over the last decade?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, you have to have administrators who really don't get in
your way. They provide. We're provided whatever we need to land the top
recruits in the country. Whether we deliver on that each year, it's on us.  
  
We feel like we get everything that we need to get what we need to get done. I
think what's happened for us, just aside from an administrative standpoint,
it's our fans, the way we're able to create a home-court advantage. We make it
look like other national championship teams.  
  
When you can win at home, when you can build a fan base, they provide the
energy in the building. Sometimes they can account for four or five wins just
because they're there, they're loud, invested. I can honestly say our fans are
so invested in our program.  
  
Look, I'm sitting on the bench and I look up in front of me, I look behind me
all the way up to the rafters. There are people sitting there. Those aren't my
ideal seats if I go to an arena. I don't even know if I would go sit up top.  
  
Our fans came into this building and cheered from the very top. That's what
you have to create. They came on the road, they gave up a weekend in March,
the weather is breaking. That's what you need. It's a lifestyle. This just
isn't a movement; it's a lifestyle. They've been doing this for years. They
want to know when our schedule is next year so they can take their days off.  
  
It's a very beautiful thing. I think Vic and I have done that, and that's why
you see it's really directly correlated with the fans and our connection with
the fans and our success.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina 76, Mississippi State 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First, just congratulations to South Carolina, their team. They
certainly played well today. I thought their energy level was outstanding. We
got beat up and down the floor quite a bit today. 25 fast break points. It
doesn't matter if you're in man or zone, has nothing to do with fast break
points. For whatever reason, we seemed a step slow most of the day. Couldn't
get back.  
  
Again, you have to give them a lot of credit. They looked like the old Kansas
men running a break. I just think it starts with that point guard. Ty is such
a tremendous player. I think I said this last time, I had the privilege of
coaching her this summer in the Pan American Games. She's just a tremendous
kid. I just think her and Mikiah, they're the heart and soul of that team. It
makes everybody else easy to play.  
  
But I just thought their energy level stood out really I thought most of the
night. We struggled with that. You can talk about a lot of things that we
didn't do, couldn't do, they did, we didn't do. To me it all came back to
really energy level. It just seemed like we didn't have a pep in our step.  
  
Again, like these two, I'm so proud of them. I thought they competed tonight.
I thought Yemiyah competed again tonight. JaMya was 0-6 at halftime but she
fixed it, had a nice second half, did a nice job running our team.  
  
Aliyah gave us a little energy, gave us a little juice. She played so hard,
competes at such a high level. I'm proud of these two. Again, I'm proud of my
team. I'm disappointed because not many games, y'all, in our career eight
years at Mississippi State have we felt like the other team just seemed like
they had a little bit more competitive juice than we did.  
  
I try to impart on my young team, because we played them so well earlier in
the year at their place, I felt like they would come out today and play like
they did. Talking about South Carolina. We needed to be ready to answer that.
We had gotten down at their place earlier, but we showed tremendous toughness
and resilience. Came back, cut it down to one at half.  
  
We didn't have that today. We didn't have the toughness we had last night I
thought. We weren't very resilient until the fourth quarter. I thought we had
some kids on the floor, Xaria, Yemiyah, that were really competitive, showed
some toughness and resilience.  
  
We'll learn from it. It doesn't take away from I think where we are right now
with this team. Certainly we had two really tough teams that we had to play
before we got to this one. I'm proud of the fact that we've been in this game
five straight years. Somebody told me last night it ties maybe Tennessee
during their heyday.  
  
Again, that's a tremendous accomplishment for our program, but it's not the
end all for us. We're here to win championships. This is why I signed on eight
years ago. I believed we could do it. We've done it. We've had our share.
We're continuing to have the opportunities. That's why we were in this game.
That's why these kids come to Mississippi State. They're here to win
championships. They're here to compete for championships.  
  
I'm proud of our kids. I'm proud of my team. I'm certainly disappointed. But
you know what, at the end of the day I'm the head coach and I'm the one that's
accountable. I'm responsible. We'll do better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aliyah, what did you feel like y 'all's energy level was before the
game? Did you feel like you were ready to roll or were you tired from
yesterday?  
ALIYAH MATHARU: Personally before we came out the message was always to punch
first. We had been struggling all year to just give that boost of energy that
we usually have in the fourth quarter, do that in the first.  
  
The message was to punch first. I kept saying it, I kept saying it, We got to
punch first. This is the give back right here. This is the game for us. This
is what we do, we finish.  
  
It wasn't as high as it normally is, but it was a little bit of energy.
Sometimes you can't really tell because everybody expresses their energy, how
they feel differently. We just let it play out. We got to the game, could you
tell it was off.  
  
I'm yelling from the bench, I'm like, Yo, we got to pick it up. We got to be
tough. We got to pick it up. I don't think anybody could hear me. I know I
can't hear anything from that far. I was screaming. Then when I got the chance
to get in the game, I'm like, Yo, we need some energy. Now it's time to pick
it up. We got to put our big boy pants on, we got to go out here and we got to
play.  
  
First shot missed. Get back on defense. I was able to get a charge. We feed
off of good defense. So the charge was just the first spark of energy. I just
tried to keep it going from there.  
  
Q. Aliyah, the day didn 't go as you wanted it, you're now averaging
19.3 points in your last five games. How much confidence does that give you
going into the NCAA tournament?  
ALIYAH MATHARU: I'm very confident. I love playing against competition. That's
the reason why I chose to come here. They play tough. They play my style of
basketball. I want every night to be tough so we can get better as a unit, not
just individually.  
  
Tonight was just another obstacle for us. We didn't do our best. I know going
forward in practice, we're going to get better from this. We're going to use
this as fuel. We got to prepare and get ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. JaMya, you have a week now before you figure out who you 're going to
be playing in the NCAA tournament. Given the way today went, over the next
week, what do you think it will be like trying to flush this game? Is this a
game you spend more time and focus on to see what went wrong or are you going
to flush it right away?  
JaMYA MINGO-YOUNG: I feel like we most definitely will look back at film, see
what we did wrong. We got a week, like you said, to figure out who we're going
to play. I feel like practice this week is just going to be about fixing
everything that went wrong this game, not everything, but what stood out the
most. We're going to try to fix it and get ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Aliyah, you mentioned you came here because you want to play in games
like this, play against teams like that. You played that team twice, other
good teams. Where do you feel like you stack up against those teams?  
ALIYAH MATHARU: Sorry, didn't comprehend that (smiling).  
  
That's a good question. I feel like when we get our defense going, there's
really nothing anybody can do with us. Defense is a big part of how we play,
what we do. I just feel like defensively once we get ourselves together,
offensively as you can see coming from our starting five all the way down to
the bench, everyone poses a threat. It's anyone's night. Every night it's
something different. It could be JaMya, it could be Rickea. Having the
defensive mindset we have, I just feel like defense was going to set us apart
from other teams.  
  
We just focus and continue to play hard and play defense. That's what is going
to separate us from other teams.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We wish you luck in the NCAA tournament.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Do you worry about your young team flushing what happened today or is
it that they 're so young they don't even know they should be that upset by
it?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't worry about them. I mean, they're young. They'll have a
distraction in their life by the time we get on the bus.  
  
I think you see Aliyah, she's crying. She's upset. Bothers her. I love it. The
kid's really competitive. I mean, I love Aliyah Matharu. That kid has worked
really hard to get herself better and to try to fit into our system. To hear
her talk about defense, 'put your big boy pants on,' she's been listening
(laughter).  
  
Our young kids, the ones that were out there in that last fourth quarter, that
competed, we had some other kids had to sit there and watch that. Hopefully
they understood what we've been doing. I was pleading with them the entire
game that our energy level was just nowhere, so it affected our competitive
level.  
  
I knew that South Carolina was going to bring it. That first game, I just felt
like -- they've gotten better, too. Obviously you have to realize, that was a
month and a half ago, so they've gotten better.  
  
We just for whatever reason didn't have it. My young team, it may bother them
on the way home. I'm sure it will. We'll take tomorrow off. We probably need a
little day or two. We got some tired kids. Jo and Rickea went long, 35, 38
minutes, 40 minutes. Be good for them. Have two kids that are up for the
Gilliam Award, which is the best collegiate player in the state of Mississippi
that we have to go to tomorrow, in Rickea and Jessika. It will be good to
probably take a couple days off, get our legs back.  
  
Q. You said time and time again this team is different. Does that mean
expectations in March should be different? Are you going into the tournament
with the thought you can reach another Final Four?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Absolutely. I think when you have a young team, they don't
really know what that means. Like, they don't have any idea what it takes to
do that, what it is going to look like, how hard it's going to be. They don't
know. It's our job to make sure we're going to give them a picture and show it
to them.  
  
But our expectations, look, I mean, we're 27-6. We've coached this team as
hard as any team we've ever coached. I think where they are right now, I'm
really proud of that.  
  
I think we go into the NCAA tournament just like we've gone in the last ones.
To be clear, I have like no desire just to be good. Maybe when we took the job
eight years ago, we thought, If we can just get in the NCAA tournament. I have
no desire for that. That ain't how I'm built.  
  
I have been in that last game, we were in that last game two years in a row,
that's where I'm at. I just don't have any desire. It may be a miserable way
to live, I can tell you most days it is for about five months a year. At the
end of the day, I have no desire just to be okay.  
  
We're going to go into the NCAA tournament with a plan. I don't care where
they send us. If we're unfortunate enough to get out of Starkville, I don't
care. They can send me to Timbuktu. I'll go play whoever they want us to play.
We're going to go in there with a plan to beat 'em.  
  
Our expectations don't change. I think that's probably the biggest thing we've
shown everybody this year. I think everybody thought, Oh, God, they're
probably not going to be very good, they're going to be way down, they're
going to be young. I think we've probably shown most of the country, including
our conference, we're not that far removed from where we were a year ago.  
  
I'm proud of 'em. We're going to move forward and try to do the best we can
with the NCAAs.  
  
Q. Mike Neighbors said last night South Carolina has no holes. What are
your thoughts on them?  
VIC SCHAEFER: They didn't today. I mean, they have size. They're long and
athletic. I was disappointed that we didn't play long and athletic. I thought
the first time we played them -- look, when is the last time you've been in a
women's basketball game where there were 21 blocked shots in a game? We had
10, they had 11. I do, I think their length bothered us tonight. But I don't
think we tried to play long either.  
  
I'm telling you, to me the difference in their team and my team is that senior
point guard and that senior four player. Those are the two most important
positions on the floor in my mind. When you got that kind of leadership, those
kind of players, with the presence those kids have, it doesn't matter who you
put out there.  
  
They're putting out there the number one recruiting class around them. It
allows those other young kids to play a lot more freer, knowing if they do get
in a crunch, Ty or Mikiah can bail them out. I do think they're an extremely
talented team. If they do have a hole, it ain't very big.  
  
I thought tonight their adjustment to us was really good. Again, we just for
whatever reason didn't have it tonight. Give them all the credit in the world.  
  
Q. You hear Aliyah talking about coming to State to compete for
championships. You 've seen South Carolina a lot in the last five years. What
do you feel is the next step for this team? How do you get over that hump?
What is that next step as you see it?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I'm not sure about getting over the hump piece. I know
we've gotten beat here four times in the championship game with them. I mean,
I think until this year we beat them three straight maybe, yeah. Then this
year we had a knock-down, drag-out at their place. We had this game tonight.  
  
Greenville is a great place. They do a tremendous job hosting this event. That
was a great atmosphere for women's college basketball. The thing for us with a
young team like that, you get in an arena like that, it's lopsided. Look, the
best team maybe I've ever had at Mississippi State was last year's team. We
couldn't get out of Oregon because there were 13,000 in there wearing green.  
  
It makes it difficult, especially on a young team. It got going south. We just
couldn't right the ship. Again, we had the same issue at their place, but we
righted it.  
  
For us I think we've got help coming. We're still so young. I look for us to
continue to have great competitive basketball games with them in years to
come. I think that's what makes our games with each other so special.  
  
Today wasn't good. We got taken to the woodshed. But we'll be back.  
  
Q. We talk about how young your team is. Earlier in the season you
mentioned they had a lot of growing up to do. Now that we 're here, where have
you seen the biggest growth in your team?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think these two kids that were up here with me tonight, and
Yemiyah, I think those three have shown tremendous growth, gotten better. I
think, again, we continue to work with them off the court in some areas that
they've grown a little bit. Not much, but a little bit. That's the piece for
us that we really believe carries over into competition, is sometimes a lot of
that stuff that goes on off the court.  
  
Nothing bad, they're not doing anything crazy. It's just teaching young kids
that are now away from home for the first time the importance of things like
being on time and things like that.  
  
This team is really special. I love being around them. I love coaching them.
They're great kids. But you better be proactive every day when you wake up
because you never know what's coming (smiling). Again, it's nothing major.  
  
In my mind it's why my staff is the best in the country at what they do.
They're really good at the off-the-court stuff, developing and helping the kid
grow as a young person. I think that's what makes coaching really special.  
  
This team, as they continue to grow, next year, good gosh, you think about us,
but we're still going to be pretty young. That next year you'll have some
veterans now that have been to the wars. It's an exciting time, for sure.  
  
Q. Everything seemed to be pretty under control. It got a little chippy
in spots. We don 't usually see that from your players. What are your
thoughts? Is that an edge you'd like to see from your players at some points
in ball games?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I'm not a big fan of it, as you know. We typically don't have
kids get into verbal stuff like that. I think it was a great teaching moment
for me and Yemiyah. I think it was a great learning moment for her. I think
she understands. But you do like kids that are competitive.  
  
As I tell them all the time, this is not where we need to be competitive. I
think you saw later in the game we blocked a shot. Same thing happened again.
For us that's just not something we typically get into or are about.  
  
Again, I think for Yemiyah, first-year kid in our program, she's going to
learn. She understands that it's not just about you. At the same time she's
competitive. Again, she's one of our kids that's really shown some improvement
here lately.  
  
She'll learn to stay competitive, but you don't need to be -- we're not trying
to out-debate somebody on the floor. I think it was a great moment for her and
I to learn and grow from that. I think she will, so...  
  
Q. The fourth quarter when you had JaMya, Yemiyah, Aliyah, you let them
go. How valuable do you feel like it was for those players to get that
experience in a game that was out of hand in the fourth quarter? How did you
like how they finished things out?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I loved how they finished things out. I loved their
competitiveness. We play a four-minute game of Bulldog every day, which is an
up-and-down game. You don't run anything. You're just trying to score as quick
as you can. Whatever time is on the shot clock, that's how many points you get
when you score.  
  
I put those freshmen out there together with Yemiyah and let them go against
our veterans. You'd be amazed who wins most of those games. Those kids, they
play together and compete together. They have good chemistry together.  
  
I thought Rickea was just tired tonight. I couldn't get her up and down the
floor. It was just one of those nights for her. Again, that kid's logged a lot
of minutes for us, played well. I was really proud of how they competed.  
  
Again, those kids are ultra-competitive. They do take things personal, which I
love. So for me it was nice to see. We executed a couple of out-of-bound plays
that we executed, a half-court set there at the end. Certainly the game wasn't
that close, but I was proud of our kids for competing to the very end on it.  
  
Again, those kids, they know, and I made it a point to point it out to them in
the locker room, that I was proud of how they found a way to compete and fixed
it. JaMya fixed it. She was 0-6 at half. In the second half ran our team. I
just thought she was really good tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you. Appreciate y'all being here. Praise the Lord and go
Dogs.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Destanni Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38949)

### [Aliyah Boston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38904)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina 90, Arkansas 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by South Carolina.  
  
We will start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Destanni, career high tonight. Tell me about this game and your
performance.  
DESTANNI HENDERSON: It felt good having an early start, knocking down shots.
Just staying in the flow of the game, moving up and down the court really.  
  
Q. Destanni, I think you 've said before you consider yourself a starter
even though you don't technically start. How good did it feel to get out there
and just start making all those shots?  
DESTANNI HENDERSON: It felt good. It can be hard sometimes coming off the
bench, not knowing the flow of the game, having a slow start.  
  
But today I came out ready, confident, ready to shoot the ball, running up and
down the floor, playing good defense. Just like communicating and playing with
my team.  
  
Q. Destanni, is it something about Arkansas that gets you going?  
DESTANNI HENDERSON: Looking back last year, yeah, I had a really good game
that game. I just had to come out. I knew they were going to come out and play
their best game against us. I just had to do the same. I had to match the
energy, stay ready, stay focused, just win the game.  
  
Q. Aliyah, you guys are up 19 at the half, then Arkansas comes out and
cuts it to 7. How did you get yourselves back? Was it all your three-pointer
that you hit?  
ALIYAH BOSTON: No, they did go on a run. When there was media timeout, Coach
just emphasized she wasn't startled and we shouldn't be either. We should just
continue to play our game, play the way we know how to play, so we did that.  
  
Q. Aliyah, this is your first SEC tournament. How do these first two
games compare to your expectations coming in?  
ALIYAH BOSTON: Honestly, I didn't really have any expectations. I was kind of
just excited. It did well. Tournament's been good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We will see you tomorrow.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Aliyah 's three, was that designed or maybe an option on the play
that it happened to go that way?  
DAWN STALEY: It wasn't designed. They were playing so far off Aliyah. We
really couldn't get her the ball in the paint. Any time we feel like we can't
get the ball in the paint, she is free to take that shot. I mean, she
practices it. She's knocked down I think one -- this is our second, the one
before tonight. I'm comfortable with that shot because it's something that I
see every day in practice.  
  
I don't want her to get too comfortable being out there, though (smiling).  
  
Q. Aliyah said you told them that you were not startled. Were you not
surprised they came back on you guys in the third quarter?  
DAWN STALEY: Oh, I wasn't surprised. I mean, my message was I didn't flinch,
neither should you. We knew it was coming at some point. I thought we did a
really good job in the first two quarters of just not allowing them that big
stretch of going on a 10-0 run or 15-2 run. I felt good with what we were
doing, although we were turning it over. I knew at some point we were going to
wear them down.  
  
I just think taking the timeout for me would energize them to give them rest.
I wanted our team to go full speed, continue to push the ball down the floor,
take open shots, rebound the ball. I knew we had an advantage in rebounding
the basketball. I just wanted our players to get shots at the basket.  
  
We had a couple of ill-advised passes in the third quarter.  
  
Q. Coach Neighbors said your team has no holes. What do you think about
that, the team that you have this season?  
DAWN STALEY: I do think we have some weaknesses. But the weaknesses that we do
have are strengths on the other side of the ball. I won't say what they are
until this season is over. But we do.  
  
I think what we do a really good job is we camouflage it with our ability to
defend and rebound.  
  
Q. You hold Alexis Tolefree scoreless in the first half, six for the
game. Talk about the team 's defensive effort on her tonight.  
DAWN STALEY: She's a First Team All SEC. She's had a tremendous year. We know
what she's capable of. Obviously if you watched the last two games, she's
pretty much capable of single-handedly beating teams.  
  
I thought we just did a great job of making sure we trailed her, making sure
we contested her shots, making sure we just tried to funnel her into the lane
rather than allowing her to take wide-open threes.  
  
But Ramirez got loose on a few times in transition. You can't stop all of
them. We just wanted to stop one or two of them from getting the amount of
threes that they usually get.  
  
Q. No matter who you play tomorrow, you 're familiar with each of them.
Kentucky and Mississippi State have any similarities that you can doubly plan
for?  
DAWN STALEY: No, I think they're pretty different. I mean, obviously
defensively they play different styles. They're aggressive. Kentucky is really
aggressive in the half court. Mississippi State likes to pick you up full
court. They're still aggressive in the half court.  
  
Whoever we play we know we'll have some competition that will push us to the
very end.  
  
Q. How does it feel being back in the finals? It was only one year that
you were not in the championship, but does this feel any different, any more
special than during the run of four in a row?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, it feels great this year because we exited early last
year. I mean, we want it bad. We're here. We're here. No need to let up now.
I'd love to be regular season and SEC tournament champions. I think I'm
probably not the only one in our circle that wouldn't want that as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the crowd tonight. Greenville has been called
Columbia North many a time. Crowd was really supportive tonight.  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, it's always wonderful to have our crowd come and show up
and support us. They've done it. They created a home-court advantage for us.
Mike Neighbors did say when I went down to shake his hand, This doesn't seem
like a neutral site.  
  
I mean, it's been here before. I think what we're able to do is we're close
enough that our fans can come here. We can pour into the economy here in
Greenville. I think that's a good thing.  
  
But also you see great games. I mean, Arkansas is a great team. You're going
to see other great teams in the next semifinals game. I think it's a location
in which all the fans can get to and they can enjoy Greenville because it's a
beautiful city.  
  
Q. Seems like any time Arkansas made a run, your senior guard Ty Harris
seemed to slow everything down. Speak about her leadership.  
DAWN STALEY: We go as Ty goes. She can feel it. She's got a really good pulse
of our team. She's got great court vision. She knows when we get scored on
quickly, she gets the ball in her hands, she's just surveying the floor to see
if we can push tempo, if she needs to pull back, get the ball in the hands of
somebody reliable that's either going to give us a good-looking shot, a basket
or get to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Do you feel your strongest quality as a team is your depth?  
DAWN STALEY: I would say before you go to depth I think we got a team full of
competitors. That is probably our separation. Anybody that gets in the game,
they're competing to win, not just win the game, they want to win their
matchup. When we put our scouting reports together, they want to see
themselves executing what we need to execute.  
  
Depth, yes. Competitors, yes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State 77, Kentucky 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Schaefer.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, just so proud of my team tonight. I just thought
we were really competitive and tough tonight. We showed tremendous toughness.
I thought the game would come down to that. We weren't tough in the first
meeting. It's something that we've really tried to talk about a lot. We've
talked about it more than we've been it.  
  
I thought tonight after a really bad first quarter, we got 20-13, 20-12,
25-12. Really locked down defensively. I know y'all thought Rhyne was going to
have a hundred. She had the first seven. She was beating us seven to two to
start the game.  
  
Jo showed tremendous toughness and resilience tonight. Got her out maybe two
times before I put her back in. Hemingway, my freshman, came in and did a
really good job of shadowing her a little bit. But I just thought Jo was
great. I thought the rest of our team did a nice job of taking away space for
her. You can't let that kid operate in space. She's tremendous. She's a heck
of a player.  
  
I thought our entire team did a wonderful job of really carrying out our game
plan and handling her. It's not a one-person job. Jo certainly had a lot to do
with it. I thought the rest of us were really engaged in what we were trying
to do defensively as a team. 59 points is a good job defensively.  
  
I thought this kid right here by far had the best game of her career. She
plays 25 minutes, has a double-double, 11 and 10, and five blocked shots.
Probably altered two or three more. I just thought she was really a big key to
our success tonight. Came off the bench. Jessika wasn't having a very good
night. I thought Yemiyah was special. I thought her teammates saw how special
she was, and they really were engaged and energized by that.  
  
So again, we beat a really good Kentucky team. I think they're going to be a
tough matchup in the NCAA tournament. It's nice to be able to have another
opportunity, this will be five years in a row, the fourth time we'll have to
play South Carolina here at home tomorrow.  
  
We're going to have a lot of people in the same, similar colors tomorrow in
the arena. They'll be in their I believe it's garnet and we'll be in our
maroon. The arena ought to look similar. Should be a great atmosphere for
women's college basketball.  
  
I'm proud to be a part of it. Proud of our players, our student-athletes.
Again, I thought they were tremendous tonight. Really, really had a
competitive spirit about them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Yemiyah, what did it mean to you to get into the game with your team
struggling a little bit?  
YEMIYAH MORRIS: It meant a lot because, I mean, I've been working really hard
all year. Like the coaches always say, just like prepare and wait for your
time to come. That's what I've been doing.  
  
I just let it all fall and it came into place. So it means a lot to me that I
could help my team get the win.  
  
Q. Jo, you had a very tough assignment with the SEC Player of the Year.
She got 26 points. After the first quarter, y 'all really limited her touches.
What was your thoughts on how you did going up against a player that's bigger,
more physical?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: Yeah, you know, Rhyne is a great player. She's SEC Player of
the Year for a reason. The assignment was definitely tough. My teammates, like
Coach said, did a good job of helping me out, limiting her space.  
  
I really just wanted to deny her the ball a lot. If she didn't get the ball,
she couldn't make plays really. I really was just trying to stay at the line,
make her be a passer, play her for her right hand.  
  
Q. Rickea, you were feeling it, 29 points. I could see in your
reactions. What are your thoughts on the way you played?  
RICKEA JACKSON: My thoughts on the way I played is I played my game. Let it
come to me, let my teammates find me in open spots, and I just made the shots.  
  
Q. Rickea, second straight night you really picked it up in the second
half. Does it take you a while to heat up in order to get going?  
RICKEA JACKSON: From previous games, you can definitely see that it always
takes us the second half to get going. I feel like we played a pretty steady
first half, though, today, more than usual. I feel like we did good in both
halves today.  
  
Q. Jo, given tomorrow 's opponent, how important will it be to not do
what you have done in the first quarter, get off to a hotter start?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: It's going to be important to come out, punch first, be
focused. They're the No. 1 team in the nation. We know we have to go out there
and play our game from the jump. We can't let them get a lead on us.  
  
Q. Rickea, you played on plenty of big stages. How comfortable are you
in this? Is it second nature at this point?  
RICKEA JACKSON: I would say I think about it, but at the same time it is
second nature. I don't want to deny my opponent because they're the No. 1 team
in the country. We just got to play our game and we're good.  
  
Q. Rickea, we talked about Rhyne a little bit. When there 's players on
the other side, you'll see them tomorrow who have been talked about
nationally, when you're going up against players like that, does it motivate
you to have a game like you had tonight?  
RICKEA JACKSON: It definitely motivates me to play my game. I don't really get
rowdy just by a name. Just trust my teammates, trust myself, make shots, play
good defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, for your time. We'll see you tomorrow.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. You 're not scared to go with any lineup. You saw something in the
post to put Yemiyah in the ball game. What were you seeing that you thought
she was going to be effective?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I just thought Jessika was struggling. For whatever reason,
Jessika hadn't struggled much this year. She's had a tremendous sophomore
year. But when Jessika had that offensive foul, just kind of ran over one of
their players, I just thought we need to try something else. We need to be
engaged and really mentally into what we're doing. Running over people at the
time, I thought it was a bad mistake.  
  
Yemiyah is getting better. Johnnie has really done a good job. That's the
thing with junior college players, y'all, it just takes a while. Yemiyah, it
has taken some time with her. Man, tonight, y'all, she was the big difference.
She was a difference player tonight.  
  
I thought our kids gave her the ball in positions where she could score easy.
I thought she battled for rebounds. Those five blocked shots, that's what you
want out of a 6'6" kid down there with a 7-foot wingspan. That's what Teaira
has given us over the past few years. You can get somebody down there, that
allows you to do some things that we like to do defensively.  
  
I thought defensively tonight, y'all, we were really special. We held them to
20% in the fourth quarter, 31% in the third. Again, that is a heck of a
basketball team. Matthew's got him a heck of a team. They took us to the
woodshed the first time we played them.  
  
Rhyne is the Player of the Year for a reason. It takes a really special effort
by some really competitive kids to go out there and do what they did tonight.
I couldn't be more proud of them.  
  
Q. Outside of Rickea and Yemiyah, another big night from Aliyah. When
she 's playing the way she is, how much does that change the offensive output
and trajectory of what you can do on that side of the ball?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think it gives us another weapon out there. She's shooting the
ball at an astronomical number. In the last five games we've got like eight
kids, y'all, shooting over 50%. It's an unbelievable stat. I can honestly say
I can't remember having a team like that offensively.  
  
Now, early in that first rotation she missed two block outs, gave up two
offensive board stick-backs. She had I think deer in the headlights, to be
honest with you.  
  
After I got her out and we had a conversation, I thought her next rotation she
was more focused on both ends, not just one end. She had the one hiccup,
ripped at half court, they went and laid it in. Other than that, I thought her
next rotation was really, really good.  
  
She's had that this year where her first rotation might not be good, but the
next one, third or fourth one, she finally settles in.  
  
Aliyah, what she provides our team with an extra scoring punch out there on
the perimeter is really, really special. When you load her up there with Jo
and even Andy on the wing, if you have Jo at point, it gives you three
scorers, then you have Rickea who is obviously playing well.  
  
Q. The conversation about freshmen this year in the league has been
dominated by the South Carolina kids. Do you think Rickea notices that? Is she
motivated by that? Does she care at all about that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think they know it. I'm not sure how much they care about it.
I mean, I think she made the comment after we played them the first time,
somebody is going to put a number by somebody's name, okay? It's kind of like
what I tell my staff all the time in recruiting. Again, those kids have had a
tremendous year and they've lived up to their billing. There's no question
about it, they have a really talented group of freshmen over there.  
  
But I like my freshmen, too. They're pretty talented. I'm certainly not
trading 'em.  
  
Q. What kind of confidence does it give you going into tomorrow that she
has 48 in the last six quarters?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I've got confidence. Again, we're on like a 16-, 18-hour
turnaround. We lose an hour tonight. Who planned this deal? It's concerning
for me. I told my kids we probably aren't going to take our shootaround
tomorrow because it's at 7:30. We won't get to the hotel and be close to being
in bed by 11:30 by the time you lose your hour. My kids know I hate that. We
never pass up a shootaround.  
  
I got to figure out what's best. We've had back-to-back games. Rickea went 38
tonight, Jo went 35. At some point you got to try to maybe find 'em a little
time. We've played 'em before. It's been a while. But we've played 'em before.  
  
Q. After the first meeting between y 'all and Kentucky, you were
mentioning the fact you thought they were more physical and tougher than
y'all. You didn't like that. How did you assess that after the first
quarter?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Again, about the first quarter, we probably got out-toughed a
little bit. I thought Yemiyah and Jordan, once they settled in and provided
what they did defensively, I just thought we were much better.  
  
I thought Myah has three assists on turnovers, played pretty good defense. We
didn't let somebody else get us tonight like we did the first time.  
  
Roper hurt us, Wyatt hurt us a little bit, and of course Patterson really hurt
us. Patterson tonight had 13. We just did a much better job on everybody else.
Again, understanding Rhyne is a tremendous player. Like you said, she's Player
of the Year for the reason. She's probably going to get hers. You just have to
make sure everybody else doesn't beat you.  
  
Q. First quarter today was pretty similar to yesterday. Pretty simple
question, maybe the answer is more complex. What would you pinpoint as to why
your team is coming out slow in the first quarter?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I have no idea (laughter). I feel like y'all have watched me all
year. I'm pretty in tune with my team. I have a pretty good understanding of
who's playing well, practicing well. You guys have talked about how many
different lineups I've had. It's always seemed to work out.  
  
These slow starts in the first quarter, I think it has a lot to do with them
trying to feel their way. Yesterday I thought our intensity on ball pressure
was not very good. Our philosophy, as you know, if you're soft on the ball,
there's a good chance everybody behind the ball is going to be soft, too. If
you got somebody up there being a dog on the ball, and I'm playing behind the
ball, I'm going, Myah is pretty tough on the ball, Jordan is getting after it,
I think I'll get up the line here, take this pass away, do my job.  
  
I think that's a big key in what we're doing. I think once we settled in, Jo
got that first foul, I know what she was thinking. It happened to her at
Kentucky. She got two quick ones. We struggle when Jo and Myah struggle. If
both of those kids struggle in a ball game, it's hard for us to win. That's
why I got her out tonight and tried to calm her down a little bit, talk to
her. I got her out one more time and she was ready to go. I thought she really
settled in.  
  
Again, I really think also we're still young. I think we're just kind of
feeling our way early and trying to settle down. I thought Aliyah had deer in
the headlights a little bit early. Once she settled in, she was really good.  
  
Q. Back to the freshmen. The last time you and South Carolina played in
this setting, it was experience. Tomorrow we can see five of the country 's
top freshmen on the floor at the same time. Does that say something about the
ACC, the way high schools are producing players more? What does that say where
this game is going to?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think it says a lot about everything you just said. In the SEC
we've got, number one, great staffs that recruit. I think Dawn would tell you
she recruits to a fit. We recruit to a fit. I think the fact that we have all
these good young players playing in this game tomorrow, playing in this
conference, I've always said this is a nightmare of a league. You have the
best players in the country in this league. You're going to have a bunch of
young ones tomorrow playing.  
  
But I think they're the way they are because of what's going on across the
country. The time and money that's being spent on young female basketball
players, whether it's high school coaches, AAU coaches, parents investing in
their daughters. I just think it's at an all-time paramount high that parents
are investing in their daughters. It's tremendous. It doesn't happen unless
you have moms and dads that want that for their kids. In a lot of cases they
may have more than just one, yet they find the time and they spend the money.  
  
Aliyah Matharu's mom used to get up in the morning, drive to the park in the
dark, turn her lights on so Aliyah can get shots. Who does that? I tell you
who does it, Brenda does it for her daughter that she loves and cares about
deeply. There's probably more stories like that across the country. That's
just a tremendous story for that kid.  
  
That's just one of the many reasons why an Aliyah Matharu is here, playing at
the level she plays at as a freshman. I think it's tremendous.  
  
Again, I think it's the investment. Just like in women's athletics and women's
basketball, the universities that are investing in it are seeing the return.
If you don't invest in it, you're not going to get a return. It's just like
anything in life, in business.  
  
I think that's the next piece is that more and more universities, more and
more athletic departments are seeing the benefit of having a great women's
basketball program, and they're investing.  
  
Q. Yesterday you mentioned the pressure that you felt for the fans to
make it to Sunday. Now that you 've done it, does that pressure feel any less
or more going back again?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I went out and ran my miles today. I ran five down at the creek.
All the way down, all the way back, it's littered with literally hundreds of
people that are in maroon and white. You walk through the lobby, you go into
breakfast and get coffee. It's just so many people around.  
  
Look, I know my fans. I got three of the biggest farmers in the delta here.
Really, I know who they are and what their work ethic is. I know the pride
they take in the job that they have.  
  
There's hundreds of people like that that are here. Yet they're spending their
time, their money and their interest in our program. So, yeah, I feel a
tremendous responsibility to the people like that. I mean, to me, I don't want
them to go home disappointed, unhappy, early, whatever you want to call it.  
  
I'm proud of the fact we're in the game tomorrow. They'll be excited tonight.
They'll have a good dinner tonight and be excited and talk about it. They'll
come back tomorrow and it will be a tremendous atmosphere tomorrow for women's
basketball. I'm proud to be a part of that.  
  
I'm so proud of my fans. I mean, it's unlike most places. I know Dawn feels
the same way about South Carolina. It's really special, really special. Don't
think that doesn't go unappreciated by me or our players or my staff. We
absolutely appreciate it and we do feel a responsibility to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Makayla Daniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38950)

### [Amber Ramirez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38951)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
South Carolina 90, Arkansas 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from Coach Neighbors.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: So much on day three of the tournament for our team is about
how we're going to find our spark. Then you have to hope that when you're
playing the No. 1 seed, the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament, maybe they
don't have their best game.  
  
Took us a while to find our spark. They played very well. We didn't get a B
effort or A-minus effort from them. Dawn may disagree, but I thought we got an
A effort from them. Proud of our kids in the third quarter, made some
adjustments, gave ourselves I think a lot to work on this next week as we get
ready for the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amber, it seemed like your team was able to get into a little bit of
a groove in the third quarter. Didn 't matter what style of game you played,
South Carolina was able to answer. How frustrating was that?  
AMBER RAMIREZ: I don't think it was frustrating. I think that spark we had --
like Coach said, they're the No. 1 team in the country, they made shots, they
battled on the boards. I think the spark we had gave them a little bit of a
shake. I think they just made shots and we just battled as hard as we could.  
  
Q. Makayla, you are a very tough-minded team. How quickly can you get
over this loss and get ready for the tournament?  
MAKAYLA DANIELS: I think once we land back home, we're going to be over it and
we're going to be looking forward to the tournament, seeing what we can do to
get better until then.  
  
Q. Amber, you knew going into this game their size was going to present
some problems. How could you counteract that? Was it a matter of trying to go
up-tempo?  
AMBER RAMIREZ: Yeah, they're pretty big. I think we just had to box out. I
think there were some assignments we missed boxing out. But that was our main
focus going into the game was just putting a body on their bodies.  
  
Q. Amber, this is the third game you had to claw back. Do you think
having three games in three days, a little bit of fatigue kicked in in the
second half?  
AMBER RAMIREZ: No, because we had our spark in the third quarter. I think
fatigue wasn't a factor. Obviously we are tired since it is the third day. But
I think we kept pushing till the end.  
  
Q. Makayla, after last year 's run, not quite making the NCAA
tournament, looking ahead to that, does a series of stepping stones seem to be
aligning here going forward?  
MAKAYLA DANIELS: I kind of think we're further than we were last year. I think
we've kind of distinguished ourselves to being in the tournament. Last year we
were kind of on the bubble. I think this year we've put ourselves in a
position to be in the tournament.  
  
Q. Amber, how good did it feel to see your jumper finally fall this
game?  
AMBER RAMIREZ: It was a good feeling. My teammates had confidence in me to
still give me the ball, let me keep shooting the ball. I knew one game they
were going to fall because I'm a shooter. It felt pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We will continue with questions for Coach Neighbors.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: They were tired. They don't want to say it because they're
prideful. On day three you're tired. Playing these guys, whether you played
two games before it or not, they make you tired. Every pass is contested,
every cut is contested, every rebound. They tire you out.  
  
We got tired. I could tell because here is how you can tell when we get tired:
when we are slow in transition offense. Sometimes we don't get back on
transition defense when we're perfectly not tired. But we'll still find a way
to run an offense. We were tired running back. You could tell, from everybody.  
  
You don't ever have to play three games in three days the rest of the season.
It's really hard to do. I think it's a great challenge for us. It's incredibly
hard. It's why we have the byes. That's why we've talked about the importance
of every game.  
  
We'll have to draw from that this year. We have a lot of evidence that if we
could have found a way to get one more win somewhere along the way, we would
have gotten a bye. Then you don't have to talk about this. This is not a
question. That's the importance of this. That's what is next for us, getting
the first and second round bye.  
  
She talked about the stepping stones. I think this is the next step in that.
Last year we were up here campaigning for us to get in. This year you're going
to hear me campaign for our league. We have the No. 1 team overall in our
league. Historically when that team has been UConn or another conference, the
Big Ten, or Big 12, that has been rewarded by the committee for having the No.
1 overall seed in the tournament.  
  
We had to play these guys three times, and we've got eight losses, right?
Three of them are those guys. A lot of people are going to lose to those guys
three times if they play three times. A lot of other teams in our league that
had to play them twice.  
  
I hope when the committee gets together after everything shakes out, Alabama,
they're looking at Alabama to be a tournament team. They're looking to make
sure that Tennessee keeps their streak alive and stays in this thing. We have
had to play the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament within our league. Some
of us, again, multiple times.  
  
Q. Given all that, you knew there was a potential to be tired. When you
cut it from 19 to 7, did you think you were in it or were you on fumes?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I knew we were on fumes. Do we sub or try to ride it out? From
what I've learned from watching other coaches do it in the past, you ride it
out. You see if you can find a way.  
  
We've done it. We got tired yesterday against Texas A&M. I was going to take
another timeout. I took blame. I should have called a timeout one possession
earlier.  
  
If there's some South Carolina people in here, they'll hopefully cosign this,
they finish quarters and halves maybe better than any team I've had to watch.
They did it the other night against whoever they played in the first round. It
was tight, then the next thing you look up you're down 12 or 15. They just
finish quarters.  
  
The crowd was phenomenal. I thought it was good for our teams to play on what
is going to go down as a neutral site game that did not feel like a neutral
site game. We know we're going to go on the road for the NCAA tournament. It
was really, really good practice for us this week.  
  
Like you said, everything in consideration, it was ride it out, see what
happened. We got a really good look at a three. Amber got a really good look
at a three on a little kick-out, she was just tired.  
  
Q. You knew their size was going to present some problems. Them being
able to shoot it makes it difficult. You were hoping they weren 't going to
make those?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah. If you're going to let Aliyah Boston play the three,
just give up. You're going to move her to the three spot, let her start
stepping out, shooting threes. Victaria Saxton has annihilated us for years.
When they put that big lineup in there, I think we kind of slowed them down
with that little matchup we were running, a little junk defense.  
  
They have no holes. There was no holes. There's nothing you can watch, glean.
You can go to all the coaches clinics in the history of this world and you're
not going to find a hole in this team. Donald tried to downplay them so they
could stay sharp. They're as complete a team as we've had to face.  
  
I was going to qualify it, but probably the hardest team we've had to play
against anyplace I've ever coached.  
  
Q. Can you speak on the play of Henderson coming off the bench
tonight.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She's killed us, too. She was a freshman. She was a kid that
in the matchup, the ball was going to find her eventually. Ty Harris is too
good to not find that kid in the right spots at the right time. It wasn't that
we didn't respect her. It wasn't that we said that's the kid we're not going
to guard. It's just the kid that the ball kept finding.  
  
I think she's played a tremendous role for them all year long. She's another
player that's always played really good against us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2020

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Chasity Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38953)

### [Rhyne Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36622)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Mississippi State 77, Kentucky 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kentucky.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Mitchell.  
  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Well, the long SEC season, a tough SEC tournament, I'm just
real proud of our team. They fought hard. Starting in January, fought hard
today. Just came up short.  
  
But real, real proud of how hard everybody's worked over the course of the SEC
season. We are proud of our team and looking forward to what is to come in the
NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rhyne, the big first quarter, seemed like they adjusted defensively.
What were they doing defensively to try to keep you from putting up bigger
numbers?  
RHYNE HOWARD: They really just focused in on me and tried to just limit my
touches, like just mainly trying to stop what I was doing. Leaving my
teammates, just making sure I wouldn't get hot.  
  
Q. Chasity, towards the end of the third you come up with a steal, cuts
the lead to 49-47. Looks like you have the momentum. They go on a run. What
happened there?  
CHASITY PATTERSON: Definitely made a big play right there, trying to start the
momentum, get the momentum. They came back and pushed the pace. We couldn't
really get the ball stopped. They were kind of putting it down our throat on
transition.  
  
We definitely tried to get the momentum off that steal. We had a couple of big
plays right there, tried to change it up, get us going.  
  
Q. Rhyne, Sabrina has been a vocal leader for you all year. How much of
an impact did it have not having her in the second half?  
RHYNE HOWARD: Not having her was a loss of another threat that we usually have
beyond the arc and defensively. But she was still on the bench telling us what
we could do, what she was seeing. She was still there for us. But we did lose
a threat.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Mitchell.  
  
Q. What was the scouting report on Yemiyah Morris? What impact did she
have in the game?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Well, she's such a big body. If she can get around the
basket, she can really get some stuff done. I thought she played a terrific
game.  
  
We just allowed too many deep catches for her. You can see her physical
presence is a problem for anybody. When you let her get the catch that deep
she really did a good job.  
  
I thought she was aggressive. It's just tough getting our post players, we're
a little banged up right now, trying to get around, in front if they're deep,
trying to push them out. We were just about half a step slow today, couldn't
get it done. We were trying like heck, worked real hard. She did a whale of a
job, a really good job.  
  
Q. Walk me through what happened as far as the injury to Sabrina, what
it did for your team.  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I think it was kind of knee-to-knee contact, caught her on
the inside of her knee. We'll have to evaluate her. I don't really have an
update or report on that.  
  
Obviously she was not able to go in the second half. We're certainly hoping
it's not a long-term thing, that she can bounce back. We have some time here
before the NCAA tournament.  
  
It got us one guard down. That was a tough situation to be in, such a dynamic
team you're playing that has such good guard play. I thought she was a really
solid defender for us. It certainly impacted our team.  
  
Q. The question isn 't whether you're going to be in the NCAA
tournament, but you're on the line about whether you can host at home or not.
Do you think you have done enough to earn one of the top four spots where get
to you play at home?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Unlike a lot of coaches, I don't really study it real
closely. We just try to stay focused on our team. I wish I had a better answer
for you. I would really have to take a look at it.  
  
No matter what seed we are, I think we can be a very dangerous team. I've said
that all along during the season. Provided we get the right matchup, I think
we can go deep in the tournament.  
  
We got to get back to Lexington, get our feet underneath us, get some rest,
bounce back. I thought you saw last night a really good performance from us. I
was so proud that the team came over and played hard in this tournament. It's
a tough, tough tournament to compete in. Tougher tournament to win.  
  
When you make it to Saturday and you're one of the last four teams standing in
the conference tournament, you know you've got a good basketball team. I've
always felt like this tournament with the back-to-back games is in many ways
harder than the NCAA tournament where you at least get a day of rest in
between.  
  
I'll be excited to see where we go. I just leave that up to everybody else. I
don't try to lobby for anything. Smarter people than me who are making those
decisions. We're just going to try to coach our team, get in the tournament.  
  
Real proud of our team for all they accomplished this SEC season. It was a
tough, tough year. We overcame a lot of adversity throughout it. I hate we
came up short today, but really proud of our team.  
  
Q. I know the first matchup you and Mississippi State kept it very even
on the glass. How much did being out-rebounded factor in, wearing you guys out
inside?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I think that was tough. I thought we got some good plays
around the basket, got some misses, then failed to block out there really
close in on the basket. Those are tough box outs when they are missing shots,
you're trying to turn, find the ball, they tip it back in. A few of those were
tough, tough breaks for us.  
  
I thought, again, our players really competed hard today, played hard, bounced
back with a tough effort. Just didn't shoot the ball well enough today. I
thought that deflated us some there in the fourth quarter. It's just hard to
keep getting stops when you can't get the ball in the basket.  
  
We were able to create some open shots and just couldn't get them to go today.
But tough, tough day, tough opponent, hard game. We just didn't quite get it
done.  
  
Q. Obviously Jackson had 19 in the second half. Last night when you run
into a player of her caliber, what is the plan coming in? Do you hope and pray
she gets off it?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Well, we didn't handle one of their actions very well. You
saw her keep coming in there, if you're facing the basket, that left elbow,
she wore us out from about 12, 13 feet really getting deep. It was just guard-
to-guard switch. We were trying to accomplish that there. They do a great job
of executing that action.  
  
I thought she just got too deep with uncontested shots. She's a phenomenal
midrange shooter. We just didn't get that done today. We needed to play much
tougher defense.  
  
It's hard action to guard without a lot of reps. We guarded it pretty good in
Lexington and were ready to go. Just couldn't quite accomplish it today. But
she's a heck of a shooter there from the midrange. Really did a good job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Joni Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30359)

### [Jenna Staiti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38849)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina 89, Georgia 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Georgia.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
JONI TAYLOR: First of all, give South Carolina credit. They came out and
played really hard. Every time we were able to make a run or keep it close,
they would turn up their defense, just force us into a lot of turnovers today.
Made it really difficult for us to get into our offense. It remained that way
for quite some time.  
  
I thought we had moments and spurts with some of our younger players. Jenna
had a good first half, carried us. Didn't have enough offensive firepower
today to match them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jenna.  
  
Q. Jenna, is that how you saw it, too, as Coach said, that South
Carolina 's pressure kind of kept you from getting into your offense?  
JENNA STAITI: Yeah, they pressured our guards pretty heavily. I wouldn't even
say just them. Even me, I didn't go and get the ball like I'm supposed to.
Quick tips just led to turnovers and scoring on the other end.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about your play down the stretch. Really solid.
Also yesterday you were really active, one foul, only two today. Is that
something you focused on?  
JENNA STAITI: Yeah, I think that comes with the conditioning part of it all.
Our coaches and trainers, do a good job of keeping us in shape. Last year I
think I struggled a lot with being in the game for 10 minutes. I think I
fouled out one time in that stretch. It's just the conditioning part of the
game. I just think that's something important so I can be out there for longer
stretches of time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jenna, thank you for your time today.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. So much is made of the three great starting freshmen that South
Carolina has. How much of a difference does it make for them to have Harris
and Herbert Harrigan, that veteran presence?  
JONI TAYLOR: Yeah, they're the anchors for the team. As freshmen, they want it
all. They know what it feels like to have a taste of it. Any time they're
struggling or just need an extra push, Harrigan gets a bucket, Harris gets a
bucket. She's their floor general.  
  
Yes, the freshmen are outstanding. They're going to be really good for the
remaining of their time at South Carolina. Those are the two that make it run.
I don't think they would be the same if they didn't have them on the floor.  
  
Q. How confident do you feel about your team 's chances now for the NCAA
tournament?  
JONI TAYLOR: I mean, obviously that's what we want to do, is play in the
tournament. We have tried to control what we could. Obviously a win today
would have really helped us tremendously. I think if you look at our body of
work over the month of February, we've really come on strong. That's with
having an injury to Que Morrison, a starter we have had to replace.  
  
For us to still compete and win, put ourselves in that position, I think it's
something we should consider. That's not my decision to make. I wish it was.  
  
Q. The schedule you played this year, what does that do for your players
moving forward?  
JONI TAYLOR: We grew up this year. I'll throw UCLA in the mix, as well. We had
a really tough non-conference schedule. We learned a lot from that. We knew we
had two returning starters from last year's team. We thrust a lot of people
into a starting role. Maya Caldwell, Jenna Staiti, they weren't starters for
us last year, and they grew up as the season progressed. I think what happened
is that we became consistent.  
  
Then our younger players came along, Chloe Chapman Javyn Nicholson, Malury
Bates, Caitlin Hose. They're all different players now than they were at the
beginning of the year. Hopefully it's something we continue to build on and
grow from. Whether that's postseason play for us now or next year, it's
something that I think will propel us for next season.  
  
Q. You talked about South Carolina 's starters. What does it say about
them that they have the depth and the players that have come off the bench?  
JONI TAYLOR: I've said it, this is, in my mind, Dawn's most complete team
she's put on the floor since she's been at South Carolina. Really good at
every position. Honestly, since we played them, their subs have sometimes hurt
us more than their starters.  
  
Let's be frank, everybody springing off the bench could be starting somewhere
else. It shows the camaraderie they have, that she's got them all playing
well, no matter if they start, don't start. In the minutes they play they're
productive when they're on the floor.  
  
You just never can get a break because they just come in and they keep coming
at you, coming at you, because of their skill set and how good they are on
both ends of the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [LeLe Grissett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38903)

### [Aliyah Boston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38904)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
South Carolina 89, Georgia 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by South Carolina.  
  
We will start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aliyah, you played in a lot of big games this year. Talk about how it
feels now to get your first postseason game.  
ALIYAH BOSTON: It's exciting. The tournament, there's just so much hype about
it. I was just really excited to see what it's all about.  
  
Q. LeLe, 40 points from the bench this afternoon. What was working with
that unit? What kind of spark did the bench bring today?  
LELE GRISSETT: Energy. We brought a lot of energy off the bench. We knew as
soon as we got in the game, we got to play together, push the ball, work hard.
Every time we sit on the bench, we talk about how we going to impact the game.  
  
Q. Aliyah, matchup with Jenna early on, felt like you were trading blows
the first quarter. You got the better of that matchup in the paint. What
changed? What was it like going up against her?  
ALIYAH BOSTON: Yeah, she's a very physical post player. She has an outside
game. She hit a three on me earlier. I mean, I kind of just continued to
attack her and tried to put it in the basket as much as possible.  
  
Q. LeLe, what kind of leadership do Ty and Kiki bring to you guys?  
LELE GRISSETT: They bring great leadership on and off the court. If you need
to talk to, like, Ty or Kiki, they always have their door open. They push
everybody to the limit. They don't want nothing but greatness from you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time today.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. A little bit of a rough start for the starters, but then the bench
comes in. Anything to be concerned about there? Is that just showing off how
deep this team can be?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I thought we were a little rattled early on. Maybe it was
just the rust of not playing on a Thursday. But I think our bench has shown up
all season long to give us a boost. They gave us the boost that we needed
early in this basketball game. I was happy to see them impact in this way.  
  
Q. Talk about your seniors, they 've been through this before, won the
whole thing. What do they mean to this team?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, when you have seniors who have been around your program
for four years and who have been at this tournament for four years, that's who
you want to lean on the most because they have the experience. They have the
experience of winning it. They have the experience of exiting it early. So
they have both spectrums in their experience.  
  
But this year I think they are leading our basketball team to wanting to win
it. Hopefully we can continue to play well as a unit, and they continue to
lead our basketball team into the semifinals.  
  
Q. LeLe played really well. Saxton played well. Is there maybe a thought
going forward to try to get them on the floor along with Boston heavier than
you normally would?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, we just see how the game goes. Obviously they know when
they're coming in the game. Somewhere after the five-minute timeout. It
depends on who's in foul trouble. Kiki picked up one early. We try to jockey
to make sure that Kiki nor Aliyah have to sit down for extended minutes
because of foul trouble.  
  
But that second unit is used to playing with each other. They've done it all
year long in practices. I actually like seeing them together where they're
playing as a unit because they're so familiar with themselves.  
  
Q. Joni was in here earlier and said, Let 's be real, a lot of your
bench players could start somewhere else. Has it been difficult to keep
everybody in their roles and happy with their roles? Hard to find time for
everybody to get on the court?  
DAWN STALEY: It really hasn't been difficult this year. I think our bench,
really, they understand their importance. When you understand that you are
important to our basketball team, you feel a sense of want and need.  
  
I think Ty and Kiki, they do a great job in just letting them know how
important they are. I think this is an example of when you accept your role,
no matter what role it is, unfortunately if we can say that, the bench could
start somewhere else.  
  
We have to make a decision. We made that decision. They could have bucked, but
they didn't. Maybe they did inside their heads, but it never showed out there
on the court.  
  
Now we're at a place where they come and they get 40 points. They got assists,
rebounds, blocked shots. They're making an impact. Hopefully other programs
are watching, other players are watching, just how impactful every single
player that's on our roster is for our basketball team. That's all because
they've embraced their roles.  
  
Q. Talk about a game like today with your bench where you got a chance,
everybody has tournament experience now, a lot of them got quality minutes,
how that is going to help you down the road.  
DAWN STALEY: I don't know. I think it helps right now to get us through 24
hours of players feeling like they played a role. They got out there, they got
their feet wet. Some of them played extended minutes. Some of them didn't play
a whole lot of minutes.  
  
I think it feels good when you can get in a game, run up and down, shoot the
ball, even turn the ball over. You just feel like you've played. I'm happy
that we were able to play 11 players today.  
  
Q. The pregame intros, probably an honest mistake, they said the No. 7
seed South Carolina. You seemed tickled about that. What were you thinking
right then? Do you use that as motivation?  
DAWN STALEY: I didn't want our fans to hear '7' because they tend to go off
the deep end, and they did. I was just trying to quiet them down saying it was
probably an honest mistake. I can't see a whole lot without my glasses. Maybe
the announcer didn't have her glasses on. 7 looks like 1. I think it's an
honest mistake.  
  
She's been here for as long as I've been a part of the SEC tournament. I enjoy
her voice. I didn't think anything of it. The national anthem singer was
awesome, though.  
  
Q. The turnovers in the first half were a little uncharacteristic. Is
this something you have to address with them or you can shake it off or write
it off as first-game jitters and then you look past that?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, I was caught off guard by it, especially because it's
uncharacteristic of Ty to turn the ball over the way she did. I think it was
just that. I think jitters played a role in it. We addressed it at halftime.  
  
I believe we had maybe six. Was it six? No, it was five in the last 20 minutes
of the game. That's more like our speed. That's not something that we'll harp
on. I think we saw it, we adjusted, then we corrected it.  
  
Q. A left turn here. There are some players here, Carter specifically,
in the next game who will have some early entry decisions to make this year.
Is that a positive evolution for college basketball, the WNBA, that that has
become a decision?  
DAWN STALEY: Is that?  
  
Q. A positive evolution for the women 's game.  
DAWN STALEY: I'm one that likes options for me personally. I like options. I
think most people would like options. There's not one way or the other. You
have options, and you have to weigh the options. Is it a positive thing if
players graduate? If they are of age to make a decision to go to the league, I
think it's an individual and a personal one.  
  
Q. Do you think the league 's new CBA will make it more of an issue?  
DAWN STALEY: No, no. Because I don't think the players that are coming out
will benefit from being cored in getting the top dollar. There's a rookie
salary cap. I don't think it's as lucrative as people think.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State 79, LSU 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State.  
  
We will start with some opening comments by Coach Schaefer.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First, just want to congratulate LSU. Just have so much respect
for Nikki and her staff and that team. They played a heck of a game yesterday.
The first half today really dictated the tempo today. I said at halftime to my
staff, We can't play much worse. I thought they had a lot to do with that.  
  
We were going to have to beat them at their game because we were playing at
their pace. But then to go out and score 53 points in the second half when we
only had 26 at halftime, so much of that was predicated on our defense.  
  
Jordan was spectacular today. I just thought she made some tremendous
decisions in transition. She goes 8-12, had five rebounds, three assists, two
steals. Again, she's kind of the heartbeat of our team. As she goes, our team
kind of feeds off her juice. She really had it today.  
  
Then Rickea, obviously 10-18, has a double-double. To get no turnovers -- I
think this is the first game all year she's had no turnovers in a game --
three assists and two steals, one block.  
  
Really, really proud of our team. I've been really worried about LSU. They had
played us so well at our place. Came back and actually had a chance to tie it
late after we were up 20 in the third quarter. This is a tough, physical,
aggressive basketball team. That's my kind of team. They're going to be so
successful in postseason. They're going to do a great job. I know Nikki will
have them ready for the NCAA tournament.  
  
A great win for us. A great second half. Obviously the shot at halftime that
puts us up one, that's a smart play by a really smart player in Andy. If
you're at our shootarounds the night before, all of our kids want to make
half-court shots before we get ice cream the night before. That's a kid that
did the same thing earlier in the year at Vegas at a tournament. Made a three
at the buzzer from pretty close to the same spot.  
  
Proud of our kids, proud of my fans that are here today. Our fans that came
and traveled provided such a great atmosphere for our kids, really for the
entire game. Just really blessed, giving God the glory for number 26 and we
get to live another day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jo, you and Rickea, everybody couldn 't buy a shot in the first half.
Getting some good looks, couldn't make them. What got y'all going in the
second half?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: I really think Andy's shot before the half gave us a lot of
energy, a lot of momentum going into the second half. The shots weren't bad
shots, they just weren't falling.  
  
Coaches told us to just keep shooting, keep driving the ball, it will come to
you. That's what we did. We had to keep playing our game. We was a little
stagnant on offense in the first half. We had to get some movement going on,
get out in transition, guard the ball.  
  
Our defense led to offense, and that's really what carried us in the second
half.  
  
Q. Rickea, we talked about your rebounding a hundred times this year.
But 23-10, got the double-double. What were you seeing on the boards tonight?
How much did that help?  
RICKEA JACKSON: Before the game, Coach Schaefer was talking about we need to
rebound, especially offensive rebound, like No. 1, Cherry, she goes to the
boards hard, has tons of offensive rebounds. I knew I had to rebound for our
team in order for us to win.  
  
Q. Rickea, safe to say you have the rust knocked off after the last
couple games? What did that feel like to get back out there and back into your
groove offensively and have such a big second half?  
RICKEA JACKSON: It felt pretty good that I could come through for my team,
just knowing that they always have confidence in me and always give me the
ball. Just make me more confident to make the shot so...  
  
Q. Jo, another game where Maya has a really good game as a point guard.
How much easier does it make it when she 's playing that way?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: It makes it very easy on me. Maya is a good facilitator. She
finds the open person and she know who needs the ball at the right time. She
feeds the high hand. Just having Maya run our team, be that presence as a
point guard, it's easier on me because I don't have to do that (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. Andy 's shot was big, but how big was the press in y'all's man-to-man
defense in the front court to get the offense a spark?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think we were really soft to start the game. We had no ball
pressure. We had no denial. We were really soft. For whatever reason, I just
was really disappointed. Seemed like everybody I put in, Maya was the only
constant, consistent defensively with pressure I felt like the whole first
half.  
  
I thought the second half our press kicked in a little bit. They had to play
yesterday. So you're playing that pressure defense with the hopes that that
kind of wears them down a little bit, back-to-back games, their depth, or lack
of, wears on them a little bit.  
  
Pointer, God almighty, she is good. She is a warrior. Tougher than nails. Just
have so much respect for her. We really just tried to create a little bit of
anxiety for her. Again, Aifuwa was good early. Then we really did a great job
on her late and she ends up 5-15.  
  
Yeah, the press, we turned them over, then that constant nagging having to
really take care of the ball I think wears on them a little bit. They may have
gotten a little tired.  
  
Q. Last year here your team was driven, weren 't going to be denied
anything. Did you worry about your team's motivation coming in that perhaps
you had to reset, different kind of narrative this year than a year ago?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Last year's team, they were so focused on doing something that
had never been done, to win a conference tournament championship. There wasn't
anything going to get in their way of that.  
  
This year's team, we are so different. I mean, I've said this a lot, I don't
know whether to pull out the Crayolas and coloring books on some days, we're
just so young.  
  
Just like tonight, we get up 13, 14, 15, we need to maybe work a little clock.
We come down, boom, boom, make a pass, take a quick shot, it goes in. That's
just how we play.  
  
I'm trying to hold them up a little bit, pull the reins back, but they won't
have any part of it. That's how they played. They have a lot of confidence. As
young as we are, we are talented.  
  
My concern going in was just like what happened the first half. Whatever you
want to call it, it can't be rust, we've been playing, good gosh, for four
months. It's just my team. Some nights it just takes more than one pull to get
the 9.9 going. It's just them.  
  
The second half, I mean, you got to look, we scored 26 points the first half
and turn around and get 53 the second half. It's like somebody said in the
back, You only working half tonight, Vic? No, trust me, it's just how it is.  
  
I think with our kids, a lot of it was predicated on our defense tonight. Once
we got that going then I think we kind of got going downhill. When we play
downhill, that's when we play our best.  
  
I told my staff at halftime, the way it was going in the first half, we were
going to have to beat them at their own game because that's the tempo that was
being played. We got a lot of good looks the first half, they just weren't
going.  
  
I thought the second half we made those shots. We got to the rim some. We got
out in transition. Jo was just spectacular. She was really good tonight,
y'all.  
  
Q. We saw Aliyah start, then she didn 't play much. Is there a reason
she started over Rickea?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah.  
  
Q. Was Rickea suspended or anything?  
VIC SCHAEFER: No.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys didn 't make shots the way you wanted to in the
first half. Andy hits the shot. How does that change your message at
halftime?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Again, with talking to my staff, I told the team this, Man, we
can't play much worse and we're up one. Andy, great job. Way to be focused and
smart.  
  
Some kids just have it. Andy is really smart. She's a cerebral player. To know
we were fumbling the ball out there, clock was going down. We had a play
called off the free throw. To know we had fumbled it, Rickea has the presence
to throw it to Andy, Andy has the presence to turn and just get it to the rim.
Again, she's made that shot before in Vegas earlier in the year in December.  
  
That's a smart, heady play. You go in at halftime, you got a little momentum
really. Again, instead of down two, being up one, that's significant in my
mind. Again, they had thrown one in, so we were even. It was a push. They
threw one in at the shot clock, we threw one in. Made me feel a little better
anyway.  
  
Q. What lessons do you take away from today going into tomorrow?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, again, I think our kids get their feet wet today and get
to play in that environment, that arena. They know we're going to play a
really good team tomorrow.  
  
I think they get a little bit, I don't know if 'comfortable' is the right
word, but at least they get acclimated. If it's Tennessee, we had a knock-
down, drag-out with them earlier in Knoxville in the year. If it's Kentucky,
it's a team that beat us. Really, it's the only game all year that we really
just never were in.  
  
I think either way, we get their attention. Again, I think our kids saw today,
whether they were on the bench or on the floor, they saw how when we get going
in transition, when we can get going in the open court, make good decisions,
we're pretty good.  
  
So I think we'll have some -- hopefully you get a little confidence from that.
You got to realize the next opponent is going to be even bigger, is going to
be even tougher. We know what our struggles were with Kentucky, we know what
our struggles were with Tennessee. Both those teams are well-coached. Got
great players, future WNBA players. They got difference players. Both of them
have dominant guards that can go get 25, 30. That's the first thing that gets
your attention.  
  
Rhyne Howard, Rennia Davis. Two big guards that can light it up. Whoever we
get, we'll have their attention and be excited to play.  
  
I'll tell y'all, I haven't slept much. I've been really worried about LSU. The
other piece is that we have so many fans here, people plan for this event now
at Mississippi State, really makes it special, that atmosphere...  
  
For me there's a sense of ownership and a sense of responsibility because
those people have planned their weekend, they're spending probably thousands
of dollars to come follow our team. I don't want them to go home early.  
  
I really wear that. I wear that responsibility because I would be so
disappointed if that happened. It happens. Look, you can look all over the
country. It happens in men's and women's basketball all the time.  
  
I know my fans. I know who they are, just what tremendous fans they are, how
hard working they are, how they love the Bulldogs. I'm glad they get to stay
another night and we get to play another day.  
  
Q. Y 'all have made five straight semifinals. Last year it's about
winning a championship. When you look back at when you took over this program,
what does that speak to about where this program is from then to now?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know how many of y'all were here the first year when we
limped out to the jump circle to play Alabama on the first night. I'm telling
you, we limped out and got beat by Alabama. We had just beat them at home a
week earlier by 26.  
  
They stood around in a 1-3-1 zone and begged us to shoot it from 12 feet and
we accommodated them, scored 36 points. Look it up, I promise you not far from
that, 36 or 37.  
  
We're a long way from that, buddy. Quite frankly I'm disappointed you brought
it up because I don't ever want to think about those days. That was rough.
When I came off the floor that night, I remember looking at my former AD,
looked at him dead in the eye and said, I'm sorry.  
  
Again, my team, my program, I'm responsible. At the end of the day I'm
accountable. To know how far we've come from that day, we're proud of where we
are. This is what's expected now. Those fans out there expect it. They're here
all weekend. They didn't make a reservation for one night and maybe the second
night. They expect it also. That's the expectations we've created at
Mississippi State.  
  
I'm glad we're a long way from that. It's taken a lot of hard work and
commitment from a lot of people. It doesn't go unappreciated. Again, I know
how hard it is to do. We'll just keep our heads down, rear-ends up, keep
grinding away.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord, go Dogs.

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas 67, Texas A&M 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from Coach Neighbors.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We've obviously built our program around defense wins
championships. Defensive stop won the game for a change, so...  
  
Really proud of our poise to stick together after another really tough start
against -- just tougher circumstances and a tougher situation. Really quality
team. I thought for the majority of the game, it didn't look good for us. When
you only lead for 8.4 seconds of the game, it's the most important part.  
  
This is one of those games we'll have to go kind of go back and rewatch to
remember exactly how it happened. The timeouts were really key all the way
through. The halftimes, the way they were talking to each other, the words
they were using, the way they just talked to each other is the reason that no
deficit is ever too much to count this team out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kiara, talk me through the two free throws.  
KIARA WILLIAMS: With the rebound, I was looking at the ball. It didn't matter
who was in front of me or who was around. The ball was my go-to. During those
free throws, I remember I was thinking I made all of them the whole game,
like, these two aren't any different, yet it's big. I can still, like, make
them. That was my whole thing, is just trying to stay poised, not think too
much.  
  
I knew my team needed it, so I wanted to pull through for them.  
  
Q. Chelsea, did the zone they was running at you in the first half seem
to bother you a little bit?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: We struggled to get in the gap and force a second person. But
once we settled into it and found our shot, we got a little bit of a momentum
going.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what was the message in the final timeout before the
defensive stop?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Just to flood the gap. We knew Chennedy was going to take the
last shot. Just helping whoever was guarding her, helping our teammate,
securing the rebound.  
  
Q. Both of you speak on the overall team effort you displayed today.  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I think we fought the whole game. Our three-point shot, we
struggled from time to time, but we fought together, we stayed together,
especially on the defensive side, being in those gaps, helping each other out.  
  
KIARA WILLIAMS: Same thing. During halftime, this is probably the one of the
most times that we've, like, ever sat down and talked, actually listened to
each other. Hey, this is what we need to do. We all came together as one.  
  
It clicked on defense in the right time. We knew our shots was going to fall.
We've been in those situations many a times before. We knew, tried to keep
telling Chelsea, Amber, Lexi, Keep shooting, we knew they were going to make
it.  
  
Q. Kiara, perception of the team, fair or unfair, is up-tempo, shoot the
three. You had to grind one out here. Does that change that in any way?  
KIARA WILLIAMS: Everybody knows we're a three-point shooting team. Everyone
knows their role. When that's not falling, we just try to have other people
step up.  
  
With that I think me and my teammate Taylah did a good job defensive-wise in
helping that out so it wouldn't be as much pressure on offense.  
  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I think this team is special because at any given night
anybody can take over and help us win. I think that's the special thing about
this team.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you were both in this situation a year ago. How much did
last year continue to help you?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: We mentioned that. We had a little pregame video that we
watched. We watched those last couple of minutes. That inspired us that we
knew what we were against and we knew what it took to win.  
  
KIARA WILLIAMS: We just kept saying that we've been here before. We all know
what we're capable of, how to shot, how to get stops. We just needed to lock
in, and we all knew we could do it.  
  
Q. Kiara, knowing that you 're going to have to get some points in the
paint somewhere, did you sense maybe you were going to have some kind of
increased role in this game?  
KIARA WILLIAMS: At first my mindset was just to play defense and to stop them
on offensive rebounds. When we noticed that Ciera went out, that was the time
that I was like, Okay, I can score, I just need to step up and try it.
Hopefully my teammates have my back. And they did, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Neighbors.  
  
Q. How big was the opening of the second half with the 8-0 run and cut
into that deficit?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Maybe even got to 10. I think Jeff said that.  
  
We talked at halftime about throwing it. We drew a little circle on where we
needed to get it to either by driving it there or throwing it there. That's
what Kiara was talking about. Then that opened up. That was the key to getting
it opened up a little bit, and those couple of shots fell.  
  
The key to building momentum is when you tell the kids something, you hope it
works because that makes them feel like, Okay, this is it. We had a couple of
very good breaks go our way that just snowballed.  
  
Y'all know our team well enough. When we get just a little bit of momentum,
that crowd rises up behind us, everything starts to click for us. It can be a
bad thing for us when we can't find that spark. The first four minutes of the
third quarter, our goal was always to make the opponent's coach call a timeout
in the third quarter, and we made him call two.  
  
Q. When the shots weren 't falling early on, how important was it to get
the ball in the paint?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: With us you know it's going to come, but the longer it goes,
the more apprehensive you get and the harder they get to make.  
  
We kept talking about driving it, drive it in there and either score or find
somebody with a little bit better shot. They forced us to take some really
tough shots early on. Their defense was really, really good.  
  
When Ciera went out and they went small, it kind of threw us for a little bit
of a loop because we weren't as prepared for that lineup. We made a couple of
adjustments and I thought we were able to get it inside driving it.  
  
We had 26 points in the paint against them the first time, we only had six at
halftime. It was a key to keep us from hanging around. We're not going to win
if we don't make a few threes. You certainly can't come back from down 17 with
a bunch of free throws and 2s. It was important that that opened up the three-
point line.  
  
Q. You fell into a media timeout this time.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah. I knew this game, we had a chance to win it in the end.
I didn't want to waste the timeout. The media was close. 12 was kind of my
number. They were setting on 12. Did they get to 12-0? 30 seconds away, we
were able to save that one this time.  
  
That's just knowing your team, knowing your kids, knowing you don't have to do
the same thing every time to get the same result. If we would have lost by one
point, I probably would have gone back and second-guessed myself to death. I'm
not going to overstate that it made that big of a difference.  
  
I just think knowing your team, if you give this group confidence and a
glimmer of hope, they'll usually come through for you.  
  
Q. Alexis had an off day today, maybe got a little flustered. The talks
you 've had with her. Secondly, what was going through your mind when Kiara
was at the free-throw line and then on that 8-second defensive stand?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I'll answer in reverse order. Remind me about the Lex part.  
  
Kiara has been shooting it great in practice. We were over there talking about
when she makes it, not the 'if' contingencies. When she makes this, let's make
sure we have our best defensive lineup in there.  
  
She's a senior. She's filled a role this year, battled through injuries. We
all talked about how vital she has been in staying with our program when we
got there. Had that feeling she was going to make them both.  
  
We did sub. Went with a small lineup that we can switch out on. We wanted to
switch all ball screens. Instead of going five guards, Taylah is basically a
big guard. She and Chennedy were high school teammates. I don't know if
everybody put that together. They played together for a long time. She wanted
to be in the game at the end.  
  
If you go back and look at the clip, when they switched screens, she is in a
defensive stance and made her take a really tough shot. There was a little
strategy involved in the defensive switching.  
  
Talking to Lex, she has matured so much. She knows way ahead of anything I'm
going to say to her. About the time I get ready to say something, she already
has those words coming out of her mouth. I got this, I can do some other
things to help us win, I'm going to hit a big one. Her voice in the timeouts
were important when we were going offense, defense.  
  
If we can survive that night, we still haven't had all three clicking yet,
we'll have a night. It's going to take a night like that tomorrow night to
beat South Carolina, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Carolina throws a ton of bigs at teams. How are you going to offset
their height advantage?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We don't have a really good answer for that one. They've
really dominated us two times with their size. We'll try to turn it into a
track meet. But the problem with doing that against them is they're pretty
good at track meets, too.  
  
There's not a weakness they have. We'll have to be on the top of our game,
hope we can catch them maybe looking past to a championship game or something.
Maybe the big crowd here, the pressure of playing in front of the home crowd
gets too much.  
  
They have really established themselves as clearly one of the best teams in
the country. The size is just part of it. It's athletic size, agile size,
strong size. They know how to play basketball. They're coached by the Olympic
team coach. Got our work cut out for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Winning a game with a defensive possession...  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Doesn't happen very often. I mean, it wasn't just that one
possession. We played great defense in the last six minutes of the game. We
were flooding in gaps, made their shots a lot harder, really cleaned up their
offensive rebounding. They didn't get one when they needed it.  
  
That last possession is the one everybody talks about. We had to get some
stops along the way. You can't cut into a 17-point lead trading buckets. It
was tough. We talked about doing it from the get-go, but talking about it and
being about it is two completely different things.  
  
Amber is such a good help-side defender. Once she started getting in the right
spots... Nobody has talked about Makayla Daniels, the job that kid does night
in and night out, guarding the other team's best player. She guarded Chennedy
Carter and made her work for it. She had to take 25 shots to get 23 points.  
  
Makayla and A'T did a great job tag teaming her. Makayla as a freshman came in
here and not only done that but is she our leading scorer today, too?  
  
THE MODERATOR: That's correct.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Wow, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time today.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Rhyne Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36622)

### [KeKe McKinney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38934)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Kentucky 86, Tennessee 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kentucky.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: It's always great to win in the SEC tournament. We've won a
bunch of games over the years in this tournament, and I can't remember one
where I was more proud of how hard the players fought and hustled tonight from
the opening tip, really started the game with tremendous energy and focus and
tenacity.  
  
I thought let Tennessee know we were here to play early, and that's what we
needed to do to build some momentum in the game. We were able to maintain it
in just a fantastic win for the Kentucky Wildcats. Extremely proud of our
players.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rhyne, Tennessee seems to have an endless supply of long bodies. What
were you able to do to negate that?  
RHYNE HOWARD: Well, I also have a pretty long body, so I think it kind of
evens out.  
  
I just put the trust in my teammates and my coaches to call the right plays or
set me up for screens and open shots, just let the game come to me.  
  
Q. KeKe, for a neutral site game, there was a lot of orange in those
stands. How important was it to take the crowd out of the game early?  
KEKE McKINNEY: I think it's like any other game. I don't really worry about
who's in the crowd or what team. I'm here to play for Kentucky just like
everyone else. We're here to just get the job done no matter who's in the
crowd.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Rhyne doesn 't score until late in the second quarter. You extend the
lead. What does that say about the depth of this team?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Well, it's a good night for us when we can have some
balance. Rhyne certainly leads the way, has just had a phenomenal year. She is
an explosive scorer.  
  
But if you look at all of our significant wins this year, when we've played
well, we have great balance.  
  
Just so proud of the team for getting focused this entire week. We started the
week off with a loss that we felt like we had control of the game in
Nashville, let that slip away from us. So really proud of the team for
bouncing back once again. We've not lost two in a row this year. They've
always had that resilience about them.  
  
It's a tough group. This was a big win for us. We needed to come in here and I
think validate our seed and let people know we were a dangerous team here in
the postseason.  
  
Real proud of how the team responded.  
  
Q. You played them earlier in the season. Game was a lot closer.
Honestly wasn 't much of a game after the second half. What did you see in the
first game that helped?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: It was so early in the conference season, second game, we
had just come off of a disappointing loss to South Carolina. We really needed
to bounce back.  
  
I feel like we got better over the course of time during the regular season on
some key things you have to do to beat Tennessee. I thought we really battled
the boards tonight and were able to come up even on the boards. That's no
small task. They are one of the best teams in the country rebounding.  
  
I thought we were able to turn them over in the first game and get some points
off turnovers. We did that well again tonight.  
  
I think it's a totally different atmosphere in the SEC tournament. That game
was so long ago, we really tried to focus in on what Kentucky could do well. I
think in a tournament setting that's really the key for you, is to try to come
out and be the best version that you can be.  
  
I thought the team did a great job of that tonight.  
  
Q. About the rebounding, you matched them in rebounds and points in the
paint. What was the difference in this game?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I just thought the determination of the players right from
the jump. It was not only the rebounds we were getting, it was how we were
doing it. I thought we were very aggressive just snatching rebounds with two
hands, just establishing a presence on the boards early.  
  
Again, like I said in the opening statement, letting them know we were there
to play. I think against a Tennessee team you have to establish a presence of
tenacity in a couple of places: You got to be really tough on the boards and
you got to come out swinging on defense. If you look at the stats, they're one
of the best teams in the country rebounding and field goal defense.  
  
You have to come out there and match that and try to be really aggressive.
That's what we try to talk about before the game, that hustle is so important
for this version of the Kentucky Wildcats. We just have to have that kind of
effort to be the team we can be.  
  
I thought tonight was as good of an example of that as we've had this season,
just the way we established ourselves in the game.  
  
Q. You saw Mississippi State a couple weeks ago. What did you take from
that game? What are you expecting tomorrow?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Well, they're extremely talented, very fast, well-coached.
They have some size. We have some issues there. They've got a little more size
and length at some positions.  
  
But we have to be ready for a real, real tough game. They're an outstanding
team. We played real hard and were able to earn a victory. We were proud of
that one. Tomorrow will be a tough game. We have to come out and, again, we
have to try, to the best of our ability, to play Kentucky basketball and
really focus in on the things that are important for us to play well.  
  
It's a great opportunity for us. We love playing in this tournament. We're
happy to have another opportunity in it.  
  
Q. You have a player from Knoxville, Chattanooga, two assistants that
were at the staff at Tennessee. You have another player from Memphis. What is
all this Tennessee stuff?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I'm grateful for the opportunity Pat Summitt gave me 21
years ago. Pat and Mickie and Holly really embraced me as a young coach. It
changed my life professionally to be able to be in that program, to learn from
Coach Summitt, all the great people that were there, build some lifelong
relationships.  
  
Known Kyra and Niya since they were coming out of their freshmen year in
college, just built some great relationships and gained a lot from that
experience.  
  
We recruit Kentucky so hard, we're really proud any time we have a player from
Kentucky who can play for us. We really focus on that. But the border states
are important for us, too. Tennessee has been a state where we've gotten some
really good players on this particular team.  
  
You just never know who's going to fit and where they're going to fit. I think
these players saw our vision at Kentucky and what we're about and signed up
and we've benefited from their presence.  
  
I think Jaida Roper a lot of times gets overlooked. You talk about her being
from Memphis. She has squeezed everything out of her opportunity at Kentucky.
She is really our floor general right now as a senior point guard. She's
banged up and not full speed. Man, she is giving us everything she has and
doing a great job. We're proud of our players. We're going to try to fight
again tomorrow, see if we can get one more victory.  
  
Q. You 've been through a lot of these SEC tournaments. You said you're
bringing this team here to win this thing. How is preparation with a team that
did legitimately win the title different than one which may not be as
competitive?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I think what we try to do is get some rest early in the
week. I think that was really important. If we can do and play close to our
best, the way we did tonight, there's some key things that have to happen,
then we feel like we can win the tournament.  
  
A real blessing out of being the third seed and not knowing who you're
playing, there's a possibility you could play one of three teams when the week
starts. I think it helps you get focused on who you are, sort of simplify that
and really latch onto that.  
  
No matter who you have, you're not going to have a ton of time to prepare.
I've always felt like in this tournament you need to focus on what you're
doing. They had a good week of doing that. They came out tonight and played
some good Kentucky basketball. So proud of 'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Kellie Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30789)

### [Lou Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38927)

### [Rennia Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34708)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Kentucky 86, Tennessee 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
KELLIE HARPER: We're disappointed. But Kentucky just played a terrific
basketball game. I think the second quarter got away from us. We had a few too
many plays that we needed to execute better both offensively and defensively.
Allowed them to go on a run and get really comfortable.  
  
When that team is comfortable, they make shots. I mean, we were throwing a lot
of different defenses at them, but they kept finding people that put the ball
in the hole.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rennia, from your experience before in the SEC tournament, having to
play last night against a team with fresh legs tonight in Kentucky, what
impact might that have had on this game?  
RENNIA DAVIS: I honestly don't think it had an impact. I really think it was
all us. I don't think we executed as well as we could have, especially on the
defensive end. So, yeah, I'm really disappointed in that.  
  
Q. Lou, when you think about what this team is bringing back for next
year, what are some of the highlights?  
LOU BROWN: I think this team with Kellie's guidance, this team has a bright
future ahead of them. They have so much talent coming back. You'll have
freshmen that have a lot of experience under their belts now, big playing
minutes, in the SEC tournament and throughout the SEC. I think that in itself
will push the team ahead next season.  
  
Q. Rennia, as you think about your off-season, what you want to improve
going into your senior year, what does that look like?  
RENNIA DAVIS: Just stay in the gym and keep working whatever the team needs me
to do. Continue to crash the boards. Just continue to try to communicate with
my teammates and build those relationships off the court. I think it will help
translate over.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
Coach, any final thoughts?  
  
KELLIE HARPER: I don't think our season is over. Hopefully these players
aren't thinking about next year right now. I hope they're still thinking about
the NCAA tournament.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Faustine Aifuwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38879)

### [Khayla Pointer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36576)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State 79, LSU 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU.  
  
We will start out with a statement from Coach Fargas.  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: This is a tough loss for us. It's going to sit a little bit
longer in the pit of our stomach. But I will say that I was proud of this
group for coming back after yesterday's win and playing 20 minutes of really
good basketball, really high-level basketball.  
  
We hit adversity in the first half, and we still had players playing with a
lot of confidence and a lot of competitive spirit.  
  
In the second half Mississippi State, being one of the best teams in our
league and in our country, showed exactly why they are. This is something that
we're going to take from, learn from it, and be better for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Faustine, y 'all had a lot of success against Jessika Carter in the
post. How do you feel you did taking her out of her game?  
FAUSTINE AIFUWA: I think the biggest thing was just staying aggressive. We
knew she wanted to get down in the post. I think the biggest thing was push
her out there and make her do something else besides operating in the block.  
  
We did a good job in the first half. We just kind of slipped up in the second.  
  
Q. Khayla, they kind of dictated the game with their defense in the
second half. How tough is it to go against them when they 're pressuring the
ball as much as they did?  
KHAYLA POINTER: Yeah, kind of like Coach said, they're one of the best teams
in our conference and in the country with their defense. When you give a team
like Mississippi State turnovers and transition points, that's what they're
good at, that's what their game is.  
  
In the second half we kind of folded with that. We did a great job in the
first half taking care of the ball. Our turnovers in the second half led to
their transition points, that kind of got them going.  
  
Q. Obviously big moment in the game was the shot right before the half.
From a player perspective, how tough was it to go into the half after that
shot?  
KHAYLA POINTER: Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking it gave them a little momentum. We
tried to come out and we wanted to be the team to punch first. But I think
they kind of fed off that shot a little bit. It was a lucky shot it went in.  
  
They kind of fueled off that I think in the second half. We didn't come out
ready and they hit us first.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We will continue with questions for Coach Fargas.  
  
Q. Did you see anything different from them in the second half than the
first? More of a pep in their step?  
NIKKI FARGAS: I thought Jackson's play was huge. We didn't match what she was
doing on the floor. I felt as though a lot of 50/50 balls, they were more in
their favor than ours. They played scrappier and harder.  
  
You have a point guard, experienced point guard, in Danberry, who I thought
just kind of took over. Her defensive presence really disrupted us. There were
so many times where when you're playing a team like Mississippi State, you got
to play downhill. We started settling for jumpers. Those weren't falling. Next
person shoots a jumper, that doesn't fall. It just adds more pressure on that
jump shot.  
  
Mississippi State is a team that rotates very well. We didn't do a great job
of making the extra pass. We've got to be better. We had a couple of charges
that we took by not playing off of two. Shot-fake-shot, when you're playing
shot blockers in the paint, you have to go to the basics of the game. I felt
like we got away from that, especially in the second half.  
  
Q. You mentioned Rickea 's play in second half. You kept her pretty much
in check when you met the first go-around. What was different?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Ayana Mitchell can keep a lot of people in check. That was her
defensive assignment, so to speak. We don't have Mitchell, but we still got
players that are going to lay it on the line and do their best. They've had to
move themselves up a notch from Awa Trasi, now our starter, who was hot coming
off the bench. We were moving up Mercedes Brooks, a freshman, to take that
spot. It's just been a work in progress.  
  
Like I said, this is a 40-minute basketball game. If you just played the first
20, I'd be happy. Again, Mississippi State has players that can make plays. At
this time in postseason, you go as your guard play go. Rickea had an
unbelievable night against us. I thought she did a nice job, too, of elevating
from a standpoint of board play. When you're controlling the boards, you're
going to control the tempo of the game.  
  
Q. Walk me through what you do between now and March 16. Take a little
time off? Practice?  
NIKKI FARGAS: You do a little bit of both. Right now we have some time to take
some days off, but we want to get back and make sure that we're practicing and
working on the things that challenged us this week. We want to make sure that
we're getting this group ready as best as we can, but also being aware of the
recovery.  
  
The pounding in the SEC is really tough. I mean, when you go through our
schedule, January, February, it's physical, it's up-tempo. This is an
opportunity for those who are a little banged up to kind of have that rehab,
recovery time, hopefully get your legs underneath you. We know we have a tough
challenge ahead of us coming up for NCAAs.  
  
We'll split time with rehab, recovery, then obviously getting on the court,
getting some skill work in. This is a good opportunity for us to do that. It's
also a great opportunity for us to watch a lot of film. We can get better
mentally through watching film on ourselves.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 6, 2020

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Shambria Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36665)

### [Chennedy Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34737)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas 67, Texas A&M 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas A&M.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Blair.  
  
GARY BLAIR: My kids played one heck of a ball game. We shot well enough. We
missed some golden opportunities in the last quarter. We had layups not go in.
We had put-backs not go in. A couple costly turnovers.  
  
But I wouldn't change a thing that we did in the ball game. Injuries happen.
It hurt us big-time when Ciera went out. It could be pretty serious. It's not
just a sprained ankle. But we've dealt with injuries for the last two years
and we'll find a way to overcome it.  
  
But my basketball team played their guts out. They played hard. You got to
want the ball in that situation. We wanted Carter on the drive. We were
crashing the boards. Obviously she was going through four people. Obviously we
thought she got hit on the wrist, but the referees didn't. It's up to us to be
able to make the shot to go through.  
  
But Chennedy Carter wants the basketball. That's the most important thing
you've got to be able to have as an athlete, that somebody wants it at the end
and can wear it on her shoulders whether she hit the shot or she missed the
shot.  
  
It was a great ball game. The three at the end that Shambria hit, that was
huge. That was our only second shot of the ball game. That she did under
pressure. She directed our ball club, played great defense the whole night.  
  
Give them credit. Daniels came in and hurt us with 13 points. I thought we did
a pretty good job as you can do on Tolefree. Dungee got a couple baskets at
the end that hurt us.  
  
Sometimes it's easier being David coming from behind than being Goliath always
in the front and in the lead. We led the whole ball game. Sometimes it's hard
to be able to keep going.  
  
Our kids, I've got nothing but great things to say about these two young
ladies up here and the ones that are crying their eyes out in the dressing
room, because we know how hard we competed. We'll go down to the NCAA
tournament, our season is not over, we'll go on the road like big boys and big
girls. Wherever we're sent, we'll do our best to represent Texas A&M and the
SEC.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chennedy, walk us through the last shot.  
CHENNEDY CARTER: Nothing. Make the shot. Missed the shot. Tough play. Tough to
walk through a play like that.  
  
I felt like consecutively I got hacked a lot on my middle drive. I don't know
what you want me to say. I just missed the shot, man.  
  
Q. Obviously a tough time, but you have a decision to make coming up
about the WNBA. When will you make that decision?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I'm just focused on the rest of the NCAA season.  
  
GARY BLAIR: That's not a fair question after we just played our guts out, sir.
That's not a fair question. Has anybody else got another question?  
  
Q. Sham, this is a significant loss. It 's not looking good for Ciera.
Still a lot to play for this season. Elaborate on that a little bit.  
SHAMBRIA WASHINGTON: Our season's not over. We're going to continue to get
better, go back to the drawing board. We have a lot of practices ahead of us.
We still have fight. Losses happen. It's just how we bounce back from the
loss, what lessons we learned. It's not a loss if we learn valuable lessons.  
  
We grow from this, stick together as a team, block out the naysayers and be
the women in the arena and just take care of our business from here on out.  
  
Q. I 've heard Coach Blair talk on many occasions about respecting the
game, working hard. Describe how you as a team have worked hard behind the
scenes to get where you are today.  
SHAMBRIA WASHINGTON: Well, hopefully from here on out we played hard enough
that it won't be a question about what we do. We play hard. We stick together.
We're Aggies at the end of the day. We're trying to represent Texas A&M the
best we can. You can't fake the harvest.  
  
Our work started in the summer, last off-season. We're going to continue to
grow, stick together, get better on film. The season isn't over. We still have
time to improve. These few weeks we have between now and the NCAA tournament
is when we put extra work in and improve to be better players.  
  
Q. Sham, looks like you made life difficult for them on the perimeter
most of the game. What was the approach coming in?  
SHAMBRIA WASHINGTON: We watched them play yesterday. They got hot against
Auburn. Their team is capable of getting hot. They shoot a lot of threes, a
lot of them go in, some of them don't.  
  
Sticking to our principles, being true to ourselves, playing out of a stance,
sticking with our schemes, our game plans, being active in gaps.  
  
Kudos to them. They knocked down shots when they needed to. Respect to them. I
don't take anything away from them. They hit shots. That's all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. You knew they like to shoot it. A lot of that comes in transition
usually. How much of that offensively on your end was able to keep them from
doing that most of the game?  
GARY BLAIR: I think our transition defense was outstanding. They only had five
points on the fast break. Tolefree and Dungee were most of the time not
getting a trailing three.  
  
Tolefree can put the ball on the floor as good as anybody in this league after
she shows shot. Sometimes Arkansas is a streak team. They streak good, they
streak bad, but they have no conscious. They can miss five in a row and they
can come back and hit four in a row, or when it's time to drive and make the
last shot, they can do that as well.  
  
Give Coach Neighbors a lot of credit and his staff. They've done a good job. I
don't think neither one of us are real happy with our whole total play of the
game. I think we're both happy with the effort and the fight and how hard and
how many minutes all of our kids had to play.  
  
We're both NCAA teams. Like last year when Mike beat me, he knew he had to win
the next game, the championship, to have a chance to go to the NCAA. But it's
also a good thing about the WNIT, four big-time teams are going to the NCAA
that were all in, Northwestern, TCU, Arkansas, and the other one I can't
remember who it was, but four teams that used the NIT to get to the NCAA.  
  
Sometimes the WNIT might stand for 'women not in tournament', but women on
their way to the next level to the tournament.  
  
I hope those teams that do not make the NCAA will sit there and go to the
WNIT. We won it in Arkansas in '99\. I went my second year to Arkansas. It's
been very good.  
  
I just want to give Arkansas a lot of credit for not giving up. When they got
real close and we cut that thing right back up to six or seven points, I
thought we showed a lot of grit and character and making the shots when it
counted.  
  
My bench played very well. Anna Dreimane, most of you cannot even pronounce
her name, and I cannot pronounce the last one pretty good, but she played
great today. Give her a little bit of credit for coming in and taking Ciera's
spot when we were in foul trouble.  
  
Q. The tempo and style of the game played to your team 's strengths. You
can't imagine a better scenario with the ball in Chennedy's hands at the end.
That's what you would want. What do you see in Arkansas in the way they were
able to handle the game although it didn't play to their style?  
GARY BLAIR: Arkansas's strength is their three-point shooting, the no fear.
What were they were down, 12-0 to us or something like that? Yesterday they
were down 8-0. They're not afraid of getting behind. I probably would have
panicked and called two timeouts. Mike's temperament is a lot better than mine
sometimes.  
  
I have a veteran team. We have to learn how to play through it. Arkansas is
going to have their work cut out against South Carolina. They know it. But who
cares. They're on house money. They're trying to get a higher seed. Tolefree
is not going to have two bad shooting nights in a row, but neither are we.  
  
When I get the ball to Chennedy at the end, or when Russell Westbrook has it
or James Harden has it, you want to get all the way to the hole because you
have the best chance. But sometimes you have to shoot the four-, the five-
footer because everybody is coming out at you.  
  
The one she would like to have back is when she drove the baseline and didn't
jump back into it and rim shot. I'd like to have a lot of our shots back that
we missed down the stretch.  
  
Hey, I think we got better as the game went on because we had to play without
Ciera and some other kids stepped up. We dominated the defensive boards the
whole night. So I had to slow down the offense, run some sets. The problem is
when we ran some of the beautiful sets that we ran in the second half, we just
missed the shot or missed the layup. We have to do a better job of cleaning
that up.  
  
Q. When I see you on the sidelines, I see a wise, seasoned coach
dispensing wisdom to all his players. We 're never too old to learn. What have
you learned from your players this season?  
GARY BLAIR: A lot of times as you get older you learn to fight through
adversity. We fought through eight games without Chennedy Carter and went 4-4.
The other kids got better because of it. They had to step up.  
  
I liken this ball game here, we started to go to Kayla Wells because we didn't
feel like Tolefree in foul trouble could stop her, and she didn't. I probably
should have called more calls. That's on me.  
  
But we were a little bit surprised that they played this as much man as they
did. We were ready for the jump or the zone. They came out and just said, Hey,
let's go for it.  
  
I learned about my players, it hurts right now. Doggone it, they're hurting.
That's what you want in sport, to be able to sit there and understand when
losing hurts worse than winning feels good. That's the way sports should be.
That's what I've learned about my players.  
  
But I appreciate the media that's here. Sir, you got the best-looking hat in
the room right now. I thank y'all.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas 90, Auburn 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn.  
  
We'll open with a statement from Coach Flo, then have questions just for our
student-athlete, then we'll continue with Coach Flo.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I just want to continue to thank my young ladies for
continuing to play hard. We knew today would be a tough game if we didn't get
out and defend the three-point line.  
  
I thought we started with great energy. It was just hard to keep it going.
Then playing such a tough game yesterday, I'm sure their legs got a little
tired. But they continued to fight.  
  
I'm just proud of the way they ended the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Unique Thompson.  
  
Q. First quarter you started out with an 8-0 run. What happened after
that?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: Well, we knew we had to come in and we had to make shots.
Then that's what we did, we came in with high energy. But once our shots
stopped falling, we couldn't really find our rhythm again. Because once our
shots were falling it was easier for us to still get turnovers, convert off of
them. But once our shots stopped falling, it was just harder to get back into
it, back into our rhythm of how we wanted the game to continue to go. But we
have to find a way.  
  
Q. You got your 22nd double-double of the season this year. That leads
the SEC. When you look back at this season, what you were able to do, what are
you going to take from this?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: I'm just going to use it as more fuel. Going into my last
year, I know I can't leave anything. I've made my mark at Auburn, but I can't
just stop here. I have to keep going and I have to continue to build a legacy
here for myself.  
  
So I'm just going to use this as -- this off-season I really worked very hard
and even during the season. Coach Flo stayed on me to keep working hard, keep
working hard. This is what it got me this far. I can only imagine what happens
if I continue to work hard.  
  
Q. Auburn is in a unique situation where this year you had the one
senior. Next year you 'll be the senior leader. When you think about the off-
season, developing your leadership skills, what does that look like for you?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: It's going to take more consistency from me. I know that this
year it was a bit of a struggle coming into the leadership role because I
wasn't that vocal. I like leading by example. It took me out of my comfort
zone this year.  
  
Just staying more consistent, even when things aren't going our way. I can't
just get quiet. I have to try to find a way more to just lead the girls
vocally because I know they look up to me.  
  
Q. What kind of things did you see from a learning perspective for your
younger players?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: They feed off of encouragement. They feed off energy. They
feed off leading by example. Whenever they see you doing it, they're also
going to try to do it. Whenever they see you doing something that isn't really
right, they're going to follow.  
  
The freshmen, they're a great class. It takes talking to them. It takes
showing them. Just continue to do what I did this year, but just building on
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Unique. We'll continue with questions for Coach Flo.  
  
Q. The five losses to start the SEC season put you in a tough position.
Talk about trying to get back. There were no back-to-back wins all season
beyond the two that ended the non-conference schedule.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, it was definitely a tough season. Majority of
it started with injuries. We started off the season with injuries, both the
two that we wanted to be point guards, they both did not start preseason. One
didn't even start back until the season started.  
  
Robyn was injured. You never could get a consistency like we wanted. Once we
got a consistent lineup, that started right after the Georgia game, we were
then able to play much better and continue. Everyone understood their role,
knew who was starting, who was coming off the bench.  
  
I'm a coach that likes consistency. It was hard for me to constantly change up
lineups. We had to change up the lineups coming into the Tennessee game when
Lauren Hansen went down because we had that starting lineup for almost eight
games I think.  
  
I think just the injuries throughout the year, having young kids, really
called for an up-and-down season.  
  
Q. With Arkansas 's ability to stretch the floor, how difficult is that
for your defense?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It's very difficult. I mean, they're not just
stretching the floor. They're making threes. They've got great three-point
shooters with great percentages. It was really hard to gamble off of anyone.  
  
Kudos to Arkansas. That's what Mike Neighbors has done. That's what he has
recruited. They've got really good three-point shooters. It was very hard to
defend. You just got to hope and pray that they don't knock shots down. But
that's not going to last very long. We saw that at the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to next season, what is going to have to be the mindset
of you and your team?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: My mindset is to be a pressing team. Now the players,
I really thought this year they took too long to buy into who we are and what
we do. That means we either got to make some changes, we got to go out and
recruit. We have to recruit the kids that fit our style.  
  
We went out and got the so-called scorers. Had a top ranking class last year
that hasn't panned out the way we need them to.  
  
At the end of the day I just got to be who I am, coach who I am. That's a
pressing team. We've always been a pressing team. Causes havoc. Nobody wants
to play us. We score off of our turnovers. We have to go back to being the
team that we are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Joni Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30359)

### [Jenna Staiti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38849)

### [Gabby Connally](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38850)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Georgia 68, Alabama 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Georgia.  
  
We will open with a statement from coach, then direct questions to the
student-athletes, then we'll finish with questions for coach.  
  
JONI TAYLOR: I'd like to start off by tipping our hat to Alabama. They were
playing really, really well. I have a lot of respect for what they do. Kristy
has them playing really hard. It was tough to watch.  
  
Really, really proud of our effort, how we played. I think everybody who came
in really contributed, did something to make a play. This was a tough game. I
told our team before the game started that effort was going to win the game
because these are two teams that play extremely hard. Talent wasn't going to
determine the outcome. It was going to be our effort.  
  
I thought we were really locked into the scouting report on both ends of the
floor and really did a good job of executing tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jenna, it seems like the beginning of a tournament can always be
pretty intense. You got more and more comfortable as the game progressed. Talk
about your mindset before the game, how it settled down. Were you nervous at
all?  
JENNA STAITI: Before the game I wasn't nervous. I knew that this was going to
be a tough game. I had to give all that I had in effort, just playing hard and
stuff.  
  
The first half I was not happy with the way I played. I mean, I was doing the
little things by grabbing rebounds and blocking shots. I felt like I had more
to contribute into the second half.  
  
I just told myself in the locker room, I got to get going. Just that self-talk
in my head, I think it translated over to the court.  
  
Q. Jenna, over the last eight games you 've been on a tear. What do you
think has been going well for you?  
JENNA STAITI: I just think playing strong and just my coaches, my teammates
give me so much confidence. They tell me all the time: The only one that can
stop me is me. Just keeping that positive mindset, doing what I can, just
giving all the effort that I can.  
  
If I mess up, I can't get mad at the one play, got to move on to the next
play. That was hard for me at the beginning of the season. Now I think since
I've translated into the second half of SEC play, it's gotten a lot better for
me.  
  
Q. Gabby, Jenna pulls down 14 rebounds, 20 points. What do you think is
the difference in her transformation? How much confidence does it give the
rest of the team?  
GABBY CONNALLY: Extreme amount of confidence. Jenna is a great player. I'm
glad she's on our team and we're not playing against her. She's special. She
can score all three levels; she can post up, shoot the three, shoot the
midrange.  
  
She does a lot of the dirty work for us. I think a lot of people don't even
realize. I'm just really happy for her that she's starting to play how she
knows she can play.  
  
Q. Gabby, when Jenna was struggling in the first half, you were the one
carrying the offensive load. What was your mentality going into the game?  
GABBY CONNALLY: I think that's really what it is, what you just said right
there. Just coming out aggressive, being aggressive, having that aggressive
mind state.  
  
Kind of me and Jenna are kind of the same in the fact that sometimes if things
aren't going early for us, we may drop our head, but the coaches always tell
us to keep shooting, keep being aggressive, stuff like that. My teammates have
an extreme amount of confidence in us. I think that really helps us, as well.  
  
Q. Gabby or Jenna, you have a short turnaround time. Things don 't get
any easier now, South Carolina. Describe what your schedule is going to be
like the rest of the day. Will you watch any of these games?  
JENNA STAITI: I think we are going right back to the hotel. Everybody is going
to shower. Then we got to get right to work on South Carolina. We celebrated a
little bit in the locker room, but we got to move on. We know it's a tough
matchup, we know what it's like to play South Carolina. They're the No. 1 team
in the country, they're going to bring all that they have their first game.  
  
We just got to change our mindset to South Carolina. It's got to be a tough
mindset.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Chloe, she came out really strong today. She 's had to step in with
big shoes to fill. How do you think her performance went?  
JONI TAYLOR: I'm so proud of Chloe. She really got thrust into a role. I'm not
going to say she wasn't prepared for it, but she's had to grow up really quick
and really fast. She's accepted that challenge from day one.  
  
We knew she was an exceptional athlete coming in. It's more than that. It's
understanding schematically what we want to do defensively. Let's just remind
everybody that she missed half of our season playing soccer with the preseason
schedule. She literally has made the adjustment and says, Coach, I'll do
whatever.  
  
On the offensive end, she's learned our offense, distributing the basketball
to the people who need it, playing a lot of minutes. I'm just really proud of
her ability to take on whatever it is we ask her to do, whatever form that
comes in. Just the future is really bright for her.  
  
Q. You went through a tough stretch at the end of January. What has been
going so well of late?  
JONI TAYLOR: I think it's a few things. I think number one, all four of those
games were against top-25 teams in our conference. That's why you come to the
SEC. It's extremely tough. You want to play against the best and with the
best. That's why you come to Georgia.  
  
I think also we're growing up. We're a young team. We have two starters
returning. Jenna didn't start last year. Maya didn't start last year. The only
two starters on the floor were Gabby and Steph. Que back and forth coming off
of an injury.  
  
So this team is just growing up. We're peaking at the right time. I have to
give the credit to our young ladies for that. Because they come to work every
single day no matter what the stat sheet said the night before, they're
anxious to learn, they're willing to be coached. It's starting to show up for
us now.  
  
Q. The little spurt at the beginning of the second half almost made the
difference. Did you say anything specifically at halftime?  
JONI TAYLOR: Not specifically. We made some tweaks offensively and
defensively. Then we just always tell them coming out of halftime the score is
0-0, especially in a game that's that close. We knew it was important to
maintain the lead, to try to stretch it out, to get stops. We were able to do
that.  
  
Q. Defensively forced 19 turnovers. What type of effort did it take
defensively to pull out this game, especially without Que?  
JONI TAYLOR: Everybody always asks me how are we going to replace Que. It's
replace Morrison by committee. There's not one person that can do what she
does. Maya got in there and rebounded the basketball. Chloe steps up really
big defensively. Everyone who comes into the game. Kaila Hubbard has been
excellent our last few games in the minutes she's played from a defensive
standpoint. Just making sure we're sound.  
  
Last time we played Alabama, they really got downhill on us penetration-wise.
That's something we really focused on. She do an excellent job of dribble
handoff penetration, ball screen action. We were able to kind of contain that
today.  
  
The other difference was we didn't send them to the free-throw line as much as
we did last time. That was a separator for us.  
  
Q. Now you face South Carolina. Daunting task as a coach. What is your
schedule going to be like the rest of the day?  
JONI TAYLOR: We'll go back to the hotel, they'll shower, we'll eat, give them
some time off. As a coaching staff we'll meet. Bring them back this afternoon,
watch film, walk through it. We will not take a shootaround tomorrow with a
12:00 tip, but we'll spend the rest of the day-evening watching film and
talking about what we need to do.  
  
Dawn, this is probably, in my opinion, the best team she put on the floor
since she's been at South Carolina. They're extremely talented at all five
positions. We have our work cut out for us, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Aijha Blackwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38827)

### [Hannah Schuchts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36659)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Tennessee 64, Missouri 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri.  
  
We're going to open with a statement from coach.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: First of all, thank you guys for coming out. I'm really proud
of our team. I told them in the locker room nobody really understands what our
journey has been like, the challenges that we've had, except those that were
in that locker room.  
  
I told them, look around, because this is a room full of winners. I know it
didn't come out the way we wanted it to on the scoreboard. The way they
battled through adversity, their resiliency, their ability to lean in when
times were tough, it was uncomfortable, is remarkable.  
  
This time of the year is always hard. Obviously with our seniors that have
poured so much into this program, it's a special group. We're certainly going
to miss them. I think for our freshmen, they got some really great experience.
I think for our returning team you have to be able to process this and learn
from it and move forward with it.  
  
That second half we got in foul trouble early. We didn't shoot the ball very
well, sent them to the free-throw line too many times. Made for a really tough
third quarter for us.  
  
Again, really, really, really proud of my team. No doubt about it, they won in
life this year. They're going to be even more successful in the real world
because of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hannah, you hit those two threes in the second quarter. Stopped their
run. How did you feel at halftime? What do you feel changed?  
HANNAH SCHUCHTS: Yeah, I mean, I felt good. Obviously my shot hasn't been
falling for me a lot lately. It felt good to finally see a couple go through
the basket.  
  
But I'm just proud of our team. Anything I can do to contribute makes me feel
good. I was so proud of how hard we fought. We just never gave up, so I'm
proud of us. Felt good.  
  
Q. Aijha, what was working for you and the rest of the team in that
first quarter?  
AIJHA BLACKWELL: I guess our shot selection, our shots were falling. We were
just patient overall on the offensive end. We did well on defense, too,
rebounding.  
  
Q. Aijha, you just had your first taste of postseason college
basketball. What takeaways do you have from that?  
AIJHA BLACKWELL: Well, just to start with the beginning of the season,
personally I couldn't have asked for a better start to my career. This was a
tough season, but it has prepared me for the rest of my career mentally. It's
going to contribute to the physical part of it, yeah.  
  
Q. Hannah, when Coach talks about overcoming adversity, how much of that
is due to the support from your teammates?  
HANNAH SCHUCHTS: Yeah, the support that we get from our coaches and our
teammates every day is a huge piece of it. We talked about coming into this
that nobody believes in us except for us. That's how it's been from day one,
whether we were winning or losing. We still constantly had that support,
always believed in each other, believed in what we could accomplish. I think
that showed today.  
  
In the first half it showed on the scoreboard, but I felt like it showed the
whole game, that we believed until the very end. That goes for the whole
season.  
  
Q. Hannah, you played your final collegiate game. How has your mindset
changed from when you were a freshman to now?  
HANNAH SCHUCHTS: A lot. I think this year I've just been so focused on what I
can do for the team. I think my mindset has changed a lot. I think when I
first came in, I had more of a selfish mindset; what do I want to do to
perform, how can I perform my best. That's totally shifted to how can my team
perform at our best, what can I do to contribute to that. It's looked
different for me every year.  
  
This year I got to see that pay off because I'm so proud of the progress we
made from the first day of the season till now. It's unbelievable. I'm just
really proud.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. They come back in the third quarter, tie it at 34, then you build the
lead back up to 40-34. Did you feel you had weathered the storm and things
were going to be okay?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I never thought it was going to be okay. I knew it was going
to be a battle. You know it's a game of runs. Tennessee is such a great team.
They're not going to back down.  
  
But I felt like we survived one of their runs. I knew there would be more.
Like I said, that third quarter and fourth quarter, we had a really hard time
scoring the ball. We had a hard time stopping them. We sent them to the free-
throw line way too much.  
  
We talked a lot in those early huddles in that second half about not settling
so much for the three-point shot. I think just the emphasis on really
attacking the basket, putting them on their heels a little bit. We shot way
too many threes, early threes. I don't mind threes. That's part of our
offense. We got a couple kids that shoot the ball pretty darn well. To me it's
different when you have an inside-out mentality versus just coming down and
jacking up shots. I didn't particularly like our shot selection in that second
half.  
  
The other thing, I felt like we really got passive against their full-court
pressure. In the first half we were attacking the score out of it. In the
second half we got a little bit more passive with it which took a lot of time
off the clock, which resulted in us taking some rushed shots we didn't have to
take in the first half.  
  
Q. You 'll probably see a lot of familiar teams make the NCAA bracket.
How has the schedule you played challenged you this season?  
ROBIN PINGETON: There's been a lot of challenging things about the season, to
be honest with you. It's been a really, really difficult season. At the same
time I'd say I think this is where you probably grow the most as a team, as a
staff. I'm really thankful for the people I'm surrounded by every day, the
opportunity I've had to teach life lessons to these players.  
  
We had a lot of moving parts. I know I didn't feel like it was going to be so
much of a rebuilding year going into the season. I was pretty optimistic about
what this might look like.  
  
Bottom line is we played a really tough non-conference schedule, and we had a
lot of different moving parts within our team, losing a great senior class
like we did, that voice, that leadership in Sophie, Lauren, and Sierra, too.
We just weren't maybe ready for someone to really step into that role.  
  
So much of our offense ran through Sophie for the last four years. With
returning players, our freshmen, just getting used to playing together. But
the problem is you play one of your toughest non-conference schedules you've
ever played thinking it might put us in a position to hosting for postseason,
then confidence gets rocked a little bit. Then you got to fight through that a
little bit. Then you play in the SEC.  
  
Like I said, it's been a really, really hard year on a lot of different
levels. At the same time I think there's been a lot of growth and a lot of
life lessons. Will stay with all of us for a really long time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [Lavender Briggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38880)

### [Kiara Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38881)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
LSU 73, Florida 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome in Florida.  
  
We'll open with a statement from coach, then direct questions to the student-
athletes.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Congrats to LSU. Outplayed us, outworked us in every single
area. They were playing for something today. They played like it. We couldn't
stop them, couldn't guard them. The first quarter is the best quarter we tried
to. Then after that 91% in the second quarter, 50% third quarter, and 42 in
the fourth. Just played really, really hard.  
  
Very disappointed with our competitiveness in the first half. Shocked with our
competitiveness in that first half. But it's a combination of us not being
ready to play necessarily with our team and then them just being really ready
to play and jumping out of the gates.  
  
I'm glad we competed in the second half. You can't do that in the SEC against
really good teams. You can't take quarters, multiple possessions in a row off.
You can't have 20 turnovers.  
  
Hats off to LSU. Hopefully we can make the NIT. 15-15. It would be a good step
for our program for what's next. But, yeah, tough day for the Gators.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lavender, not the outcome you wanted, but just talk about the season
as a whole, what you saw out of this team.  
LAVENDER BRIGGS: I thought we started out the season pretty good. We continued
to get better. In the end we didn't finish it how we wanted to or how we
thought we could. That's just lack of discipline and focus by us.  
  
Q. Kiara, Coach talked a little bit about first half, you guys not
having the fire that you showed in the second half. What happened at the
beginning of the game from your assessment?  
KIARA SMITH: I think we came out ready to compete, then shots weren't falling
for us. The ball wasn't going our way. At that point I feel like we just --
LSU just, I can't think of the right word, but they scored off of what we was
lacking of.  
  
When we dig ourself in a hole too deep, our energy just wasn't there. We
couldn't bring ourselves back. At that time like that, against a really good
team, like Coach Cam said, we can't fall too far back.  
  
Q. What changed in the second half?  
KIARA SMITH: Just coming in talking about our energy, talking about how we
needed to compete and play hard, how at the end of the day we just wanted to
say that we left it all out there on the floor.  
  
Second half we tried that, but overall it just wasn't our night.  
  
Q. What was the difference between this matchup with LSU and the first
back in January?  
LAVENDER BRIGGS: I thought the first time we played them -- I think we're
actually better than the first time we played them. I don't know what happened
today. The whole team didn't bring it. They disrespected us. It's not okay. We
definitely could have been more disciplined, like I said before, played a
whole better game from start to finish, had a better outcome.  
  
KIARA SMITH: I agree with Lav. The first time, we got way better since the
first time we played them. We just couldn't capitalize tonight. Like Coach Cam
said, they was just playing for something. It felt like we weren't.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time. We'll continue with questions
for Coach.  
  
Q. Hard to think about next season or the future as a whole. How do you
feel about the building blocks you do have?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Just hoping we get to keep playing this year to keep working
towards that.  
  
I agree completely with what Lav said. I think we're a better team than we
were today. We had a number of players shellshocked at the start of this game.
Very disappointed. I think they're disappointed. It's happened too many times
to us to where we don't respond quick enough. Whether that's a young team or
not, we've played 30 games. We can't keep having that same excuse.  
  
I do think we've grown in a number of areas, but we still are lacking some
leadership when people need to step up and tell their teammates they need to
go harder, be more focused, box out, whatever it is. It needs to come from
each other. That's why it's called peer pressure. It needs to be from your
teammate to encourage and challenge whatever it is. It can't always come from
us coaches.  
  
If we had that, we would have had an even better year. That's the hardest
part, I think, to get them to grow in that area and take that accountability
and responsibility.  
  
Overall we won eight games last year, we won as many conference games this
year as we did our first two years. I was really hoping we could get to day
three this year. Last year we got to day two with the win. I was hoping we
could get to day three this year. But just shows you, we're just not there
yet. We're not there yet.  
  
Lavender Briggs today, 9 of 16, 3 of 3, 1 of 1. That's a freshman right there
who lead the conference in minutes. You heard her say she felt like we were
disrespected, this, that, the other. That kid's got fire and passion. I wish
we had more that had that fire and passion all the time. Just hope that she
continues to keep doing what she does. That's a great building block we have
right there.  
  
Just got to keep getting better. But I'm proud of where we were, grateful for
where we are, and excited about where we're going. I know it doesn't feel that
way right now, but I am. It's just that we want more. We want more.  
  
Q. You out-rebounded LSU tonight, 13 offensive rebounds, only four
second-chance points. How much did that affect the game? What were they doing
defensively in the first half specifically?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: They were there. They guarded us. We were afraid. With some
of those offensive rebounds, we were right there at the rim and just rushed
them. That's what I mean by afraid or scared. Just sped up. That was their
presence, their size, their defense, their quick hands.  
  
You got to stay poised. You can't be shook, you can't flinch. We flinched too
many times when we had great opportunities. 13 offensive rebounds, you score
on 2 of them? It's not good. But that's their defense, who they were, how
aggressive they were playing, speeding us up.  
  
Q. You talk about the growth of this team, wanting to play in the WNIT
in a couple weeks. What have you seen from this team? You know you 've earned
it, you deserve that spot for this program to grow and take another step.  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: You look at a number of our losses and how many top-25 teams
it's against. Half of our non-conference losses were against two teams that
were in the top 20 all year, with Florida State and Indiana. You play Kentucky
twice, you play Arkansas twice, you win at Kentucky, you beat Arkansas at
home. You go 15-15. Just right there on two or three other conference games
that didn't go our way.  
  
I think we're good enough to be in the postseason. I think we're deserving.
From a coaching standpoint, I want it so we can keep playing and build for the
future. Paige and Zada are seniors, but we still have a ton of players back to
build for what's next. I just hope that we can get that bid for it, just keep
playing.  
  
We got a room full of workers and dreamers. I say that because we got kids
that work really hard every single day to get better. They dream. They got big
dreams. They're working for those dreams. It makes it a lot of fun to show up
every day and work with them.  
  
We just got to figure out how in the moments where we get in foul trouble or
shots aren't going down, how do we overcome that adversity and keep playing
forward. That's still the reason I want to keep working with them.  
  
I would like to get that work done hopefully before next year.  
  
Q. LSU started four juniors and a senior. Is this what you hope your
program emulates?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: They're a tough, aggressive team. I don't know what years
they are -- thank you for giving me that -- but that's what I want us to
emulate. How hard they played nonstop, how aggressive they were on defense,
making plays, scrambling, multiple efforts on defense and offense. They played
with passion. They played for something greater than themselves.  
  
I would definitely emulate that with their program. I hope we get there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Thank you. Go Gators.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chelsea Dungee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36599)

### [Alexis Tolefree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38863)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas 90, Auburn 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas.  
  
We're going to take an opening statement from coach, then direct questions for
the student-athletes, then finish up with coach.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: After watching Auburn play yesterday live, I was really scared
about how well they had been playing down the stretch. They had Mississippi
State in overtime, a win over LSU, played Tennessee till the last buzzer, then
they played great yesterday. They had our attention.  
  
We knew in the first part of the game it would be to their advantage having
played yesterday. That obviously was the case. But I was really proud of the
way our kids stuck together. There was no panic through the first substitution
and media timeout. We got it back together. I thought from that first six
minutes on was our most complete game of the year against a quality team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions now please for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alexis, you had 20 points in the first half, you end with 30. When we
talked yesterday you talked about this pace, liking the matchup with Auburn.
What were you able to see that got you so open?  
ALEXIS TOLEFREE: Well, I just ran what he told us to run. I was in the middle.
He told me to cut out. My teammates really found me open most of the time.
They found me when I was hot, and they just kept coming to me.  
  
Q. Chelsea, how important was it for this team to get this first win,
get the pressure off your backs a little bit and advance?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: It's a big win. I don't know, like it's big when you have to
win to even advance in the tournament. We just take it game by game.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you tell us a little bit about what happened in the
timeout, what switched after that?  
ALEXIS TOLEFREE: Just the first timeout he told us to come out and play loose
and have fun with it. I think that's what we did. We just came out and started
having fun, not really worried about like the outcome of our shots. Every shot
we took are shots we make every day in practice.  
  
Coach telling us to go out and play loose, that's what we did.  
  
Q. Alexis, what really got you going in the second quarter?  
ALEXIS TOLEFREE: I mean, I was just taking shots that I normally hit. They
weren't falling at first, but they started falling for me, which is something
that Coach always has confidence in me to do.  
  
I just found the open spaces in their zone, and my teammates found me when I
was open.  
  
Q. Chelsea, is there something about this building that lets this team
catch fire? Is there kind of a sense of heightened expectations based on that
run at all?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Tournament time we have a different mentality. We're out to be
back in the championship like we were last year. We stick together. We know
what it takes. We've been here before. We know what it takes to get there
again.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We will be petitioning to move all home games here next year
(laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for joining us. We will continue
with questions for Coach Neighbors.  
  
Q. The 8-0 that Auburn started, where were you at? Did you feel they
were a little distracted?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It happens. We knew it. We actually talked about it last night
in between dart games. It happens. It is part of this tournament. When it's
the advantage to that first team that has already played the day before. We
used it to our advantage last year. So our kids knew it.  
  
I hate that we were right about it. I did try to challenge them to not let
that happen. I said great teams would not allow it to happen. Good teams it
will happen to, but they will get over it quickly.  
  
We still got room to grow. We can get over that. But it is a hard thing to do.
I tried not to show any emotion. We made a quick substitution. I was dead set
on not taking a timeout. Timeouts become a little more precious since we can
advance it late in the game, and we only get four.  
  
We had the game plan if it happened, we were going to make a quick sub, and we
did. It took them to go through it, get it out of their system, too. When we
got back to our starters, from that point on we were pretty under control.  
  
Knowing it was coming was a huge part of it. I hate that it did happen, but
that's credit to Auburn, the way they did play. But it was obvious it was
going to happen pretty quick if we didn't get a timeout and make a
substitution.  
  
Q. Was there something you saw in that other than just needing to settle
your team down?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It's uncharacteristic stuff. Mak turns it over, which that's
not what Mak does. Lex has a three block. She's not open. If you get a three-
point shot, you're not open. We didn't get back in transition. We were out of
position defensively.  
  
It was a complete lack of everybody's focus, start, whatever you want to write
down, you'd be accurate in saying it was a complete failure on all levels. So
much time left. Let's not panic, let's not fire anybody. Let's just fix the
problem, let's be solutional.  
  
That became something we got in the middle of the year. One of the kids said,
Give me something solutional. I get a tendency to point out facts and things.
They said, Give me something that's solutional. That word stuck with me. I've
been using it ever since. We'll give the person due credit later on.  
  
Trying to speak in images with them, make a pass, do something else with it.
We talked about not letting the ball stick. I think it became a visual for
them. When they start making shots, it's get out of their way and make sure
they're rested and in the right spots.  
  
Q. They tried to half-court trap you a little bit. That seemed to play
in your favor.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: That's what they've done ever since coach has been there. You
know it's coming. You prepare for it. We actually got them into a half-court
trap. It's usually the full court. Our kids love to see that because we've got
a good plan for it. We have the personnel that can get into seams and spots.  
  
They wanted that matchup. This is a matchup they love to play. We called one
set play today, and it didn't work. It's overrated. You got to get them in the
right spots, then trust them to go play.  
  
We've played 30 games now, about, is that right? If you don't trust them by
now, we've probably done something wrong in the off-season.  
  
Q. Ramirez was 3 for 14 shooting tonight, but active defensively.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She's been the key for us when we have a big player around the
basket. She's such a good clogger, not the dancer, but the person that goes
down and makes Unique Thompson's life hard. She was in the right spot, tipped
a lot of balls.  
  
I'll take the exact same 14 shots she got tomorrow. She's going to make seven
or eight of them. Got in her own head a little bit. You know that kid well
enough to know that she'll shoot the next time she's open.  
  
But our defense has been great all year. She's not going to necessarily go
steal it from you, she's not going to block shots. She seems to always be in
the right spot for us. She's really good at following game plans. She can
really take Coach Todd's words, his coaching, go out and help our team. That's
what she did today to help our team win, was defend.  
  
Q. 17 three-pointers today, which I believe is an SEC tournament record.
Gary Blair joked they 're going to continue to hit those, we just have to make
sure they don't hit as many tomorrow. Talk about Texas A&M, how successful you
were behind the three today.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: How long did it take him to explain that to you? Was it under,
over five minutes? I'm sure there was more to it than that (laughter).
Diagrams involved probably. There's no telling.  
  
No, I mean, I saw Coach sitting over there. He didn't need to be here. He
knows what we're going to do. We talk about it weekly. We talk about it all
the time.  
  
They will make our life hard. Bob Starkey is back there developing a plan.
They will be more guarded tomorrow, I guarantee you. We'll have to score
around the basket a little bit. We'll probably have to set some ball screens.
It will be a different way to get open.  
  
If we end up with 42 threes tomorrow, I'd be shocked. Attempts, I don't care
about the makes. He will be upset if that number is probably half of that.  
  
We'll have some adjustments for them, too. I know a few of his play calls.
We'll try to be ready. They will have a different approach for sure. Our goal
is to always be able to make any defense wrong. If we shoot it that well, we
made 17, but I wouldn't have been surprised if you told me we made 25. The
shots that we got, I would normally expect us to hit around 50 or 60% of
those.  
  
Q. Last year in this tournament Chelsea had to put on heroic
performances every single game. Can you talk on the balance of this team
compared to last year.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I'm going to run off of your question a little bit. You saw
what she did last year. She's had a better year this year than last year.
Nobody that's been around our team would agree with that. They get too buried
in the stat sheet.  
  
She's had a great year for us. She incorporated having another offensive
weapon on the floor like Amber. She incorporated having a true freshman point
guard that contributes in Makayla and A'T.  
  
The adjustments that she's made in her game, she's been stellar in all of
that. Then overall with the team, just that leadership role that we needed
filled when we lost Jailyn Mason. Jailyn is on the sideline with us, but she
can't play. Chelsea took on some of that, accepted some of that
responsibility.  
  
I know it was good for us to be able to put other people around her to where
she didn't need a heroic effort. She just needed to do what she did today:
stand out there, catch it. She went five of eight. That's what she can do.  
  
I'm glad she was able to do that in this building. It's been a really special
place for her.  
  
Q. Alexis, 30 points, 20 of your first half points. Her game today?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I thought she settled us down. Once we saw her make one or
two, she got her little celebration going. I'm always worried when I see the
top of her head, she's looking down at her shoes. Always good to see her
smile.  
  
She kept us in it, kept us going. She was the first one out of the locker room
passing to Amber. I don't know if anybody else caught that. I don't think she
took one shot during warmups. Amber, here we go. She passed to Amber the
entire halftime.  
  
That's just the kid that she is. But definitely, her play, not just the
scoring, she was driving it and kicking it out, doing a lot of things that we
needed to have, winning plays. She had a lot of them in that first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Kellie Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30789)

### [Rae Burrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38889)

### [Rennia Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34708)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Tennessee 64, Missouri 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee.  
  
We will start with an opening statement by Coach.  
  
KELLIE HARPER: I'm really excited that we're advancing in the tournament. We
came out, started a little slow. I felt like Missouri was going to be really
tough to beat today because of their style of play, how they play. They're
well-coached.  
  
Really proud of our team for hanging in there. Really in the second half
getting stops, that was the difference in the game. Our team made some runs
and got some momentum. Really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rennia, talk about how physical that game was.  
RENNIA DAVIS: That was a physical game. We knew coming into this game that
Missouri would be a tough team, as Coach Harper mentioned.  
  
But I was just proud of the team for just sticking with it, not really
considering the calls or whatever the case might have been, just stepping up.
When we did get foul calls, we hit free throws.  
  
Q. Rae, it was quite a contrast from the first half Tennessee
performance to the second half. What changed at halftime for the team?  
RAE BURRELL: I think just we really locked in with our defense. We had good
communication. We had good offensive rebounds. We started attacking a little
bit more, getting to the free-throw line. Things like that really got our
momentum going.  
  
Q. Rennia, how quiet was it in the locker room at halftime? Did
everybody just listen and go from there?  
RENNIA DAVIS: The locker room was actually the opposite of quiet at halftime,
to say the least. I think the message was well-received. We came out in the
second half and played better.  
  
Q. Rae, you have a short turnaround time. You play Kentucky. What do you
remember about the game with them?  
RAE BURRELL: Just our defense not really being where it needed to be at that
time, stretches in the game. I don't know. It's kind of hard to recall because
it was so long ago, yeah.  
  
Q. Howard scored 37 that game, Kentucky was hot from the three-point
line.  
RAE BURRELL: Like I said, they had a lot of wide-open shots. A lot of
miscommunication on defense. We need to clean up those areas and we'll do a
lot better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Harper.  
  
Q. What did you say in the locker room to your players?  
KELLIE HARPER: At halftime we were just trying to get our players motivated.
Again, feel some urgency in the game. Sometimes there's some technical talks,
sometimes there's some motivational talks. That one was probably a little bit
of both.  
  
We didn't want to come in there and be satisfied with our first-half
performance. We wanted to try to instill a little urgency going out of the
locker room.  
  
Q. What do you remember about Kentucky? What makes them difficult to
defend?  
KELLIE HARPER: We'll start with Rhyne Howard. Yes, I remember Rhyne Howard.
Defensively we were just a step behind everything they were doing. She was
coming off screens. She was open. We had breakdowns. It was really a game of
runs. They made some runs. We made some runs.  
  
That was really the first game that we played against a really high-pressure
defense. I thought it affected our play offensively. We missed a lot of
chippies, some shots that we could have made.  
  
I've not seen them a lot since, but I know both teams have grown since that.
It's been a long time.  
  
Q. The NCAA tournament, do you think now the body of work, getting to
the quarterfinals, that your team has done what it needs to do?  
KELLIE HARPER: It's funny because I really have not looked at other scores,
looked where other people are standing. Any time people ask me about that, we
tied for third in the SEC. We have 20 wins. Now we have a win in the
tournament. Hopefully our r�sum� is looking better and better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Faustine Aifuwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38879)

### [Khayla Pointer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36576)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
LSU 73, Florida 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU.  
  
We will open with a statement from Coach Fargas.  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: I'm just very proud of this group and their effort and intensity
to play hard for 40 minutes. When you're at the SEC Tournament you know that
the best in the country is here because you got some of the best players in
the country and you got some of the best coaches in the country here at this
one event.  
  
To see this group go out and play like they did, like a family, they played
together, they supported each other, that's the type of basketball that to me
is going to win you a lot of ball games.  
  
A lot of credit to Florida. They've got a talented team. They're going to
continue to get better. But I also think that our team is talented, and we did
some really good things today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Faustine, did you realize you were 4-4 in that second quarter? What
did that feel like?  
FAUSTINE AIFUWA: No, I didn't know I was 4-4. It was all my teammates. They
put me in right positions to easily score. I knew I had to do my part for the
team so we could get a win.  
  
Q. Was there a concerted effort to kind of get something going in the
paint in the second quarter?  
FAUSTINE AIFUWA: No. I knew paint touches were going to come as the game came
along. We worked the game, stayed aggressive. We got easy baskets through
going to the rim or through post touches.  
  
Q. Khayla, second quarter, 90% shooting as a team. As a team, how did
you turn some of those stops into buckets on the other end?  
KHAYLA POINTER: Yeah, I think we were just playing hard. Going into the game
we really wanted to focus on our defense, making sure we were bringing
intensity against steals, passing lanes, deflections. We knew if we played our
defense, then it would lead to our offensive game. When we're playing really
well on the defensive end, we're playing really, really well. Trying to
establish that at the beginning of the game, and let everything else take care
of itself.  
  
Q. This has been a season of some ups and downs. Does it seem like this
is a game where you can kind of build some momentum, trend upward?  
KHAYLA POINTER: Yeah. It's always great to get that first win in the
tournament, I would say. SEC is a great league. Any given night any team can
get beat. It was really a matter who came to play. We wanted to be the hardest
working team. We're going to build on this. We're going to go home, watch some
film and get ready for Mississippi State tomorrow.  
  
Q. Faustine, Coach talked about how LSU played like a family. Has that
been the case all season or where in the season did that start to click for
you guys?  
FAUSTINE AIFUWA: No, it was definitely all season. Especially when Ayana went
down, we knew we had to step up for her and for this team, just to play
aggressive and kind of play like her for us to end up with the win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your team.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Fargas.  
  
Q. The second quarter, that 's the story of the game. Goes without
saying, defense translated into offense. Was there a concerted effort to be
aggressive and get stops and turn that into points at the other end?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, we wanted to disrupt a very good offensive team like
Florida. I really challenged our team every time I could get in their ear,
deflections, get our hands on the basketball. Deflections lead to steals,
steals lead to transition baskets. We did just that. I really felt like that
opened the game for us.  
  
That was an unbelievable percentage for us to shoot. We have not shot 90%,
even when we had Mitchell. But this group, they are believing in each other.
Their assist-to-turnover, when you have 19 assists on 11 turnovers, that's a
team that's playing together and playing like a family.  
  
Q. How instrumental is Khayla in helping with that? Talk a little bit
about her development.  
NIKKI FARGAS: Khayla's role is one of a leader. She is somebody that we want
the ball in her hand, especially when it's late game, especially when teams
are pressing us or there's a lot of pressure.  
  
I like the fact that Pointer distributes the basketball and she will make her
teammates look good. But the part that we challenge the rest of our perimeter
players to do was to also be of service and be an assist to her.  
  
When you look at our stat line, we have several players that had assists on
the night. Tiara Young came off the bench, three assists, Mercedes Brooks had
four assists. It became a team effort to make the extra pass, let's find the
better shot. That's why our offense was a lot more efficient in this game.  
  
Q. How important is a good showing in this tournament to your NCAA
prospects?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, you want to continue to increase your opportunity to have
a higher seed in the NCAA tournament. We know that our body of work that we've
done this year should allow us to be a team in the tournament. You want to
definitely continue to get better.  
  
Playing against some of the best teams in the country right here in your
conference is going to help prepare you for NCAAs. There's a lot of great
players here. There's a lot of great coaches.  
  
This tournament is about as tough of a tournament to go through when you're
playing Mississippi State, the next team on the list, you have Kentucky that's
ranked, you have South Carolina, you have Texas A&M. It keeps going on and on.
There's not a better conference that can help prepare you for NCAA than this
conference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: Thank you.

## March 5, 2020

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Jordan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32615)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Georgia 68, Alabama 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Alabama.  
  
We will open with a statement from coach, followed by questions for our
student-athlete, then we'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: Congratulations to Georgia. It was another close game. They were
able to make a few more baskets than we were. I thought the difference in the
game was the fact that they shot 24 free throws and we shot 12. We just
weren't able to adjust, try to turn the corner, get to the free-throw line,
convert. We just missed some open shots.  
  
Again, it was another well-played game. I just want to say I'm really proud of
my team. To win seven out of ten, eight wins in this league, should get you in
the NCAA tournament. And a one one-day game shouldn't take away from our body
of work.  
  
I'm really proud of my kids because they have fought. We played Kentucky,
Texas A&M twice. The schedule hasn't been easy to us as far as the two
opponents along with Auburn. I just love my kids and I'm really proud of them
today.  
  
There were a lot of tears in that locker room. I don't want it to take away
just one day from what we've accomplished with our body of work, so I'm really
proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jordan Lewis.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned tears in the locker room. Making sure you guys keep
the perspective this one game does not define the season. As you look back at
the positives, what stands out for you?  
JORDAN LEWIS: I'm proud of this team, like Coach Curry said. I think we really
fought together. I think we could have laid down when we started 2-6, easy to
lay down and give up at that point. The push we made in February.  
  
The tears are tears of hard work, how much we've put in to try to make it to
this point.  
  
Q. What changed at that point?  
JORDAN LEWIS: I just think we didn't do all the little things early on. I
think we let plays affect us. We let things at the end of the game bother us.
I don't think we got off to good starts. I think we let people get out ahead
of us, tried to fight back all game. I think that was really affecting us. So
I think just getting off to better starts, just kind of finding who we are.  
  
Q. What do you think about the strides this team can take next season?  
JORDAN LEWIS: I think you just have to remember moments like this, moments
when it really hurts, moments when the other team is celebrating. Think about
what did you not do to be that team that's celebrating. You have to hold on to
the feeling, but not be regretful or give away anything you did to get to this
point.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. As your team awaits the decision as far as the NCAA tournament, what
are the next few days going to look like for you and your team?  
KRISTY CURRY: Like it has all year, we just get back to work and continue to
learn and get better. Excited about the week next week, practice. It's a great
opportunity for us. We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. The little spurt that Georgia had at the beginning of the second
half, seemed like they came out with a little bit more energy. What was your
explanation for that?  
KRISTY CURRY: Yeah, I just thought we missed a couple of shots. That dictated
our energy on the defensive end there for a couple of possessions. When you
make shots, it cures a lot. We just missed some shots. I thought that affected
us too much. We didn't play the next play at the level we needed to.  
  
Again, it's a really good Georgia team, so give Georgia credit there. It's a
game of runs. We just didn't make one as long as they made.  
  
Q. Jordan brought up the point in the season where it was lay down or
get-it-done time. What did you see change in Alabama to be able to put
together that second half run?  
KRISTY CURRY: We lost five games, five of those in the last minute. We had
continued to just teach and find the positives, know that it was a stop here
or there, a boxout here or there, just the little things like Jordan was
saying. Little things often make a big difference.  
  
Our kids just continued to grow and learn from our film time and practice. Our
practices have been phenomenal. Just our preparation. We stayed consistent. We
stayed positive. I think that shows right there the character of kids in our
locker room. Our staff has done a great job.  
  
We were right there five of those that we lost. We felt confident even though
the success on the scoreboard hadn't been there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: I do want to thank the city of Greenville for the experience.
It's been unbelievable how they've hosted. We just really appreciate
everything they do for SEC women's basketball. So thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

### [Daisa Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38822)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Auburn 77, Vanderbilt 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Auburn.  
  
We'll open with a statement from coach, then questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought my young ladies continued to fight for 40
minutes. We knew it was going to be a tough game. When you play a team three
times, it's definitely always going to be a tough game.  
  
We continued even in the first half when we weren't shooting the basketball
extremely well, we continued to fight and pick up our defense in the second
half, scored out of their turnovers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Daisa, it looked like you might have been getting a little frustrated
early when your shot wasn 't falling. What happened later in the game that
allowed you to get the confidence?  
DAISA ALEXANDER: My teammates, they just kept getting on me, telling that
these are shots I could hit in my sleep. They just encouraged me to keep
shooting and to start driving.  
  
Q. Unique, it looked like a lot more success started happening in the
second half when you started attacking the basket, going right at them,
getting to the free-throw line. Was that the game plan coming out of the
locker room at halftime?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: Yes, that was a part of the game plan. That was part of the
game plan at the beginning, too. In the second half we knew that the shots
were going to fall, so we just continued to do so.  
  
Q. Daisa, this is your senior year, so you 've done the SEC tournament
before. What about playing on the first day, wanting to make sure you keep
playing, what is that experience like for you?  
DAISA ALEXANDER: It's tough. My sophomore year we played Tennessee. We played
our hearts out and we lost at a buzzer-beater at the end. This season is kind
of like my sophomore year, I didn't want to go out like that, I wanted to keep
playing.  
  
Q. Unique, because Daisa is one of the few senior leaders on your team,
what did the team say going into today 's game about how important this game
was for you guys to really show up?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: We knew it was very important and seeing it didn't go the way
we wanted to for Daisa. So we're using the tournament to play for Daisa.  
  
Q. Daisa, they 're playing for you. Is that pressure?  
DAISA ALEXANDER: No. I love them. I know they have my back regardless.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Flournoy, please.  
  
Q. The game plan was clearly to attack the basket. When you started
doing that in the second half, got to the free-throw line and were able to
convert some and-one opportunities as well, build that lead in the fourth
quarter.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We're such a streaky shooting team. If the shots were
falling, then we could continue to shoot them. But they weren't falling. We
kept emphasizing to let's attack the basket, let's attack the basket, try to
get more high-percentage shots, then the shots would fall.  
  
Robyn hit some big threes. Erin also shot the ball well.  
  
Q. For the second straight game, you forced 20-plus turnovers. That 's
always been an emphasis. At the end of the season, that pressure is starting
to pick up for you. What's been the difference?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: The team has actually started to buy into it. I
didn't think early on they really wanted to play defense. I think they didn't
want to because they didn't understand what it does for us and who we are. We
are a defensive pressing team. That's who we are, that's how we win basketball
games. They really had to understand that's what we do.  
  
They didn't want to do it because it's hard work. You got to be in great
shape. Pressing for 40 minutes is hard. Nobody wants to deal with it, also.  
  
Q. Arkansas in the second round tomorrow, a team that can obviously
score a lot of points. What is going to be key?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Totally two different teams. You're playing Vandy
today, who was a team that wasn't a great three-point shooting team that we
knew could score in the paint. Now you're going to play a team Arkansas
tomorrow that that's exactly what they do, is shoot the three. Where we were
in tight today, looking forward to expanding that zone out a little bit
tomorrow.  
  
Q. In the second half, I think the intent when you went to full court,
man-to-man, as opposed to your three-quarter 1-2-2, that was to motivate them
to get to moving faster? Great move on your part.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you. We did. Sometimes you got to entice them a
little bit to play a little bit harder. That's what we did. We just upped the
pressure a little bit.  
  
I thought Vandy was very comfortable coming down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Stephanie White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29603)

### [Koi Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38823)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Auburn 77, Vanderbilt 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
We're going to open with a statement from coach, then take questions for our
student-athlete, then questions for Coach White.  
  
STEPHANIE WHITE: I think first and foremost, we want to continue to ask for
prayers for our national community, to know that our thoughts and prayers
continue to be with them, the aftermath of the tornadoes. We want to maintain
perspective certainly.  
  
Incredibly proud of our three seniors. They left the program better than what
they found it. Each one of them has helped us in terms of our growth process
tremendously. Really proud of how far they've come and what they've been able
to accomplish, how they've led our team this year.  
  
In terms of our young kids who got a taste, the steps that we've taken in our
program, now we know what to expect, we're ready to take the next step. The
execution, the mentality, consistency, and put ourselves in position to keep
moving forward.  
  
But I'm really proud of this group. We have faced so much adversity with
injuries and such. Through it all they've continued to just step up, continued
to be resilient, continued to stay together. Sometimes that's really hard,
especially for a young team. They've done an outstanding job of doing that.
I'm so proud of them. Really just looking forward to getting into the off-
season, getting better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athlete.  
  
Q. When Jordyn went down, how much did that change the game plan of the
team?  
KOI LOVE: I don't think our game plan changed as much. I think our fight and
the head of our snake defensively. That's tough. That's just really tough for
us. She leads this team in defense, leads the SEC in defensive steals. That
was just really tough.  
  
I think not to put pressure on her or anything, injuries happen, but I think
that was the defining point in the game. I think we have Jordyn, we win by 5,
at least.  
  
Q. Talk about LeaLea as a teammate, all the adversity she 's gone
through. Of course, started the second half, things looked good.  
KOI LOVE: LeaLea is awesome. No matter what, through whatever she's going
through on and off the court, she's going to play hard, she's going to be a
good teammate, she's going to vocalize when she thinks things are going wrong,
how we can fix them. She's a very positive person on and off the court.  
  
She's just someone you want to be around, someone you want to have on your
team. You got to love her. We love her. Sad to see her go.  
  
Q. Coach White mentioned the impact that the three seniors had on the
team. When you think about how to frame that, what is your perspective? What
are some of the things they 've done for this group?  
KOI LOVE: Everything. We're such a young team. We have seven freshmen that
came in. I think they just kept us grounded all year. Fas with her scoring
ability, just her dependability on and off the court. LeaLea, just her
experience, her playing hard, her mental toughness, her physical toughness.
Then Sarah, she doesn't do a lot on the court, but on the bench off the court,
so much of what she does goes unsaid.  
  
We appreciate them so much. We're going to miss them a lot.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned taking the next step for the program. As you 're
going to be a part of that, what does that look like for you?  
KOI LOVE: Me? Well, I'm looking at the paper here, seven turnovers. Turnovers
have been a problem for me personally and our team all year. I think it starts
there. I think off-season, it's just going to have to be a lot of hard work to
get better in everything that we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Koi.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach White.  
  
Q. Jordyn going out really changed things, didn 't it?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Yeah. She was playing at a great pace offensively. Four
assists, no turnovers. Really doing a good job leading our team. But she
really is the head of the snake for us defensively. Everything that we do from
an intensity standpoint starts with her. That makes it tough. It makes it
tough.  
  
We had to collectively be able to raise our intensity level on the defensive
end. Plus we're down another guard. I don't know how many we have over there
on the bench with injury, but at least three. That's another one. Our depth
was certainly impacted. We weren't able to have a rotation, sub out. We had to
keep changing defenses.  
  
Without having Jordyn's pressure and another defender on the floor, it
certainly opened things up for Unique inside.  
  
Q. Is there a specific injury that you can tell us about? Was it a leg
or knee?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Yeah, we don't know yet. It's lower leg, but we don't know
exactly what it is, where we go from here yet.  
  
Q. You played Auburn three times, beat them handily the first time, led
the start of the second game. Beyond the injury, was there anything else?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Well, turnovers. I think the injury is part of that. We have
another ball handler with experience on the floor, one year of experience, but
she still has experience. We're asking freshmen to go on the floor and handle
the ball in situations like this. We're logging Chelsie so many minutes. She's
having to handle the ball 94 feet, be a scorer for us, defend 94 feet. It's a
lot.  
  
But there's just no way to make up for 31 points off of turnovers.  
  
Q. LeaLea, her career. A lot of adversity. Talk about that.  
STEPHANIE WHITE: I'm so proud of LeaLea Carter. She's a person that you said
it, she's been through a lot of adversity on the floor, off the floor. Every
year she's grown so much from a maturity standpoint, from a basketball
standpoint, from a life standpoint. She's somebody that is a great teammate, a
great friend. In terms of individual personal growth, in a four-year span,
this kid is at the top of the list. She's grown exponentially.  
  
I'm so proud of her. We're certainly going to miss her. She stuck it out
through the adversity. She continued to battle. That takes a lot. It says a
lot about her character.  
  
Q. Your opening statement about the tornado, talk about where you were,
trying to find your team.  
STEPHANIE WHITE: We were here already. We had come Monday. We were delayed a
little bit, but got here Monday evening, had dinner. I woke up at, gosh, about
3 or 4 o'clock in the morning to a lot of text messages. Trying to make sure
everybody's family is safe, folks in our athletic department was safe. We had
a kid still at home, trying to make sure she was safe.  
  
Once we locked in and made sure everybody was safe and sound, then it was just
for us mourning loss, praying for those who were still missing, praying for
our community who is going to have to be strong and rebuild, not just tangibly
rebuild but emotionally rebuild.  
  
There's strength in our community. We wanted to be able to represent Nashville
well today. We wanted to play for something bigger than ourselves.  
  
It's really humbling when we're in the sports world, we think wins and losses
are of the utmost importance. Not just because it's our livelihood, but fans,
friends, family, everyone, it's about winning.  
  
When something like this happens, it teaches us it's not really about winning
at all. It's about representing something bigger than ourselves. It's about
doing everything we do with pride. It's about for us in the collegiate model
helping young people understand empathy, helping young people understand
community service, helping young people understand servant leadership, helping
young people understand lending a hand, and helping young people become future
leaders who go out and make a difference in communities like ours.  
  
It gives us a great reminder of what's important. We're very fortunate that
our family, our friends are safe. Not everybody got to experience that. So
we're grateful for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Thank you.

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Aijha Blackwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38827)

### [Jordan Chavis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38828)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri 64, Ole Miss 53.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri.  
  
We will open with a statement from coach, then direct questions to the
student-athletes.  
  
An opening statement, please.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: First of all, I appreciate you guys coming out and covering
the tournament. Hats off to Coach Yo and her staff. It's pretty remarkable,
that team, just their ability to continue to stay the course and compete.  
  
Said it to our girls before we played them, that their record is really
deceiving. They're in pretty much every game. They play so hard. Very
resilient team. They're not going to go away. They're going to play for 40
minutes and they're going to go on runs, they'll have stretches where they're
knocking down shots and stretches where the ball is not falling for them.  
  
Those kids are really, really competing hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Proud of our kids. We bent but we didn't break. Obviously again continue to
have some issues with our turnovers. They scored way too many points off our
turnovers.  
  
I thought we went in stretches where we looked really sharp, had stretches
where we didn't look so sharp. But overall I felt like we maintained that
mentality of playing to win and not to lose. Made some big shots when we
needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aijha, you 've been playing hot as of late. Coach said on Monday for
you guys to continue in the tournament, you need everybody on the court to
contribute. How important is it for you moving forward that all players scored
today?  
AIJHA BLACKWELL: It's very important. When everyone is scoring, everyone is
happy. When everyone is happy, we're all playing good basketball. It's very
important for everyone to get touches and get a chance to score.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk about your first tournament and your mindset going into
this one, how they differed.  
JORDAN CHAVIS: I mean, right now all I'm thinking about is one game down, we
got more to go. That's all I'm really focused on. We got Tennessee coming up.
I'm excited for it.  
  
Q. Talk about your first quarter. Had a hot start.  
JORDAN CHAVIS: Yeah, throughout the game I don't really think about it. Yeah,
I had a little heat check, but I just got to keep shooting and contribute the
ball around.  
  
I feel like during the game we each did that. I didn't really have to get my
shot up. You saw the score, we won, so everybody got the ball, everyone was
scoring. That's all that matters.  
  
Q. Jordan, you have a lot of familiarity with Tennessee. At this point
what kind of things are you thinking about, mentally preparing for a
matchup?  
JORDAN CHAVIS: I mean, I feel like it's different every year with us. This
year we've already played them once. We already know the feel of how they
play. I'm pretty sure it was, like, we only lost by 8 or something like that.
It wasn't too bad.  
  
I feel like if we stay consistent, like we usually do in our fourth quarters
and we're playing hard, if we play hard all four quarters, it's going to be a
good one.  
  
Q. Aijha, your starting lineup is so unique for Missouri, you, a
freshman, then all of that senior leadership. What has that experience been
like for you?  
AIJHA BLACKWELL: It's been great. In the beginning of the season, coming off
the bench, I had to get a feel for the game. Starting with the seniors,
they're like my mom on the court. They tell me what to do, how to do it, get
out of my own head, keep me going (smiling).  
  
Q. They have a lot of experience with this event. What did they tell the
younger players about what to expect this week?  
AIJHA BLACKWELL: I know specifically Amber, she was like, Be patient, don't
look at the crowd as much. This is a big stage, so just stay poised, play my
game as usual.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like every time they made a run in the first half, you all
answered. Talk about how big that was.  
ROBIN PINGETON: It was huge. You see that out of Ole Miss. Like I said, I'm so
impressed with how hard they play. It does not matter what the score is. They
can be down 20, and they'll be right back into the game. They played
Mississippi State to a single-digit game in the first half. They still made a
run at them in the third half [sic].  
  
It's the common theme for Coach Yo's team. They don't lay down. They're going
to continue to compete. Their challenge is putting those stretches together
consistently. But I said it to our girls, their record is very, very
deceiving. You're going to have to compete for 40 minutes. We knew that they'd
have stretches and make runs, we were going to have to answer.  
  
Q. What kind of things do you think didn 't go so well today that should
be corrected before Tennessee?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Still a little disappointed with our ball movement, especially
early on. We have a tendency to hold onto it a little bit. I really felt like
when we are in the area of six to eight passes per offensive possession, we
usually get a pretty good look. Felt like we tried to force the action a
little bit, especially in that first half.  
  
Then just some careless turnovers which continues to hurt us. I mean, when a
team is scoring, I don't know what the final stats were, but it feels like
they had 20 points off our turnovers. A handful of those were controllable.
It's trust in the movement versus force in the action. That's something we're
going to continue to talk about until that final horn sounds.  
  
Q. You got outscored a little bit in the fourth quarter. What did you
tell your players in the timeouts to keep composed?  
ROBIN PINGETON: We had some interesting rotations out there. I think that
probably played a part in that. We were just trying to be mindful of minutes.
We had a good little lead going into the fourth. Certainly you play to win one
game at a time, but at the same time when you have a little bit of a lead
built up, you like to make sure you're trying to keep legs a little bit fresh
for tomorrow, especially back-to-back games.  
  
I think a lot of that honestly was the rotations that we had in that fourth
quarter.  
  
Q. In the tournament setting where you have games on consecutive days,
how does that impact the way you prepare between games?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think that's why you play in tournaments usually around
Christmastime, maybe sometimes around Thanksgiving, depending on how your
schedule works out. Try to emulate that a little bit.  
  
If you're a competitor, you love it, you absolutely love playing back-to-back-
to-back. I promise you they would rather be playing games than having
practice.  
  
I think at this point in the season everyone's tired, everyone's beat up, but
that's when adrenaline kicks in. Survive and advance, live to play another
day.  
  
I know as a coach, you're excited you don't get any sleep at this time of the
year because that means you're still playing.  
  
Q. Talking about everyone contributing. What do you feel you 're seeing
from your players? How key is it moving forward you get everybody involved?  
ROBIN PINGETON: We talk with our team about this all the time. 92% of the time
that you're in a game, the ball is not in your hands. How are you going to
impact the game when the ball is not in your hands?  
  
Unfortunately I think sometimes as players you get so wrapped up. If you're
scoring the ball, if your shots are falling, just trying to get them to
understand that you can have such a huge impact regardless if you're making
shots or if you're getting shots.  
  
Unfortunately that's not an easy thing to get through to your student-
athletes. I'm sure I didn't get it when I was playing either just because
that's how we're wired. To understand the attention to detail, being
assignment correct on scouts, understanding shooters, drivers, how we're
defending ball screens, just being engaged in each possession, and one
possession at a time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2020&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2020

  

### [Yolett McPhee-McCuin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36559)

### [Mimi Reid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38829)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri 64, Ole Miss 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Ole Miss.  
  
We're going to open with a statement from the head coach, then direct
questions to our student-athlete, then we will wrap-up with questions for
coach.  
  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: When I was hired at Ole Miss, I was given the challenge
to build a program. Seeing that this is my second chance at building a
program, I understand that before you can take two steps forward, you may have
to take a step back.  
  
To a lot of people, they may think that this step back was trending down and
showing where the program is headed. But I can assure you that it is trending
in the right direction.  
  
I thought that our players for 16 conference games played extremely hard for
about 10 of them, and I thought that they gave everything they had in a
generation that's so fragile. They're willing to quit every time they're hit
with some adversity. I commend my young ladies for just continuing and
fighting every single day.  
  
The energy was great all season. We never stopped coaching them. We never
stopped laying the foundation. Now we can just only look forward to the
future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athlete.  
  
Q. You did a pretty good job staying in it up until the second half.
Where do you think that disconnect came from?  
MIMI REID: I believe the disconnect came from just we started to not believe,
we started to almost give in to the things that we kind of struggled with all
season. Then we had to recollect, remind ourselves that we came this far now,
you don't stop, you don't quit.  
  
I think the disconnect came and then we just decided to snap back. The coaches
just kept pushing us and kept coaching us. I think we was able to regroup
really quickly.  
  
Q. Coach talked a lot about the resistance of this group. Where did that
leadership come from? Who on the team do you think really kept the group
grounded and focused?  
MIMI REID: I wouldn't say it was one particular person. It was definitely
somebody different every day or every practice. But, to be honest with you, it
was Coach Yo that kept us fighting, that reminded us who we are. Sometimes
somebody would break, but we were like, No, you can't do that. She would just
remind us.  
  
I can't say it was just one person in particular. It was somebody different
every single day.  
  
Q. She mentioned the team was trending in the right direction. What does
that look like for you?  
MIMI REID: It looks like, as she talked about, winning conversations. It looks
like positive talk. It looks like always encouraging one another,
understanding there will be adversity. It's just a matter of when you get back
up, you just have to keep going. I think that's what it looks like for the
future of this program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, Mimi.  
  
MIMI REID: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open up the floor now for questions for Coach Yo.  
  
Q. You mentioned having to take a step back in order to move forward.
With a season like this, a lot of teaching moments. For you what was probably
the biggest that you faced this season?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: That's a great question.  
  
I just think that this probably -- I may go home and make myself a coach of
the year award because this has been my best coaching job by far. I didn't
think we would recover after the South Carolina loss. I was very concerned
about our team, just their mental state. The staff, the whole program, was in
a state of shock.  
  
I just learned from this that I believe that my mission is to teach, develop,
and inspire. I truly believe this is my ministry, helping young women. Any
time I would feel like quitting, because I'm human, too, I've won a lot, I
just said, I need to be the example for the players. I need to show them how
to grow, how to get through adversity, because they're going to be moms and
wives and aunties. Their kid or niece or nephew will have some type of
adversity, and they have to be able to give them the tools that they learned
from here in order to be successful. I think that's just life.  
  
Really, this is just a game. Shame on coaches that don't use it to teach young
people about life because a percentage of these players, 1%, are going to play
professionally. This is not the NBA. It's 12 teams to a roster. They're
getting ready to go and be in the world, CEOs, surgeons, teachers, police
officers. They have to be resilient.  
  
At some point they'll go through adversity. So my number one focus was just
teaching them how to handle that.  
  
I think the redshirts that I have sitting out, kicking our butt every day,
helped too because I get to see them all the time. Obviously our recruiting
class that we have coming in.  
  
Q. You talk about the players that didn 't get to see a whole lot of
action this season. What can you say about them coming into next season?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: I think we'll look totally different. There's no coach
in the SEC that does not know that. They've been working extremely hard. We
have four young ladies that are home that will be eligible to play in the
fall. Then we have three so far coming in that are pretty good.  
  
One thing I did with the young ladies that are on campus redshirting is after
every game, they would send me a synopsis of the game, what they thought we
could have done different, what they heard in the scout, what they learned.
Just teaching them how to see the game from an outside perspective.  
  
I think in the SEC, Power 5, if you want to be successful, like you have to
have pros. You don't have to have a whole team of them, but you have to have a
few of them. When I was at the low major, I needed mid major players. Mid
major you need high. High major you need pros. I think we have about two of
them next year that I'm excited about. I'm just looking forward to where we're
going.  
  
No one feel sorry for me. We signed the number one recruiting class in the
SEC. No one is patting me on the back. Everyone is, We know what you got
coming.  
  
Like I said, I thought it was our best coaching year. Who would think an 0-16
team would be in the game with Tennessee and lose to Alabama by a basket, and
Florida, have Mississippi State on the ropes for a little bit. That's gaming
and scheming, game planning and scheming. I thought we're prepared and we're
ready for the next step.  
  
Q. In today 's age of immediate satisfaction, how do you convince your
players that don't quite understand good things happen over time?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: I think you have to try to use real-life experiences. I
have two daughters. I really think baby strollers and stuff, they're scams.
The baby is going to walk when it's time to walk. You can't encourage the baby
to walk. One day, Yuri, my two-year-old, got up and started walking. She
didn't need any assistance. I just think it takes time.  
  
I think that's how it works with everything. What we've done as a staff, we've
been completely realistic with our players about life and building something.
It's like building a house: you don't just throw it in together for a week.
You have to put in the floor, lay the foundation, build it up.  
  
So just a lot of real-life experiences, talking to them about that. Just
trying to relate to them as much as possible, getting them to block out the
noise. Deflecting, me taking a lot of the brunt of anything that went wrong,
just putting it on my shoulders because I thought that they were strong enough
to handle.  
  
I think they'll be better for it.  
  
Q. You mentioned the games against Mississippi State, Tennessee. The
beginning of the season a lot of blowouts, I don 't want to say.  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: Yeah, we got our bleeps kicked.  
  
Q. Going down through SEC play, you wanted to get wins, but still
growth, losing by a few points.  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: No doubt. I think there were a lot of wins we had this
season that maybe didn't show up in the win-loss record that will show up
later on.  
  
I think like Mimi said, coaches are leaders, and we must be examples. Every
day we came in and had great energy, great focus. We didn't just get beat by
60 the other night, you know. Just being a storyteller and selling a bag of
goods sometimes.  
  
My players really thought we were going up in there to beat Tennessee. They
really believed that. So you have to do some convincing as a coach. Like I
said, this is not my first bill at Jacksonville. My first year we were 13-12.
Then the second year we were 12-14. The only difference is I'm in the SEC now,
not in the A Sun. I was able to steal a couple wins through it all.  
  
The SEC is the best conference, most physical, talented, most talented
conference in the country, in my opinion. You have to have it. You have to
have it all in order for it to happen. We just don't have that yet, but it's
on its way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.  
  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: Thank y'all.
