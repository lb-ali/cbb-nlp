# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn: 72  
Louisville: 52

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Louisville is Head Coach, Jeff Walz with Shoni
Schimmel and Asia Taylor. Coach?  
COACH WALZ: First off, I would like to congratulate UConn on tonight's game.
It's a game where we did some good things but at the same time we didn't do
enough of them. And it's a 20‑point game but like I told my kids it's not like
it was a gradual 20 points. We let 'em get there too quick.  
When we started defending and doing things well, they weren't able to extend,
it and I know somebody is going to say well they weren't trying well I have a
hard believing they weren't trying. I think I know how he coaches a lot better
than that, and he's not going to let his kids not try.  
You know, we know that we very well could play them again. And, you know, I
believe we can beat 'em. I mean, hell, what do you play the game for?  
I had a reporter ask my player last time, do you think you could beat UConn,
and they said yes, and then they blasted them for it. What the hell you
supposed to say, no? What kind of reporter is going to bait a kid into a
question like that and write crap like that?  
Yeah, we show up to play the game to win. If nobody thinks they can be beat
them, let's save a bunch of money and not have the tournament and give 'em the
trophy now. But I believe everybody thought the same thing about Baylor last
year. It might not be us that does it, it might not be, but I know how Geno
prepares his kids. And he's not in that locker room right now going, "It's
going to be a breeze for the next three weeks. Let's go to the casino and roll
some dice for the next three days." That's not how he prepares his kids. I'm
excited we're going to get the opportunity to continue to play.  
I'm excited that these kids are going to get a chance to keep playing, because
I think we can do some great things. But it's going to take forty minutes of
very, very good basketball in order for anybody to beat them. That's one thing
that I've been preaching to our players about the entire time.  
You can't play for 20, you can't play for 30, it takes 40 minutes of
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, you cut it to 8, I think it was 28 ‑20 and then Stewie‑‑  
COACH WALZ: We can't handle prosperity, that's our trouble right now. We cut
it to 8, we had a defensive assignment breakdown and then we fouled. We fouled
the jump shooter several times. You know, things like that, you can't do.  
That's what we talk about, where we get things going well, and it's like you
just gotta come up with one more stop or make them score a contested shot
because when we contested them without fouling them, I thought we did a pretty
darn good job. We forced Dolson into 4 for 13 from the field because we
contested her shots. That's what you have to do.  
Unfortunately when we got it to 8 we gave up a backdoor layup and a foul and
it goes to 11 and before you know it, it's 18 at the half. Was there more to
that question?  
  
Q. There was, it's a good answer anyway. Stewie had 7 of those points and a
3 ‑point play. How tough is she as a match‑up and how good of a player is she
as a sophomore?   
COACH WALZ: She is great. There is no question about it. When you're 6‑4 and
can shoot the basketball and handle the three, it's tough to guard. She made a
few shots that are big‑time shots. I've got no problem with that. I've told my
kids, hey, they're going to make contested shots, that's fine. You can't give
them the easy ones. We got beat in transition again and we talked about that
and that's something we will breakdown on film and we understand now the
urgency was there tonight, but now it's really got to be there from here on
out because the next game we lose is our last.  
  
Q. Shoni, Louisville teams before you even got here have had their path
blocked by this program National Championship games, Conference Championship
games. How does an athlete separate the frustration of what goes on against
Connecticut with the confidence that you guys are going to get them someday?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: You just gotta keep continuing to believe in what he's
preaching. He knows what he's talking about and for us to believe in that,
that's what we have to carry over into the game.  
He got us to the Final Four coaching us and us following him and going out and
executing the game plan and we gotta continue to keep doing that. Tonight we
had times where we didn't necessarily do what we were supposed to and it came
back and got us. So for us to just actually believe in what he's saying and
put two feet into this whole thing, we just gotta to trust in him.  
  
Q. I have to ask about the NCAA Tournament. What are your thoughts on ‑‑ I
know the Committee will do what they want to do, but what do you think is‑‑ we
know UConn is going to be No. 1. Should they go to Louisville? What do you
think about that? Should they go somewhere else?  
COACH WALZ: How am I supposed to answer that question without getting
reprimanded? I'll lose my per diem money and everything! I will be wearing a
tee shirt to coach in next time! It all depends what we view as important. If
we're trying to put a true NCAA Tournament together, which I think we're at
that point now that we can, then if we're the fourth No. 2 and UConn is the
first one, then they should come to our place, and I've got no problem with
that. That's part of it.  
But I mean, I'm not sure how many families here, or writers in this room have
their car gassed up and prepared to drive to Louisville if that's where the
game‑‑ if that's where with they're sent. You're going to fly to Louisville or
Lincoln. So if you're trying to run a true tournament with the true seeding,
that's what you would do if we're not the fourth No. 2 seed. I still look at
it as I think we're the only team that has not lost to anyone who is not below
50 in the RPI who is looking to fight for a No. 1 seed, and I know everybody
is going to say, well you haven't played ten top‑25 teams in the RPI, that's
true, because we can only play who is on our schedule, and we had some good
nonconference games and some teams had some injuries after we played 'em; they
were healthy when we played 'em, but we can't control that. At the same time
we had a lot of opportunities to have teams try and beat us.  
'Cuz like I try to tell everybody, you know, we've gotten teams in our league
right now. You've got UConn and Louisville. You have eight other teams that
hope to have an opportunity to make the NCAA Tournament. I'm not sure how many
of those eight believe that they could beat UConn for a top‑10 RPI win. But
I'm willing to bet all of them are like, we can beat Louisville! So we got
everybody's best shot, and we did our job. We went 30‑4 and did not stumble
along the way. I think that speaks volumes for this group of young ladies.  
We had lots of opportunities for teams that aren't ranked in the top 50, the
top 30 in the RPI to beat us.  
THE MODERATOR: Jeff, I wanted to ask about Bria. She was hobbling and ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Her knee is bothering her. I was going to be cautious with that,
make sure we get that taken care of and get her healthy for the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Jeff, I want to get your thoughts on how vulnerable the one ‑two combo
is, Stewie and Hartley.   
COACH WALZ: They're average. They both suck! Lordy, that's one of those great
questions. They're unbelievable. You aren't 34‑0 for a reason. They're two of
the top‑10 players in the country.  
You know, I personally think you had three of the top‑10 players in the
country on the floor today, Shoni being one of them, and Stewie and Hartley,
they're great. They're talented players. Next!  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.  
COACH WALZ: We got time! He ain't goin' nowhere! He's going to his restaurant
make sure they're selling food. We can't even get a free meal out of him!  
THE MODERATOR: Did you want to ask a question?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, we got time for two more!  
  
Q. I was going to ask you when you coached USA Basketball if you wanted to
beat the communist team! (Chuckles) Do you think next year when you're emersed
in the ACC, watching what happens there every day there that your program is
going to get better, because of what you are going to have to deal with on a
day ‑to‑day basis? Versus the fact that Connecticut and Louisville, the teams
in this conference are 0‑36 against you this year?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not going to say that at all. As players we take pride in what
we do every day at practice. Our goal is not to go out and say we're playing
this team and that team. We're getting done what we need to get done in
practice. I'm pushing them as hard as I can. So you're prepared for games. I
don't think that's necessarily going to make us all of the sudden a better
basketball team, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
COACH WALZ: Go ahead, we got one more.  
  
Q. Last year you guys had a great tournament. How likely is it that teams
can elevate even in the course of the tournament?  
COACH WALZ: We've found a way to do that a lot of times. In '09 I'm not sure
we were picked as a favorite to go to the Final Four. I know last year we
weren't. We get to the Sweet 16 Shoni's freshman year and Asia's freshman year
and if Monique Green doesn't tear her hamstring in the warm‑ups, I think there
is a great shot we're playing Stanford in the Final Four. We figured out a way
to do that. That's what our plans are. You play this regular season and
conference tournament for the NCAA Tournament. That's why I tell everybody I
would hate to coach a football team in college because if you lose a game in
Septemberit screws you for the rest of the year. Here we have a true
tournament that you get a chance to play and it's not necessarily the best
team that always wins, it's who is playing the best basketball at the time.
Notre Dame beat UConn three times last year and they lose in the Final Four.  
You gotta figure out a way to get your kids to believe in what you're doing
and to play your best basketball at the right time and anything can happen,
and I think we've proven that here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn - 72  
Louisville - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: While we are waiting for Coach, we have Bria Hartley, Breanna
Stewart and Stefanie Dolson. We will take questions.  
  
Q. Stef, you talked all year about how you build up to this point to be
ready. Do you think this team is playing it's best at this Tournament? Has it
reached a point where you're starting to fire on all cylinders?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, things are definitely clicking, and tonight we went out
there and played extremely well as a team. We executed on offense and played
great defense and there is always room for improvement because we know the
NCAA Tournament is coming up and everybody is going to keep getting better. We
can't stay complacent and not get better ourselves. Would he played great
tonight and are we're extremely excited that we won, and we've got to keep
getting better from here.  
  
Q. Stewie, they cut it to 28 ‑20 about two minutes left in the half or so,
three minutes, and then you had that three‑point play, the "and one" and you
scored 7 points in the final two minutes to send it back to 18. Do you kind of
sense there are times to take over and get it back to a comfortable margin
instead of letting them get it back to a closer game?   
BREANNA STEWART: I think you always want to go into halftime on a good note
and then we kind of set up the game. Our transition game kept working and we
kept pushing it at them.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Bria, it seems whenever there is a big game you like to start the game
off with a run yourself. Talk about the differences in a game like this and
how you go about taking advantage of that.  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think when the game starts, you kind of‑‑ I know Coach told us
he wanted us to push the ball in transition, and I love to run and in
transition; that's what I try to do.  
I was trying to get out and the my teammates found me and I was able to knock
down a 3‑pointer or whatever and I think we had an aggressive mentality in the
beginning and we got started and it went through the whole team.  
  
Q. Stewie, we watched you grow up so much last year as a freshman, you went
through that rough stretch, you did what you did in the Final Four in the NCAA
Tournament. This year you've been consistent all year long. How much better
can you become as a player, not just this year but through the next two
years?  
BREANNA STEWART: There are so many ways I can improve. Being able to do a lot
of different things on the court, that means there are so many other things
that you can get better at, just not getting complacent and wanting to be the
best player I can be.  
  
Q. Bria, over here. What are the signals you look for that tell you that the
team is performing at its optimum? What do you like for? What clues you into
that?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it's a feel, especially when we start the game the way
we started the last two. Everything is clicking, we're making the right pass
at the right time and everyone is sharing the ball and we have so many threats
on our team, and we are playing our best basketball when everybody is
contributing and putting everything in for the team and you saw how it is
these last two games, when we were playing well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach? You ladies can go.  
  
Q. Coach, can you give us a comment on the middle of the second half and
what was going on? Both teams looked like they were somewhat ineffective
offensively.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I can't speak for them. Looked like they were
trying‑‑ probably trying too hard to get back in the game and they were
playing way faster than they needed to be playing. I think we lost some
concentration there for a little bit. You know, you start missing free‑throws,
you start‑‑ just all of the sudden playing like every other team plays, you
know, for long stretches.  
It's something we talked about coming into the game. I don't ever want them to
feel, we're up 18 at halftime so let's coast home for the next 20 minutes. I
thought we regained it pretty quickly. I was happy to see that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the experience that you had here at the Sun, and if
it were up to you, would you want this to come back?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I had a huge win last night. I played blackjack for two hours,
and I left with the exact amount of money that I started with, so I am way
ahead! I can't wait to come back! It's something that we wanted to do for a
long time. We've always talked about it as coaches. I always thought it would
be a great experience for the fans, a great experience for the players. It's a
beautiful venue, the crowds are great, the people that run it understand how
to run these events.  
It was it everything that I thought it would be. I hope it was everything that
all the other teams and everybody expected it to be. But I'm not surprised it
was as good as it was, and I can't think of any one thing that I would say I
was disappointed in.  
  
Q. Geno, what are the keys that you look for that tell your experienced eye
that your team is playing at its capacity, at its optimum?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Mostly for me it's the combinations that we're scoring in,
kind of like a boxing match, you know, when if you just throw the same punch
over and over and over again, I don't know how effective that is.  
So if we're taking the same shots over and over and over again, then I know
we're just settling for whatever, the easy way out. But when we are getting
out and getting layups in transition, we're getting to the free‑throw line,
we're getting enough three's, we're getting the kind of movement that's crisp
and clean and everybody is touching the ball, that's an indication to me that
everybody is kind of dialed in.  
The stretches where I'm not sure we're like that is when it gets very much
like one pass, all right, let's hurry up and score, throw another pass and
shoot it, whatever shot that is, I don't care, just shoot it. And then we get
complacent, but the first half yesterday and the first half today, I don't
know that we could play much better than that.  
  
Q. Coach, every coach says they want their team to get off to a fast start,
your team continually actual does it, every game. They seem to get into it and
open up the early lead. What is it that's different about the kids that you
have versus other teams that they continually get that fast start that they're
looking for?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, we do some things at practice that right at the
beginning of practice that if they're not into it right away, and there is a
couple of things that they've got to get done immediately, then they have to
keep doing it until they get it. So we kinda start every day with, all right,
these first, 15, 20 minutes better be absolutely perfect so we can move on to
the next thing, and I think that carries over into the games. The first five,
six, seven minutes of a game, we feel like those seven minutes we're going to
be absolutely perfect in what we're doing.  
I have tried that other times and my players weren't that good, and it didn't
work out so well. It's nice when everybody you pass the ball to has the
ability to put points on the board. That's‑‑ you know, our offense‑‑ the skill
level of our offensive players is pretty high, even playing top‑10 teams in
the country, it's pretty high. I hope my teams look the same year after year
after year because we spend a lot of time, number one, trying to recruit those
kids and number two, we spend a lot of time in practice on offensive skills
and it shows sometimes.  
  
Q. Geno, you have won a lot of conference titles and this is the first
conference championship for the American, and no one can take that away. How
does that feel?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We had a conversation in our locker room with the team and we
talked about it's not so much‑‑ it's not so much the trophies and the watches
or whatever you get, the hats and shirts, they're meaningless. It's nice but
they don't really mean anything. The significance of this is you have a goal
when you start October15th. Our goal is to win the conference championship,
and then the process is about that. So when you actually do it reinforces that
our process is right. We're doin' it the right way.  
New league, new coaches, new venue, you know, all that was kind of exciting
for us. That's the way we looked at it. We looked at it as an exciting time. I
don't know how many conference championships the American Conference is going
to host in their lifetime, but as you said, we won the first one. And
yesterday I think was a pretty special day here in the sense that you have a
conference where a team that's not in the top‑20 like South Florida takes the
No. 3 team in the country down to the wire, down to the last possession.
Nobody in the country is talking about South Florida, but I wouldn't want to
play them in the NCAA Tournament, and if anybody gets in ahead of them there
should be an investigation. I don't think there is any team playing better
basketball right now than South Florida is.  
  
Q. Geno, I was wondering if you think it would be fair for the No. 1 overall
seed to be sent to a bracket where they could be playing a true away game in
the regional final?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Somebody is going to have to do it, you know? Somebody is
going to Notre Dame, somebody is going to Louisville and somebody is going to
Stanford and you're going to end up playing the home team in one of those
three places. Do I like it? No. We had that situation in 1995 we had a
regional at Gampel, and back in the day it was called buying your way into the
Final Four. You put in a bid, a lot of people aren't going to bid, so you get
it and the regionals are at your place every year.  
I don't like it. I'm not in favor of it, and I don't think this is going to
happen again, either. It's a one‑year deal, I think. Regionals should be
played on neutral sites. I understand going to places where the game is
popular, but I think the three home teams probably are in position to get a
No. 1 seed. Louisville, Notre Dame and Stanford.  
So if they are, the absolute best 2, 3 and 4 teams in the country should all
be in those three regionals, make them pissy about having a Final Four at
home. They did that to us in '95. We had us, Virginia, Louisiana Tech and
Alabama. It was actually better than the Final Four we went to.  
  
Q. How do you combat the natural instinct that players develop over time
when they can't beat a team that's clearly blocking their path to great
things? Your program like it was for Notre Dame for a long time is standing in
Louisville's way from doing things that they want to do to, win National
Championships and Conference Championships? How does Walz convince them to
forget about it and it's possible.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, nothing lasts forever. My first two or three years I
think in our league we couldn't beat Villanova, and I thought we would never
beat Villanova. And then Kim made the only three of her career and we won at
the buzzer, and they didn't beat us again for the next 15 years. Things don't
last forever. The object I think is to put yourself in a position where you
can win, and at some point you will.  
I don't know that, you know, we're not the only team that's standing in any
team's way. I think in order‑‑ you know, in order to win the National
Championship you eventually are going to have to beat some really, really good
teams. They're going to a different conference now, so everything will be
different for them. Notre Dame and Louisville can slug it out over there.
Eventually it changes. It's cyclical. I'm not‑‑ I'm not naive enough to think
that you could play Louisville twice a year for the next ten years and they
would never beat us. They're too good of a team, and he's too good of a coach
for that to happen. It just that he's caught us in the National Championship
game with some of our best teams ever and he caught us this year, the first
three times, maybe with one of the best teams we ever had. At some point it
will be different. It will be different. That's the only explanation I have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Louisville - 60  
USF - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Louisville is Jeff Walz, along junior guard
Jude Schimmel, Shoni Schimmel and Asia Taylor. Coach?  
JEFF WALZ: First, I would like to congratulate South Florida. If they're not
one of the 64 teams in the NCAA Tournament it's a shame. They're healthy,
they've got everybody back. I think they've lost three games since Jan, or
four, and that could be three of them to us and one to UConn.  
Courtney Williams and Inga Orekhova are special players and if we're trying to
put the best 64 in the NCAA Tournament there is no question South Florida
should be in.  
For our kids, we didn't play fantastic, but I thought South Florida had a lot
to do with that. We weathered the storm the first six minutes of the game,
where they were sloppy, but, again, they caused some of that. Down 10, get a
4‑point lead at the half and fortunately we came out to start the second half
and did not play very well.  
So it's situations where we have to get better at taking care of the
basketball and making sure we execute at crunch time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you walk us through that last 10 seconds where you went down
the lane and pulled up for the rebound?  
SHONI SHIMMEL: I just saw, you know, they take out a great rebound and I saw a
few people behind me and I just kind of went with the ball we had numbers in
transition and the pull‑up was there and nobody picked me up, so I shot it.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell your team at halftime? Like you said, they were
fighting out there, South Florida, USF?  
JEFF WALZ: We just talked about the fact that we're all playing to survive and
play the next day. So we knew South Florida was going to come out and compete.
I don't think we matched their intensity to start the game. Once he we got our
composure, I thought we played really well the last 10 minutes of the first
half.  
But we didn't come out to start that second half with the same intensity, had
some breakdowns, turned the basketball over and that led to some runs for
them.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys haven't had many close games this year. You played them
tough it was an 8 ‑point game the first time you played them. What does it say
for your team that you pull it out close in the end?   
JEFF WALZ: We actually take some games back in the non‑conference, we take
Oklahoma to overtime, I think we were down 4 with 30 second to go or 6 with a
minute to go, pushed that game to overtime. Our game against Florida State
we're down 4 with about 40 seconds left, take that game to overtime, so our
kids have been in this situation before.  
I thought for the most part we did a really nice job defensively of making
players that we wanted to have shoot the ball from South Florida, and then
when Inga and Courtney took shots we did a good job of trying to make them
difficult shots.  
  
Q. What do you tell your kids at this point that you haven't expressed to
them, pointed out to them, emphasized with them about playing UConn? Is there
anything left to say or is it just about performance at this point?  
JEFF WALZ: No, we haven't talked about that yet. We're going to enjoy this for
about an hour or two, once we get back home to the hotel. We will watch some
film, and then we'll sit down and breakdown UConn again.  
We know in order to beat them, we have to play a great game at the defensive
end of the floor because they score the ball so well. We're going to have to
figure out a way to score.  
I personally think the only chance you've got to beat them is you have to put
70 on the board yourself and I'm not sure they have allowed anybody to score
70 all year. So we know what we have to do. We especially have to do a good
job at the defensive end because when you have breakdowns, they make you pay
for that.  
  
Q. For the players, obviously UConn has handled your team well through the
years. Do you feel that they are beatable and what's it going to take?  
JEFF WALZ: We're going to have to score more points.  
ASIA TAYLOR: We have to play forty minutes of basketball and I think the score
will take care of its.  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: Like Asia said we have to put it forty minutes of basketball
together and we just have to continue to be disciplined, play good defense and
good offense and do what Coach tell us to do. He's going to want us to run our
game plan and we're going to be as prepared as we can be.  
  
Q. Jude, we have never seen a player serenaded by the band when they do
something good like this. How does that feel? Are you tired off it after the
end of the year?  
JUDE SCHIMMEL: It's a great song, I like it, I appreciate it, especially for
me he. It's a great feeling.  
LOUISVILLE: My daughter's name is Lola, can you imagine the song they will
play for her? "Her name was Lola. (Laughing)  
  
Q. You played them a week ago, what can you change? You had home atmosphere
and 20,000 fans. What can you do differently?  
JEFF WALZ: We have to do a better job defensively. Offensively we got the
shots that we wanted but we gave up transition baskets, one after another and
that's something we can't do. They're a great basketball team, but we know we
have to get it into a half‑court game the best we can.  
We can't allow them to score in transition and then we have to do a good job
of guarding their half‑court offense. They're going to make shots but we have
to make them shoot contested shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Louisville - 60  
USF - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head Jose Fernandez, and Courtney Williams and
Inga Orekhova. Coach?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: I think everybody is probably going to remember that last
minute of the game. I told our kids, everybody remembers that last minute,
that last two minutes of the game because it's the last thing that happens.
There are so many possessions in a basketball game, I thought in the first
half, you're down 4, we gave up free‑throw blockouts, and in the second half
we didn't give up any second‑chance points.  
I've been very proud of this group, and I think this group has shown when we
are totally healthy we can play with anybody in the country. You know, our
only losses since Jan are to UConn and Louisville. I think we came out at this
conference tournament and this team pleaded itself case to the NCAA Tournament
Committee.  
I was proud of our kids and their fight and it's a tough way to lose but I
think this team has a lot of basketball left to play this year. We will see
what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, how many bids do you think this conference deserves and does it
hurt or help that you're losing just to UConn or Louisville? Does it hurt or
help to have those two teams at the top of the conference?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: If you look how we did, Louisville is 3 in the country, we
lost to them at home by 7 and this game could have gone either way last
minute. We held UConn to their lowest total all year, 63. So I think you gotta
take a look at how many do we deserve? I think we deserve to get in. We went
on the road and beat Rutgers on their home floor at the end of the year and
finished third in the league. You look at our losses, our losses were in
Decemberwhere we had our second‑leading scorer out for twelve days. We had
three other girls that were injured during that span. Those losses were four
or five‑point losses. So if you look into this team's make‑up and what we have
done, you know. So, what, we won 8 out of our last 10? We're playing good
basketball. There are other teams around the country in BCS leagues that have
lost 7 of 9 or 6 of their last 8. We will see what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, biggest thing you tell your team to get 'em back ready for a
Tournament game?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: We got guys that last year‑‑ you know, last year we lose in
overtime to go to Sweet 16 to Cal who went to the Final Four. It's spring
break for us next week. We don't have classes. We will have time off. We don't
know what will happen until Monday night of next week so we will get them back
at the tail end of the week and get back to work.  
  
Q. Courtney, how is the ankle? You played forty minutes and Coach thought
you were going to be questionable. You put on a heck of an effort with a bad
ankle.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: It's all right, it was a baby strain, I just twisted it a
little bit, it wasn't nothing major.  
COACH FERNANDEZ: You had me worried at shootaround today.  
  
Q. Talk about her, he had she had a 40 ‑minute job defensively on Schimmel,
she came in and did a great job.   
COACH FERNANDEZ: Courtney is a tough kid. Both these guys, I thought‑‑ I was
worried in shootaround because she wasn't moving as laterally as much as I
thought she would be, but getting that assignment on Schimmel and we tried to
rest her and put Stringfield on Schimmel but the young lady next to her wanted
the ball in her hands and hit some really big shots we were in a position were
we usually play nine, ten guys and Inga and Courtney haven't played forty
minutes all year and how Inga was shooting the basketball, and Courtney we
were trying to isolate her on different parts of the floor.  
  
Q. Inga and Courtney can you address the last minutes of the game and the
three ‑pointers you put up and how confident were you taking those shots? You
took a long one at the end. How confident were you that it was going down? Do
you wish you had done something else?   
INGA OREKHOVA: You always wish that you had done something else after the
game, but we played our hearts out. We can't look back and think oh we wish we
would have done that different or this different but I feel like you have to
have confidence to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I feel like you always have to be confident when you're
takin' shoots like that. The last shot was tough. I jabbed, she stepped, to
gave me the three and I took it, can't take it back now, what's done is done,
gotta get back in the gym and hopefully get to the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn - 83  
Rutgers - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Rutgers is joining us, Coach Stringer, Rachel Hollivay, Kahleah
Copper and Betnijah Laney.  
  
Q. Coach, why no three ‑point shots today? What was the strategy going into
tonight?   
COACH STRINGER: If you can't hit 3‑point shots, why would you take them? Does
that occur? Sometimes we do, but sometimes we don't, and 99% of the time we
don't. When I get some 3‑point shooters next year, we will do that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about UConn's defensive intensity?  
COACH STRINGER: UConn does so many great things and they are not always given
the credit they deserve. They're given nowhere near the kind of credit they
deserve on the defensive side of it, and I say that because defense is not
just the way you play, whether it's in the zone or man‑to‑man but in
completion. They're block out, doing all the fundamental things they need to
do and it's easy, especially when a team is scoring at the clip that they are
offensively to be slow and sloppy and lazy on the defensive side of it.  
And I think that Geno does a masterful job of encouraging his players to be as
intense on the offensive side as they are on the defensive side or vice versa,
but that's what clearly makes a great team.  
It's not as obvious until you see the kinds of things the way we were forced
to score. We weren't trying to do that, they were forcing us into that
situation more than we would like.  
  
Q. Vivian, can you talk about the first ten minutes there? Seemed like UConn
came out and they were hitting everything.  
COACH STRINGER: Not only were they hitting everything, if you look at any of
the stats, at least that we've been looking at, you get into the boxing ring
and they get‑‑ they look to knock you out the first ten minutes, and I think
that probably is the secret, is to be in the eye of the storm and still
maintain some composure, be calm and not abandon the ship, so to speak. We
clearly did that. We got anxious. They shot the heck out of the ball, doesn't
matter, from one side to the next, and that's not something you practice. They
came in shooting and they got that much better. That's not an accident. They
spread the floor so well.  
Having said that, we have to recognize that they always beat you half to death
as much as they can in the first four minutes and I'm saying that if you look
at the tracking system, it's true. In this case they were able to sustain for
eight minutes and then they just shadow box the rest of the time and something
happens at the half and they come at it again. We knew that was‑‑ that would
be a surge. I thought our team did a great job of settling down and playing
them much more composed basketball game, one that we would be proud of. We
weren't too happy that they forced us to get excited and try to "save
ourselves" and when that happens no one person can beat UConn because it is
not one person that's beating us anyway. It's the entire UConn team that makes
everything happen. That's the secret to us and to any team that's going to be
successful against UConn.  
  
Q. Vivian, what will the next eight days be like for you as you wait until
Selection Sunday? Last year you guys kind of knew you were out and years
before you knew you were in. It's been a while since you've been on the
bubble.  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, I don't know. I think tomorrow and the next day will‑‑
tomorrow and the next day we will just try to rest up, get in the ice bath and
hope that we are in, which I believe that we should be, but it doesn't really
matter what I think a whole heck of a lot, it depends on what the committee
thinks but it is an uncomfortable situation because we don't know. We really
don't know.  
We will wait quietly at our televisions and if they say you guys are‑‑ because
you know that UConn is UConn by itself and everybody else is there, and I
don't like to have to say that but it is what it is and it's the true. So it's
incumbent upon all of us to be a whole heck of a lot better. I think they set
the standard in each position with what they do and it's as simple as that,
and we're okay, we can aspire to that but we're going to have to wait.  
In years before we have always known that we were in. We were out last year,
which wasn't a shock. This year we don't know. I think that based upon the way
I thought that Betnijah, Kahleah and Rachel and others practiced this summer,
I thought that they really remembered that. They personally ‑‑ more credit
goes to them than to any of us, at least me specifically, or to the coaching
staff because had it not been that they decided they didn't like where they
were, they came back ready, they worked hard and we're grateful to be able to
coach them and to put this together for them. I know that they want better and
they're going to work, continually.  
I know that they don't believe that it's over, so maybe tomorrow‑‑ not
tomorrow but maybe the next day they will get some shooting in but they will
come ready. As a young group, we're proud of them and they will be back. If we
have an opportunity to show our talents this year, that will be great and if
not we will be that much more determined through the summer and this group
will come back with that much more resolve and I have no question in my mind,
based upon what I've seen, not what I've heard about but what I've seen, I'm
proud of the way they have come back this year.  
  
Q. Kahleah, can you talk about how difficult it is to attack the basket and
get to the free ‑throw line with how much size they have in the middle?   
KAHLEAH COPPER: It was really hard, but our coaches prepared us for that. I
knew once I had to attack my guard had to slide up and we had toe kick it out.
They're really long, and as long as we kept getting deeper into the paint they
were close IN on us, and that was expected. Coach prepared us for all that but
yeah it was difficult.  
  
Q. Vivian, based on what you said about showcasing your talent, if it didn't
happen NCAA Tournament, would you consider a NIT bid if it came?  
COACH STRINGER: Is my athletic director here? You know how I feel about that.
You know that. You of all people know that. But I think that we will do what
is best for the team. Probably what's best for the team is that we will take
advantage of the experience, the opportunity, one, to practice, to play, to
compete, and it's a team that while I could be disappointed that we are not in
the NCAA Tournament, I would because‑‑ I would do that because I know that
this would benefit the team, the fact that we can go to Europe this summer,
that's what I'm trying to do.  
I think this team is capable of lots of good things, so to answer your
question, Mel, yes, but don't tell anybody else that, because we planning to
go to the NCAA. Let me leave it like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Rachel, you set the program single ‑season block record today. Can you
talk about what you take out of this season, given the loss?   
RACHEL HOLLIVAY: Just keep working hard and try to do the best I can, help my
teammates.  
  
Q. Betnijah, I know you guys practice real hard. Where you practice for
something like that, being down 25 ‑5 or whatever it was? Does that shock you
when you are out there and how do you not let that get the best of you?
Obviously you guys played better the rest of the game.   
BETNIJAH LANEY: I don't think it's something you practice for; it just
happened. We talked about we knew what their game plan was, to take us out in
the first custom minutes and we tried to focus on that and make sure they
didn't but it happened.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn - 83  
Rutgers - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Quick statement, Coach, and then we will have questions.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I thought the way we started the game was about exactly like
you want the games to start. I thought we came out aggressive, and, you know,
we got out in transition, we move the ball great, and we got everybody
involved. It wasn't just one player. But that entire first 20 minutes was
probably the kind of basketball that‑‑ as good of basketball as I could hope
for, especially in the postseason.  
  
Q. Geno, you obviously would like to see that all the time and there has
been games this year when it's been a slower start. Did you see something in
the locker room or the pregame shoot ‑around that they were pumped up for
this?   
COACH AURIEMMA: This team doesn't really give you a lot of signs of what
they're going to be like. They're pretty much the same.  
We were the same at the beginning of the game in the locker room as we were at
halftime in the locker room. And we were the same yesterday in the locker room
at the beginning of the game.  
So they're really‑‑ they're pretty much right here, level, they don't get too
high, they don't get too low. I wish we could start out like this every game,
but sometimes the other team has something to do with it. Today, I don't think
there is anything Rutgers could do about it.  
  
Q. Geno, Moriah, a couple of early three's. Can you talk about the
difference that makes?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When you make shots early on, it looks like you're off to a
great start. And generally speaking when teams start the game against us,
they've got a game plan that they're going to guard certain people a certain
way, and I don't think they go into the game saying we gotta making sure
Moriah Jefferson doesn't make any three's. I think most times they're okay
with her shooting those, and when those are going in and we are finding
Kaleena in transition, and those three's then tend to pile up, and I've said a
lot this season if Moriah Jefferson is a really, really consistent 3‑point
shooter, then we become ‑‑ as good as we are now, we become that much better
when she is shooting the ball like that.  
  
Q. Geno, can you talk about Kaleena and everything she has been through,
because she was part of that "hot stuff" that you talked about today, as well,
going 3 for 4 early. Is she back to where you expected her to be?   
COACH AURIEMMA: No, from where she was as a freshman and where she was last
year to where she is today, from what I can see, from watching her every day,
I would say on a scale of 1‑10, it's like 5. It just hasn't been right since
November, and you add up all the stuff and it's‑‑ there isn't that consistency
that there used to be, and little by little I hope it comes back. Hopefully
between tomorrow and whatever in the amount of games we have in the
tournament. No, we haven't seen anything like it this year at all since
November.  
  
Q. Breanna, the score is 30 ‑9 and they were running down the floor with a
likely layup and you chased her down and blocked the shot. Tell us what your
thought process was there. Does anybody on this team ever feel like it's okay
to take a possession off in a situation like that?   
BREANNA STEWART: I honestly didn't think I was going to get it. I thought I
was too far away but she slowed up a little bit and I was able to get there
and make the block and I think that, you know, most of the time we're hustling
back because usually once someone turns it over and we lose the ball we want
to make up for it.  
  
Q. Geno, I know Rutgers doesn't normally take a lot of three's, but they
didn't even attempt one today. What is the last time you've seen that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Wow, I don't know. I don't know. That's a good question. I
don't remember a game off the top of my head where someone did not attempt
even one three. I guess if you know you're not going to make 'em, why shoot
'em?  
  
Q. Bria, can you talk about how important it was for your team to get off to
that hot start, 13 ‑0 before three minutes expired and what it says about your
team when you do that?   
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it was really important. We talked about yesterday that
we want to have a better start than we did yesterday. When we're goin' like
that and we're playing well we know we can go on really big runs at a time and
when we're playing like that it's fun, we all had a great time out there and
we all enjoyed it so I think we want to keep playing like that the rest of the
way.  
  
Q. Kaleena, can you talk about your play and how you feel after the mono and
do you think you're getting your shot and your game back?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I haven't been on a consistent path all season,
whether I'm hurt or sick or I'm hurt again. So, you know, I took pride in the
consistency that I had last year and I just haven't really found the rhythm
yet, so just trying to keep it up and do everything I can for my teammates
while I'm out there whether it's rebounding or playing defense.  
  
Q. Geno, your thoughts on playing in the inaugural finals of the AAC
Tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We talk about this periodically. You don't really get caught
up in the name of things, because that, as we saw, can change. If it's a
preseason tournament at home, if it's a Thanksgiving tournament on the road,
if it's a conference tournament. We have traditionally done pretty well in
tournaments.  
I think it's appropriate, I think, that we're in the finals. I was hoping we
would be. I wanted us to be. You know, we had to prove over the first five
months that we're the best team in the league. We should be playing tomorrow
night. There are two really good teams playing tonight and whoever we play, it
will be a first as you said. It will be the first one and hopefully it's the
first of many.  
  
Q. What if you play Louisville again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: If we play Louisville again? It's never easy to play someone
two times in the span of a week. There is a lot of things that they do that we
struggle with and there is a lot of stuff that we do that they struggle with.
Tomorrow night, the significance of tomorrow night as far as the NCAA
Tournament is concerned is probably huge for Louisville because everybody is
talking about them be a No. 2 seed at home. I know because there are so many
more good teams deserving of a No. 1 seed than they are, so the significance
tomorrow night is huge. Not only to win a conference championship but if they
win tomorrow night then they probably are definitely a No. 1 seed, so it
should be a great atmosphere.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2014

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Haley Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26535)

### [Elizabeth Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26534)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  69  
Duke ‑ 53

  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: This was a good game, really good basketball game.
Really, really proud of our players and their fight. I thought Elizabeth was
just absolutely outstanding, absolutely outstanding and aggressive in a way
that she can be. And it was really a dominant performance by Elizabeth.  
I thought Haley was just a fierce competitor, as she always is. Rebounding and
looking to score, being aggressive there, too.  
It's interesting shooting percentages are not so hot. It's good that we
out‑rebounded them, because we need to get in the habit of doing that more.
But they're a terrific team. And we didn't do much with McBride and Loyd, much
of anything defensively there. Between not really finding them at times and
the turnovers, that cost us a little bit.  
We've got some great lessons. Lessons that we'll take from this game. We're
very grateful to play the games that we played. We need to play games, so we
played the maximum we could play in this tournament. We're very disappointed
to not finish and do what we do. But at the same time we're looking forward to
improve from this.  
  
Q. Coach, how happy were you with your game in the paint? Was that something
you could build on?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Absolutely build on it. I was very happy, you look at
that 36 for us, that was good in the paint. That was important that we
established that. Elizabeth was often playing against two people, one and a
half, two, at all times. It was very, very physical. And so that paint ‑‑
those paint opportunities are key, are really, really key for us and we need
to continue to have patience to continue to work with that.  
  
Q. In watching your game a lot this year, they're a very level ‑headed team
and very rarely see them frustrated. For about 25 minutes tonight was the
first time I've seen them frustrated, especially on offense, where they're
usually very fluid. You mentioned they weren't able to guard McBride or Loyd
very well. But the shots they were taking were very tough shots. They were
making bailout plays. What does it say about your team and what do you see as
the potential over the next two weeks for growth going into the NCAA
tournament, being what you gave was probably the No. 1 team in the country 30
really tough minutes of basketball?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Obviously there's a lot of great lessons for us. And I
think there's no limit to what we can do. We just have to own up on some
things. The turnovers cannot happen. We have to slow down and stop trying to
go at a certain speed.  
I was disappointed at us in the second half. The second half turnovers were
horrific. We've got to maintain it and control the tempo. We've got to own up.  
We've got to learn and certainly be motivated by all the good stuff. As you
say, plenty of good stuff to look at. But we've got to be hungrier than that.
I don't think this is a team that wants to be patted on the back. I think this
is a good team, a great team that wants to be even better. And that's going to
come with a little bit of self‑reflection, a little bit of how can I get
better, and everyone's got to ask the same question: What can we do? How can
we get better? And I know we will.  
So I think there are no limits. I think tournament time is an exciting time.
We'll be ready to get after it.  
  
Q. Coach, I guess on Loyd and McBride, are they about as athletic, a good
executing back ‑court? There's back‑courts that are very athletic, don't
execute as they do. Are they about as tough as anybody you'll face this year?
  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, it would be hard‑pressed to find a better pair. I
think McBride's season was player‑of‑the‑year material. I know there's votes
and stuff. But she was fantastic all season long. And to me was very, very
consistent and leading her team.  
I think that's the thing that separates them. As you say, they're athletic,
very smart, they're high IQ. They perform every night. They perform every
single night. And that's something that our team has to get used to. I see it
so many times, somebody has a great game and the next game they don't. It's
like the success ‑‑ they have a problem with success.  
Players of that caliber seem to get driven by their success. And they're so
consistent. I mean, we didn't want to get 25 and 26, but if we had held them
for 19 and 17, then we're in the ballpark of what we're supposed to be doing.
But we obviously didn't get that done.  
  
Q. Liz, you guys worked hard in the paint, particularly yourself, in getting
those points first and second half. Second half looked like you needed to work
harder, because either they were doubling down ‑‑ what made it tougher? And
then on the defensive end they gained more points in the paint than the first
half. What was the difference there?   
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: I think it was kind of a matter of focus and
concentration, and getting the ball inside. I think like Coach B. said, we
bugged out of some of our offenses in the second half. And defensively I think
we started cheating out the shooters and that kind of left the paint a little
more open in the second half. We just have to be able to adjust better.  
  
Q. What do you think about Duke's overall tournament performance and how
disappointing is this one and what do you take out of it to take to the
NCAA?  
HALEY PETERS: I think our overall tournament performance, I mean, it's good
for us, because we just need to play as much as we can together. And we earned
all three games. And we learned in every game we took a step forward in being
as good as we can be. And I think we did that a little bit tonight. But we
just didn't stay with it for the whole game.  
And there's a lot that if we go back and look at, especially the second half,
that we're going to learn from it and just keep getting better to try to get
as many games as we can out of the season.  
  
Q. You basically got two weeks to fully practice with this team. It's kind
of like a boot camp, essentially. What two or three things are you going to
zero in on in particular over what you've seen over the last couple of weeks
that you really want them to get better at when the first game of the
tournament rolls around for them?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, it's a space of time. And it's a good space. We
need some rest, first. And then we'll bring the team back.  
Our defenses are getting better, but there's improvements in all of them that
can be done. So we'll go back at that. Of course we'll look at the handling of
the ball and the patience on offense and the execution piece, because of the
turnovers. You look at the stats, it's just so difficult to see that entire
game as points off turnovers. That's why they win. That's hard to deal with.  
So we'll use that as a motivator. We'll look at film. We'll check out what
exactly we were doing. And we'll just improve in all areas. And it's hard
because you come off a loss, it's a long time before you play again. And the
sting of this is it's important for us to remember this and carry it with us
at the appropriate time.  
  
Q. Tricia had a particularly tough night offensively. Can you address what
they did to her to slow her down and give her such a bad time?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: They really went after P and they did a great job. My
heart goes out to her. Three charges, I've never seen that before by Tricia. I
don't think she's had three charges in her career prior to this game. So this
was a really banner game for her that way.  
I think she was frustrated. They played good defense. They played very
physical. We needed to just kind of, again, continue to execute and be
patient. And I think at times we tried to push the envelope a little bit
there. The turnovers that she had are uncharacteristic. And again, no one
hurts more than her on that.  
And just great lessons for us. Good film watching to show how we really
weren't setting things up. How we really weren't executing and trying to get
each other open. That would be good for us to see.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the body of work. What would you like to say to
the selection committee, you should not be in the same region with Connecticut
or Notre Dame when the tournament starts?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: It's a hard job they have. Everyone told me we're going
to get whacked because of our situation. I think we need to be true to the
principles. Our body of work is incredible, our RPI, our strength of schedule.
The players have worked very, very hard. I'm not a big fan of seeds overall.
It's not the seed; it's just playing.  
But on principle, on principle, I think we should be evaluated for our body of
work. And I hope we will be. Whatever happens, that would be fine. We've got
to play and get ready to play.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  69  
Duke  53

  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I was really pleased with the second half. I thought we
came out of the locker room and had kind of a renewed energy. I thought we
played our game. I thought we played a little bit harder. The first half I
felt like we weren't rebounding.  
Elizabeth Williams is a really difficult match‑up. She's a great player and
just really hard for us to handle inside. She had a fantastic game.  
I thought Jewell and Kayla McBride were just unstoppable. The second half
Jewell had a stretch where she took over and did so many great things. And
Kayla is so dependable all year long, so steady, so consistent. We got some
stops, we got the break going, an I thought our transition game really took
off in the second half.  
  
Q. Obviously the undefeated record at this point is really impressive.
Coming into the conference you played 8 teams in the top 15 and only one game
was really close. How well has your team gone through all this?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: They really have played well. It's a credit to our senior
leadership. They have this team ready every single day of practice. They're
mentally tough. They have a competitive spirit. They just came in every day
willing to work hard, ready to do whatever it takes. It would have been easy
to watch a little game film and pat ourselves on the back and talk about how
good we are. But we watched film, critiqued ourselves and asked ourselves: How
good can we be? And that was a real credit to our senior class.  
  
Q. Were there some specific adjustments at halftime or some target areas
that led you to that 19 ‑4 run?   
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: We put Kayla inside in the zone offense. I thought we
were getting a lot of free throw jumper area shots. And she's just so steady
from there. We wanted her inside. We did that. We put Ace on the wing. We came
up and pressured a little bit more, and I thought that was ‑‑ (video feed

COACH MUFFET McGRAW: The second half I thought we did a much better job of
really getting out on the break and running and doing the things we do in the
transition game.  
Defensively I thought did a little bit more, tried to trap them a little bit
more and get some turnovers, and I thought we were able to do that. Generally
when we rebounded that was just the biggest key.  
  
Q. Kayla, coach alluded to the senior leadership. Specifically what do you
think this group of seniors has done for this team this season?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: We have a lot of experience in the Big East, we had a lot of
success going to the Final Four. We've been here before, we know what it takes
to win these type of games. I credit Ace and Ariel. I think they're always
ready. I try to feed off of them. We know what we're doing with each one of
our players, and how we can get them going. It's combined effort and we feed
off coach and we just pass it on down.  
  
Q. There will be two undefeated teams going into the National Tournament.
That's where the attention will be. How will you keep your team focused not on
that but on each game?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think they'll put us together in the first round.
I think we'll be pretty focused on our opponent, whoever that turns out to be.  
  
Q. Kayla, in this game and Tennessee was another game like this (video feed
lost)?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: What we had to do for every game and how we're going to win, we
focus on that game. We focus on each possession, and each 40 minutes of each
game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the perimeter game, just what you were able to
do with the 3 ‑pointers, and also what you were able to take away from Duke?
  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I thought Jewell did a tremendous job on Liston. I was
really pleased with her stats. I think our perimeter. We stood around a lot in
the first half. We talked about that at halftime. We needed more motion in the
offense, ran some different sets in the second half, put some people in
different spots. We were really perimeter oriented. We didn't get anything
going inside. I thought the second half we were able to get inside a lot more.
That was the key for us, because we missed shots early in the first half, and
then the second half we made them and that always makes us look better and
opens up the inside game.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Michaela Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26562)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
North Carolina State ‑ 48

  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I thought we played really well. I thought we did a lot
of good things defensively. I was happy with the transition game and the
rebounding. It was difficult for North Carolina State without Gatling, and
they'll be fine, they just didn't have enough time to prepare. And I know
she'll be back for the NCAA tournament and we wish them luck.  
  
Q. You've piled up 78 bench points in these two games. Obviously you're
trying to rest your starters, but not every coach could bring in the reserves
and get the production you've gotten. How good is the bench?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It's the best we've ever had. I think we have great depth
with Michaela Mabrey. She's having a great year. I thought she was the best
sixth man in the country this year. Taya Reimer, a freshman, we're expecting
great things throughout her career. Markisha Wright comes in and gives us good
minutes. It's great to rest your starters and be confident in your bench.  
  
Q. Jewell has 998 career points. She would only be the third sophomore to
hit a thousand when she gets there. Can you talk about that accomplishment,
considering the scorers she's been around and her ability to get to that
point?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: If she has trouble making the shot early I'm canceling my
subscription to the "South Bend Tribune."  
I'm not sure Jewell knew that or not. I wasn't going to put her back in the
game to get it. I didn't know it until she came out. It's a tremendous
accomplishment as a sophomore to be looking at those kind of numbers, with a
team as unselfish as we are and Jewell as unselfish as she is, what a great
honor for her to be in this position.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Michaela and what she was able to bring to you.
Can you talk specifically when you have a shooter that good when you bring her
in off the bench, not everybody can be that good a shooter when they're not a
starter.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She heats up in a hurry. She is a fearless competitor.
She doesn't mind missing a couple of shots, we know she's going to keep
shooting. She's got the green light. She's probably the first player I've had
in a long time that has the absolute green light to pull up on the brake and
do whatever. She's really taken advantage of her opportunity this year.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how your team went into attack mode
immediately.  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: I thought we had a little bit of a slow start, missed a
couple of shots early, but I thought we really got comfortable. I thought we
made some nice plays. Jewell made some big plays. Mike comes in and gets a 3
right away. I think that makes everybody feel comfortable.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding numbers? Is that the area that you took
the most advantage of regarding Gatling's absence?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, for sure. I thought inside ‑‑ we really wanted to
go inside and score inside a little bit more. But for the rebounding that the
minutes everybody played, I thought the rebounds were well distributed.
Madison Cable, leading rebounder with 7. Everybody had five or six. I thought
we did great on the boards, both ends, 19 offensive rebounds. We missed a lot
more shots than we normally do, but made up for it getting the rebound.  
  
Q. You don't know who you play tomorrow, whether it's North Carolina or
Duke. Do you adjust your game depending on who the opponent is?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think it's about preparation. The coach does a great job making
sure we're prepared. And we'll go over some scouts and personnel to make sure
we're ready for tomorrow.  
MICHAELA MABREY: Both teams are very good, both teams are athletic, have great
players, we know how to prepare for both.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about the two teams that you could play
tomorrow, what makes them good?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Duke has a number of All‑Americans on the roster,
probably as many as anybody in the country. Tricia Liston had an outstanding
year. Elizabeth Williams a really talented inside player. Haley Peters is a
great glue player for them. They've got All‑Americans on the bench.  
North Carolina is incredibly athletic. They are an amazingly athletic team,
and Diamond DeShields is having a spectacular year. She's come on late,
playing phenomenally well in the tournament here. She's a really difficult
match‑up for every team. I think she'll be a scary match‑up in the NCAA
tournament, also.  
Both teams present different challenges. Both are very, very good.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk a little bit about what you guys took advantage of
early on to get that big lead and then also could you talk about the different
ways you were able to score today?  
JEWELL LOYD: We were making sure we got the rebound first. And Lindsay did a
good job of looking ahead. And personally I was just taking what the defense
gave me, not trying to force anything, and just trying to follow up on it.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the challenge of being ready, just
coming off of the bench and hitting shots and how well the bench has done this
tournament?  
MICHAELA MABREY: I think I've really embraced my role of coming off the bench.
I just ‑‑ I'm always ready to shoot and always ready to get my teammates open
and in the right positions. I think our bench has really come along. I think
in the beginning we were struggling little bit. But I think we've definitely
come along very well.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  66  
North Carolina ‑ 61

  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: That was a great basketball game, just a terrific,
terrific effort. I'm really proud of my team's fight and particularly just the
execution down the stretch and the timing score. North Carolina is a very,
very good team. We didn't really do much to stop their primary go‑to's. But we
worked hard to, we tried to. And we tried to be aware and alert and make
things difficult, if we could.  
Out‑rebounding them was very important for us. That's something that we need
to get going on. Having three primary rebounders, when I look at that with
Haley, Elizabeth, and Ka'lia, we have got to be a team that has three primary
rebounders. So that was a great thing for us.  
I liked our heart, our grit, our effort, our fight, and some great lessons
there. Great lessons.  
  
Q. When the season began, I'm sure you didn't anticipate the players you had
on the free throw line in that situation being there. What does that say about
them and about Duke basketball?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: It says a lot about them. It says a lot about their
character. I can't say enough about Ka'lia Johnson and what she means to this
team and what she's been doing. It's just frankly incredible. And she just has
so much respect from her teammates and her coaches. You have no doubt about
her. I didn't have any doubt about what was going to happen.  
Oderah is a competitor. I could see that Oderah was sort of pleased, they
fouled, and it was Oderah. I looked at Oderah's eyes, and I said, She's going
to make these. She's, again, a person of character and a person who's going to
step up.  
It's great stuff to see people step up and to see a team play well together
and to fight through adversity. And we've had a lot of that.  
  
Q. Coach, if you're on the other side ready to face you guys, what are you
thinking as an opposing coach right now of this Duke team, where you are right
now versus what you might have expected previously?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I just love my team. I don't know how to really answer
that question. I just love ‑‑ right now we're just trying to get better. Is
this three games with this team? This is three games with this team. Three. So
we're just so grateful ‑‑ I'm sorry, four, my bad, four. We're just trying to
get games as much as possible and play together and get better. So I don't
know if I can say much for what somebody else might be thinking.  
  
Q. Elizabeth, on that block that you had at the rim, I think it was on
Stephanie under the basket. You had four fouls at the time. What goes through
your mind in that situation? Do you already say, I don't want to try to block
a shot, I'm in foul trouble or how do you make that decision or maybe you
don't have any time to make it?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: I think in that position and at that time in the game I
wasn't really in a position that I could foul. I felt like I could get a
pretty clean block out of it. I tried to get my hand on the ball and keep my
contact away from her. That's pretty much what I was thinking in the moment.  
  
Q. I was struck by it was a throw ‑back for you, that the last couple of
years Duke has been offensive‑oriented team. And they've lamented they didn't
play some of the grittier defense you had earlier in their stay here. But it
seemed today it was special in that regard. When you look at things like
points in the paint and rebounding, do you sense that this team has just kind
of absorbed the message that if they're to do anything the rest of the year
they have to embrace that identity as opposed to sort of the offensive
identity?   
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, I think it's taught us a lot of lessons about the
value of passing before dribbling. The value of rebounding and the value of
really measured defense, where you're focused on trying to take away the
strong hand of somebody, and really getting particular about those things.
We've really had to get detailed and focused and can have no distractions,
because it's hard work out there.  
And I think this team has learned ‑‑ learned a great deal about that, yeah, I
do. And I think it will help us this year, and I think it will help us in the
future.  
  
Q. Tricia, can you talk about how your roles had to change since Lex went
down, and how much more comfortable you are and your teammates, even though
you've had a very short time to get used to not playing with her, and how that
may impact going against Notre Dame?  
TRICIA LISTON: I think one noticeable difference is we're not running every
chance we have. With Lex, she has the ability to get up and down the court so
quick off the dribble. We find ourselves passing a lot more especially in the
open court and breaking presses. But knowing what we do well and how to play
with each other, I think it's ‑‑ at first it was a little difficult. It was a
little weird. But now I think we're knowing each other better, and knowing
what each other likes to do and where to get them the ball. And I think the
chemistry is really coming together again.  
Being able to set up in the half court and execute our stuff and use our
length on defense and play that match‑up really well, we're trying to perfect
that. We still have some work to do. And then staying on the rebounds with the
big lineup we have and the people off the bench. I think all of that
contributes to the new team that we have.  
  
Q. Tricia and Haley, playing Carolina in this situation in your senior year,
is this as motivated as you ever were for a basketball game?  
TRICIA LISTON: It's great. Especially after the first two games we had against
them this year. I definitely would like to end my career beating Carolina and
not ending on a loss. But coming into the ACC tournament, there's motivation
there. We want to come back and defend our last year's title.  
I think between the two of those there was a lot of motivation in this game.
But not to expect anything in tournament play, because you're only guaranteed
one game.  
  
Q. Coach and maybe Elizabeth, about Notre Dame, they've hit more than 51
percent of their shots this year. Coach Calder was talking about their
offensive execution, the precision they brought to this league. Do you feel
like you've learned anything in the first two meetings that will enable you to
interrupt that precision a bit tomorrow?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: I mean, yeah, every game is a learning experience and
learning opportunity. I think we had a couple of good stretches in our first
couple of games against them, but we've also had some bad stretches. So being
able to play a full 40 minutes against them is going to be really important.
And like Tricia was saying using our lengths in match‑ups and rebounding is
going to be important, just getting those extra possessions.  
  
Q. This is for Haley or Elizabeth, because I know how post players stick
together. What is it about Oderah Chidom and what you've seen from her so far
this year that maybe you felt confident that she was going to knock those free
throws down? Haley, I saw you having a conversation maybe with her when she
was on the line. What have you seen from her this year?  
HALEY PETERS: Well, O is a funny character, she really doesn't get phased by a
lot. She always seems to be kind of in her own world, which is a really good
‑‑ it can be something we have to jar her out of every now and then. But in a
situation like that it's a great thing. She's confident in herself and she
just went up there and hit four free throws in a row and really won the game
at the end of the game. So that's who she is. She's kind of very composed. She
doesn't get high. She doesn't get low. She's just ‑‑ she just plays and plays
hard.  
  
Q. At the end of the game when they came down trying to hit a shot to tie
the game, was your strategy to maybe pack in the zone with DeShields and Gray
hit a 3 ‑pointer? But it seemed if they were going to drive the refs were
going to call a foul. Did you have any strategy there?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think we had some pretty good strategy just trying to
take away DeShields down the stretch. I thought Ka'lia did a tremendous job
doing that, she's hard to take away. So we tried to work with that a little
bit. And I thought the rest of the team did a very good job matching up and
containing the paint and looking for Gray. So I thought it was great team
defense by our team down the stretch. I thought our last, probably our last
three minutes were the best of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you played Notre Dame twice and learned a lot about their team.
How big is the challenge tomorrow night?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Sure, it's a very big challenge. They haven't lost all
year. Haven't really been challenged all year. They're a very, very good team.
They're, as you said, precision offense.  
It's going to be important for us to get back, really work on our transition
defense. It's a great opportunity for us. A really great opportunity for us
because they're very, very good. They're definitely picked to beat us,
obviously. They're ahead of us, they have been all year. And that's just the
way it is. And it's a great opportunity to try to go after a great team like
that and find out what you can do and what you can attack and go from there. A
tournament situation is a lot of fun.  
So we're going to hopefully get a little bit better, grow more as a team
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Haley, I think it's fair to say you guys have had a lot of gut checks
this season, maybe more than maybe any other team possibly in the country.
Emotionally did you guys feel you had this in you tonight? This was a tough
battle, you've lost to these guys twice. Your lineup is so different. What was
it that you think emotionally brought you guys together? And did you feel like
you could do something like this after everything you guys have been
through?  
HALEY PETERS: Yeah, I mean, I think we've had ‑‑ we've gone through a lot as a
team and it hasn't really, I don't think, worn us down emotionally, at all.
It's just made us really become a closer team and really we just ‑‑ we just
want to be as good as we can be. It's been a fun challenge since Lex got hurt
for all of us in playing new roles and trying to get to know each other in our
new identity. We've been energized by it, I think.  
Obviously Lex and Chelsea on the bench wouldn't have it any other way, they
wouldn't let us be drained by it at all. It has only made us more energized
and more focused. And we've always ‑‑ we think we're good. So we don't ever
doubt that we can win when we step on the floor.  
  
Q. Question for Tricia and anybody else that wants to take it on. You guys
played a difficult game last night. It wasn't really close, but you had to
spend more energy because there was less of you. Notre Dame has played its
bench over the last two days. The fatigue factor is in their favor. Mentally
how do you prepare yourself to go into that type of situation and possibly
even make it an advantage?  
TRICIA LISTON: That's it. A lot of it is mental. We're tough, we're in great
condition. Tomorrow there's going to be enough energy from playing in a
championship game that we don't really have time to worry about if we have our
legs and if we don't. It's going to start by inside, getting some layups and
kind of getting our flow from there and moving outside. I don't think we're
going to want to start shooting outside shots and seeing if our legs are there
or not. But I think we're going to have to attack it and keep doing what we've
been doing. Our bench will come in and give us great minutes like they did
tonight and yesterday. I think we'll be just fine.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  66  
North Carolina ‑ 61

  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Congratulations to Duke. On this night they
were better than us. They are well coached and have good talent, very good
talent.  
We made some mistakes down in the end we'd like to be able to replay, but you
don't get to do that, so we'll learn from that and we'll drive on. I thought
overall in the game we gave good effort. I do not like the fact that they
out‑rebounded us, and I thought that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, the 10 ‑second rule is new, and maybe I don't understand the rule.
But did you feel the officials missed a 10‑second call at the end?   
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: I do not think so. But it could have happened,
but I do not think so. But we'll look at it.  
  
Q. Coach, what were some of the mistakes at the end that you were talking
about earlier?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Well, I thought we had a chance to make a
couple of ‑‑ we missed some shots. We didn't miss the shots on purpose. I
thought we had a chance. We didn't make a bad pass on purpose. I thought at
that point you've got to be very careful with the basketball. And I thought we
were a little bit wild with the basketball at that time. I thought we turned
down a couple of shots and then we took a couple of tough shots. And we have
to learn the difference between a good shot and a tough shot.  
Diamond shooting the 3 at the end, we were down 2. I said to her, Take the
shot. That's the bottom line. She's won us a lot of basketball games. And in
the end she's going to have the basketball in her hands. She can shoot it or
pass it, but she's going to have the basketball in her hands. That's my
loyalty to her, because she can make great plays. She's a great player. She's
an All‑American basketball player.  
  
Q. Obviously somebody had to lose this game, unfortunately. The 40 minutes
of basketball between the two teams, can you remember many games that were
played better than that?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: I don't know. We had some at Duke when we came
back, down like 16 at half or something, made a couple 3s and came back. I'm
not sure there.  
I'm sure for the fans that was a great basketball game to watch. A great game.
Unfortunately for the Tar Heels it didn't turn out like we liked. But
congratulations to Duke, and best of luck tomorrow night against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Two questions, can you give us an update on the status of Danielle Butts,
and related to her, how much did you miss her energy plays and her hustle? It
seemed that you were trying to dig down deep to get someone to replicate what
she brings in the game and weren't quite able to do it from your bench.  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: No question, I understand what you're saying.
And people can talk about numerous things. They can talk about you played
three days, they played two days, etcetera. We are young, they're older. No,
there are no excuses. We have players that come off the bench that have
talent.  
Did we miss her? Yes, she's a high energy player, and played outstanding last
night. No excuses. It's not just about basketball. It's about life, too. And
we don't have excuses. We would love for her to play.  
  
Q. I guess back to the first question, what's the nature of her injury? Does
it seem to be serious or is it unclear at this moment?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: It's unclear to me. They thought they may have
to take her to the emergency room at that time, but they did not. So I'm not
exactly sure from there.  
  
Q. What sort of challenge did Haley and Elizabeth present to you guys on the
boards?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: They're tough rebounders and they know how to get in there.
And I remember after the last game, their coach wasn't really happy we
out‑rebounded them the first few two games. I'm sure she got on them. They did
a good job of getting in there and shoving us out of there, whether it was
legal or illegal.  
  
Q. Ladies, either one of you or one after the other, did you see a different
Duke team on the floor today than you did just last week?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: No, I didn't. It was a different North Carolina team as far
as rebounding went. We didn't crash the boards like we should have. Duke does
a lot of things well and honestly, they did them well the past two times we
played them. But I just feel like we outplayed them the last two times and
this time they ended up doing it better than us.  
I didn't really see a different team. They were probably more energized. But
other than that, I don't think so.  
  
Q. Diamond, you guys have had some ups and downs this year. You played very
well and had some disappointments. Going into the NCAA tournament, what do you
think you need to focus on most to have a run in the tournament?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, first, we've got to get our heads up. We've got to
move fast, and we've got to have heart, and as far as the game goes, we've got
to crash the boards better. I think we've just got to play hard. We've got to
understand that we can play with anybody, and that should carry over each and
every game, and we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that sequence, I'm sure it happened fast, but
what do you recall about it?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Like you said, I got the offensive rebound, and I've been
getting offensive rebounds in the back, and just didn't fall that time. I pump
faked it. And maybe I shouldn't have pump faked it. And I went up and then
Ka'lia Johnson got the rebound.  
The whole time I had my hand on the ball, so my hand was already on the ball,
and me and Ka'lia were tied up, and the ref decided to go with the foul. So
respect his call.  
  
Q. Did you think that last 3 was going in?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yes, I thought it was going in. I wanted it. I wanted the
ball. Actually, I knew it was going in. It came in and came out. So I was very
confident in my shot when I took that one. But, you know, things happen. I'm
all right with it, I'll just work harder and be ready for the next game.  
  
Q. Xylina McDaniel always seems to be a rhythm player, that when she gets
into a groove it carries over to the rest of the game. In this game she got in
early foul trouble. In the past that seemed to upset her rhythm. Do you think
that's going to happen in this game, because she was a big factor in your
prior wins over Duke, and she wasn't really a factor today?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: They didn't give her the same open looks they
did the other games either. They gave her some wide open 3s in the other two
games and she knocked them down. I thought they shrunk the zone a little more
when she got the ball in the high post, and didn't allow her an opportunity to
drive the way she likes to drive from the high post.  
  
Q. Maybe a difficult question, you've seen Duke three times, Notre Dame
once, how do you see tomorrow's championship match ‑up?   
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Duke, as I said, is very talented and well
coached, and Notre Dame is the same. What Notre Dame brings to the league is
what Connecticut did for Notre Dame. Connecticut taught Notre Dame you've got
to execute. You've got to be able to score.  
And this is a league that's been more defensive dominated, athletic and
defensive dominated. And Notre Dame brings to the game precision, excellent
precision on the offensive end, and good position defense. And they're going
to make everybody in the league have to step it up to play with Notre Dame
because of the precision they bring on the offensive end. I think the league
will start to change. I thought Brenda Frese changed the league a little bit
with her offensive Maryland team in the past.  
I think it will be ‑‑ it's hard to say. Notre Dame is very good. Duke is very
good.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Notre Dame  83  
North Carolina State ‑ 48  
  
COACH WES MOORE: Rough day. Obviously very humbling day. And it's hard right
now to look at the big picture. But hopefully we can do that soon. And there's
about 290 Division I teams out there that would give anything to trade places
with us and be playing in the NCAA tournament in a couple of weeks. We've just
got to pick things up and maybe try to learn from some of the things that
occurred today.  
I'm proud of these kids. Obviously 25 wins is a great accomplishment. And so
do our best not to let one bad day overshadow what they've accomplished over
the last few months.  
Again, Notre Dame, great team, and wish them the best. And again, we've got a
couple of weeks to try to get back on track and be ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, how close was Markeisha to being potentially able to play today?  
COACH WES MOORE: You know, I think once she got out there it was just ‑‑ you
know, there's no structural damage, but there was a bone bruise. And I think
the doctors that looked at it yesterday felt like there might be a chance. But
then when our team doctor got here today he just felt like it probably was a
little bit too painful for her to go.  
So we wanted to be ‑‑ definitely be careful with it. She's going to be very
important to us in a couple of weeks, plus feel like she has a professional
career ahead of her. So there's no need in taking any chances with something
like that.  
  
Q. Just to clarify, she was not medically cleared to play?  
COACH WES MOORE: Again, when they looked at the MRI and all that again today,
you know, again, it's a bone bruise, it is painful. So they just felt like ‑‑
we didn't want to ‑‑ we didn't want to do anything today to, like I said,
maybe compromise her ability to go in a couple of weeks.  
  
Q. You had some players that haven't played significant minutes against a
team at that level. Who really showed you something of the people that haven't
played a lot?  
COACH WES MOORE: It was a rough day, you know, so it's pretty hard for me
right now to analyze that game, our individual play. Obviously I'll go back
and watch the film, maybe. I may just throw it away, to be honest with you.  
But I don't think anybody stood out and had a great game today. And I think
there's a lot of reasons for that. So mainly, you know, Notre Dame had a big
part of that, as well. You've got to give them credit.  
No. Again, we were ‑‑ it was tough, you know, even to run some of our stuff.
We had people out of position and different things. So it was a rough day.
Again, that's life. You're going to have those, and that's the great thing
about college athletics, it teaches you a lot. We learned a lot today, I'm
sure.  
  
Q. Coach, have you ever, in all your time coaching, had this many injuries
to deal with in key players?  
COACH WES MOORE: Probably not, especially so close together. I've never had
two ACL's within a 24‑hour time span. And then for Keisha to be ruled out,
yeah, it's tough. But, you know, there's other people that go through it, too.
And we just have to keep battling. I just hate it that these kids that played
so hard all year and so well all year, I hate that on this stage we had such a
rough showing. But again, just got to deal with it.  
  
Q. Both players, you got some time to recover from all this and you get one
of your key players back. What do you hope you learn from today's game?  
MIAH SPENCER: Just keep playing hard, every position. I know we had some
players that were out, but we have to pick it up ourselves and come together
as a team and play hard each possession.  
LEN'NIQUE BROWN: We have to bounce back, no matter what, we have to play hard,
play through.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what makes Notre Dame so difficult to stop
offensively, great ball movement, shooters. I know they've got a lot of
talent.  
COACH WES MOORE: All of the above. Obviously they're well coached. They pretty
much always have five players on the floor that, A, have very high basketball
IQ's, and B, can shoot the lights out. And again, they run their stuff
extremely well. They read and react to how you defend. It's not so much a set
play or anything like that. It's more once you make a decision how you want to
defend they've got a counter to it.  
So, again, I would have liked to have played them at full strength, but at the
same time, they're, what, 31‑0, so they've shown that anybody in the country
they can pretty much do this on a given day.  
  
Q. Coach, you get emotion from your team when you guys are winning and you
feel good and so forth. And now your team is facing an experience maybe for
the first time for you leading them and them under your leadership. How do you
work through that and how did you initially try to get that started today?  
COACH WES MOORE: I just told them, like I told you guys, we still have a lot
of basketball ahead of us. And we're fortunate these kids have put together a
great résumé. We ought to get a really good seed in the NCAA tournament and
have an opportunity to make some noise in there.  
So we have a lot to be excited about. And we do have some time now to catch
our breath. We'll take a couple of days off and then get back in and try to
clean some things up and get better and be excited about the opportunity. Like
I said, there's 290 Division I teams that would love to have the opportunity
that we're going to be presented with here in a couple of weeks.  
Kids are resilient. We lost to Notre Dame last week. We gave them a couple of
days off. And the second day off a lot of them were in the training room, and
I was really concerned about how they were going to bounce back from that,
I'll be honest with you. I was thinking about trying to pick them up, and I'll
be honest, they picked me up when I went down there. That's the way these kids
are. They're very resilient and they're going to keep coming back. And I have
no doubt we'll do that again.  
  
Q. Yesterday Kody was effective after Keisha went down. Today she had
difficulty getting the ball and difficulty getting good shots. How much of
that was Notre Dame's defense?  
COACH WES MOORE: I'm sure a lot of it was, but also, she was out of position
today. We had to move her inside and I don't know how smart of a decision that
was on my part, but we had to put somebody in there.  
You know, you can talk about running different stuff, but when you've ran four
out, one in, all year long, it's kind of hard to change when you find out less
than an hour before tip that your one in is not playing. Again, as coaches
we've got to be prepared for that. But you can imagine if the Denver Broncos
an hour before kickoff Peyton Manning wasn't playing, it might affect their
game, as well.  
  
Q. You sort of addressed a little bit what I was going to ask. How much
reshaping on the fly did you have to do with what you do offensively
considering it's been a pretty simple formula on the first option for 31
games?  
COACH WES MOORE: Obviously I didn't do a very good job coming up with counter
ideas. We run quick hitters, and we have other things we can do offensively.
But Keisha is a big part of what we try to do. And we work inside out. These
are the kids that obviously can do a lot of things on their own, as well. But
it starts ‑‑ it runs through her. And obviously you take her out, that changes
things.  
But, again, I don't want to make excuses. We're a better team than what we
showed today, with or without Keisha. We've got to do a better job than that.
We've got to play better, we've got to do the little things we didn't get done
today. That game should have been a little more respectable than it was. I'll
take the blame for that. I didn't have them prepared for this situation,
obviously.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned how after the game last Sunday against Notre Dame you all
had a good demeanor. Do you feel like with Keisha coming back in two weeks,
you can make a good run in the NCAA tournament? You still have confidence in
yourselves?  
LEN'NIQUE BROWN: I think we'll be able to bounce back. We've been bouncing
back all year. I think we can.  
MIAH SPENCER: I think a couple of days off is going to give us our legs back,
get our minds back right, let all this go, and focus on what is ahead of us. I
think we'll be fine.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  82  
Georgia Tech ‑ 52

  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Obviously we found out today exactly why Duke is one of
the top ten teams in the country. I really felt like their seniors stepped up
and played extremely tough, especially on the boards and just ripping balls
out of our hands. I think we kind of got on our heels. We hit a wall and we
never really recovered.  
It seemed like we spent a lot of energy yesterday, and we didn't have much
left in the second half and just felt like they were able to make some plays
and we couldn't match their effort level on the boards.  
  
Q. Coach, you played them toe ‑to‑toe in the first part of the game. What
specifically happened that you were not able to sustain them?   
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: I think one of the things was we were not able to make
shots. We shot 26 percent for the game. We weren't able to make shots. When we
can't make shots we can't set our defense. We get our momentum from scoring,
setting our defense, build on momentum from that. We just weren't able to hit
shots. And when you don't hit shots, then it's difficult for us to maintain
our intensity level on the defensive end.  
  
Q. What lessons are you looking to give your team out of this since you're
going to be in the NCAA after this?  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: I definitely think one of the things we've got to
understand is the level of intensity and toughness it takes. [Inaudible.]  
I think when you have another 3‑point shooter that helps spread the floor, I
think that really helps. Obviously we were hurting today without Sydney
Wallace. She's one of our best 3‑point shooters and has been playing extremely
well down the stretch. It's just a different game for us against the zone.  
I think Kaela has learned a lot of lessons throughout the course of this year.
But I've been very impressed with the way she's come back from games like
this, what her response has been. You can knock her down, but you can't keep
her down. She's just a very tough player, tough‑minded player. And obviously a
very special freshman.  
I really think that she's ‑‑ no doubt in my mind that she'll learn from this
experience playing Duke and all the top ten teams we played this year, we
played over ten. I think she's grown with each one of them. I definitely think
she'll come back in the NCAA tournament and have an answer.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: Playing against the zone, like Coach said, without Syd
today, so it was kind of a struggle. Kaela being primarily the only 3‑point
shooter on the floor, besides Aaliyah. She just couldn't get shots today and
it got wider and wider. They had some height, but it was something, like I
said, got spread further and further without hitting 3‑point shots and getting
the ball inside.  
  
Q. You played Duke earlier in the season where they were more or less full
strength in terms of their roster. Can you compare Duke then and Duke now and
what was different about them today?  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: You know, obviously they were without their point
guard, so I think that was a little bit different. But I think it was more
about us today as far as the difference in the game. I really felt like we
didn't make the plays that we made earlier in the season. And I really felt
like, again, we were playing without another 3‑point shooter, so we weren't
able to run, and our point guard. Both of us were without a point guard today.  
You really can't compare the two times we played them. And we played a game
yesterday and our starters played 38 minutes. It's just kind of a whole
different situation today than it was the first time we played them. Obviously
they're a different team, but I think their seniors have done a tremendous job
leading them through this adversity that they faced.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  82  
Georgia Tech ‑ 52

  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Yeah, I thought it was a very good basketball game for
us and a terrific and intense 40 minutes, which is really what you have to do
at this time of year. Georgia Tech is a fantastic team. We were certainly
concerned about different things that they could do. I really loved our poise
against any pressure.  
  
Q. What made this an increasingly one ‑sided game over the final 24 minutes?
  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I don't think it was any one thing, whether it was a
defensive possession or offensive one. There were very few times I felt we
were stepping outside of what we wanted to do. And there were very few shots
that were stacked because we were patient, we moved the ball and got the ball
in the right spots. And that's important to us. We've got to play this game
together, and I think everyone did a great job doing that.  
  
Q. Ka'lia, how much momentum did your team carry into half after you hit
that shot?  
KA'LIA JOHNSON: I think that momentum going to the halftime was great, and we
just built off of that. Coming out it was great. We played great defense,
great offense. It started from that, built off of that. Coming out it was
great. We attacked really well. Moved the ball really well. Like Coach said,
we didn't take any forced shots. I think we took all of our shots. It started
from that point and we just carried it on through the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Haley, you played an NCAA team, win by 30 points, everything looks good
on the stat sheet. With all the adversity you've had with losing players, how
impressive is it to you that everybody has adapted to new roles and learn a
new system?  
HALEY PETERS: Yeah, we've done just a great job as a whole, everybody just
embracing the challenge of what we've gone through this year and over the last
few games. We've had some setbacks, and we haven't done what we wanted to do,
but we've always really stayed with each other and stayed in what we're trying
to build on, and everybody just doing what they can do on the floor and doing
better, and improving on what they think they can improve on and today we did
a pretty good job doing that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the press and how you guys broke that press and how
you guys worked inside to basically wear down their defense versus the other
way around which they did against Virginia. I thought that Tech would come out
and try to wear you guys down physically, but it looked like by the end you
guys actually held up, the last one standing, so to speak.  
KA'LIA JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we were really patient offensively against their
presses, and like we said before, we weren't really getting out of ourselves,
we weren't trying to be uncharacteristic. We weren't overdribbling, and just
being patient and moving the ball. We were able to get layups against their
presses.  
  
Q. You held Georgia Tech to 20 percent shooting in the second half, 23
percent in the game. Coach and Elizabeth, do you remember a game like that?
Secondly, 13 of their best shots were blocks. Talk about the impact of the
blocked shots on maybe their psyche and their shots.  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: Blocked shots are intimidating, honestly, and I think
everyone contributed to that. Just having our hands up and being active, I
think we also had deflections, not even just blocks.  
What was the first question? Sorry.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: It's been awhile.  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I don't know the last time. But I loved the focus on
the stances. Again, everybody was moving together. So when somebody passed
off, somebody communicated, the pressure was there, the ball pressure. And
that's really, really important at this time of year. That's something we can
build off of tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season you were maybe the seventh, eighth, ninth player
off the bench and now you know you're going to play almost the whole time.
What's it like for you now and how much do you enjoy bringing the ball up the
floor?  
KA'LIA JOHNSON: It's fun. It's always fun to be on the court. It's just ‑‑ I'm
just always ready to play, no matter. Tonight 32 minutes, earlier in the
season, like you said, I got maybe 10 minutes. Every time I get the
opportunity I want to make a difference and do what I can for my team.  
As far as bringing the ball up the floor, going back to high school days, I
played a little point guard. It's like visiting my old days. But it's cool.  
  
Q. Haley, I was listening to Coach Brown talk on the Blue Devil Network. And
evidently you had 3 points in the first half, 16 in the second half, and he
said he was extremely happy because it sort of happened you were patient and
it sort of finally came that you were able to put the ball through the hoop.
Is that the way you look at it?  
HALEY PETERS: Yeah, I was aggressive all the game, I think moving to the ball
and moving without the ball. We had great shots in the first half. And I mean,
if your shots aren't falling, I was just focused on rebounding and playing
defense, and staying aggressive on offense. And in the second half it broke
for me.  
It's just ‑‑ that's how the game happens sometimes. Coach Brown is always
right (laughter).  
  
Q. Joanne, I thought the chemistry tonight was absolutely terrific. I was
just reminiscing back at the beginning when you had three experienced point
guards you were going to depend on and then now you don't. How did all of that
chemistry develop between these ladies?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: I think the team has worked very hard at owning up. We
did well against Wake, but wanted to be better. The next game we didn't do
well.  
This team is very, very excited about this new season, and they're very
confident. We've got a lot of great talent, and I think everybody understands
that everyone's got to play their role. That we've all got to be present
minded. And I think the leadership, whether seniors or younger, everybody is
playing their part and having fun, but knowing when to focus, and I think
that's a big key to this time of year.  
  
Q. Joanne, one of the main critiques you had of your team was overdribbling,
and that being a symptom of lack of focus. Can you compare that game and now
and how much of that was simply getting several days of good practice in to
sort of work on that particular flaw?  
COACH JOANNE McCALLIE: Again, I think the team just really, coaches like to
think practice really helps. But I think, too, that the team just really began
to understand it's better to pass. And I think this experience is teaching us
a lot of lessons. And may even be teaching our point guards that can't play
with us, because that ball is moving at quite a clip. It's hard to keep up
with it when it's passed. I think this team has really begun to understand
that, and was not happy about how we were last time out.  
We're a better team than that. We want to keep climbing, keep climbing, keep
challenging ourselves. And keep passing the ball.

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Florida State ‑ 57

  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: They're undefeated for a reason. And they know what they
want to do and they do it. And they expose you when you're not as confident in
who you are.  
We've had some ups and downs this year, and part of that is habits. We don't
have a lot of the habits that we need to have as a team that has freshmen and
sophomores. The one on my left here has habits, and you can see what four
years in our program ‑‑ a kid that goes to work every single day.  
Everybody keys in on her and she still has 29. I know she's three rebounds
away from being our all‑time rebounder. That's an amazing feat. Extremely
proud of her and exciting to play in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, as you prepare for the rest of postseason now what things did you
learn positively and negatively about your team?  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: Well, I think we showed a lot of resilience and a lot of
fight with the young kids. In the second half we could have packed it in, to
play them even in the second half and to battle and to fight, I'm proud of
them for that. But again I think what we learned is more for what we want to
be as a program. And if we're working to build a top ten program then we
learned what that takes.  
When Ariel Braker is willing to shoot one shot and be in the starting lineup
and go to work and do what she needs to do, that's what we've got to have is
kids that are willing to do whatever it takes to win. Natasha did that in our
program for three years. She wasn't our leading scorer last year. We have five
kids that scored in double figures. Natasha has been somebody that's willing
to do whatever it takes. Now you see the fruit of the labor. And it's really
exciting for her.  
  
Q. What did they do well to take her out of the offense?  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: I think she was trying to get more people involved,
honestly. We always want to get Tash involved, and we wanted to run some shot
clock, as well, because they're so prolific with their scoring ability.
Unfortunately she didn't shoot great. But she ran for 40 minutes, and that's
always something that she gives us.  
You look at Lindsay Allen, she does the same thing for them. And we've just
got to get some kids that have some confidence around them, going into the
tournament time.  
  
Q. Natasha, you're two games in a row, pretty strong performances. What are
you going to take away from these performances, why were you so successful in
these two games?  
NATASHA HOWARD: Just battling day in and day out, not giving up, just fighting
for my teammates every single game, no matter if we came up with a win or a
loss. Just battle with my teammates.  
  
Q. You've seen a lot of great ACC teams. How does this Notre Dame compare
with the best you've seen?  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: They're, I would say, up there. The thing that great ACC
teams in the past have been able to do is pass the ball. And I see them as ‑‑
when you have 24 assists in a game, that's pretty incredible. And great
scorers on the other side that can knock it down. But they don't want to just
play up and down and hully gully, they want to defend, too. And they do a
great job of that.  
And Muffet has done a great job with this team. She's put people in position
where they know what they're good at and they stick with the game plan. And
different people can have good nights. They have a lot of good weapons.

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Brittney Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26449)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina State  79  
Syracuse ‑ 63

  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously everybody who watched the game can see it
was with Gatling and without Gatling. She's an unbelievable post presence. And
she did a very good job of getting deep post position in the second half. She
just did a great job and Wes did a great job of getting the ball inside to
her. I thought we did a good job of making her taking two and three dribbles
to score.  
Just give her a lot of credit. She came up big. Because if she doesn't do
that, we win the game. Have to give her a lot of credit and give NC State a
ton of credit for just not laying down at halftime, being down and come out
and played hard, and that's why they had the season they had. They play hard
and did a good job.  
As far as our kids, just really, really proud of our effort. We have a young
team and a lot of young players. And sometimes we get a little unorganized in
situations, but they keep fighting. And that's what I like about my team. We
really compete at a high level.  
So overall I'm really happy with our effort. Great conference tournament. It
was great to be here and obviously going home a little bit earlier, taking a
whole lot of clean clothes home, so that's not good. But just very happy to be
here. Very happy to have a chance to compete against some great teams and
great coaches.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure you felt good about your team when you were up 48 ‑39\.
It's about a 9‑minute span of clock time, and I think probably a lot longer
than that in real‑time with the power outages, before Briana Day got the field
goal that was the first ‑‑ I think it was about a 20‑1 run. What took place
with your team during that span?  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: They went to their four out. We were prepared for
that. We knew they were going to go four out and try to punch and throw the
ball inside. We really felt that we could do a pretty good job of getting
Gatling out of the paint, making her take two or three dribbles to score. I
thought early she got very good deep post position and we talked about
doubling at some point. We talked about shrinking the floor. We didn't double
it, but we did shrink the floor.  
She made a lot of one catch and shoot opportunities inside. It was more of her
taking two dribbles, missing it, they get an offensive rebound. A lot of
things went wrong during the stretch.  
The biggest thing that went wrong is we didn't score. If we continued to score
being up 7 it would be a different ballgame.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to Bob's question, did they change things specifically
during that 25‑1 run that took things away from you?   
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: We got shots. We got shots that we didn't make. We did
a really good job of getting to the paint, getting shots, we had 10 turnovers,
we got plenty of shots. We took 70 shots. They took 63 shots. We shot 26
percent, they shot 45 percent. If we shot 40 percent I think we would win the
game. We would have stopped scoring.  
  
Q. Brittney, what do you hope to learn out of the ACC tournament to take to
the NCAA tournament play?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: We learned a lot from our first ACC tournament. We enjoyed our
time here. We're in a competition in a tournament of great teams. And to face
them, I think we're well prepared going into the NCAA tournament in
postseason.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a lot of depth, why didn't you foul Gatling more?  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think you get into a situation where you look at our
stat sheet and Shakeya Leary had four fouls. And Briana Day was in the game,
she had two fouls. And as you're playing Gatling, you don't want to get into a
total fouling match with her. We could have fouled her, we could have
double‑downed, we could have fronted her.  
It was really about her scoring. I really believe that. She had a monster
second half, no doubt about that. But it's more about us not scoring. We don't
throw the ball inside and say we just start fouling people.  
They did a very good job keeping us spaced out. I've got to give Wes amount of
credit, making sure his team understood what the game plan was the second
half. It was obvious; go four out, get her inside, throw the ball to her. So
we give her a lot of credit.  
This is not what we do, we don't just throw the ball inside and start fouling
and take our best scorers off the floor and play a player that can't score at
the other end. We can't afford that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Alyssa Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26541)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  73  
Maryland  70

  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: I'm proud of the fact that we fought all the way to the
buzzer. And I thought our momentum in the second half, you know, if you told
me to be able to have a shot with Alyssa with the ball with a 3, it was a
great look. That's what you want. I definitely thought it was going in.  
This game, obviously, I felt was impacted in the first half in terms of how
Carolina came at us really aggressive. We were back on our heels and you spot
a great team like Carolina 11 points, you're fighting the entire second half
to come back.  
We rebounded hard, but obviously a lot of uncharacteristic turnovers that they
were able to get points off of.  
  
Q. What do you attribute that kind of sluggish first half, 14 turnovers and
you miss 9 free throws and that's something in a game like that that's so
important?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: I thought Carolina having a game under their belt, I
thought they just came in really aggressive. We needed to get comfortable,
obviously new players, we have two freshmen in the lineup. I saw a lot of
nerves for them. So we had to settle them down. So obviously it took some time
and they were really aggressive and I thought kind of intimidated us to a
degree to start the game.  
  
Q. You were talking to the guards during the game, during time outs, during
the sluggish start to the game. What was kind of the message to them to get
over it?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Just to relax. I thought Carolina was really amped up.
They were very aggressive. And for us, just to try to get our poise under
control, stay confident with what we were doing and really just to settle
down.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about Diamond DeShields, rightfully so. But Allisha Gray
can do everything as well, go inside and get the 3. What kind of problems did
she present to you?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: I knew when she got that extra rest time yesterday she was
going to be really fresh. I think Allisha is just a tremendous player. She
does so many things. She has a really high IQ. Obviously she got a
double‑double. She's just a really difficult match‑up for us.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you got a jumper to cut it to 71 to 70, and the last sequence,
what was going through your mind and the thought process?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Just take it down, transition ‑‑ we were getting back in the
game. We definitely had the opportunities but we just didn't come through.  
  
Q. Coach, as the team was coming back in the second half, both Brionna and
Alyssa got into some foul trouble, and you had them on the bench for an
extended period of time, obviously because of the foul trouble. And during
that time North Carolina was sort of able to hold you guys off by getting the
ball inside. Did you at any point consider putting them back in a little
sooner to negate that advantage?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: You know, there was just different flows of the game. I
actually thought at one point in the stretch in the second half our guard play
was stopping the clock to get us to the free throw line. We didn't take
advantage of shooting the ball well from the free throw line. The way they
were calling the fouls, obviously that impacted us being able to play our
bigs. We had to put AT inside in a spot that she's never played in before,
because of all the fouls that were called.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you did become Maryland's all ‑time scoring leader today, being
first on the list with a program with so many great players. What does that
mean to you?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Just a huge honor. We didn't come up with the win tonight, so
(Inaudible) ‑‑  
  
Q. Sort of to follow up on that, for you, coach, to coach someone that does
something like that in a career. She's not in a position maybe to appreciate
it right now, are you?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Absolutely. And I know Alyssa will after her career is
over. And I know she's not going to appreciate it right now because of the
competitor and the winner that she is. She would turn all of that away to get
that win.  
But, yeah, absolutely. I mean everything that she's meant to our program, to
our University and it's only fitting for her to be the all‑time leading scorer
in Maryland.  
  
Q. Outside of the last ACC tournament for you guys, any emotions at all
about being in Greensboro one more time?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Obviously sad for it to be over. Definitely wanted to be
able to go further.  
But just great memories. Obviously great battles. When you talk about come
tournament time and coming down here to Greensboro, they do a first class
tournament. So just a lot of special memories will be taken away.  
  
Q. Coming out of the locker room in the second half it seemed like you were
making a concerted effort to get the ball inside. Was that something that you
thought you could attack in the second half, to chop into the deficit?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, we struggled in every area. I mean we
needed to have something, inside or outside, when you look at our percentage
from shooting the ball from the three, again, with some really wide open
looks.  
Yeah, being able to establish Bri and Alyssa inside and a higher percentage
shot obviously was critical.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you plan to use this loss to prepare for the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, as a team if this doesn't motivate you,
for us it would be a very quick ending. But I know what kind of competitors we
have in the locker room. We'll use the week to get better. We'll use this week
to, again ‑‑ I felt like we battled. If we don't spot them the way we do in
the first half, we give ourselves a legitimate shot. So we've got to be able
to come out and get better in this week ‑‑ week, two weeks that we're going to
have before the tournament.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Andrew Calder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26495)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Allisha Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26540)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  73  
Maryland ‑ 70

  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Again, as always, thank Coach Hatchell, gave me
a nice little pep talk today about playing Maryland. I wish the best to
Maryland in the NCAA playoffs. Again, they're very talented and very well
coached. Best of luck, especially to Alyssa Thomas, she's an outstanding
player. I thought we did a very good job of shrinking the floor tonight, to
not give her as many driving holes as she normally gets, and still be able to
rotate back out to the 3‑point shooters.  
Outstanding job by Carolina on the defensive end. Offensively we did some more
things today. Again, you see the talent of Diamond DeShields going in the post
and taking advantage of her outstanding skills also in the post. She's not
showed a lot of that this year, but she showed a variety of moves tonight. And
Allisha Gray hitting another double‑double is very big for this team.
Especially the foul shots, we were 16 for 20 from the free throw line. I
thought that was very important.  
We were very poised down the end, and we just made great plays. Allisha's
block on Alyssa Thomas at 33 seconds or somewhere in there, I thought was
outstanding. The tip of the shot, anyway. But great job on Carolina's part.
Great effort. Great intensity and effort.  
  
Q. Coach, was there much consideration at all after Allisha got hurt last
night, was that an issue going into the game? And I want to ask Allisha how
she felt.  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: No, she was tough. They told me there was a
great chance she was going to play today. She's a tough, tough young lady,
very mentally tough. And we expected her to play tonight.  
ALLISHA GRAY: It was nothing major. I'm fine.  
  
Q. Could you just speak as to how excited you are about playing Duke in this
venue tomorrow?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: I think I mispronounced Alyssa, my fault. No.
25, Thomas, we know who she was. I apologize.  
Playing Duke, again, and we've said this before, very talented and very well
coached. And we look forward to the next game for a chance for us to showcase
our players' skills and a chance to improve. And that's what we're looking for
every game, just a chance to improve. We play at 7:30 and the men play at
9:00. How about that?  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when Brittany Rountree stepped up to the
line in the last seconds, she hadn't shot one shot all game before that?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: We were very comfortable. We thought Diamond
would still get open, even though they had two people on her. But Allisha did
a great job finding Brittany. Latifah went down towards the baseline and came
back, and Brittany slid to the corner, and Allisha did a great job finding
her.  
We're very confident in Brittany, especially on foul shots at the end of the
game because she kind of owns that basket down there. I think she made like
six threes as a freshman down there, a high school record, I guess with seven
in the whole game on that end of the floor. She's comfortable in the
Greensboro Coliseum. We planned for them to shoot a 3 when Brittany went to
the line.  
  
Q. Seemed like you and Alyssa Thomas had good back and forth in the second
half. How would you evaluate how it went?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: My thoughts were just to stay strong. Alyssa, she's an
extremely powerful player. For me that was a challenge and that was one of the
hardest challenges I think I faced all season. I commend her on that and all
the hard work she's put it in season. She's a great player.  
So for me, I just had to step up to the challenge as a freshman you're
guarding an ACC player, it was a challenge for me, but I was ready for it. And
although she did, obviously, have a great game, I tried my hardest. That's all
I could say about that.  
  
Q. You seemed to start off a little slow, you seemed frustrated at the
beginning. How were you able to improve your confidence through the course of
the game?  
ALLISHA GRAY: It was basically my defense. Once I get a couple stops on
defense then my offense develops. I really don't worry about ‑‑ because I know
my team will score, I just focus on defense and just play my role and shoot
when I'm open.  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: I said put her back in, she's ready.  
Let me say the great job that Xylina did when we got the jump ball at the end
not allowing Thomas to go left, and then fumbled the ball and then we got the
jump ball. Xylina's defense was outstanding on that play.  
  
Q. Diamond, obviously a tough night for Allisha last night, missed the whole
second half, sit it out, then for her to come back with a double ‑double
tonight, what do you think of her performance?   
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I'm extremely proud of her. I know before the game started,
all day, basically, we've just been talking to each other, we're going to get
buckets tonight, and trying to motivate each other. I know she was down last
night, had to sit out. And so I tried to say, I got you, I got you.  
So today it was just all about confidence for her. And I think I did a good
job of getting her ready. Like I said, all day we were just talking about the
game, all day, all day. She did a great job. I'm extremely proud of her.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Kody Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26512)

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina State  79  
Syracuse ‑ 63

  
COACH WES MOORE: Again, I just couldn't be prouder of this group of kids.
They've done this all year long. It's not good for the head coach and the
heart, but sure is nice when you have a happy ending.  
So again, I think we were down 10, 38‑48\. We talked about at halftime how
Syracuse probably had an advantage in the first half, having already played a
game and gotten the jitters out of the way. But we felt like in the second
half we maybe could take advantage of that by being well rested. Probably the
delays probably didn't hurt us any either.  
Kody Burke, what can you say, 21 points, 16 boards. Keisha Gatling, obviously
career day scoring‑wise. Breezy Williams coming in off the bench. Miah
Spencer, a freshman here. Just so many people stepped up. Len'Nique Brown
playing about the entire game, having to handle the ball against the press.  
So just a great team effort and couldn't be prouder of them.  
  
Q. You were down 48 ‑39 and then scored 25 of the next 26 points in and
around several power outages, which you said didn't affect you. What turned
the game around?  
COACH WES MOORE: I'm not sure. I thought defensively we did a much better job
in the second half of trying to take the 3 away. They've got some great
shooters on that team.  
The first half I think they hit six 3s, we had to really do a better job
there. And then offensively we got it inside. Obviously Keisha is hard to
guard down there. And when you've got people like Kody and Miah knocking down
shots on the perimeter a little bit of inside‑out, it makes it tough. But,
again, I think we did a nice job, too, on the offensive boards, and went and
got some easy points.  
So, again, just a great second half.  
  
Q. It may be a little early, but do you have any kind of an injury update
for us?  
COACH WES MOORE: Not really. The x‑rays and everything they've done so far has
been good. I know they're going to do an MRI just to be safe. But hopefully,
whether it be tomorrow or in a couple of weeks when we play again, hopefully
we'll get her back out there. But, you know, right now, nothing definitive.  
  
Q. Obviously Keisha, Kody, and Breezy had great games. Sometimes seniors
just decide we're not going to have it end today.  
COACH WES MOORE: Right.  
  
Q. Is that your experience, that it makes a difference to have seniors at
tournament time?  
COACH WES MOORE: There's no doubt. But Miah is a freshman and she handled it
pretty well, too.  
This team, they've done this all year long. They've been so many times against
ranked opponents, they could have hung their heads and said this just isn't
our day, and they keep battling, they keep fighting, they hit a couple of
shots and get a couple of stops and turn the game around. I've been very
blessed to be a part of it and get to go along for the ride.  
  
Q. Kody, how inspiring was it to get the academic award right before the
game? How eager were you to play and win this one today?  
KODY BURKE: The award was definitely a surprise. I had no idea, I was lining
up for the National Anthem. And they told me to go to the half court to accept
your award. That was a big surprise. It definitely motivates me.  
When I waved to the Wolfpack fans, see how we had their support, that
definitely fired us up as well. ACC tournament time is time for us to make a
statement in the postseason. This win definitely helped.  
  
Q. A lot of freshmen when they come into this venue, it's an intimidating
experience the first time. You came out hit your first three. How did you
settled down so quickly?  
MIAH SPENCER: Just knowing that my team is very confident in me and I'm
confident in myself and the coach and Kody and my teammates push me every day
in practice. I knew I was table to knock down shots when I came into the game.  
  
Q. Question for Kody and Miah, Kody especially being the senior, if Keisha
is not able to go tomorrow, obviously you had 5 or 6 minutes today to learn
what that's like. What are you thoughts about going forward?  
KODY BURKE: I'm so confident in my team, because there was a long stretch
where Keisha wasn't in the game and we had people step up to the plate. As you
see, Breezy Williams had a great game.  
Defensively, as long as we play defense I feel like our offense will come. So
I have more than enough confidence.  
MIAH SPENCER: Just keep playing defense, getting rebounds, boxing out, doing
little things that count. We'll be fine.  
COACH WES MOORE: It beats the alternative.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Natalie Achonwa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21816)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Florida State ‑ 57

  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I thought we looked a little rusty at the beginning
of the game. But I thought we pulled ourselves together pretty quickly, had a
nice run at the end of the half. I thought Jewell Loyd in particular in the
first half was really outstanding, and then I thought Kayla took over in the
second half.  
Good performances from Michaela Mabrey off the bench in the first half. And I
thought some great minutes from Taya Reimer today, as well. But Natasha Howard
is an incredibly tough match‑up. She's just a phenomenal player, an
All‑American type player. She really looked like it today.  
  
Q. How important is it in a tournament where you've got to play back to back
to back to get a pretty comfortable win the first day so you can rest some of
your people?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: It was good for us to get our people off their feet, the
starters, especially, off their feet. And you need those good contributions
from the bench to do that. Because the three days, coming off of ‑‑ we had a
two‑day break, and we just really thought needed to play a little bit more
together. So now we'll hopefully be fresher for tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for coach. This team has been such an impressive team all year
long, and in the way you've moved very smoothly through the ACC. Is it hard
with the success that you've had and the dominance that you've had to keep
this team really hungry on a day ‑by‑day basis?   
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: No, we have really high goals. I think our seniors, these
two and Ariel Braker, are really focused on those goals and what we want to
accomplish. We know every game is important, and we come into each game with a
really great attitude.  
  
Q. Delgado scored 20 points for them yesterday, zero today. What did you
learn from yesterday's game?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: She actually had her career high against us when we
played them during the season. We were coming in geared up to play her. Then
yesterday topped her career high with 20. We knew she was somebody that was
capable of scoring. I thought we got up and guarded her well. Lindsay Allen
did a good job on her.  
  
Q. For both players, how much pressure is there, or is there, to be
undefeated at this point in the season, to go out and be good every time?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: We don't look at it as pressure. I think we took that
accomplishment of being undefeated at the end of the regular season and put
that on the back burner, celebrated for a little bit, but we have further
goals to accomplish. We're looking forward. It's a great accomplishment in
being in the ACC and being undefeated. That's all it is to us. We're looking
forward to what we can do next.  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think we were in the same situation last year. As seniors,
just coming in and just taking it game by game, and not looking too far ahead.
I think this team has shown a lot of mental toughness throughout. And we put
it behind us and we're just taking it day by day.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys will be playing the Wolfpack tomorrow, and I'm not sure
if you're aware or not, one of their key players, Markeisha may be out. Can
you talk about the significance of her being in or out of the game and how
that will help or not help you guys tomorrow?  
COACH MUFFET McGRAW: Well, she definitely is a very good player. I think an
All‑American caliber player. She was on the Neysmith and Wooden watch list.
When we played them down there we got a really good look at her, she has great
hands. She moves so well. She's so tough inside, leads the nation in field
goal percentage. She's amazing.  
But I think the thing that makes her so much better is Kody Burke. I think the
two of them are a great combination. Both of them can go inside. Both of them
together are really a formidable tandem in the post. They certainly rely on
those two a lot. So we're going to go into the game prepared for her to play.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Krystal Saunders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26466)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State ‑ 72 (OT)  
Miami  67

  
COACH KATIE MEIER  
KRYSTAL SAUNDERS  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Obviously a frustrating result for us, especially feel like
you're leading most of the game and have it kind of go away at the end there.  
But the start of the second half was probably our worst 4 minutes of
basketball we played all year. And I think that segment right there was really
where it changed our emotion, it changed our toughness, it changed our guts.
It just changed our whole demeanor.  
Really disappointed in that performance in the second half, especially the
fact that we were concerned about live ball turnovers and them getting steals
and that ignited them. A lot of what we prepared for and a lot of what we were
concerned about actually happened. That's frustrating as a coach and I'm sure
as the players, as well.  
But it's frustrating that we know that Florida State needs to win, and we kind
of gave it to them there in that 4 minutes.  
I will say, and I mean that sincerely, for Cheetah Delgado to have that game
is unbelievable. It's a great response by a big‑time player who played with a
ton of guts.  
Tasha Howard is Tasha Howard, we doubled her and she still got her numbers.
She always does very, very well against us. The reason why we couldn't stop
Howard is because Cheetah was scoring. It took away our game plan. She scored
throughout the game and she hit the big shots for them. If she's going to do
that, then not only are they an NCAA team, they can make it deeper.  
  
Q. Two games were pretty tight in the regular season and this one goes to
overtime. Was it fitting that you guys played an extra 5 minutes when you
played Florida State ‑‑  
COACH KATIE MEIER: We're both probably sick of playing each other.  
I did think this would be one of the best games in tournament because of there
was so much coaching going on, so much. And Florida State made some tremendous
adjustments in their zone this game that they did not make in our last game.
And they frustrated us. And I think the emotional immaturity of our team, lack
of experience in certain positions, they got us to that point.  
I'm trying to give them credit without blaming my team. They did a really nice
job of not giving us the looks that we were certain of. So then we became
uncertain. And so most of our turnovers, if you could see my face, I had all
these weird looks, like, What?  
I realized during the game if you were a player, you expected one thing, and
they took that away and got us off balance.  
I'm frustrated, and I truly am, I do want to give them credit, because I hate
when coaches don't give credit to their opposition for what they did to make
us feel that way. They did do that. They are very long, they played very
physically.  
In the crunch time when I was trying to go to Krystal, suddenly they were
covering up Krystal really wide in their zone. We had people taking shots that
aren't usually our game winners. And that's kind of what happened towards the
end there.  
  
Q. Krystal, what makes the two teams so even, do you think?  
KRYSTAL SAUNDERS: What makes Florida State and Miami so even? It's a rivalry.
That's our motive. We're playing Miami, it has to have some toughness in that.
When we play each other it's like, who wants to win? Who wants it more? And
today Florida State wanted it more.  
  
Q. Did you have a chance to win that tournament? You've been in a good
situation like that before.  
COACH KATIE MEIER: That tournament, which we'd be proud and blessed to play
in, if Krystal's legacy, Krystal and Maria four straight postseason bids as a
class, that's a big deal. And I think that's going to happen for us, which is
great. We have the ability when we play, with emotion, to beat anybody. We
really do.  
The consistency this year has been very difficult at times. I've said all year
I think if Suriya McGuire and Keyona Hayes play well on the same night, based
on the consistency we've gotten from Krystal and Motley, you watch us on film
sometimes, and you go, Wow, that's a top 25 team. No doubt. It's my job to
make sure we get that performance every night and play consistently.  
The most excited team, the team that's happiest to be in that tournament,
usually goes very far. And I will be very excited if we get that opportunity.  
  
Q. It didn't end up being moot, but how big was that Necole Sterling three,
and overall her contribution tonight?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Huge. Necole has been a very fun story for us. We are not
an easy system to play in because you've got to have creativity and establish
trust with me to understand what I'm thinking to play that free. It's not ‑‑
the inmates don't run the asylum. But there is a certain, Am I okay to take
the shot, am I not okay to take the shot? I don't understand, Coach. I get
that a lot with my first‑year players.  
There was a moment in the game she missed the shot. She didn't want that shot.
She wasn't confident in the shot. I said to her, No, you've got to know you're
good. Don't take a shot if you don't know you're good. You've got to know
you're good and you've got to knock that down. She hit the next one and then
she hit that big one. That was all her. She was supposed to either roll or
pop, but the fact she was confident and took that shot, that's real exciting
for us.  
Those type of sparks from all different players. Jessica Thomas had great
minutes for us tonight, and I probably should have trusted her a little bit
more down the stretch, to be honest. But that's fine.  
And as disappointed as I am right now, it will take me about 30 minutes to get
my motivation back up, to get in the gym and fix what we need to fix and have
more fun stories to pop up for us.  
This season there's a different story every game. And it's a great thing. We
have nine players on the team, at one point every one has been a leading
scorer. Which is probably no other team in the country can say that every one
of their player has been at some time a leading scorer this year. But it also
makes you a little bit crazy to figure out who to go to.  
That's the team this year. So we all decide that we're going to be leading
scorer in the same night, we'll be great. We just want to keep playing.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Kaela Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26483)

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Tyaunna Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26484)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  77  
Virginia ‑ 76

  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: I want to give Virginia a lot of credit. I thought
their seniors battled down there when they got down 14. I thought they did a
tremendous job making plays. And they went to the zone in the end. We
struggled to score against that 3‑2\. They were able to get some run‑outs and
scores, and that got us on our heels a little bit.  
I want to give my players a lot of credit. Because when we had to come up with
big defensive stops we were able to do that. I thought we had some big plays
down the stretch. Aaliyah Whiteside had struggled throughout the day, but came
up with a big 3‑point play at the end.  
I think that's one of the things we've built this program on is defense and
rebounding. We pride ourselves on our resiliency. We bent but we didn't break,
and we were able to come away with a win.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys used the full 40 minutes to beat them last time
right from the beginning. This time you used that spurt in the second half to
get some separation. Did you see another, I don't know, blowout coming? Did
you kind of expect you guys to settle in or were you surprised that Virginia
did come back?  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: No, I was not surprised by Virginia's resiliency and
ability to make plays. When we played them in Atlanta we made our first 11
shots and kind of knocked the wind out of them early. But they continued to
fight. I told my staff afterwards I thought Virginia was a very good team
because we played a very good game that day and Virginia, we weren't able to
run away with it.  
And I thought today we were in for a battle. I got exactly what I expected.
It's tournament and anything can happen. When you get a team full of seniors
and upperclassmen like Virginia does, you have the ability to make plays and
win games. I thought our team, again, just showed some toughness down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, your team always typify athleticism and endurance. It looked like
you guys were pressing right from the beginning. Was that meant to really wear
down UVA throughout the game from back to front?  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, you know, we press. We're a team that presses for
40 minutes. We press you on every dead ball, every made basket. We even press
on missed baskets. We're a team that presses.  
But we were feeling like since Virginia played yesterday our ability to press
and run in transition would help us wear them down a little bit. I thought
that they showed some toughness and endurance in the second half, as well.  
  
Q. Did you think the technical at the end of the game was a good call?  
COACH MaCHELLE JOSEPH: That's a loaded question, isn't it?  
You know, obviously I thought it was a great defensive play by Nariah Taylor,
obviously she got pretty excited about it. And I do think the officials were
put in a situation where they had to make that call. We talked about it in the
locker room afterwards and Nariah knows her excitement overcame her obviously
and it wasn't a very good play for us, but it was the right call.  
  
Q. For the girls, obviously you two have the majority of your points tonight
but the biggest bucket comes from neither of you. Can you talk about how much
you appreciate Aaliyah with that three ‑point play and what the feeling was
like to take the lead there?   
KAELA JOSEPH: Definitely our role is to score on our team, but when we have
other players step up, like Aaliyah from the bench, that play right there, a
lot of excitement on the court when she made the bucket. I ended up on the
ground too with her. We were definitely excited.  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: Same thing, it's always our role. We know our roles. But at
the end of the day, same thing when you have other players step up and make
big plays, it just kind of fuels everybody and gets everybody excited. And
just puts ‑‑ we have the trust in her to make that play. I think that's the
great thing about it, you put the trust in her and she made the play. It was a
big‑time play.  
  
Q. Tyaunna, heading into the next game against Duke, you played them before,
what's the message that you send your teammates? You guys don't have that
luxury of getting too much rest to be ready to go. How do you guys prepare for
that game?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: No matter who we play, it's an ACC team and every team in
this league is good. We're going to approach it like a regular game. It's win
or go home. We're not going to come in here scared or timid. We're going to
come and lay it all on the line because we're not promised tomorrow.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Brittney Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26449)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Syracuse  63  
Clemson ‑ 53

  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think this game just came down to just playing hard.
It's funny, because when you go into this game and I look back at the tape we
played Clemson the first time, they just do a lot of good things in the zone.
They spread us out. They put themselves in a situation where most teams you
just settle. But when you look at their roster and the players that should be
taking 3s, take them, players that shouldn't, drive. We need to concentrate on
their personnel and knew who was in our area and who was in front of us.  
I give them a lot of credit. Audra is doing an awesome job. She's getting them
to play hard and play the right way against our zone.  
As far as our team, it was about waking up this morning and trying ‑‑ I didn't
care how we got it, I just wanted to get it. And I thought going into this
game, we thought about balance. I thought we had a ton of balance. When you
look down our stat lines, everyone played and everyone contributed to this
win. So I'm very happy about the win.  
I thought that late second half we just got isolated and got some good looks
at the basket. Everybody helped us win the basket game.  
  
Q. Quentin, what did you tell Brittney and Brianna at halftime? They were
combined 0 for 6, they had no points. I know you had to be concerned about
that.  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, I was concerned. I told them they were awful. I
told them they were awful. I really did. I said if our two best players play
awful we're going to lose the basketball game. That's what I told them. You've
got to pick it up, we depend on you, and you guys have to play better.  
  
Q. Brittney, was it a matter of working through things when the shots
weren't falling and just hanging in there?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: In the first half, me and Brianna were 0 for 6, but for me, it
was just a matter of just staying confident and knowing that the shots that I
usually make were rimming out, and I know I could make those shots. It was
keeping confidence and staying out of my own head.  
  
Q. Were you able to wear them down a little bit? You just kind of kept after
them?  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: That was important for us to push tempo and to keep
pressuring. They did a really good job of spreading you out. And once they get
you spread out they attack you really well on the backside of your press. But
we thought if we could continue and press them and get a few traps and steals,
that they would have to get out of that and get into something different. I
thought everybody helped us, yes.  
  
Q. La'Shay Taft really kept you in the game in the first half. Could you
talk about her playing, everybody focuses on Butler and Sykes so much, but you
really had another player step up and start nailing some threes. And I thought
that was a big key, the reason you led in the first half.  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, definitely. When you look back at the games that
we won, that we consider big games, and the games that are résumé builders,
La'Shay Taft played well at the Paradise Jam. She's a very explosive scorer.
And she's the one ‑‑ one of the kids that has a neon light. If you want to
shoot it, shoot it, we'll figure it out on the back end. She's going to just
shoot it, so just let her go.  
  
Q. This is for both of you, is your depth something that can maybe help you
through the next ‑‑ you get to play multiple games on multiple days, is that
something that can come through for you?   
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yes, for sure. We talk about getting four players in
double figures. We talk about getting ten players double figure minutes every
night. And we can continue to keep fresh bodies in the game and we can
continue to have ten players give us production in our positions, it will be
huge.  
I think in the post, it really hurt us a lot driving in the middle of our
zone, so we used all three of our centers, I thought Briana Day came in, she
only played three minutes, but she did an awesome job of getting some stops,
getting some rebounds. She got loose balls. She played with energy. I thought
tonight it was her.  
  
Q. Brittney, would you care to elaborate on tomorrow's opponent a little bit
and your thoughts about playing them again?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Well, I know now that the regular season is over and we're in
ACC tournament we kind of figured out and put the teams in the place they
would be, and now that we see we're playing them, I think the whole team and
the coaching staff we're all excited and we're ready to play them again,
because we lost a tough one at NC State, and we really wanted to face them
again, because we know we can win them. We're playing them tomorrow, same
time, same area, we're going to go out and do game prep and be ready to play
against them.  
  
Q. This was your first ACC tournament, were you surprised at an atmosphere
for an 11 o'clock game in the morning? What were your thoughts on that? It
sounded pretty loud in there.  
COACH QUENTIN HILLSMAN: No, I wasn't surprised because they've been warning
me, if anybody has that high school game you're not going to be able to hear
yourself think. And I wanted to say, you guys be quiet, because I can't ‑‑ I
really can't hear, and they can't hear me. It was an awesome atmosphere.  
You get to a venue like this, and you have young kids that are coming to the
game, probably one of the most unbiased crowds that I've faced. They cheer for
everybody. It's funny, they cheered for us one possession, are you with us?
We've got to give them credit for their enthusiasm throughout the game. It was
a great atmosphere, great venue, same thing tomorrow, hopefully it will be
great, same thing.

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Chelsea Douglas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26439)

### [Dearica Hamby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26440)

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  69  
Wake Forest ‑ 65

  
COACH JEN HOOVER: Just really proud of our team and the growth we made this
year. And could stand up here all day and talk about each individual player,
and especially starting with these two right beside me. But, you know, just
such a gutsy team, and showed so much character and passion, I can't say
enough about them. It's a hard day for us. I told them in the locker room I
wasn't ready for the speech. I had a victory speech prepared, ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, you played good, confident basketball for the first half and then
Carolina kind of hit you with a barrage. Was that due to fatigue or did they
just make the right adjustments?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: I think they just played a lot more aggressive and physical.
And the game was allowed to be that way. I think we got rattled a little bit
from it and didn't step up and be strong enough.  
You've got to give them a lot of credit. We knew they weren't going away. We
know they're an extraordinary basketball team with a lot of talented
basketball players on that team. We knew they were going to keep coming. We
were confident we could handle it and we were going to take the best punches,
but we fell short.  
  
Q. Did you have to change a little bit how you were playing after the third
foul? Things were going so smoothly earlier.  
DEARICA HAMBY: Usually I start the first half less aggressive and second half
I usually pick it up when I don't have any fouls. But definitely changed the
way I played and rebound and be more aggressive and go for steals and stuff
like that.  
  
Q. What changed over halftime that they were able to get the jump on you the
second half?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: I don't know exactly what changed. Again, you're looking at
a team with a lot of tradition. They were ‑‑ obviously I thought we played
some of our best basketball in the first half. And they just came out in the
second half and were really aggressive with us, and right off the bat we
missed a few shots early in the second half, I know we missed a layup. I think
we were 0 for 4 and they got momentum out of it.  
It was one of the things we talked about, we had to get stops and keep them
from running their transition games. We didn't want to give them points off
turnovers.  
Once they started to kind of come that way and saw success, it was something
that they fed off of.  
  
Q. For any of you, what did the effect of the power outage situation have?
Looked like it maybe helped them, some of Carolina's momentum at the time.  
CHELSEA DOUGLAS: I don't think it really played any effect. We were just
trying to stay warm.

### [Nikki Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26428)

### [Nyilah Jamison-Myers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26429)

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Syracuse  63  
Clemson ‑ 53

  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: First off, I want to commend Syracuse on playing a decent
basketball game. They really had a lot of kids step up. They shared the wealth
tonight and had a balanced attack in terms of their scoring.  
For us, I was proud of the way our players played, the way they fought,
especially the majority of the kids having to play a ton of minutes last
night. That was a very emotional and physically exhausting game for them. But
I'm really proud of the way they fought. I really felt like Syracuse had to
battle to win this game. And they turned it on in this late second half and
went on a run and we couldn't recover from that run.  
Unfortunately we gave up quite a few offensive rebounds there, and that
completely exhausts you on defense, when you have to continue to play defense
over and over again. But I can't begin to tell this group, these two young
ladies here and the rest of the group how very proud I am for them for getting
to this point and battle a team like Syracuse like they did today.  
  
Q. Coach, what's the challenge of defending a team that just keeps bombing
away from three point range like that?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: Taft, the kid didn't even play against us the first game.
But that's the thing with 3‑point shooters, she has a very quick release. And
a couple of times we thought she was coming off the ball screens and we were
getting ready to defend her utilizing the ball screen and she just shot it. We
lost her a couple of times. That presented a great challenge for us in the
first half.  
Also the offense, they were running the first half, they were lining up
shooters on the right and left side, setting the ball up top, and Leary was
diving to the paint and we couldn't defend her. We couldn't trap her like we
normally trap in the post. She was in the middle of the lane. And we couldn't
bring anybody from either side because of the shooters. That presented a huge
challenge for us in terms of locating the shooters and making sure that we got
in their face. Of course, you know, Coffey knocked down two. Taft, she was the
X factor in the game tonight. She was the X factor, she kept them in the game
and kept them going the first half when Sykes went out.  
  
Q. Nikki, you guys were playing with basically six players there at the end
of the game after Quinyotta fouled out and they were running with 11 most of
the night. Did you feel like you wore down the second half?  
NIKKI DIXON: Definitely, I felt like we were limited on numbers. But we've
been limited on numbers all season, because it's not an excuse, we have been
playing with 6 or 7 or 8 strong, regardless of what it is. I felt like we kind
of ran out of gas.  
  
Q. You played two of your best games of the season in the tournament. What
do you think is the key to sort of finishing strong like that?  
NYILAH JAMISON‑MYERS: I feel like ‑‑ like I said yesterday, I'm just working
on consistency. I'm just trying to make it to where I can bring it like this
every night for next season and seasons afterwards.  
  
Q. If you could, the two players, you know, you're obviously disappointed,
but it seems like you were playing your best ball right here at the end of the
season. How do you feel about the progress you made and the program made this
season?  
NIKKI DIXON: I feel like ‑‑ it's like, I don't know, it's like tournament time
is the time to just ‑‑ everything you possibly have been through this season,
you play so many games that when you get to the tournament time you have to
have like a second brain, like a second physical body and mental brain. A new
player, fresh out of the summer.  
You have to get to that point when you come to the tournament, teams are ready
to win. And there's also teams that sleep. And there are also teams that come
in that are the underdogs and sneak up and win against very good teams. I felt
like the progress we've made ‑‑ did you say individually as well as ‑‑  
  
Q. Wherever you think you made progress.  
NIKKI DIXON: It doesn't matter. As a team, we really are changing, and that's
the biggest thing, we had a really good foundation for this program. And we're
ready to take off.  
  
Q. Coach Smith, same for you, obviously you just finished your first season
here. What are your thoughts on it right now?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: A lot of positives going into ‑‑ my wheels are already
turning about postseason workouts and into the summer and next fall, because
you know before we know it the season is back around again.  
I have to admit, they won't admit it in public, but for these young ladies,
this has been a tremendous adjustment for them. Literally, I think I said to
someone the other day, it's like I picked them up and dropped them off in
Japan, and they're like, Oh, my God, I don't know the language, how do I get
around, how do I navigate this thing? I completely changed everything that
they've been used to. So I made them very uncomfortable, which is part of the
process in terms of growing.  
We have a lot of talent returning, we have quite a bit of talent coming in.
And I'm hoping that these young ladies have learned from not only when I
started, but what the staff has started in terms of everything that we do,
from practice, from the way we dress, from the way we speak, from the way we
conduct ourselves, from the way we take pride in being in class on time, from
the way we take pride in everything, in who we are, that that will help us
move forward.  
Because Clemson is a very special place. This program at one point was at the
top of the ACC. And my focus and my goal is to get us back there. And I'm
really proud of the way they came into this tournament. No one expected us to
beat Virginia Tech yesterday. But especially the way we played them at their
place. And they dug deep and they won, and in the way they battled tonight.
There were numerous times they could have folded and Syracuse could have beat
us by 20. But they continued to stay in the fight.  
So that shows huge progress and that we're getting there. And I know it's
going to continue to take more time. But the future for us is very, very
bright. As long as they continue to learn to understand me, which sometimes
can be quite difficult. I guess I'm a strong disciplinarian is a nice way to
put it. But we have to have it. We have to do it.  
And this is a tremendous league. I'm so excited to be back in this league, but
already I'm ready to get started working so we can be ready to get back here
yesterday and our stay here next year will be longer than it was this year.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State ‑ 72 (OT)  
Miami ‑ 67

  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: That's always a great rivalry. It's always a great game when
we play Miami. And credit Miami, I thought they did a great job of controlling
a lot of things early. The main thing that we talked about was Miami had a 51
to 36 advantage over us on the boards in our last game. And we hammered home
how important rebounding was going to be, and we held them to 31 rebounds. And
I think that was the difference in the basketball game.  
I think these two being warriors that they were. Two seniors who didn't want
to have their career in the ACC end early. They scored 50 of our 72 points.
That's pretty incredible. And for Tasha to have 30 and 16 against a great
basketball team just shows what kind of a warrior she is. And I think both of
them played ‑‑ both of them 44 and 43 minutes. And that's warriors.  
So I'm extremely proud, extremely proud of our young team for coming in. We
had three people that have ever played in this tournament before that
returned. I'm very proud to be able to advance.  
  
Q. Talk us through that 3. And how big was that kind of open the lead there
in overtime.  
YASHIRA "CHEETAH" DELGADO: We had drew a play up to run. And it didn't go
through. The clock was running down and the ball ended up in my hands. I just
shot it. I didn't think about it. We were trying to tell our team, We've got
to get back, there was too much time left to give them a chance.  
  
Q. Coach, I looked across the way with 3.3 seconds and that foul shot went
in and there was a little bit of an exhale from you. I'm sure it never gets
old against your biggest rival. It must have been a good feeling when that
happened.  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: Unbelievable. And to be in that situation ‑‑ and that's one
thing that we've really grown as a team is at the line. And to be in that
situation, we have had a lot of pressure on us for a very long time. Since our
loss to Wake Forest I think we felt a lot of pressure. And to be able to
handle it like we did today, free throw line at the end of the game, that was
big for us.  
  
Q. Tasha, another 30 ‑point game. You had quite a few of these here in the
last week. Can you just kind of take us through the roll you've been on. Was
this your favorite 30‑point game against your biggest rival?   
NATASHA HOWARD: I really don't know. Like every game that I play is always
fun. Scoring that many points, but I couldn't do it without my teammates and
the good coaches I have on the sideline. I just come in and play my heart out
and play for my teammates.  
  
Q. Cheetah, you win the best two out of three to get the most important
game. What made the team so evenly matched this year?  
YASHIRA "CHEETAH" DELGADO: We're both great teams. Playing against Miami is
always a rivalry game. We had good match‑ups and so did they. It comes down to
the end, like it did in overtime, who wants it more, and I feel like we played
a lot more towards the end. It's always going to be a good game with them.  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: It doesn't matter who is on either team, it's always going
to be a great game. Katie has done an amazing job with her team, as well.
She's lost some pretty good ones in the past, players. And she's done a good
job this year, extremely balanced, and that's hard to guard.  
  
Q. For all three of you. Emotional win over your rival in overtime. You've
got a huge challenge tomorrow. Is that going to be tough to make that
transition from winning today and having to face another game tomorrow?  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: No, that's what this tournament is all about. We knew that.
It's not like we win and we get another week to prepare. We're excited about
that. And we'll enjoy this through dinner and then we'll get busy.  
  
Q. Coach, since the beginning of conference play, your team's kind of had a
journey up and down. But coming into tournament play you always seem to really
get it there. How do you prepare your players? It seems that they respond each
time around this time of year.  
COACH SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, I think we've got to trust the process. You can't as a
coach get too up or too down on what's happening. And with a young team, I'm
telling you, I mean, we have pulled our hair out. These guys have pulled their
hair out. We have conversations all the time. They're trying to teach as well
as trying to play.  
It's been great for all of us. I think we've grown as leaders in this time.
And for them to stay as steady as they've stayed I think it's, again, just
trusting that process.

### [Andrew Calder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26495)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  69  
Wake Forest ‑ 65

  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Thank you. Again, I want to thank Coach
Hatchell, as I always do, for her help. The ACC tournament is always so
special. Like I've said before, Greensboro Coliseum, city of Greensboro and
the ACC does a tremendous job with this tournament.  
To Wake Forest, they're well, well coached. They have two outstanding players.
The one thing I like about what they do, they don't run an offense, they
attack you when you make a mistake. They did a really good job with that.  
However, in the second half our team picked up the intensity defensively. And
we mixed up a couple of traps in there with our man‑to‑man defense. I thought
the defense that Brittany did on Douglas in the second half, Brittany Rountree
was outstanding. And also Diamond DeShields, basically whoever she guarded in
the second half. Xylina McDaniel on Hamby some in the second half too, I
thought she did a good job of denying her the basketball.  
  
Q. You scored the first 14 points at second half. What was so special at
halftime that you changed things around?  
ASSOCIATE COACH ANDREW CALDER: Well, we're champions and I think the players,
they closed the door before I could get in there to them and kind of took care
of business themselves. I may have raised my voice just once, maybe, at them.
But they responded. And they're champions and they worked extremely hard and
we're very proud of them.  
When the lights went out, I said Super Bowl, didn't the 49ers come back, but
they didn't win, did they. We said it's just like the Super Bowl, we said that
to the TV people, but I don't know if they said that on TV or not.  
  
Q. Diamond, you grind out a win, without many people having a shooting
night, what did you have to do well to make up for that?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: We just had to take care of the basketball the second half.
The first half we were being careless. We need to trust each other to make big
shots and just find the open gap in their defense. We did a good job of
slashing, Coach made an adjustment and I was put in high post. I didn't do as
well as I wanted to, but I think that frustrated their defense a little bit,
because they were focused on me.  
And Brittany was on the perimeter shooting the big 3. We had to be able to
make adjustments on the fly. We didn't want to lose. We didn't want to go
home. And I think that was just the main focus.  
  
Q. Diamond, were you looking for shots the last few minutes, because you
seemed to be a little more aggressive down the stretch?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yes, I definitely was looking for shots. I like the big
moment. And I've said this before, I want to take the big shot. I got
confidence in myself and I believe my teammates have confidence in me to take
that shot and make that shot. That was the shot that we needed. I had to knock
it down. I had to.

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Ataira Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26435)

### [Sarah Imovbioh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26485)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  77  
Virginia ‑ 76

  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Just a great, great tournament game for both teams.
Obviously it's really painful right now. A lot of credit to Georgia Tech, but
I couldn't be more proud of my team after this game.  
  
Q. I guess you guys get down 13 there. Did something kind of click in you
and maybe Kelsey and Lexie to think that this could be our last game, let's
not go down without a fight and you kind of turned it up a little bit?  
ATAIRA FRANKLIN: I don't want to say that that was necessarily our first
thought, that this is the last for us. But more so that we just want to win,
more than anything. It wasn't really ‑‑ we weren't really so focused on we're
the seniors and this is it. We just wanted to win the game.  
Sarah is the one who something must have clicked for because she put the team
on her back. At the end of it I just couldn't be more proud of my teammates.  
  
Q. Sarah, this was your third career tournament game. But did you kind of
get in the moment a little bit tonight and said kind of hop on my back and
make that comeback?  
SARAH IMOVBIOH: Yes, I really did. I wanted this win for all my seniors. I
wanted to advance, and we were all looking forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. The other coach mentioned that you switched to the zone in the end,
spurred that comeback.  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: It was good. I'm glad we changed it up a little bit. They
were beating us off the dribble, and we were fouling up at the free throw
line, we had to do something. We had played 12 down there before, weren't
quite as successful. In a game like this, last 9 minutes and you're 9 down,
and we saw some success in the first two possessions of it, I thought we have
a chance now. I think they're a little rattled, we're a little bit on a run.
So it definitely helped us.  
  
Q. The technical happens and you call timeout. And obviously Frankie hits
the two free throws and there's 3.7 seconds left. What was the play you were
trying to get there and what did they do to disrupt it?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: I knew they were going to switch on all screens, we faked
SI screening and flashed back to the ball. We felt she was mauled a little
bit, wasn't really open, but she couldn't get open. So the play was for SI to
fake the screen, flashback, everybody else was a decoy coming to the baseline,
hit SI, Frankie fake going low, come and take the handoff and attack the rim
and hopefully get fouled on the first shot, to hand the ball off to Frankie.  
But SI couldn't ‑‑ was trying to get open. Wasn't able to get open. Not
necessarily her fault. And we could not get the ball to her. So Rae bailed us
out, got the handoff, shuffled it to Frankie, and Frankie looked to attack and
shot the pull‑up.  
  
Q. Frankie, obviously there's not a whole lot you can do there. How did you
try to get something toward the rim on that?  
ATAIRA FRANKLIN: Yeah, I mean after it happens you think about all the things
that you could have done within that one second that was left once I passed
the ball in. But it was just tough. I mean Sarah was literally sandwiched. And
at that point like Coach B. said Rae bailed us out. We got a similar look to
what we were trying to get. Sometimes things just don't work out in your
favor.  
  
Q. You guys take lots of charges this year. From your vantage point where do
you think she was on that play?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: I couldn't see. I was blocked by everything. There was a
couple of things I'd like to watch the film and see, but I won't do it
tonight.  
Again, the calls happen. Calls don't happen. It's part of the game, I get it.
But, again, I thought we did everything ‑‑ the kids put themselves in such
great position to fight back and win that game.  
  
Q. Obviously beginning of second halves have plagued you guys in this last
month or so. When it started to happen again, I guess for all three of you,
was there any point that said, here we go again? What kind of clicked to stop
that bleeding and not let that happen again?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: I think part of it was going to the zone. When we got some
stops I felt like we relaxed. I told Frankie, I felt the game was 80 minutes
long. We've got plenty of time, we've got 9 minutes. I thought we did a good
job of executing. We only had 8 turnovers in the game. We really took care of
the ball. I thought for the most part trying to play fast when we needed to we
found great balance in that game.  
Coming off yesterday's game, Boston College made a push, we came back. Today
we were down, we made a push. I felt like that wasn't even in our psyche these
last two days.

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Brianna Kiesel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26443)

### [Asia Logan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26442)

### [Suzie McConnell-
Serio](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26441)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  72  
Pittsburgh ‑ 58

  
COACH SUZIE McCONNELL‑SERIO: You know, it's always tough to end your season
the way we did today. Everyone, except for one team ends their season on a
loss.  
But to come out and play the way we did was a little disappointing. We didn't
make enough plays offensively. We had good looks throughout the game. I think
fatigue became a factor. Wake Forest has Hamby, who we expected so much energy
defending her and Chelsea Douglas hit shots and other players made plays. You
have to respect everybody throughout the course of the game.  
They made plays and they picked us apart. We tried different defenses; man,
zone, press, match‑ups. At times we got stops. But credit Wake Forest, they
had a great game.  
It's always disappointing for the seniors to end their season. And despite
this being a tough year, with the number of wins and losses, I'm very proud of
this team and the effort that they continue to show and the growth and the
progress that we have shown over the course of this season. And feel that our
future is bright at Pitt and proud of what Asia Logan and Brianna Kiesel,
these two players have done, being our leaders score‑wise and on the floor,
what they have done for our team, and how far we have come over the course of
the season. I know it doesn't show in wins and losses, but we have come a long
way.  
  
Q. Suzie, did it feel like in the first half once you guys tied it up and
got your bearings a little bit when Chelsea Douglas hits those two 3s, did
that change the momentum a little bit, and how did you respond to that?  
COACH SUZIE McCONNELL‑SERIO: We had it tied at 24 and thought we were doing
what we needed to do defensively. And Marquel Davis and Chelsea had gotten in
trouble. And we were rotating people in and out. And had miscommunications,
and that's what Hamby does, when you're focusing on where she is, other
players end up open. We had some miscommunications and they had two big
threes. They went on a 10‑0 run, and we cut it to six, and then had a
possession at the end of the half. I would like for us to have pulled it out
and gone for one shot and maybe gotten a better look.  
We competed in the first half. And the first half I felt we got good looks. We
missed some layups, missed some open shots. And then in the second half almost
midway through the second half we started to self‑destruct. Some decision
making was suspect. But that's going to happen. When you miss shots, you can't
make mistakes at the other end, and they just continued to build on the lead.  
  
Q. You mentioned that second half. What sort of happened there? Did the ball
just start rolling for Wake Forest in the second half?  
COACH SUZIE McCONNELL‑SERIO: When we came out I thought we got a couple of
stops, mixing up our defenses, then we got down. They started to extend the
lead, and we went man and had breakdowns defensively. And we tried to double
team Hamby, at 6‑3, we're undersized. She's able to throw out of it. They're
getting layups. And I think we just got frustrated on the floor. And just our
mistakes just started to build one after another, and they were able to
stretch a run.  
Our players never quit. We continued to tack and play hard and fight to the
very end.  
  
Q. Hamby wasn't on the board for All ACC before the season started. What
makes her so tough to play?  
COACH SUZIE McCONNELL‑SERIO: I think her versatility. She's dangerous in the
high post area, you can't leave her open for shots. She has range to three.
You have to respect it. I don't think it's her bread and butter, but obviously
you have to respect it at three. You throw a double team at her, she finds
people. One‑on‑one I think she's very good. She's back to the basket. She can
face up, put the ball on the floor. She's long, athletic. She runs the floor
very, very well. You always have to be aware of her.  
And she has teammates like Douglas and their shooter, Calicott, that extends
defenses that it opens up things for her. And then she has a post presence
inside that takes the pressure off of her being the only post player on the
floor, where Asia is playing with four guards all the time makes it more
difficult.  
  
Q. Asia, I know coming off a loss, but can you reflect at all on four years
at Pitt and what your career has been like?  
ASIA LOGAN: At first I had an up and down, but with my team and my coaching
staff, they really helped me pull through, especially this last game. And it's
been a long ride. I wouldn't trade it in for anything.  
  
Q. Brianna, coming back next year, what progress has this team made in
Suzie's first year and what do you need to do to keep that going next year?  
BRIANNA KIESEL: She's a great coach. We had three conference wins, and the
last two I played in we had none. That's a step in the right direction. We are
undersized but did the best we could. I think coming in next year, you can
take the positives and bring them to next year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Erik Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24766)

### [Katie Zenevitch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26436)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  74  
Boston College ‑ 59

  
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: This was quite a year for us. We started out with a lot of
promise coming off of a really good performance here in Greensboro a year ago,
and returned with really good players, certainly like the player to my left,
Katie.  
And we really had a roller coaster of a year. We had a seven‑game winning
streak. We had some really good wins, but we weren't deep enough to deal with
some of the injuries and the things we had to deal with.  
Tonight playing without Kristen Doherty was tough. Katie Zenevitch has been a
great senior leader, but we're not at a point yet where we're quite deep
enough, talented enough, big enough, to withstand some of those things.
Kristen, by the way, is okay, she was too sick actually to even come on the
trip.  
But like I said, I'm so proud of the foundation that Katie and Kristen have
built in terms of just really, really caring about this program. She just
mentioned in the locker room about loving basketball again, finding that
passion. At a place like Boston College, we're going to win games because we
have smart kids who believe and who care, and are playing for something bigger
than themselves.  
To be able to have those young players here, Katie's passion and her love for
what we're doing and also pushing them for what the future is going to be, I
thought was really, really inspirational.  
  
Q. Did you think when Kristen first went down with the flu that she would be
able to play for this week? For those of us who haven't seen her play, where
did her absence affect you most?  
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: What's interesting about Kristen is the media at media day
called her the Swiss Army knife because she's got an attachment for
everything. She's a little bit of everything. She's our best defender. She's a
great rebounder, and leading assist maker and leading scorer.  
From a leadership standpoint, so much more falls on Katie's shoulders. Nicole
Boudreau stepped up in great ways. Kelly Hughes stepped up in great ways. But
look, when you're not really deep, it sort of bumps everybody up the ladder
once. Now somebody else is guarding the best player, our shooters had to
attack more themselves rather instead of being there and being the recipients
of some of the great passes that Kristen does.  
We beat Virginia without Kristen, believe it or not, when we played them
earlier the season. We got down 15, had a great comeback. These guys always
believe. And like I said, the woman sitting to my left has everything to do
with that. She works so hard and poured her sweat, blood, and tears into this
program. She's inspired her team to be able to play even beyond their
capabilities at times. We just didn't have enough tonight.  
  
Q. Did you think last week that she would be able to play?  
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: Katie will tell you, it's been a roller coaster through
the whole thing. She's had to deal with concussions, a back injury, and an
infection she got pretty sick from. Some of those symptoms have crossed each
other up. It's been day‑to‑day.  
But you know what, I think these guys do a great job of coming into practice
every single day and being ready, hey, who do we got. Nicole Boudreau has a
bad back, she doesn't practice sometimes. Katie actually missed senior night,
believe it or not, it's the only game she missed since I've been coaching her.  
But the team adjusted. We went out and battled with Maryland and got Katie
back in the lineup and she came to battle again.  
  
Q. Coach, you obviously were trying to get that run, but Virginia was
matching. When you're trying to get to that point Virginia was matching it.
What were you telling to your team to keep pressing on during the second
half?  
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: We went back to our last conference game was at Georgia
Tech, a similar thing happened, where we were getting some good offense going
and we were scoring, getting in transition. We couldn't get the stops when we
needed the stops.  
I thought our coverages were good, our communication was solid. When they
really wanted to go one‑on‑one, they made some big shots. We had a couple of
over‑helps, we gave up some 3s, and obviously they hit big ones.  
A lot of it has to do with Virginia, they did a great job. When you want to
win a game at that level you need to be able to score and get the stops. And
we couldn't get the stops when we needed them.  
  
Q. You talked about making the stops. Was that one back breaking, at the end
of the shot clock, Kelsey Wolfe banks from the 3 at the top of the key that
sprung them ahead, was that kind of a back breaker for you, because you had
that possession?  
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: There were a few of them. The 3 that Franklin hit at the
end of the half. She hit two in a row. We over‑helped a little bit off of her,
gave her another look. We had just hit a 3 to cut it to 4. You're going into
halftime with momentum, and now they hit a big one. You've got Wolfe's bank in
3 at the end.  
We've hit our share of those. That's part of basketball. We don't sweat that
stuff. The mental approach of these guys is really good in that way.  
  
Q. What's your best memories of playing for BC in the ACC and what's next
for you in basketball?  
KELSEY WOLFE: Best memories is just being with this group of girls every
single day. They become your sisters. We're together 24/7. Being in the locker
room, rooming with one another on away trips, even rooming at school with one
another. These are memories that I'm going to have for the rest of my life and
I'm so thankful for them.  
And the new coaching staff to come in and just to help me with personal things
and just basketball. And finding passion and love in it has been awesome. And
basketball, further basketball, we'll see, not a hundred percent sure yet.  
  
Q. They play a lot of four ‑guard lineups. How big was this rebounding No.
37 to 24 that they were able to beat you on the boards like that?   
COACH ERIK JOHNSON: We're a four‑guard lineup, too. It's a match‑up where
we're often giving up size, and they're often giving up size. It was a breath
of relief for both coaches to say we've got four guards and they have four
guards.  
Unfortunately, we out‑rebounded them and beat them at our place; they
out‑rebounded us and beat us tonight. The game does come down to often that
physical competition, who is going to grab the ball.  
There were a bunch of balls tonight that I felt like in live action I felt we
could have grabbed. They hustled, they got to it.  
We'll certainly break down the film and helping the returners with ways we can
get more of those rebounds. You have to give credit to Virginia, they went out
and got it when they needed it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Chelsea Douglas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26439)

### [Dearica Hamby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26440)

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  72  
Pittsburgh ‑ 58

  
COACH JEN HOOVER: We came here with one thing on our mind. We've been
preparing for this since July, and these two young ladies have obviously been
preparing for it for a lot longer than that.  
A lot of credit for Pitt, they are scrappy. They play with a lot of heart.
We've got a couple ‑‑ they're undersized, but they never really considered
themselves out of the game. Really proud of our team. We came in with a couple
of main goals, one was taking care of the ball, and the other was rebounding,
I felt like we did a great job with both of those.  
  
Q. How important was it to win by 14 points instead of having a game that
goes down to the buzzer? And also were you trying to rest Chelsea and Dearica
as much as you could during the game?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: I think it was important for us to be able to hold on to the
lead once we were able to push it out and not have a chance for them to ‑‑ we
knew they were going to keep coming back. We talked to the team about it.
They're not going to go away. It's March Madness, no team wants to pack their
bags and go home.  
Chelsea, she's coming off two days ago being sick and having a bottle and a
half of IV yesterday. We did come in trying to be a little concerned about
making sure she was not going to get dehydrated or worn out through her
period, so I think we did look to rest her a little bit more when we could.
That's something she's not very used to nor does she like it.  
  
Q. Have you noticed, did it change anything early on, the way they were
playing [inaudible]?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: We knew they were going to ‑‑ she draws a lot of attention
obviously. We knew coming out of the game that we were able to execute a few
plays, particularly in a lot of different ways. We knew we were going to have
to run some different action, and I thought our kids did a great job hitting
her on the move some early, which I think was critical for us, not just
leaving her down low, and getting beat up the whole game, if you will, but
being able to get her on the move.  
But they're quick and athletic, and they were undersized. But I think they
played with a lot of heart and Coach Suzie does a great job with them. We knew
it was going to be a battle.  
  
Q. How important is this tournament to you, Chelsea?  
CHELSEA DOUGLAS: I wanted to keep playing as long as I could. And I was
playing to win.  
  
Q. Dea, how important was it for you after getting named to the All ACC
First Tournament to possibly make a statement?  
DEARICA HAMBY: [Inaudible.]  
  
Q. What did you do better than when you first played there?  
DEARICA HAMBY: Moved the ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contribution you got on the boards from Kandice
and also Jill?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: I thought both of those were huge for us at different
moments. We kind of challenged Jill a little bit halftime. Felt like she was
not giving us as much on the boards and cutting‑wise, but felt she was doing a
great job in the back of the zone and in concepts defensively.  
I thought Kandice's rebounds were huge for us. And the 4‑minute period she put
together on the floor. And again, I think some of it is just the
workinprogress as we come along. She's gotten more and more comfortable. And
against a team like that that's smaller and athletic, she was able to give us
some huge minutes, as well.  
  
Q. Chelsea, in the first half right after they tied it up you had a couple
of 3s in a row, did your eyes sort of light up when you got those shots?  
CHELSEA DOUGLAS: It was pretty good, it helped give us the momentum. And,
yeah, it definitely gave ‑‑ made my eyes light up. If I see a few going down,
it's pretty much going up.  
  
Q. You get to play North Carolina, Coach. First time you played them you
were with them 33, 34 minutes. What do you need to do tomorrow to stay the
whole game?  
COACH JEN HOOVER: We have to get some rest and get off our legs. And get a
good meal at Pastabilities, one of our favorite places in town. Carolina has a
lot of quickness and athleticism. We have to play the entire 40 minutes. We
have to earn it and earn it on every single possession. And I think tomorrow
the two big things: We have to be able to take care of the ball and take care
of the rebounds, I think those two will be crucial for tomorrow night.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Nikki Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26428)

### [Nyilah Jamison-Myers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26429)

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Clemson  69  
Virginia Tech ‑ 56

  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: First of all, I want to give a lot of credit to Virginia
Tech, thought they played a very, very great game. And definitely accolades to
my team and how they came out in the first half. They played with a huge sense
of urgency. A dire sense of the fact that they were not ready to go home and
they were going to give all they had and they did.  
I felt like our defense is what catapulted us into playing such a
well‑balanced game. I was happy with how well they played, and how hard they
play. As I told them, we had to get it done on the defensive end, and we also
had to make sure that we rebounded very well. I'm definitely proud of the fact
that they came out with a lot of sense of urgency, enthusiasm and put
everything they had in them today.  
  
Q. After losing to Virginia Tech so decisively last week, what does it mean
to turn the tables and win this game so decisively, and how do you explain the
turnaround?  
NIKKI DIXON: I think that today, tonight we played with like revenge, and
that's the biggest thing, is that we can't let a team pound on us twice, it's
not going to happen. We worked too hard.  
NYILAH JAMISON‑MYERS: I also feel like we were ready for this game. We kind of
helped with the practice. We were really into it. Like the whole team was into
it. We felt what the coaches feel, what they put into the game. We put all
that into the game. You want to come out with a win, you don't want to fall
short.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked yesterday about the job that Ugoka and Panousis did,
they scored 36 points last time, and you held them to 2 points today. What
about the job you did defensively?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: You have to give credit to these guys, give them a pat on
the back in terms of the scouting report. We put the onus on them and do the
scouting report and how they were going to defend them. They both had big
games against us.  
So their whole focus was anytime there was a ball screen they were going to
make sure they limited touches as much as possible and they were in their
face.  
Ugoka, the biggest thing they wanted to play off of her and allow her to be a
jump shooter. And that allowed her to get penetration to the baskets and also
limit her touches. It was a team effort. They did a really, really good team
effort.  
I asked, What do you want, to go 2‑3 or want to go man? I'm a players' coach.
They're on the court and they know what they're comfortable with and what they
feel like they can be successful with, they did a good job of keying in and
making sure that they weren't ‑‑ they didn't have as great of a night against
us at Virginia Tech.  
  
Q. How about offensive, what did you do better than last week?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: We executed better. We went to an offense, a couple of
offense where we utilized a lot of ball screens. They had problems with us,
when we start utilizing our ball screen, playing 2‑man game action, we got to
the basket a lot. We got some things inside. We did not get the ball inside
well enough down there when we played them.  
We did a good job. We were patient. We took care of the ball a lot better than
we did the first time. And we made shots. That's the key, when you make shots,
then it takes a lot of pressure off of you, and you can set up your defense
and play defense.  
I felt like everybody was in it, all their eyes were focused on me. Everybody
was focused. I could feel their energy. When I know they're in tune to what's
going on, I know we have a great chance of coming out with a victory.  
  
Q. You had a career high today with 19 points. Can you just talk about what
that means to you and also to have it happening in the ACC tournament here.  
NYILAH JAMISON‑MYERS: I feel like all season I've been trying to work on my
consistency. And I feel like it was be there, whatever you need to do, be
there. I'm just happy that I could finish with the free throws today.  
  
Q. Ugoka went to the bench with the two quick fouls, and with her out, you
built that 21 ‑6 lead, that was it, game over. Can you talk about once she
went to the bench how you were able to take advantage of the situation and you
could take control of the game.   
COACH AUDRA SMITH: She's such an offensive threat. That took a lot of pressure
off us defensively. Not to take anything against the other kids on the floor,
they're very good players, as well. We didn't have to spend as much energy
doubling on her and that took pressure off of us on the defensive end. We
didn't have to focus on as many offensive threats.  
Then offensively for us, we were able to execute a lot better. She's a strong
kid inside, she's a strong defender. We were able to finish around the basket.
That was key to get her in foul trouble and get her out of the game and make
other people have to step up and contribute.  
We did a really good job on the other players that came off the bench, that
were on the floor and we did not allow them to get involved.  
That's always part of our pregame speech, as well, is the fact that great
players, you're not going to be able to shut them down completely, but you can
contain them. But role players and players that are coming off the bench, you
have to limit them. You can't let them get six or eight points, it makes up
for the points you're taking away from the star players.  
  
Q. It's been a few years since this program has won a game here at the ACC
tournament. What does that mean to each of you to have one under your belts?  
NIKKI DIXON: It means everything in the world to this program, period, because
we have such an awesome fan base and awesome families that come in and help
and support us. And they're there at Littlejohn every night when we play. It
means a lot because we can give back to them.  
We had a good fan base that came all the way from Clemson. We want to make our
fans, like we appreciate them, and we want to give them back for all the
coming to our games. It means a lot for this team, period, because of all the
adversity we have faced since I've been here three years, and to our seniors,
I know that they're jumping for joy right now. This is the start of a change.
And that's the biggest thing is change.  
  
Q. Coach and Nikki, just looking forward to tomorrow. You guys played really
well back in January. I think you had 19. What's got to improve just a little
bit from that game to have a chance tomorrow?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: I agree. I felt like we played 37 minutes of really good
basketball. And then the last 3 minutes was just ‑‑ I felt like Brittney Sykes
woke up. And that was it for us.  
But I feel like for us, again, it's going to be on the defensive end. They
have some really good threats from the outside to the inside. But for us, we
have to ‑‑ we've got to get some rest. We're limited in terms of our numbers,
we have to get some rest. We have to be focused tomorrow, we have to be ready
to defend. And I've been in tournament situations quite a bit, and people
always ask, Would you rather have the buy, would you rather play the first
day? And I think playing the first day is really good. You get all the kinks
out. You get accustomed to the floor, you get accustomed to the rims and
everything. So you get the juices kind of flowing.  
So I feel for us the biggest thing we're going to have to do tomorrow is to
defend, we're going to have to limit touches, and finish around the basket. We
did a good job of finishing. There were layups we missed. We have to make sure
we have the opportunities around the rim that we finish.  
NIKKI DIXON: Basically what she said. We played well, really well against
Syracuse. We were there, we were in it a hundred percent. We just have to
limit Briana Butler and Sykes, and contain the post players, and it's our
game, anyone's game to win, this is why the tournament is so exciting. Whoever
shows up is who wins. That's what we're looking forward to tomorrow. Showing
up and being there a hundred percent. If we go out there, we give it
everything we've got we should get after them.  
  
Q. What helped you guys dominate on the boards and especially the first
half?  
COACH AUDRA SMITH: Well, I felt like when Nikki was a significant factor with
12 rebounds, and that's what we've been telling the girls the whole year is
they have to rebound down rather than watching the action. As post players,
you're down there boxing out, bumping and grinding and trying to get a tip on
it. And she did a good job of grasping the rebound.  
So I felt like it was a good team effort. We made a conscious effort to box
out and to limit them to one and done. What did they end up with, 8 offensive
rebounds, but I felt like we played a couple of those came out of ‑‑ a couple
came off the free throw line. We made a conscious effort of boxing out, take
the toughest contested shot and find a way to come up with the rebound.  
  
Q. Building on what coach just said, they have really dominated the post in
the last game on you. As one of the big girls on the team, what was the
mindset like for you guys coming into the game and the key to sort of flipping
that script around?  
NYILAH JAMISON‑MYERS: We were just telling the guards, we can box the post
out, they have to come and get the rebound, it's not about numbers, as long as
we get the ball. We want the guards to come down and pick it up, because it's
just open space.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Kelsey Conyers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26431)

### [Uju Ugoka](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26430)

### [Dennis Wolff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24772)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Clemson  69  
Virginia Tech ‑ 56

  
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: I'd like to congratulate Clemson, first, I think that they
had a better approach to the game. It's disappointing on our end, but I
thought their team rebounded from what happened last week and came after the
game the right way. So congratulations to them.  
Secondly, we picked a bad time to play our bad game. And it would be tough for
me to sit down and look at it from a basketball standpoint. There were things
that were done the way we normally could do them. I'm proud of our seniors,
proud of Uju and Monet, they carried themselves great. I'm disappointed.  
  
Q. After winning against Clemson so decisively last week, how surprised are
you to have the exact opposite to lose so decisively in the rematch today, and
how do you explain that turnaround?  
UJU UGOKA: Definitely we were not prepared tonight. We didn't come out with
the right effort like they did.  
KELSEY CONYERS: I don't think that necessarily that was the reason for the
outcome of the game. Coach warned us all weekend that we were going to have to
come in forgetting that and play as hard as we did. So I don't think that's
the reason for the outcome at all. I think that all of us came in knowing that
they're a good team. They've had some good wins. But we just didn't carry out
our offense or defensive principles as well as we should have.  
  
Q. How do you explain from last week to this week, the big turnaround in
scores?  
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: Well, you know, I think that there's always going to be a
little advantage to the team, if the teams are relatively close, there's going
to be a little advantage on a game like that. And I thought they would be able
to focus their team a little bit better.  
So I want to credit Audra, again, for what she did. I'm just disappointed. We
had a bad start to the game, and that really hurt us. We got in foul trouble.
We missed open shots. And that got us to lose our composure. So I did the best
job I could, but I didn't probably do a good enough job of trying to impress
on the kids that this could happen if we didn't approach it the right way.  
  
Q. Dennis, you outscored them from the field. I wonder if you feel you sent
them to line too much, you fouled too much or is that just a reflection of
fouling at the end?  
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: No, I think we were fouling them way too much during the
game. I think that we didn't ‑‑ we put ourselves in some bad positions.
They're not a great outside shooting team. So we didn't manage the ball
screens the right way. And then we didn't rebound the ball. The first game
they got five or six offensive rebounds, and it says they got nine, I thought
the first half they got way too many second chances.  
We fouled them. It's not like we could say we didn't foul them. We gave them
an opportunity to get points that way, which is not a good thing for any team.  
  
Q. Uju picked up those two quick fouls and went to the bench. And by the
time she went back in the game they were up 21 ‑6\. How much of that, not
having Uju in the game, early in the game like that, how much does that change
the whole outcome of the game?   
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: Well, obviously we needed Uju in the game. My coaching
philosophy throughout my career is you want to manage the fouls the best you
can in the first half. So historically for me when somebody has two fouls I
end up taking them out. We've gone against that a few times this year. We got
out of the first half without Uju having a third foul. But having a third
foul, we're not, as a team, constituted well enough to not have any one of
these kids available. If we're having to sit somebody for a long time we end
up finding ourselves in a bad position.  
  
Q. For everyone, did they defend you any differently this time around than
last week? What made it a tough shooting game for you guys?  
KELSEY CONYERS: No, I think they guarded us, for the most part, the same
during the match‑up. They did play a little bit more out on us, taking away a
lot of the outside shots, and they played a little bit more man than their
match‑up zone, but overall it was similar to the other game.  
UJU UGOKA: Same thing, it was similar to the other game. They were just more
aggressive. And it was like more aggressive, but they played us the same way.  
  
Q. What was the effect of their defense today?  
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: I think it's half and half. I think that they played good
defense, I don't want to take anything away from them, but we had a lot of
open shots. And this kind of mirrored Sunday at Maryland, where we missed
shots that appeared to be open. And it really rattled our confidence in some
of the girls. I think more than it should.  
  
Q. Here you are one and done again. How surprising or frustrating is it to
once again be going home on the first day?  
COACH DENNIS WOLFF: I don't want to say it's surprising. It's disappointing.
We're disappointed. The girls ‑‑ this is Uju's second ACC tournament, Kelsey
was hurt last year, so the history of it for them is just ‑‑ but for the
program, there's no question we're disappointed today. I have to kind of think
about where we're at. Because I told the girls in the locker room I thought
for the most part they worked extremely hard throughout the season. They gave
us a lot of really good games. And we just picked the worst day to play
arguably our worst game. I'm going to take full responsibility for that.

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Ataira Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26435)

### [Kelsey Wolfe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26434)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia  74  
Boston College  59

  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Just excited to get our first win down here. It's all
about advancing. I thought the team for the most part we played a pretty
well‑rounded game on both ends of the floor. I was excited about that. We
played team basketball, which is what we've been working towards. It's nice to
get our first win.  
  
Q. Kelsey, it was an 11 ‑point game with about 6 1/2 minutes left. Maybe BC
looked like they were going to come back again on you guys. You throw up that
bank sink, kind of take us through that. And how big was that maybe a sign
that you were going to finish it out?   
KELSEY WOLFE: I think that was a big sign. The shot clock was going down. I
think I was 3 feet off the 3‑point line and I just shot it, it went it, banked
in. Bre said on the bench that she called the bank for me, so that's probably
why it went in.  
  
Q. Ataira, could you talk about that stretch, 19 points in about 9 or 10
minutes between the first and second halves.  
ATAIRA FRANKLIN: I think I started the game 0 for Wednesday, and Coach Cory
told me, I think you want it too much, just let the game come to you. I think
I got more into the flow of the game, especially defensively getting tips and
steals, and running the transition with my teammates, I think the game started
to come to me a little easier.  
  
Q. How proud are you that you did finish this one out, it wasn't even a
squeaker? They got within about 9 with a minute and a half left. How proud are
you that you closed it out?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, we talked about it. And they've had our number a
little bit. It's nice to get down. Like I said, when you're in a tournament
everybody's record is null and you're coming in to advance as much as you can
throughout the tournament. For us to put a pretty complete game together,
obviously it's going to build our confidence. It's nice to play team ball when
you get W's.  
  
Q. Could you talk about playing BC after that previous game where you
probably thought you were going to win that one, and blowing the big lead in
that game. Was there any kind of revenge? Did they have more of your attention
after having done that the first time?  
KELSEY WOLFE: Yeah, I think so, and I know the last season our first
tournament was against BC and we lost against them. We knew we had to come out
and really execute down the stretch and just take care of what we could take
care of and execute our game plan.  
  
Q. Coach, in playing that inside/outside game and really getting the shots
when you needed it, was that something that was key, that you had to do
against this team that really more or less plays from the perimeter and was
struggling?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, we changed our offense a little bit and I thought it
freed up our guards to get better looks. We got some touches inside. We
finished. We got to the free throw line.  
I thought overall our offensive flowed better. We missed some chippies and
missed some easy pull‑ups. But I liked the flow of what we were doing just
based on how they were playing us.  
  
Q. There were some patterns developing again, Sarah's early fouls. Did you
like the way you handled the rest of that half without her, and her
discipline, she comes out on the floor and no fouls the rest of the game?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Yes, we've been playing a lot of first halves without
Sarah I. And we talked about keeping her in the game. I thought she was a lot
more disciplined. And she wanted the ball. And it's always nice ‑‑ I thought
we might have to go with our small lineup tonight, completely small, we
didn't. And I thought Syd and Sarah Beth both came in and gave us a few
minutes here and there, and that let us rest her. And we went with our typical
four‑guard lineup. We got a lot of different looks tonight and everybody
contributed.  
  
Q. No secret that you don't have one of the tallest teams, how important is
it that you out ‑rebound them 37‑24?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: We talked about attention to detail. And I think in the
last game they out‑rebounded us by a few. And that was a team that was minus 6
on the boards. That was one of our focal points tonight. We were going to do
everything not to give them second‑chance points, and I thought we did a great
job of paying attention to that detail.  
  
Q. How does it feel to win? You guys have lost four in a row, six of seven.
Just what does that do for you confidence ‑wise, and kind of look ahead
tomorrow against a Georgia Tech team?  
ATAIRA FRANKLIN: I think that right now we understand how essential it is to
really lock in and execute in these games. It's literally do or die for us. We
love playing together and these are the last games we'll get to play together
as a team. I think everyone is eager and excited and hungry to finish out the
season strong.  
KELSEY WOLFE: What she said is good.  
  
Q. What was the difference midway through the second half when you look at
some of your other games? Was it just attention to detail?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, we got some stops. We got some crucial stops. Where
we've struggled it's either we're not getting stops or we have a lull in
offense. I thought both ends of the floor were pretty complete tonight.  
But when we had to get stops I felt we did, that was big for us. Even when we
weren't scoring every time down the floor. I thought we did a nice job
offensive, but ultimately rebounding and getting crucial stops was important.  
  
Q. You talked about leading up to this about how your seniors are going to
be accountable for how you finish this thing. Kelsey gets two huge 3s there to
stretch it out. And Franklin the huge lip going into halftime. How crucial
were these two in taking accountability?  
COACH JOANNE BOYLE: They were. And that's the great thing about seniors, you
want them to go out in a tournament like this and carry what they need to
carry, and they did that tonight. They've been here before, they're familiar
with this.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  74  
West Virginia  71

  
KIM MULKEY: I want to first compliment West Virginia. We just beat a team that
is very good. Why they have my respect is not just because they're very
talented, they play defense, and they play man‑to‑man, hard‑nosed aggressive
defense, and I think the job Mike Carey does with that team is impressive.
They have five or six seniors on that team, two of them fifth‑year seniors. We
just battled. It had to be an excellent game for television, for the Big 12
Conference, and I want to tell Odyssey, breaking a record in one year with
this young bunch speaks volumes for what she's done for our basketball team
this year and our program, and I couldn't be happier for her.  
  
Q. Niya, as Julie said, her high is 10. What got into you tonight?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Being in attack mode and just come out there focused from the
start until the end, just trying to contribute with the team and just getting
involved on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Niya, can you just kind of take us through that final play?  
NIYA JOHNSON: I tried to make a turn in the backcourt to waste time, and then
I tried not to foul when she shot the three, and I just had to play smart.  
KIM MULKEY: We discussed in a time‑out, do you foul there, because a lot of
people do. Or do you take your chances that they've got to make a spectacular
shot, and that's when you look at your seniors, Makenzie, and you look at
Odyssey and you say what do y'all want to do? That's showing ownership of your
team, and they didn't want to foul there and put hem at the foul line and
Odyssey's remark was, Coach, we're going to play defense right here because if
they intentionally miss the second shot and then they hit a three, they beat
us. The worst it can do is go to overtime. So that decision quite honestly was
left up to seniors.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you just talk about how big these underclassmen were in the
first half when you had to sit down on the bench?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I think my team did a very good job of keeping their intensity
up and made a quick run, and they stayed after it. We never gave up when they
made some runs. They're big. The freshman class is a very big group, their
young but at the same time they grew up quick. They did a very good in this
situation. They didn't foul. They didn't give up easy buckets. What more can
you ask for? They played their role and did very good.  
  
Q. Odyssey, the shot you made to put them ahead, put your team ahead there,
can you kind of walk us through that, and you had that shot last Sunday in
Waco, it was a little bit different but you had a chance in that game, too.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I was just very focused coming off. I knew we had to get ‑‑ not
a quick shot, but just a good looking shot, not a poor shot, not a bad shot.
Ball was in my hands, I came off the screen, knew they weren't going to let me
penetrate, I didn't want to run over anybody. I jumped up and shot and I made
it.  
  
Q. Most girls might not even win one championship in their career. You've
won four conference championships, four tournament championships. Put that
into words, describe that?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It means a lot. I think the group that just left, give credit to
them. They're a very good group. We dominated the first three years with them,
and being the underdog going into the season, I think our team handled it very
well. We kept playing, I didn't expect us to win as many games as we did, but
we kept fighting. Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't win any
games.  
Give credit to our bench players. I think they come in, they gave us the spark
that we needed when our starters weren't doing anything.  
  
Q. Odyssey, eight days ago that loss to West Virginia, really a heartbreaker
for you especially. What are you feeling right now emotionally right now?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just feels great. It feels good to win another championship. I'm
happy for my team. Just happy.  
  
Q. Nina, coming into the year as Coach said before, you were not the most
heralded of the freshman group. Coming into the year did you ever expect that
you would be the Big 12 Tournament MVP, and how does that feel?  
NINA DAVIS: Coming into the year it definitely wasn't my focus so I didn't
expect I would be where I am now and getting MVP, but it's just a feeling that
I can't describe. First of all, I owe it all to God, my teammates and my
coaches, and without them it wouldn't be possible, and I'm just blessed.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you talked about it, you give credit to that group of seniors
that won so many. Does this one almost mean more to you because all those guys
are gone and you won it with a very young group?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Not necessarily. I think just winning is very important. I guess
you can say just winning it four times, we've got a good group. I like this
team. They're exciting to be around, and no matter what we're going to keep
battling. We've got a team full of warriors, and I like it.  
  
Q. Kim, kind of what Jerry just said to Odyssey: Because of everything you
lost but everything this team has done, you've talked about how much you love
this team. Tonight was a grind, you've talked about the grind. Was this more
special than some of the other ones?  
KIM MULKEY: I'll never tell you that any team is more special than the other
or any championship means more. They're all special in their own way.  
What makes this particular team special is I'm not sure what the expectations
were for this basketball team this year. I couldn't tell you at the beginning
of the season what I thought they should be. I knew we had Odyssey Sims, I
knew what she was capable of doing, but I didn't know about anybody else
around her. I knew that we had a bunch of hungry players that wanted their
opportunity to play and they patiently waited their turn, and then as the
season progressed and we scheduled the right games and the right teams in
non‑conference to let them grow, I had an opportunity to see a team that's
good, and I think that everybody now sees that as good as Odyssey is, we're
pretty good when she's not on that floor, too.  
We won another conference title, and then we won another tourney title, and
let's hope in the NCAAs we get a good seed and see if we can't go pretty deep
in the tournament.  
But they're all special. I don't ever take them for granted. In this business,
it's a cold business. Coaches get fired this time of year. I'm as good as
those kids in that locker room, as good as those coaches that recruit for me,
and you keep it in perspective. You're excited, and as I said, one day you'll
look back and go, wow, we made a pretty good run there, six out of the last 10
tourney championships; that's hard to do.  
  
Q. Could you have ever imagined that you would have gotten 19 points from
Niya tonight?  
KIM MULKEY: I know you guys don't believe this, but she scored 50 points in a
high school ballgame. Niya can score, she just has a point guard's mentality:
Pass first, score second. But as you're seeing, Niya has to score for us, and
when she does we're a better basketball team, and it's because of the way
we're guarded. We are guarded so different than just say a man‑to‑man or a
zone. There's always little freak defenses that we see.  
Now, West Virginia, just a period of time there he might have gone to a
triangle‑and‑two, but he plays you about as much man as anybody in the league.
But we have to adjust and we have to make changes, and sometimes we do become
stagnant out there offensively. But Niya can score. She just has to do it
more, and as you see, she did it tonight.  
Her clutch free throws, her clutch free throws down the stretch, I've been on
Niya all year to shoot the shot and to be a better free‑throw shooter, and
it's just good to see that when you tell a player something they go work on it
and they get to perform in a game and they get to see why you tell them those
things.  
  
Q. When did Niya, when was she ready for this kind of a game?  
KIM MULKEY: I think she got some minutes in that group last year. She and
Prince got minutes in some big games. We went to UConn, and I saw Niya in the
UConn game there last year really deliver the ball to players at the right
time, and I thought, this kid is going to be good.  
As you think about the future of your program and the changes that you're
going to have to make offensively, I knew then I had to have both Niya and
Odyssey on the floor together. She just directs traffic for you. She has a
knack for pushing the ball up the floor, a knack for getting it to the right
people, and giving them passes that they can do something with.  
But yeah, she can score. You don't score 50 in high school if you can't score.  
  
Q. The game in Waco was described as a street fight. First of all, did you
think it was kind of similar today, and is this kind of maybe a rivalry
getting started with West Virginia, and was it satisfying to beat a team that
you guys had to share with them, maybe prove you guys don't like sharing?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, yeah, it's like I said when we played them in Waco, they
shot 50 percent on us, and the only other team in the last I don't know how
many games that's ever done that, we lost that game, as well, and it was
Stanford. The difference was in the Stanford game we didn't have a shot at the
end and the ball in our hands to win it and a one‑point lead, and basically in
Waco, I mean, guys, we're supposed to win it, we have the ball in our hands
with 35 seconds to go, and isn't it ironic that the same scenario happened
today with maybe 31 seconds, 32, I don't remember exactly, but I just laughed,
and Odyssey gave the ball up to Niya and stayed in the middle of the floor.
And that's what I told her, just stay in the middle of the floor.  
I don't know that it's a rivalry with West Virginia any more than any other of
the other Texas schools that are in our conference or really any of the other
schools that are in our conference. I think what makes it exciting is it was a
good game. It was a good game, and people want to see good basketball, and I
thought today you saw good defense. I thought you saw great players on the
floor, and I thought you saw role players basically probably were the
difference in their team.  
Bussie was a concern of ours. I challenged our team to hold her under 10 shot
attempts, and she gets 4. But yet then you see a Bria Holmes hit 19 at the
half and we had to hold her to five in the second half. You see a Niya
Johnson, when Odyssey and Nina got in foul trouble, KK, Khadijiah Cave, was
big. She needs to be written about. She got some big offensive rebounds in
there and got to the foul line. Didn't make them all, but she was big for us
when Nina was in foul trouble.  
  
Q. You talked about KK, and she came up big during that stretch, but you
guys got down five. Talk about the way you were able to answer because West
Virginia was kind of on a roll.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, there was a time‑out, and I'm pretty transparent. What you
see is what you get, and I was on them hard in the time‑out. I thought we were
being manhandled, I thought we were being pushed around, I thought that we
were being punched, and we didn't punch back. It was less Xs and Os being said
in that time‑out. There was more motivating and just trying to get up in them
and tell them, you need to woman up here, you need to get up there and you
need to bow your neck and make some defensive stops.  
And, you know, that's easy to say to a senior group. It's hard to say to a
young group because in their mind they are giving you all they have, but
sometimes they're just physically out‑manned. So you're trying to really,
really dig deep right there, and I think that it was more of that in the
time‑out than there was anything to draw up.  
  
Q. Coming back to that last play, to foul or not to foul, is that a decision
that you typically make ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: No‑‑ yeah, I typically make the decision.  
  
Q. And what would you have done in that situation?  
KIM MULKEY: Odyssey answered it beautifully. You know, there's times in your
coaching where you want those seniors to have some ownership, and I knew that
what I was going to tell them to do, but I wanted to see what they said, and
in fact, the coaches and I had talked about it before I went in there. I went
in there and I asked them, here's a scenario, you're up three. A lot of
coaches believe in fouling and putting them at the line, you're going to get
the ball back, and they just looked at me and then for a split second, Odyssey
said, no, Coach, no, you've always said what if they miss the second one and
they hit a three and we lose. The worst we can do is go overtime, and you like
to hear them take ownership.  
Had she said foul, I probably would have overruled for sure, but I think that
you make them feel like this is our victory. This is our senior year. We won't
ever play another Big 12 game. It was just good for our conference. That was a
good game.  
  
Q. When Odyssey went to the bench, we got a glimpse into the future. A lot
of coaches don't like to play freshmen because of some of the dumb mistakes
they make, but why do you have so much confidence in this young group that
seems to play big, and somebody comes up big game after game after game?  
KIM MULKEY: Because they're good. They're good. I don't think you realize how
good they are because Makenzie and Odyssey are having good senior years and
Sune is having a good junior year. But I'm just telling you those kids on that
bench that aren't getting the minutes that those upperclassmen are, you saw
what they did when Odyssey was sitting over there. They share the basketball,
they trust each other.  
And also, too, you can run things believe it or not, when your All‑American is
not in there, you can run things a little bit smoother because they're jump
defensing you or we're trying to let Odyssey do too much. It just runs a
little bit smoother sometimes.  
I think you saw that tonight.  
  
Q. I know you said earlier that once you got into the schedule you knew that
this was a good team, but I think there are a lot of people that still see
this team in Brittney Griner's shadow. Do you think that winning this Big 12
championship is maybe validation to the outside world that this is the new
Baylor team that we have to worry about?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, I don't. Anybody that knows basketball knows the history
of this program now. You know, there's no one that's in Brittney Griner's
shadow. There's no one that's in Sophia Young's shadow. We've had lots of Big
12 Player of the Years, we've had national championships. This is Baylor
women's basketball.  
We don't look at it that way. I don't know that the true women's basketball
fan looks at it that way. I think maybe when the season started they were
curious to see if we'd be any good, so maybe that question was answered. But I
have to believe that people know how much we love women's basketball and they
know that we're going to recruit hard and we're going to play hard and we're
going to be somebody to be reckoned with year in and year out.  
  
Q. I know you say that no championship means more to you, but this being
Makenzie's last hurrah, as a coach and as a mom what does this mean to you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, she got a little emotional on me today, and actually when
you know your child, you know she's hurting, you try to change the subject.
You know, when you raise children and they get cranky and emotional or
something, you change the subject real quick and you try to direct their
attention elsewhere, and there was a time there when she got hit pretty hard
two or three times and hit her head, and I know when her head is hit, I see
that look on her face, and I thought, oh, boy, is this concussion time,
because I've seen it before, and I could tell her nose squinches up and she's
about to cry.  
So I kind of diverted attention and just got on her, just made her mad at me,
just don't let her go into that my head is killing me, I can't finish this
game. And I saw that tonight and she goes right back out there and takes
another charge and doesn't get the call and then she takes another charge. So
it was trying to make her understand we can take care of you later.  
You know, and then after the game she was real emotional. When you're a senior
and you take that uniform off for the last time, there's no feeling like that.
And she knows her days are numbered, and she knows that she has given us
everything she can both as a teammate, patiently waiting her turn, and then
taking an opportunity and running with it, and she was real emotional after
the game, and I just hugged her and kissed her, like I would any of them that
are emotional because you're just happy. Those are tears of joy.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  74  
West Virginia  71

  
MIKE CAREY: Well, first of all, congratulations to Baylor. You know, we wish
them only a lot of luck in the NCAAs.  
Second of all, our girls played extremely hard. We had a one‑point lead with a
minute to go and just didn't execute, and then we go down to the other side
and then didn't score and then come down to the other side and didn't execute
again. But both teams played extremely hard. There was runs. We were up five
at one time in the second half, so there was runs both ways.  
I thought the difference for them was Johnson, to be honest with you, and then
right there at the end we let her refuse a screen and hit a baseline jumper
when we were up one. We took some shots in my opinion, some bad shots that we
normally don't take. We got in a hurry. They did a great job sagging in on
Bussie, and Asya, I felt she was a little bit tired today, people pounding on
her and banging her and pushing her and shoving her now for three days, so I
thought Asya, she did a great job, but she was a little bit tired, couldn't
move.  
We had her open at times, we didn't get her the ball, and at times we didn't
throw the ball where it should have been.  
Overall I told the players, remember how this feels because the next time
going down the stretch, we've got to execute. We normally have executed well
going down the stretch. Today we just‑‑ we had a couple shots, missed them,
and then defensively is where I was really disappointed, we didn't execute and
get some stops.  
  
Q. Averee, second half it seemed like you guys came out with the mindset on
offense to really drive the ball at them. Was that one of the messages at
halftime to really be aggressive going to the basket?  
AVEREE FIELDS: Yeah, I think we played a little bit tentative the first half,
so second half Coach Carey just told us to play our game to do what we
normally do and so I think we came out with a lot of energy and wanted to play
the way we normally do. We like running up and down the floor, so we tried to
do that more the second half.  
  
Q. Bria, you picked up, I think, two fouls there within like a minute, and
it all came about so quick. Is it hard not to let that affect your play there?
Do you have to go about things a little differently at that point?  
BRIA HOLMES: I just have to play smart and just have my teammates talk to me
about it and just play smart for the rest of the game. I picked up a third
foul real quick, too, and Coach Carey sat me down. I just had to play smart
and let me teammates talk to me and keep my head focused.  
  
Q. Asya, the game in Waco, I guess, eight days ago was kind of described as
a street fight. Was this game similar to that as far as it seemed there wasn't
much margin between you guys and you guys were just going at it the whole
game?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, I think it was very similar from the game in Waco, it was
just fighting the entire game. I think Sune said it on the court that it was
very similar and we were tailing a couple times, and we just didn't execute
down the stretch, we didn't defend, and the outcome was just different.  
  
Q. Asya, did they do anything differently here than what they had done in
the previous two games? I know you really scored a lot maybe in the Waco game
or the one at West Virginia?  
ASYA BUSSIE: They might have sagged a little bit more but I think it was
pretty much the same, just having their point guard kind of off and sagging a
little more in the paint. I think that was the only difference, but pretty
similar.  
  
Q. Averee, I know obviously this one stings, but you've got to put this one
behind you. It's a whole new season starting next week. Do you think that's
going to be something that this veteran team can do?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think yes. I think tonight we'll feel the loss a little bit,
but we just have to learn from it. Our season is not over, and we want to make
a good run in the NCAA Tournament, so we have to put it behind us. We have to
move on from wins and we have to move on from losses. So I think that we'll
get back together, get focused in practice, and we'll be ready for the
tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, you guys, I think, were down one, you guide lobbed it into Asya and
Sims kind of came backside and knocked it in. Was that the play you were
looking for?  
MIKE CAREY: We was looking for a little bit of high‑low, but if it's not
there, it's not there. We went ahead and threw it. I think she did knock it
and Asya thought it was off her, and if we'd have just let the ball go out of
bounds it probably would have been our ball.  
I thought we had a good trap right there at the end of the game, and then a
foul was called. But I thought we had them right where we wanted them at the
end of the game right there.  
To answer whoever's question was about sagging, they were sagging their 4,
too. That's why Averee Fields was open a lot at the top. Sims was just
cheating in there and then they were sagging their 4 there on Asya plus the
big girl on Asya. They bottled her up a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, Odyssey had scored, I think she had averaged like 43 in the first
two games. Did you do anything differently on her or was it just her missing
shots?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, she only took 14, so normally she takes a lot more shots
than that. I think, like I said earlier, I think Johnson and their 4 player,
Davis, I mean, was taking some shots. I mean, normally they don't get as many
shots as they'd get. But we did a good job defensively at times. Our rotation
in the first half was not good, was not good, and they made an adjustment from
our game right there where we would rotate our 4 over, but our outside guard
was not rotating on their 4, and they got‑‑ the first half it looked like they
were getting mostly lay‑ups on the block, and then I thought the second half
we did a better job.  
  
Q. During spring break this week what are your plans for the team?  
MIKE CAREY: We'll give them off a couple days and then get back to work. We'll
give them off, what is today, Monday? We'll give them off Tuesday and
Wednesday and then get back to work on Thursday.  
  
Q. The play where Sims hit the jumper to give them the lead, was that what
you were talking about when she refused the screen there?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, she did it and then Davis did it. There's no reason to do
that to let them refuse it because we were either showing or we were switching
it. To let them refuse it is something that we always guard against, and we
just did‑‑ I think we just got tired a little bit down the stretch and let
them do some things we normally don't.  
  
Q. I know you don't like talking about it too much, but now with this
heading into the NCAAs, where do you see yourselves being ranked in there?  
MIKE CAREY: I mean, I think we at least should be a 3, at least a 3 seed. I
said this yesterday: 2, 3, I'm happy. Don't want to be 4 and 5. I'm happy at a
6. I just don't want to be 4 and 5.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  65  
Oklahoma State  61

  
Q. You held OSU to 26 percent shooting in the first half. Can you kind of
speak a little bit about what you guys did defensively there?  
MAKENZIE ROBERTSON: I mean, we've played them twice already just like any
other team, so we know their strengths and weaknesses, so we just tried to
capitalize on it.  
  
Q. Niya, I don't remember a time when you would have taken 12 shots. They
were obviously leaving you open. Talk about your ability, you've got to be
able to?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Well, when I first stubbed out, coach came up to me and told me
to keep shooting the ball, shooting the ball with confidence, and I just took
her words to heart and I just kept shooting until it fell in, and once it went
in, they were big shots, so I was satisfied.  
  
Q. Makenzie, you guys are wearing the 400 shirts. Talk about playing for
your mom and being there for her 400th win.  
MAKENZIE ROBERTSON: Well, that's kind of special. I mean, I think we got to
celebrate her 300th my freshman year maybe, and so I'm happy to be here for
300 and 400. It just makes me really proud of her and that I get to be a part
of it.  
  
Q. Nina, just talk about your experience the first time here. Looks like you
feel pretty comfortable in this setting?  
NINA DAVIS: My first time here has been great. I love the essence here, just
playing every game, every game is aggressive, everybody brings their A game
in. I'm just really loving the atmosphere out here.  
  
Q. Nina, talk to me and tell me is it easier being the first game out while
now you have the championship tomorrow night, you get a little more rest under
you? Does that help you guys?  
NINA DAVIS: It's very important because this game right here, we basically had
to play to the very buzzer, so we used a lot of legs. It was a very physical
game, and so just having the first game and being able to rest is definitely a
plus.  
  
Q. Makenzie, what are your thoughts on the match ‑up tomorrow with either
West Virginia or Texas? I know you just played West Virginia a week ago,
obviously, but your thoughts on that?   
MAKENZIE ROBERTSON: Well, they're both great teams. It's been pretty close
both times‑‑ well, this last time with West Virginia, obviously, was a
heartbreaker for us. But both games, both teams are just great, and they come
out and you give it your all and they both hustle. They're both physical. We
have to come out and stay focused and be ready for whatever they throw at us.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like officiating was tough to overcome. Were there any
adjustments made from you or the players in relation to the officiating?  
KIM MULKEY: It was just a physical game. It was a very physical game, and I
probably should have made an opening statement, so I'll say it now, and make
sure y'all write this, or maybe y'all can answer it for you: Are there any
major BCS leagues that play each other twice? Come on. Is there? We might be
the only two leagues, this league and that one that do it. It's a grind out
there. It is a grind. You see the scores. We know everything about each other.
You don't even have to do a scouting report, so when the NCAA sits down to do
their selection, they need to keep that in mind, that you're looking at six
teams in this conference that go at it night in and night out, and we don't
have traveling partners or whatever they call all that stuff, and we don't‑‑
we're not able to avoid certain teams. You've got to play everybody in this
league. And to come out here and have to do it in a conference tournament
again, it's just a grind, and it may not look very good. I don't imagine that
game was very enjoyable to watch on TV. There was a lot of stoppage, a lot of
fouling, a lot of all that going on, but both teams are battling and just
trying to win. It was just that kind of game.  
  
Q. You talked about the grind. Do you think the grind is wearing on Odyssey,
or is this ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: No, no.  
  
Q. Is that the case at all?  
KIM MULKEY: I think it has to do with her being guarded by everybody on the
other team. They take turns. They take turns, and then two of them do it at a
time and three at a time and throw this one at her. No. She sees it all. She
sees it all. I think she'll lose her composure some, but she doesn't lose it
near as much as I probably would as a player because she is‑‑ I just don't
know if there's anybody in the country that's guarded like her. I mean, you
think of the players that are up for Player of the Year, the positions that
they play, they don't see that kind of defense. They don't see three and four
players, fresh players, come at her and then a double‑team here and a
triangle‑and‑two and a box‑and‑one. You know, it wears on you because good
coaches and good teams aren't just going to let her come down and shoot it, so
they make it difficult for her.  
  
Q. I know you expect it from Nina at this point, but another big game, 18
points, 12 rebounds. Did you see some maturity out of her being able to do it
kind of battling with the foul trouble that she had?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, she and Sune got in foul trouble early and then Kristina
picked up her third there early.  
Nina today probably did it in a quiet way through the middle part of the game,
and then she got some big buckets there late. She's just one of those players
that when the game is over, you don't realize she had another double‑double.
She just does her job in there, and she also had to guard Martin, so she
wasn't just doing it on the offensive end, she had to guard Martin, and Martin
is playing very well right now.  
  
Q. Kim, 400th career win. Did you know that they were printing those shirts
up?  
KIM MULKEY: No, no. Actually I thought when we went to do the interview with
television and Nina had hers on and she said one of the coaches, I think, gave
them to the girls. Actually, you know, you get caught in the moment. You kind
of say, well, Coach, surely you knew you were at 400. You know you're at 300
something, but about two days ago I got a text from a fan that said something
about now, go conquer 400. I had to ask my assistant what are we conquering?
He goes, Kim, you're right at 400. Duh, you're right, I am. But you don't
think about that. You're thinking how can I win this conference tournament and
then you're thinking how far can I go in the NCAA Tournament.  
That's a lot of basketball games, and the good part about it is I don't have a
lot of turnover in my staff. Those coaches have been with me a long, long
time, and the players that have come to Baylor that I got to coach, you know,
when I'm in my rocking chair and hopefully grandbabies crawling all over me, I
can pull out some clippings and they'll be all yelling, and I can say, see, I
really did used to coach. You can tell them all I'll go all Cruella De Vil and
I'll teach them all about the dalmatians and pull out that book and say this
is as close as I could come to a spotted jacket. I was looking for him today,
tell him I miss him.  
  
Q. Talk about the end of the game there. Did you expect them to not foul
Odyssey when she was there at the top and the ball kind of got knocked
around?  
KIM MULKEY: No, I'd have to think about how many seconds were left on the shot
clock, but I know what I did tell her, the same thing I told her in the West
Virginia game. You keep the ball in your hands and you don't get rid of it.
Odyssey Sims, she's a senior, she's an All‑American, and we won. It was a
grind out there today, and we're in foul trouble and we couldn't hit shots,
but guys, we won. I meant what I said about this league playing each other
twice. I think you get a true champion, that's for sure. I remember 14 years
ago when I came into the league, back then I brought up why don't we play each
other twice and we'll find out who the true champion is, and everybody just
looked at me like I was growing a third eye. It's like, are you kidding me? I
like it, but it's a grind.  
But what you hope happens is the selection committee understands, wow, let's
look at this league they're in and how tough it is and give us a lot of good
seeds.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2014

  

### [Christal Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24894)

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Bria Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26581)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

West Virginia  67  
Texas  60

  
MIKE CAREY: Well, the two games we played Texas before, it was physical,
wasn't pretty, so it doesn't surprise me this wasn't a very pretty game. Both
teams played pretty good defense, both teams go inside a lot, and that type of
stuff, and there's a lot of banging. We was able to get a lead, Texas cut in
there at the end, and then we was able to hit foul shots and make some big
buckets.  
Very proud of these players. Down the stretch, always feel good, especially
with these players down the stretch, under four if it's close. We've had a lot
of games this year under four minutes close, either behind or close, and we've
been able to win a bunch of them.  
  
Q. Bria, how eager were you to get out here again today? I know last night
had to be totally frustrating with the fouls and so forth. Were you able to
put that behind you pretty quickly and be ready to play today?  
BRIA HOLMES: Yeah, I put it behind me. I came out today ready and focused
again, ready to play again. I noticed my outside shot wasn't falling
yesterday, so today I decided to attack the basket more.  
  
Q. Bria, I thought a big part of the game was you guys neutralized Imani
McGee ‑Stafford and Nneka probably better than anybody has done so far this
year. How much was that stressed pre‑game, and how much was that part of the
game plan that you would do that?   
BRIA HOLMES: It was stressed a lot. We had to be on weak side a lot and there
for the help and just close back out on the shooters.  
  
Q. Christal, what is it about this team and even when teams made runs at
you, Texas pulled within a point or two several times, somebody always seems
to come up with a big shot. Are you just expecting this now in this
situation?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, it's just always a team effort with us. If someone is
down we just always try to pick them up or someone else can step up and make a
big play for this team. That's why we all have West Virginia on our jerseys,
because we're just a team and we always try to step up and help each other.  
  
Q. Christal, you get Baylor again. You just played them a week ago today,
third time. Your thoughts on that match ‑up tomorrow night?   
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: It's going to be a dog fight. Everyone wants it bad, and
this could be our first chance to win a conference tournament championship,
and Baylor, they want us again, and everyone just wants to come out and play
hard, and we're going to come out and play hard for 40 minutes. Odyssey is
going to come out strong. She let one go with her team on senior night, so I'm
sure that's still on her mind. Tomorrow is just going to be a big game for
both teams.  
  
Q. Bria, how do you prepare to play Baylor tomorrow?  
BRIA HOLMES: Just come in ready, focused, ready to play as a team, just go out
there and play hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. With Stanford losing and possibly a No.1 seed opening up, could you
expect your team possibly to slip in if you were able to beat Baylor tomorrow
night? Your thoughts on that?  
MIKE CAREY: I don't know. I really‑‑ I've never in my whole career never
really got into that. I just know we didn't want to be a 4 seed, just put it
that way. We didn't want to be a 4 or 5 seed. I'd rather be a 1, 2, 3 or a 6,
7. Our focus is going to be on Baylor tomorrow night, and whatever happens
with the seed happens, but we've got to get focused on Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, Texas had a size advantage over most of their opponents this year.
Imani doesn't score a field goal until, I don't know, some 15 minutes of the
second half. How big was it part of your game plan and what did you do to help
neutralize that part of their game?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I thought we did a good job. We got up the lane on her. She
does an excellent job of selling people down there and all that, and we was
able to get up the lane, even when we switched with a guard they stayed on top
and we was able to get weak‑side help. And then the other thing, I thought we
got decent ball pressure, where at times she was open, but they really
couldn't see it, get it in there. It was a combination of things.  
They're a very good basketball team. They do a lot of high‑low type stuff, and
we do a pretty good job getting weak‑side, getting ball pressure and keeping
it on one side of the floor.  
  
Q. I know the players are always confident even when it gets tight there at
the end that they're going to pull it out. Are you the same way?  
MIKE CAREY: No.  
  
Q. I know you've been seeing this all year. Was it still driving you nuts?  
MIKE CAREY: We was up, what was it, eight or nine, took a couple bad shots,
led to fast breaks on the other end, gave up a couple three‑point plays on the
other end. I just felt we didn't execute as well as we should have going down
the stretch to let them back in, but give them credit, too, they put pressure
on us and that type of stuff. At the end I thought our players stepped up.
They tried to press us, their press didn't hurt us, they had to end up fouling
us, and we was able to go to the line and hit the foul shots.  
  
Q. Could you imagine a tougher road to get to the final, obviously TCU and
Texas who play such good defense?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, that's funny. We said coming into this about a week ago,
two of the teams we didn't want to see was Texas and TCU because both of them
play great defense, both of them were very physical. So we played two very
physical teams going in, and now we're going to end up playing three physical
teams back to back to back.  
  
Q. How do you plan to cover a player like Odyssey Sims, and then also now
Nina Davis?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we haven't covered her yet, so I guess I don't have a plan.
She had 48 and 38. She's a great player. What we did a good job of at Baylor,
she had her 38, but we did a great job on the other people and didn't let them
hurt us, and we kept them off the offensive boards as much as we could.  
Our goal was just going to be to keep it close going into four minutes left.
Baylor likes to jump on you, go up 15, 20, and that type of stuff. We've just
got to keep it close, keep it close, and then both teams have pressure on them
with four minutes to go in the game.  
  
Q. Continuing on that question, getting the chance to see Baylor today
before your game, is there anything that you've seen heading into tomorrow?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, you know, Oklahoma State played them a lot of
triangle‑and‑two. We'll mix up some, but it's going to come down to our
defense against their offense and our offense against their man‑to‑man
defense.  
Both teams are really, really good defensively, and both teams play hard and
both teams are physical. You know, we've got to do a good job when Odyssey
comes in there, and I don't want to say jumps into you, but when she comes in
there, your secondary defender can't move, and sometimes that's hard when
somebody is coming in there and being as aggressive as she is.  
  
Q. It seems like every year, every game this year, if you see Bria has a
down game she almost always bounces back. With the real big game the next
time, does she really never get down on herself?  
MIKE CAREY: Not really. She probably gets down on herself more missing foul
shots than anything. She could shoot three air balls, and it bothers me, it
doesn't bother her, because the fourth time she gets that look she'll shoot
it, and that's what you want out of a scorer and a shooter, where she has a
short memory. But I just kept telling her to drive it, drive it, drive it.
You've got to see the ball go in from somewhere, from the foul line or
somewhere, and then once you get a little confidence you start looking outside
a little bit more, so she did a good job doing that.  
  
Q. This is not you guys' first championship. You had a couple Finals against
Connecticut in the Big East. Is there any correlation with how tough the Big
East was to how tough the Big 12 is now?  
MIKE CAREY: I don't want to get into that. Big East was a very strong
conference, and Big 12 is very strong. I will say this: From top to bottom the
Big 12 in my opinion is the strongest conference I ever coached in, from top
to bottom. There's just really not a lot of off nights.  
  
Q. A little provincial question from me, but Texas was one of the worst
teams in the conference last year, didn't make the tournament, went 12 ‑18\.
What do you see as the greatest improvement they've made to reach this point?
  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think needless to say their size, that coach does a great
job, sets up a lot of schemes, go high‑low, that type of stuff. You know,
their guards are matured, some of them are sophomores now, not freshmen, and I
just think she's done a great job. I mean, they've really improved. I can't
remember, I think they beat us last year, too. I mean, they beat us last year.
That says a lot about us, where we were at.  
You know, she's done a great job. They just keep getting better and better,
and their future is so bright. They have a great recruiting class coming in,
and they only have one or two seniors on this team. In my opinion they'll be
preseason No.1 next year, in my opinion, coming in.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  65  
Oklahoma State  61

  
JIM LITTELL: Well, I'm really proud of our team. I thought they competed very
hard. Also disappointed because I felt like we had a chance to win the
basketball game. You could look at about four different things, in the first
half we had a lot of empty possessions where we didn't run very good offense,
and those are just possessions that you can't get back. The buildup of those
come back to haunt you.  
Another thing that really hurt us is we gave up offensive rebounds at key
times. We cut it to four a few times, and Davis would get a put‑back on her.
She's probably one of the best offensive rebounders in the country, and it's
not a lot of fun to think we've got to play her for three more years, but
she's very active, and she hurt us at times on that.  
And in the triangle‑and‑two, I thought we did a nice job on Odyssey. If
somebody would have told me we held her to 17 going in, I would have taken
that. But the second part of the triangle‑and‑two was we were not to lose
Robertson, and we lost her about three or four times, and she hit shots out of
the corner. That's probably the single most thing that we needed to do that we
didn't do. We just didn't stay locked in on her the way we ought to, but if
we'd have done that, I feel like we would have won the game.  
Then the fourth thing that really hurt us was we didn't make enough free
throws. To upset a team of this caliber you've got to make sure that you're
sticking easy shots and making free throws, and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Tiffany, just talk a little bit about how you had to change your game
maybe a little bit when you picked up the two fouls in the first half, and you
played the final eight ‑and‑a‑half with four fouls.   
TIFFANY BIAS: Basically coach just told me to be smart, and as a player with
four fouls you know you can't be as aggressive as you want to be. You have to
be mentally tough and be sound on defense.  
  
Q. Tiffany, offensive struggles in the first half, what were they doing
defensively to slow you down there in the first half?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, it's a good defensive team. They deny the passes, and
really put pressure on the ball, so I think that we weren't executing our
offense on our end, so I mean, if we just ran our offense through, we'd have
been fine.  
  
Q. Brittney, how much does a game like this, and not only the game but
league play, prepare you for the NCAA Tournament?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I mean, all the games are going to be tough in the NCAA
Tournament, so I mean, all the games are tough in the league, but I think this
game really prepared us and taught us that we need to be patient when people
start denying our passing lanes and things like that. I think we really need
to be patient on offense, and it showed how hard we're going to have to work
to get where we want to.  
  
Q. Brittney, there was a lot of fouls today. There was probably 30 some odd
fouls. Was this one of the most physical games that you've played this year?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. This rule change thing has got us all messed up.
I can't say we can't play as hard, but we need to move our feet instead of
using our hands. I think we're still going to have to get used to that.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how frustrating was it in the second half, you got the lead down
to three, four, and every time it seemed like you guys were never able to get
the defensive stop you needed or convert a basket on the other end, how
frustrating was that to never get over that hump?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, as you play, you don't really worry about that, but I
think that was our fault on our end playing on the court. I think when we have
the momentum on our side we need to slow down and keep that momentum on our
side. I think we learned from it today that slow the ball up when we don't
have something and get a good shot on our offense.  
  
Q. Brittney, how much did the athleticism of you and Kendra, as well, kind
of utilize that athleticism against their bigs, obviously both of you with 11
points and combined for 20 rebounds?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that both of us are kind of a tough match‑up, a big
on Kendra, she's a lot quicker than most bigs. She's quicker in a weird way, I
think. She's just quicker than them. I guess I'm a tough match‑up because I
can take the post from the outside in. I just think I'm quicker from the
outside to inside.  
  
Q. Liz was scoreless in the first game. Today she had eight points. How
important is it to kind of get her back on track before the tournament
starts?  
JIM LITTELL: Well, Liz has got‑‑ we have to have three players that can score
on a consistent basis for us, and it's got to be Liz Donohoe and the two
ladies who were here, Tiffany and Brittney, have all got to score. Our big
three have got to get baskets and then we've got to get support out of LaShawn
and Kendra Suttles inside. We need to get her on track. We need to get her
making shots. We had some good looks. We had a lot of shots that I thought
were going in that rimmed out. We never could get over that hump once we got
it to three or four, and you know, we just‑‑ I allude back to some of those
mistakes that we made that you can't do against a team like this. You know, I
look at it, we shot 35 percent and we're within four. You've got to make more
shots to beat a team like Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the end of the game when Odyssey had the ball
right at half court, and is there a reason why you never fouled?  
JIM LITTELL: We probably should have fouled. One reason, she's about 80
percent free throw shooter, 85 percent free throw shooter, and we should have.
Did that one play make the difference in the ballgame? Probably not, but we
probably should have fouled on the rebound is where we should have fouled. And
we wanted to do that before it got into Odyssey's hands.  
  
Q. NCAA readiness, this tournament and league play, how much did it prepare
you for what's coming in a couple weeks?  
JIM LITTELL: I think you see everything within this league. You see great zone
out of TCU, you see man‑to‑man teams, you see athleticism, you see size, you
see scorers. I think when we get to the NCAA Tournament there's probably not a
whole lot that you haven't seen or you're prepared for. Coach Mulkey told me
after the game, she said, "Jim, this league is a grind, and you know, you guys
can go into the tournament and win games," and I believe that out of her team
and I believe that out of our team.  
I just think this league is, from top to bottom, the best in the country, and
it prepares you to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Kind of going along with that notion that the league is a grind with
playing everyone twice and then playing the tournament, what do you have to do
to prepare for the NCAA Tournament? Does this off week this upcoming week
really help from a physical standpoint?  
JIM LITTELL: It's kind of hard to prepare when you don't know where you're
going or who you're playing, but I think we get some days off. We gave some
days off prior to this tournament, and I think we had a lot more pep in our
step. We seemed rejuvenated.  
We played two good games here in this tournament. This was a positive. You
know, and if you want to draw from the positives, five of our eight losses
this year are the conference champions. You know, all eight of our losses are
to teams that are going to be in the NCAA Tournament. So we really don't have
a bad loss on our résumé right now, but I guess getting back to answer your
question, we've got to get some time off, get these kids rested up, get healed
up a little bit, and this point of the year you're not going to teach them
that much more, you've just got to have fresh minds and fresh bodies.  
  
Q. Jim, it seems like Brittney may be a half to two thirds through the
season really started to go to the boards, and she had 11 points, 15 rebounds
today. Was there a point in the season that you really emphasized that to her,
because she has been getting a lot more boards.  
JIM LITTELL: Yeah, that's a lot of rebounds for a 5'11" or 6'0" kid. I think
she just really picked up her game, especially in this tournament. You know,
she's got a knack for the ball. She jumps well. She's one of those kids that
catches the ball at the top of her jump. She's a good athlete, and she's very
capable of bringing a double‑double for us every single night.  
I thought we ran some good things, got her some good looks, and you know, her,
Tiff and Liz really didn't have a very good shooting night, and we needed to
make some of those shots. But I thought we did a good job of getting good
looks for them, and we didn't finish some of the shots.  
There's a lot of different things you can point to. I'm really disappointed; I
thought we had a chance to win the ballgame.  
  
Q. LaShawn and Kendra combined for just six rebounds. How important is it to
get that production up from those two in the NCAA Tournament?  
JIM LITTELL: Well, I mean, it's crucial. It's crucial, and LaShawn can't have
one rebound and be successful once we enter postseason play. We've talked to
that, and five in 22 minutes isn't bad for Kendra, but LaShawn does have to
pick it up as far as rebounding. She's one that's got the athleticism and the
quick twitch to go get the ball, and she needs to rebound better than that.  
But sometimes you look at it, too, there weren't a lot of rebounds left after
Brittney Martin was getting all that she got, as well.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2014

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Nekia Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26583)

### [Celina Rodrigo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26582)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

West Virginia  67  
Texas  60

  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I thought that, first of all, West Virginia's guards were
really, really good today, and we weren't able to keep them at bay as far as
early in the game transition buckets, and then in the second half we just
couldn't stop their penetration. Part of it was our lack of efficiency on
defense, but some of it was their ability to get to the paint and draw fouls.  
I was really proud of our team from the aspect that we really didn't play
well. A lot of that had to do with West Virginia, but some of it had to do
with our composure offensively wasn't very good. But I'm really proud that we
didn't give up and didn't get to a point where we got to, dejected. That's an
area where I think our team has really grown enormously. I'm proud of our
effort. I think we've taken some really good steps this year, and in
particular in this tournament.  
  
Q. The comeback that you guys made, some of it was made with players that
don't always get a lot of minutes, for example, Nekia, Brianna. What does that
show about the team as a whole that you can rely on other players other than
the big two or the big three that get most of the attention?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think it shows that we have a lot of depth, and on any given
night any player can step up, and I think coach just went with the group that
was playing pretty well, and in turn we were able to come back and almost get
the lead, but I just think it just depended on the group that was in there,
and like I said, on any given night anybody can step up. I think it's due to
our depth.  
  
Q. Nekia, kind of the same question, but you in particular, you led the team
in scoring I think in the first half and wound up with a really good game.
When you go into a game like that, do you think it's up to me to get this team
in gear? What's your mindset like that?  
NEKIA JONES: My mindset is just to bring energy and find a way to help the
team just get better every time, every play, every step of the way. At that
moment in the game, we just tried to bring energy and keep this team together
and push to try to get the lead, but it didn't happen, but we've still worked
hard, and we didn't pull it out.  
  
Q. Celina, their coach said you guys have played two not so pretty games
against each other and wasn't surprised at this one. What is it about West
Virginia that it's really tough to play them? It seems like they're really
physical that maybe takes you out of your game a little bit?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think since we're both pretty physical teams, it ends up I
rot of fouls, we definitely put them on the free‑throw line physicality
between the both of us.  
  
Q. Another question: Imani didn't score a field goal in the first half and
Nneka may have had one. How difficult was it to get them involved in the flow
of the game? Seemed like maybe a little bit better in the second half, but
West Virginia was really tough today on them?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think in the first half we knew that we had to get a better
post presence in the paint, but I think as a team we just kept encouraging
them and letting them know that we still trust them, that they're going to get
position, and I think it worked out better in the second half.  
  
Q. Same question I asked a minute ago: It looked like Imani and Nneka had a
hard time getting into the flow of the offense. Did West Virginia do anything
in particular to neutralize them?  
KAREN ASTON: I think they did exactly what they've done every time we've
played them, in particular when we played at West Virginia. I thought they did
a terrific job denying our post players the ball. It's twofold: They have to
work a little harder and get better position, but the other piece to that is
that we have to be patient enough to reverse the basketball where we can get
some pins from the way that they're being played on the first pass, and that's
where I thought we were impatient, really, really impatient in the first half
and didn't let the offense flow.  
Our team has a habit of wanting to score off the first pass and not having‑‑
and obviously I have to take responsibility for that because I don't think
we're disciplined enough to make the next pass, and some of it is youth and
some of it's that some teams we don't have to do that against, and then we run
up against a team like West Virginia that really takes away your first couple
of options, and we don't do a good job of getting to the next option.  
  
Q. Texas made a comeback in the second half with players that don't always
get a lot of minutes. Does it say anything in particular to you about them and
how gratifying is it that players that don't get a lot of minutes brought you
back?  
KAREN ASTON: I think those players practiced every day. It's not like they
don't get a lot of reps in practice because they do. They get about as much
reps as the starters do. And I think that aside from Bri Taylor and Kelsey
Lang have had minutes that really mattered throughout this year, so I mean, it
just so happened that they were the ones that were really bringing some energy
that the older players were struggling to find. So we went with that group
just seemed to have a little bit more energy. Obviously Chass was in that
group, and that was a killer when Chass fouled out because I thought we were
right there, and that was obviously a huge play in the game.  
  
Q. She was pretty adamant that she didn't touch her. From your viewpoint,
without getting fined by the league, what did you think of that particular
play?  
KAREN ASTON: I'd have to go back and look at that on film. You always‑‑ I
think coaches always assume that we never foul. It's always a bad call. But I
try to not really make a lot of judgment on things until you look at the film
because honestly most of the time you go back and look at the film and it's
the way that they call it. Most often it is. It was just unfortunate for us
because Chass was really kind of the anchor to that group, and she was playing
well. She was shooting the ball well. Brady was struggling today, so it really
hurt us when Chass went out.  
  
Q. I guess the big tournament, you'll find out next Monday, but all in all,
the season, 21 ‑11, I don't know what your expectations were at this point,
but how do you feel about your team going into the big one?   
KAREN ASTON: I feel really good about our team. I thought that they really
came here to win the tournament. They didn't come here just to win a game.
They're an extremely disappointed group right now. They're not ready to go
home. I'm going to give them a few days off, and I don't necessarily think
that they were ready to do that. They wanted to play tomorrow. I'm really,
really excited about obviously the future of our program, but in particular
what I think we could do in the NCAA Tournament.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Zahna Medley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26543)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Natalie Ventress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23314)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

West Virginia  67  
TCU  59

  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, I thought it was a hard‑fought game. We were right there.
We've been down this road with them before, and they hurt us on the glass, and
that continued to give us problems. They're a tough, physical match‑up. I
think Bussie is just a tremendous player down there, and we just had trouble
finding a way to keep her off the glass. I thought our first‑shot defense was
good, but keeping them off the glass was critical, and we weren't able to do
that.  
I thought our group fought. I thought we made some big plays. I thought Z was
fabulous tonight, had a great look to her, made big shots all night long.
Noony had a stretch where she made some big plays. It was a tough night for
her early. We just had trouble getting her shots. She had a tough night from
behind the arc, but she had a stretch there where she really lifted us up when
we came back, so a couple‑possessions games, and they made a few more plays
than us. They're an outstanding team. Give them credit. They made a few more
plays than we did.  
  
Q. Ms.Medley, you obviously were hitting your shot whenever you wanted,
especially from three ‑point. When they put Harley on you, did her size affect
you at all?   
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I don't think so. I think a little bit when I had her in the
air. Sometimes I had a step back on her but I didn't take it because I thought
she would block it. I was trying to take the second shot which was harder than
the first one. Other than that, just kind of didn't make the shots.  
  
Q. Natalie, do you think your performance tonight will help you build for
next season or the team, what the team can do for next season?  
NATALIE VENTRESS: I mean, yeah, it should help me grow, and when I'm not
making shots, I have to find other ways to score and to help my team like get
to the free‑throw line, and I didn't do it tonight.  
JEFF MITTIE: And I would not‑‑ I would say I don't think we're done playing. I
don't think we're in the NCAA Tournament but I do think we'll be a postseason
team. That would be an area that we weren't able to get her to the free‑throw
line tonight, and we probably needed to run some better stuff for her to get
to the free‑throw line. That's not just on her, that's on me to get her a
better chance to get to the free‑throw line. I needed to do a better job of
getting her into position to get that done.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Zahna's performance tonight as a whole. It seems like
you look at the numbers, I think the next top score was six points. How did
she run this team tonight?  
JEFF MITTIE: I'll tell you what, she was amazing tonight. She had a look. I
thought we were able to find her a lot of different ways. She just has such a
great feel. A kid like that that's not very big that can get inside, draw
fouls. The amazing thing about her is she's not super quick, but she is really
quick with the basketball because she is so fundamental with everything that
she does. But I thought her look was good early. She was shooting it deep.
There was a few stretches where she got a little bit tired, but she really
pushed through, and I think she's had a fabulous year.  
  
Q. Latricia was obviously a big factor down low, seven blocks. Can you talk
about her performance?  
JEFF MITTIE: Yeah, you know, that's what she's done for us all year long. I
think she's one of the best defensive centers in the league, as evidenced‑‑ I
think the other coaches recognized her with that, as well. She really anchors
our defense down low. It was big when she got hurt. I thought Bradshaw battled
Bussie as hard as she could on that play where Bussie gets the and‑1, but
you're talking about a fifth‑year senior that's going to play at the next
level and talking about a freshman‑‑ and I thought she battled her as hard as
she could on that play. But I thought Lovings was fantastic defensively, and
yeah, I mean, when she goes out of the game‑‑ we have trouble rebounding with
her in the game, but when she goes out of the game, that's a real struggle for
us.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Niya Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26555)

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Ieshia Small](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26557)

### [Imani Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26556)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Kansas  47

  
Q. Niya, first of all, just talk about the start that you guys got off to.
It looked like the offense was flowing pretty well early.  
NIYA JOHNSON: We knew we had to get ‑‑ start off quick and energetic because
we knew that we had to, I guess, start off quick. It first started with
Odyssey pressuring the defense, and we just followed her lead.  
  
Q. Imani or Ieshia , the last time you guys played them, it didn't go as
well in the second half as you would have liked and they won that game. Talk
about the rebounds that you guys had today.  
IMANI WRIGHT: I guess we knew we had to come out with more intensity. We still
remember the loss that we took, so we felt like we needed to start fast and
keep it going.  
IESHIA SMALL: Like Coach Mulkey said, in the beginning of the season,
rebounding was the key for us and we lead the league in the Big 12 in
rebounds, so we're trying to keep that going.  
  
Q. Niya, you guys lose a player like Brittney Griner, so dominant in college
basketball, and you come back and had a fabulous year. What does that say
about the Baylor program that you guys haven't fallen at all, even though you
lose a transcendent player like that?  
NIYA JOHNSON: First off, we still have Odyssey Sims, and I mean, we're still
here, we still have the talent. We're just young, but the talent is there.  
KIM MULKEY: This program was here before Brittney Griner got here. This
program will be here long after Brittney Griner is gone. We were all
privileged and honored to be around her, to play with her, to coach her, but
she's no more important Sophia Young who was on the 2005 team and Chelsea
Whitaker and that crew. This young bunch sitting here before you, they're
going to be here for the next three or four years. It's called a tradition,
it's called a program, and we're not going away. Odyssey Sims will graduate,
Makenzie will graduate, and you're looking at three pretty good players here,
and that's why I brought them up here today, and I thought your question was
outstanding.  
  
Q. Imani, just talk about your aggressiveness today. It looked like you were
pretty quick to get your shot off.  
IMANI WRIGHT: You know, the coaches in practice were telling me stay
aggressive. I guess it's easier when you're more aggressive to get in a
rhythm. That's what I tried to do today.  
  
Q. Niya, you talked about Odyssey's ball pressure. It looked like a lot of
you guys were doing that, just putting a lot of pressure on them. Were you
kind of trying to test their legs a little bit because they had a long game
late last night?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Yes, and also to help our posts inside, as well, so we knew we
had to get the pressure involved so they wouldn't get inside quick and easy.  
  
Q. Last time you were in our city playing a game, you had the disappointing
loss to Louisville. How did that ‑‑ did that loss, being such a favorite and
going down, did that change anything about the way you ran your program?
Obviously you spoke about the consistency and tradition, but what kind of
effect did that have on you and the way you look at your program?   
KIM MULKEY: I've had disappointing losses as a coach before. I've had
disappointing losses as a player. It's part of sports. The only thing I
thought about coming back here was please don't put me in that same hotel I
was in. That's all. I didn't like the hotel. I thought it was creepy, and
don't put me back in it. I'm not going to tell you because I don't want those
people mad at me, but the hotel didn't lose the game for us, I just didn't
like it.  
But no, it's all good. It's part of sports.  
  
Q. Coach, first half, excellent, defense, holding them to 26 percent, points
in the paint, 26 ‑8\. Just talk about the outstanding job on both ends of the
floor early on.   
KIM MULKEY: I just thought that our defense was what it normally is. It was
aggressive, it was ball harassment out front. I thought Sune, she just quietly
does her job in the paint. Gardner has 29 last night, and Sune just bangs in
there and angles and listens to scouting reports. I know Gardner finished with
21, but those 21 weren't really a factor in the game like she was last night.
I just thought the kids were ready to play. I thought their legs seemed to be
a little bit fresher than they were the last game we played at Iowa State, and
now we will go to the film room and get ready for a good Oklahoma State team.  
  
Q. How important is getting rest for your starters, not only for the sense
that they can rest but younger players getting in there.  
KIM MULKEY: This game was so important to win, first of all, and you never
know going in how much rest you can get for your main players. And then as the
game unfolded, particularly as we were up 26 at the half, I thought, okay, now
we've really got to grow here, and I've got to be able to sit players.
Odyssey, I left her out there with three fouls early, which I don't normally
do, but the score dictated me doing that because I thought when she picks up
or if she picks up her fourth, I can start resting her at that point. And it
kind of worked out that way.  
It's so valuable, but it wasn't just resting them. It's what the other players
did while the starters were resting. They didn't lose a lead. They didn't do
bad things on the floor. I saw a very mature team out there with that many
young players extend the lead and get steals and deflections and defend, and
that's when you're really, really pleased. It wasn't just the rest, it's what
those players did on the floor while we were resting them.  
  
Q. Nina came out pretty strong, multiple and ones in the second half, she
had 18 by halftime. Clearly no teams are surprised by her anymore, but just
knowing that there's now a target on her back and still the way she came out,
how pleased were you?  
KIM MULKEY: I expect that every night from Nina, and if she would have played
more, she would have had another double‑double. She's one of those players
when you go on the floor, you go, that's Nina Davis I keep reading about,
because you don't realize how small she is in there with those big players,
and then when you watch her shoot, you're like, how does she get that shot
off, how does it go in, and then you think, well, surely she's going to get
exposed on the defensive end of the floor, but she doesn't. Nina Davis is so
deserving of awards and up for freshman of the year. She's a great example of
a player that didn't come in with a lot of accolades out of high school, but
when you put her on that floor, she worked her way up, and we can't win
without her.  
  
Q. Early in the game it seemed like you picked them up a little bit more
full court and pressed a little bit. Was that just to kind of test them and
see how they were feeling after last night's game?  
KIM MULKEY: It really had nothing to do with them going to overtime. Everybody
is tired late in the year. It had more to do with generate your own energy and
enthusiasm here. You've got Baylor fans that have spent time and their money
to come here, and let's get them excited, let's get them into the flow of the
game. Let's don't come out here and not have some energy and excitement, so
that was the reason I called that, and it got us going.  
  
Q. Up next Oklahoma State tomorrow afternoon. Your thoughts on them, and
what do you expect to see tomorrow?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I expect to see probably a lot more orange than green and
gold in the stands. It's almost like playing a home game for Oklahoma State. I
know that it was so difficult when we played them in Stillwater, and yet at
the same time we made plays without Odyssey Sims having a very good game. And
in fact she was on the bench when we went into the overtime.  
I know that they will play extremely hard. I know Tiffany Bias is a leader for
them on the floor, and they're like the rest of us that are left in this
tournament; we know we're going to the NCAA Tournament. We know that we're
helping each other prepare for the NCAA Tournament, and it'll be probably
tougher than NCAA Tournament games because we know so much about each other.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Chelsea Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24873)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Kansas  47

  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Well, I mean, defensively didn't matter what we were in.
They just looked at us and said we're going to rip it and drive on you and
offensive rebound and get you in transition. Give them a tremendous amount of
credit. They came out and ran a buzz saw and we didn't have an answer
defensively. I thought they were really, really aggressive with us in the
first four minutes, got us out of sorts. We had no rhythm, we started
dribbling around like crazy and tried to take what we liked to do and they
clearly from a scouting report defense played some people and we got exposed a
little bit and didn't take lanes that were available and tried to play
one‑handed. Give them credit. Obviously they were the more aggressive team
from the tip, and we just never got back in it.  
  
Q. Chelsea, I know it's a tough day today, but just talk a little bit about
your growth this year coming from last year to this year and what you were
able to accomplish and look forward to your senior year, as well.  
CHELSEA GARDNER: I think I've grown a lot this year. I've grown the outside
game in knocking down jump shots, and I'll grow inside, too. I think next year
I just need to keep working hard in the off season and just work hard every
day.  
  
Q. Coach, just overall this past basketball season after the last two years,
talk a little bit about this team and what you had to do. Can you see the
foundation being built for the future?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Yeah, we obviously lost three really talented kids last
year, and I think when we look back and look at it from a consistency
standpoint, we struggled. These two up here, Chelsea and Natalie, were clearly
by far the most consistent performers we had on the year. Chelsea, the one
thing you look at Chelsea‑‑ for each of them I would say Chelsea has got to
stay out of foul trouble and Nat needs to be consistently as aggressive as we
need her to be. But we had too many guys that were one out of five games
played play well, will give us something. You can't do that in this league.
Our returners, and I said that, how consistent our returners would need to be,
all of them, because we had very little room for error. But if you're playing
consistently and you're playing aggressively and playing with discipline,
there shouldn't be a lot of error.  
But we, just too much, with upperclassmen that were in a different role,
obviously, because these two had a different role and I thought executed and
performed at a high level, considering how their roles changed. Natalie grew
into ‑‑ I think once she started get being out of the brace, get back to 100
percent, I think actually is playing better now than she ever was before, and
Chelsea being able to play at a high level, but we've got to have‑‑ CeCe was
probably the most next consistent in that group, but past that, from a
returner standpoint‑‑ freshmen are inconsistent, that's what they are. The
thing about a freshman, they'll become a sophomore. It wasn't the group of
freshmen, it was the returners around them not being consistent enough to
sustain the success and the level of play to be successful in this league. I
think that's the most disappointing thing. But you can't complain about the
results you get overwork you didn't do.  
I still think in the offseason I think some guys didn't get in the gym like
they needed to get in the gym. We've got to shoot the ball better to get
Chelsea some room, you think about that, we've got to give her some room to
play and we've got too many guys that defensively they'll play in the paint
and not guard well. I don't tell people not to guard you. That's not my
scouting report, and I tell them all the time. You've got to grow your game
where you can play both right and left‑handed, you can pull up, you can get to
the rim, shoot the three. But defensively we've got to get better, tougher,
and those things we'll work on this spring and summer.  
But I think we've got‑‑ it's hard to talk about one‑possession games after
this drubbing, but I think we're in 12 or 13 one‑possession games, and we win
the one last night and find ways to make plays on both ends of the floor, and
we're that close, but there's such a fine line between losing and winning,
there really is. In this league there have been a large amount of
one‑possession games like there has been historically in this league, so we've
got to be able to shore that up where every possession matters, every shot
matters. Those things, I think, from us moving forward about growing the
returners and we've got a crop of young kids that I really believe will come
in and help us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Aaryn Ellenberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22721)

### [Morgan Hook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24916)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  82  
Oklahoma  72

  
SHERRI COALE: I congratulate Texas. They played extremely well. They shot the
ball well. Their post players were fantastic, and I just thought they played
really tough and really confidently and were very hungry. Our performance was
a little bit like our year has been ‑ inconsistent. We went for such a long
period of time in the second half without being able to put the ball in the
basket, just really from three‑point we had great looks, from the block, we
missed lay‑ups, and we missed a few free throws in there. We just couldn't put
any points on the board, and then we made some defensive mistakes, left
shooters that we weren't supposed to leave, and let them get some momentum and
let them get feeling good, and then we made a flurry at the end, too little,
too late.  
  
Q. Morgan and Aaryn, can you guys talk about what happened coming out of the
locker room the second half and how Texas kind of hit you hard?  
MORGAN HOOK: Just kind of like coach said, we let missed lay‑ups or free
throws kind of affect us on the defensive end, and we just weren't aware on
the defensive end and made just silly mistakes.  
  
Q. Aaryn, and then Morgan, was there something Texas did the first five, ten
minutes of the second half because it just seemed like two minutes were gone,
the lead was now a deficit, and you guys were just sort of scrambling? Did
they do stuff to make that happen?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I think most of it was just us doing it to ourselves, not
knocking down easy shots and making plays, and then brain farting on defense
and losing people who are shooters. I mean, I think most of it was us to
ourselves.  
  
Q. Guys, just a tough shooting night, or was it something Texas was doing
maybe to bother your shot tonight?  
MORGAN HOOK: We just didn't knock down open shots.  
  
Q. Morgan, especially with the way the first half ended with the momentum
you had with yours and Nicole's three and then T'Ona's three at the buzzer,
was it especially deflating to come out of the locker room that off,
especially missing those open shots?  
MORGAN HOOK: Yeah, I think we came out of the locker room just eager to get
back on the floor and build a run, and like I said earlier, we just let a
missed three and then a missed lay‑up just affect us.  
  
Q. I just wonder, you said it's a lot like the season, and maybe I'm asking
a question you've answered already, but does it seem familiar in the sense
that you guys seemed to get a toehold on something, a 55 ‑point win over Tech,
you play really well, and then it goes well for a little while, then kind of
not so much, and now you've got to sort of come back again. Is that a familiar
feeling this season?   
SHERRI COALE: Yeah, very much so. I think that "it" thing that we've been
searching for all season, that killer instinct that we've been able to
capitalize on prosperity, we just have not had it for whatever reason, and
it's my job to find it. It's my job to figure it out, and I have not been able
to figure it out yet, how to change that. Obviously if I had been able to, I
would have.  
It's just‑‑ it's interesting how good we can be when we're down at the end and
how good we can be when we're up against Tech by 25, and then when you've got
a six‑point cushion, and we had all kinds of momentum at halftime, to come
out, and we had the ball, and we got exactly the shot that we wanted, that we
drew up, and then to then defend as tentatively as we did, and I thought
that's really probably the best description I can give for it is we were
tentative, and that's hard to explain. That's where it began and Texas started
feeling really good. That lead was wiped out in less than two minutes, I
think. Then they went on I think it was a 21‑5 run or something crazy like
that.  
  
Q. Are you concerned with your team's prospect for the NCAA Tournament at
all?  
SHERRI COALE: Well, I think we've done enough to get in. I do. When you go 9‑9
in the No.1 RPI league in the country, I think you're in. Kansas got in last
year at 8‑10 and went to the Sweet 16. That speaks volumes about the strength
of our league, and this Texas team is very, very good. Our strength of
schedule is 16 in the country. I do think we've done enough. I'm disappointed
because I think a win tonight would have really, really helped us in terms of
where we might end up.  
  
Q. Not to repeat the same question, but I want to say, do I have my years
right, 2005, you go play Arizona first round in the NCAA Tournament? Anyway,
that was the last year that there seemed to be some sort of are they in, are
they not in? I think I agree with you that you're in, but is it a nervous
Sunday awaiting you because you don't know for sure until you see it, and the
last time it was like this I think was '05. Does it seem at all similar to
that season?  
SHERRI COALE: You have a better memory than I do. I can barely remember last
year, much less '05. It's just an unfamiliar feeling for us to be sitting
there when names are called and not know for absolutely sure. So it will be a
different sort of selection day for sure.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Hallie
Christopherson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21855)

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Nikki Moody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23345)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  67  
Iowa State  57

  
BILL FENNELLY: First of all, on behalf of our team and Iowa State University,
I want to thank everyone in Oklahoma City and the Big 12. There's no better
tournament in the country than what happens here, and we appreciate it. The
hospitality and everything was great. Beautiful place to play.  
As far as the game goes, our team is one of those teams that we don't make
shots, you're not going to win games. When you shoot 22 percent and you miss
seven lay‑ups against a good team, a Top 20 team, you're going to lose.
Sometimes it's not real hard to figure out, and to me that was the difference
in the game.  
  
Q. Hallie, you opened the second half and Oklahoma State goes on a 9 ‑0 run.
What was going on offensively leading to them getting all those points so
quickly?   
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, I think when they started out first half, they
were kind of shying away from the basket, and then second half they knew they
really had to attack us, get us in some foul trouble, and that's what they
did.  
  
Q. Nikki, you started off really hot in the first half and then kind of died
off. What were they doing defensively that changed in the second half?  
NIKKI MOODY: I think they were breaking down more and trying to chase me off
my shot. And mostly they were clogging the lane, so it was harder to get in
there.  
  
Q. Hallie, you have 21 points, 11 boards, but you're one ‑of‑eight from
three. I assume that's dim on your stat line today?   
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, definitely.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you got good looks?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: You know, coming in I was just trying to kind of focus
on the post and the inside, and when I got the ball on the outside, probably
just wasn't ready to shoot the ball, and it showed.  
  
Q. Hallie, what were they doing down low defensively to stop you? You had 22
points in the paint to their 40. What were they doing defensively down there
that was so tough?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: They're strong post players, pushing you out of the
lane, trying to hold you off the block, and once you did get down the inside,
if you put the ball down on the floor, then they're coming to double, they're
coming to strip it out and you just had to kind of change up how you played
knowing that they were going to be two or three coming.  
  
Q. Nikki, you had that four ‑point play about five minutes to go in the
first half. That's when the momentum was kind of swinging back and forth. How
big was that play for you guys going into the break?   
NIKKI MOODY: I felt like it was pretty big. It gave us momentum going into the
locker room, and we needed to carry it out into the second half, but it didn't
happen that way.  
  
Q. Oklahoma State had six steals in the second half. Was that just a case of
them being more aggressive defensively or were you more careless with the
ball?  
BILL FENNELLY: I think it's both. When someone makes a defensive play, part of
it is their execution defensively, and some of it was some lack of
fundamentals on our part at the start of the second half. We were up seven at
the half, and we run a play, we get a lay‑up around the basket, we miss, and
we don't get back in transition, and they get and‑one. The points in the paint
thing, a lot of it was some transition opportunities by them, but they're a
good team. They're quick off the bounce. We tried to keep them in front of us
as best we could, and for the most part we were okay. Our defense was okay.  
But again, offensively we really struggled to do some of the things that we
need to do to be good to have a chance to win. Just didn't get it done today.  
  
Q. You had six threes in the first half, I believe, and I think the success
kind of carried over from the last game against them. What were they doing
defensively to kind of slow you down in the second half from long ‑range?   
BILL FENNELLY: I don't think the game‑‑ I think they guarded us exactly the
same way both halves, it looked to me. Sometimes you miss open shots. They
clogged up the lane a little bit, but we still got‑‑ you look at the shot
chart, which I don't do, there's seven missed lay‑ups. So if you're going to
take away the three, you're going to get something else, and we didn't make
them. And when you don't make shots, that happens.  
Except for a couple that you had to force at the end of the game when you're
down, I would say most of the three‑point shots we took were pretty good
looks, and that's our team. We're not making them, I'm sure when I get home
I'll have lots of emails, we shoot too many threes and all that kind of stuff.
If you said to me, Hallie's got a wide open three three times in the second
half, will you let her take it? Hell yes. Didn't go in. But it went in the
first half, didn't in the second. You've got to credit Oklahoma State. You're
playing a Top‑20 team, a good team, and they played better. That's the nature
of the beast, and obviously you're disappointed you've got to go home, but
you've got to congratulate them for what they did, too.  
  
Q. You hold Donohoe, one of their better scorers and overall players,
without a basket and didn't really have an impact in this game. What was the
key to that?  
BILL FENNELLY: You know, we got a lot of help. I thought Brynn did a good job
guarding her. We really wanted to chase her off the three and then help a lot,
which I thought we did, and then I thought because we did a decent job of
guarding her, they took her out of the game, and they really tried to beat us
off the bounce a lot more. Brittney Martin was really good. We had no answer
for her, and Tiffany Bias is a first‑team all‑conference player and played
like it, I thought, in the second half.  
Their balance and our inability to get enough baskets at critical times is
probably when the game swung.  
  
Q. That run to start the second half by Oklahoma State, was that just lack
of effort, just slow on their feet to start the half?  
BILL FENNELLY: No. Don't ask me that question.  
  
Q. Was that Oklahoma State ‑‑  
BILL FENNELLY: No, no, no, let me finish.  
You've been covering our team all year, right?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
BILL FENNELLY: I don't want to hear lack of effort. You want to say this team
is coached bad, you run bad plays, they made mistakes, you can write anything
you want. You don't say lack of effort about my team. You understand me?  
  
Q. Yes.  
BILL FENNELLY: They guarded us great. We made mistakes. The team was poorly
coached coming out of halftime. Write that. Don't say anything about lack of
effort about my team. Ever. Ever. They have busted their hump all year, all
year. Look at the minutes. Look at what they tried to do today. Don't‑‑ don't
do that.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Jess Harley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26565)

### [Taylor Palmer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23267)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

West Virginia  67  
TCU  59

  
MIKE CAREY: Let's give TCU a lot of credit, came out and played extremely
hard. They played us extremely hard all three times. I knew this was going to
be like this, this game, and I told the team when we knew we were playing them
last night that they're a great team. But I thought Jess Harlee come in
defensively and offensively, did a great job. I thought Asya Bussie did a
great job in the paint, and when we got behind there, Taylor Palmer come in
and hit a couple threes and got us going a little bit and scored. Total team
effort. Needless to say we're going to have to play a lot better tomorrow.  
  
Q. When TCU started to go on their runs, what did you guys say to regain
your composure?  
TAYLOR PALMER: We just tried to make sure that we were all on the same page
and trying to slow down. We knew we had to get stops, and like coach said,
Jess Harlee came in and she played tremendous on Medley and it got her to slow
down a little bit, and that's when we started to make our run.  
JESS HARLEY: We just said we had to stay positive and keep helping each other,
when she was driving, help each other and stay on her when she was shooting
the threes because she kept doing the step back, so we just said help defense
and get back and recover.  
  
Q. Jess, the missed free throw there, were you kind of surprised when that
girl just stood there? I guess they thought obviously it was two shots. What
did you think when the ball is going up and their girls aren't even moving?  
JESS HARLEY: Well, I saw them standing there and weren't ready. And I was
like, I'm pretty sure this is one‑and‑one, but I'm not sure, I'm just going to
follow it and why not? So I went in there and followed it and made the lay‑up,
and I was like, oh, well, good.  
  
Q. Taylor, you guys were down, I think, 45 ‑41\. You got a couple of threes
there that really seemed to turn the momentum. Did you feel good about taking
those shots?   
TAYLOR PALMER: Yes. I just shot. I wasn't really thinking about it. I wasn't
thinking about it. When I got the ball, I just saw the basket and I shot it
with the utmost confidence, and I was hitting, so it was good.  
  
Q. What does it say about this team to be able to win a game like this? I
know Bria was on the bench with fouls most of the night and you had some other
people that came off the bench, you and Jess in particular that really helped
this team get over the hump?  
TAYLOR PALMER: It just shows how deep we are. A lot of teams have maybe like
five or six players. We have a whole team. Everybody comes in, everyone plays
their role, and we're deep, and it helps us when, like you said, Bria was in
foul trouble, and people getting in foul trouble or people not hitting their
shots, it helps tremendously because everyone can come in and step up and do
what they have to do for us to win the game.  
  
Q. Jess, were you assigned to stop Medley? Seems like when you came in your
size really gave her trouble in the second half?  
JESS HARLEY: Yeah, that's what I knew my role was when I got in there, that I
had to stick her and make sure she didn't get the ball. So I just did my best
that once she passed it up I didn't want her to get the ball back. And if
people were driving, I wasn't helping off of her so my goal was just not to
let her catch the ball, even from full court on. That was my role.  
  
Q. Jess, is this just a big sense of relief for the team, just to get past
this first game? You're a 2 seed playing the 7, the pressure is all on you,
not them. Do you think having gotten past this game and grinded it out that
this team will maybe relax a little bit, not be as tight tomorrow?  
JESS HARLEY: Yeah, it's always a great feeling to get a win under your belt.
TCU had that yesterday so we wanted it today so then tomorrow we'll be more
ready for the game, I feel like. We're going to have a shoot around in here so
we can shoot on these baskets more, so I think that will help us, also.  
  
Q. Coach, your team beat TCU twice in the regular season by a total of eight
points. What does it say about your team to be able to beat them again in the
tournament? It's really tough to beat a team three times in one season.  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, it is, and TCU is a tough match‑up for us. They were both
times, and it came down to the wire just like this game did. It didn't
surprise me. This was a tight game, and it came down to the wire. It didn't
surprise me we got behind. We've been behind a lot this season and always been
able to fight back and find a way to win at the end.  
Would I rather that not happen, absolutely, but it doesn't surprise me.  
  
Q. You used three point guards tonight, obviously needed to with the foul
trouble, but going forward do you feel comfortable using all three in that
role here?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, yeah, we got in foul trouble, and then Brooke Hampton is
coming off injury, and then Darius, I brought her off red shirt. So yeah,
we'll continue to do that.  
But we'll see who's playing well and that type of stuff, but you know, Brooke
is not in my opinion used to contact again and all that, so we'll just have to
play it by ear.  
  
Q. Taylor Palmer 4 of 5, 3 of 3 of three ‑pointers, didn't shoot a free
throw but had 11 points in 17 minutes. Has that been typical of her all
season?   
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, she's done a great job off the bench. She was picked sixth
player in the conference, sixth man, and that's why. She comes in and gives us
some offense, comes in and plays hard and is a senior, you know, so she
understands the pressure and that type of stuff. She's done that job for us
all year.  
  
Q. Along the lines of what I was talking with Taylor about, do you feel like
the players having gotten past this one, you hope that they'll relax and be a
little better tomorrow?  
MIKE CAREY: I hope so. I hope so. You know, my past experience has been even
if you go to an early tournament, usually the second day you play better than
you do the first day. You slow down a little bit. You don't have all that
energy and all that. We've been here since Thursday. It seems like it's about
time we played. So hopefully we'll come out and take care of the ball a little
bit better and execute a little bit better.  
  
Q. You talked about it Thursday before you left Morgantown you were
concerned with the foul shooting, you knew that was going to be key, 6 of 7
there in the last 1:15, and the one that Linda missed just folded in. Just the
foul shooting, your thoughts?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, again, we were missing some, but down the stretch I think
Linda Stepney stepped up there and hit four in a row, and then I think Jess
hit a couple, and then the one we did miss I think was Asya, and Jess was able
to get it. I was thinking the same thing. I know I was thinking it was 1‑and‑1
because we just got into the 1‑and‑1, so I was thinking it was 1‑and‑1 when we
missed, and then I'm thinking I'm wrong and then Jess puts it in, and I'm
like, Jess is a little bit smarter than I am. That was good thinking on her
part just to go ahead.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Tiffany Bias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22720)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Oklahoma State  67  
Iowa State  57

  
JIM LITTELL: Obviously very excited to beat a very good Iowa State team that
has played very well recently. They've won three out of their last four games
and played Baylor really tough, so we knew we were catching a team that was
really hot.  
Very pleased with the way we guarded tonight, the foundation of our program
for a long time has been defense and rebounding. We gave up too many open
looks in the first half, but I thought our kids really locked in and probably
played the best defense they've played all year long in the second half to
limit them to 20 points.  
We talked about it at halftime, having some patience offensively, making them
defend for longer into the shot clock. I thought Tiffany Bias was exceptional
running the offense tonight and controlling the tempo of the game, and
Brittney Martin by far her best game of the year on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when you guys got down early, what was your message to the rest
of the team being the leader?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Just to keep our heads up. We've gotten into a hole before at
the beginning and we worked our way back, so I think when we had the first
media time‑out, just we were one down and get a good set drawn up and then
execute it.  
  
Q. Was coach Littell's halftime message a threat or an inspiration? You came
out in the second half and had a really good spurt.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think we could take it as both. We could take it however we
want, whatever motivates us, I think.  
TIFFANY BIAS: It's always about inspiration, but I think there was a hint of a
threat in there. But no, I think that we all knew that we needed to start the
second half with a fire under us, and I think that we did that.  
JIM LITTELL: I'm denying that, by the way.  
  
Q. What's the difference between this game and when you played them a couple
weeks ago? Far different result.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Defense. I think that's the main thing. I think when we were at
home our defense was slacking a lot, and I think tonight we came out and we
played the best defense we have all year.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think the effort base was really what got us going in the
game and kept us in the game, so I think effort has changed.  
  
Q. Brittney, you guys came out and scored the first nine points the second
half, the first seven by Atkins. Talk about her contribution today.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: She does that in practice, too. When she gets on the floor
she plays hard and does what she needs to do. She was hot when she first came
in so we kept giving her the ball. She was working hard for it, getting
rebounds. She was just hot tonight, so I think she just took it over.  
  
Q. Tiffany, Iowa State made a late run in the second half and Suttles had a
big lay ‑up down low and also stepped out and hit a three at the perimeter.
Can you talk about her contribution late off the bench?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Kendra always has those great contributions, and I think that's
why she's deadly. She can step out and use shoot that three. She's been
rebounding for us all this game and she's played great defense on Hallie, and
I think that was a big play when she had that two‑footer and then hit that
three. That really got our momentum picked up again.  
  
Q. Coach, again, the difference between a couple of weeks ago and this game,
primarily defense as the girls said?  
JIM LITTELL: You know, we didn't do a good job of covering the three in the
last ballgame. They had 37 attempts and made 15. We just lost track of some
people in transition a week ago, and we made a commitment to make sure that we
got back and also tried to follow Christofferson a little bit more. But that's
a hard guard for us because she's a 6'3" post that can step outside.  
But I think we were just a lot more conscious after the first 10, 12 minutes
of the game about guarding the three line.  
  
Q. The first two or three minutes were your worst part of the game. What
were you seeing? Why off to the sluggish start and what happened the rest of
the game that you changed?  
JIM LITTELL: Well, I didn't think‑‑ for the most part I thought we competed
really hard in this entire game, but I didn't think we competed very hard in
the first five minutes, and we were giving open looks, we were giving drives
to the basket, and then offensively we had no patience. We were resulting in
taking quick jumpers. We didn't give the defense time to make a mistake. So at
the first media we just stressed that, hey, slow down, let's take care of the
basketball, let's make them work a little bit more, and we got to be conscious
of guarding the dribble drive. We gave up three open threes in the first three
or four minutes of the game, and you can't do that against Iowa State.  
  
Q. Jim, don't want to oversimplify this, but offense off turnovers, 17 ‑6 in
OSU's favor and points in the paint 40‑22\. I thought you really got the job
done off the turnovers.   
JIM LITTELL: We did, and Brittany Atkins turned the ballgame around to start
the second half. She got some run‑throughs defensively and just really gave us
a big spark. The 9‑0 run that was led primarily by her was the point of making
our kids believe that we could get back in the thing. You know, second‑chance
points, points over turnovers, we haven't done as well as we need to do the
last couple weeks, and it was very good for us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously we don't know who you're going to play tomorrow, but can
we get a couple thoughts on both teams for you for possible opponents for
tomorrow?  
JIM LITTELL: You know, Baylor obviously is very strong and features the best
player in the country. Kansas had a great comeback and are led by one of the
best post players, Chelsea Gardner.  
Baylor is indicative of their record, 26‑4, and having the leading scorer in
the nation, and they've got Nina Davis who's just a rebounding machine inside.
We've got our work cut out whoever we play, but we're glad to have the
opportunity to play Baylor or Kansas, whoever comes out of that game.  
  
Q. You guys have scuffled a little bit here the last few weeks. Today you
seemed to really grind out a good victory. Are you hoping that's the one that
you say, okay, hey, that kind of got us going again maybe?  
JIM LITTELL: You know, we have scuffled a little bit, but we've found a way to
get some wins out of that. I heard Fran Fraschilla say not too long ago that
you play great a third of the time, you play average a third of the time, and
you play poorly about a third of the time, and we've found a way this year to
win a lot of games this year when we haven't been as good as we need to be.  
These kids have found a way to win. Our effort level was much better today. I
hope that's a sign of games to come. Our defense was much better, and our shot
selection was much better.  
We've got ourselves in trouble the last couple weeks by being hurried and not
taking good shots, and I think that's indicative of shooting 50 percent from
the floor. We didn't shoot very well from the three, but I thought our shot
selection was much better.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Nneka Enemkpali](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24864)

### [Chassidy Fussell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26569)

### [Imani McGee-Stafford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24863)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Texas  82  
Oklahoma  72

  
KAREN ASTON: Extremely, extremely proud of our basketball team for a lot of
reasons. First of all, we haven't won a tournament game in a while, so that
was our first goal of the week was to win a tournament game, and we did that
tonight, and really, really proud of our composure. I thought that at halftime
they really reset themselves, which is a sign of a team that's beginning to
have terrific chemistry and growing up. By the time our coaches got in there,
they knew exactly what they needed to do, and really all we talked about was
slowing down. We were playing way too fast in the first half, and I thought
the beginning of the second half was probably the difference in the game
because it gave our team some confidence, and we took it from there and really
played solid defense, I thought, the entire second half.  
  
Q. With about six ‑and‑a‑half, Chass, how big of a shot was that at the
time?   
CHASSIDY FUSSELL: It was a really big shot just to give us the lift. We were
in a drought really. Karen called the play, and we just executed it really
well, and Nekia set a really great screen, and I hit the shot.  
  
Q. Ladies, how does it feel to come in here and get this first victory
against a rival team like Oklahoma?  
IMANI McGEE‑STAFFORD: I've never won a Big 12 Tournament game. Last time I was
here we lost, so it feels great because it's a new experience, and on top of
that, it's OU, so it's great. Like before the game, OU fans were posing in our
pictures with the horns upside down, so it's a real rivalry, and I think I
finally feel it because I'm not from Texas. It's great to win against a rival,
and we've just got to win again tomorrow now.  
  
Q. Nneka, coach said you guys huddled at halftime before the coaches got
there. What in particular was said between you guys?  
NNEKA ENEMKPALI: It was a refocusing for us. We've been in that position
before when we played them at home. I believe we were down about 12, and we
just needed to come together and realize that if we play our game defensively,
offense will come, and eventually things will be put together and we'll come
out with the win.  
  
Q. You guys played really good defense. You held them to 30 percent shooting
on the night, especially Ellenberg. What did you do to keep her so busy all
night?  
CHASSIDY FUSSELL: In the first half they came out 50 percent from the
three‑point line, so really it's another thing we talked about at halftime was
just playing defense and getting back to our character and what we're about.  
  
Q. Coach, you split with West Virginia in the regular season. What is it
going to take for you guys to come out victorious tomorrow?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, first of all, we need to get back to the hotel and get our
legs in some ice and get prepared for a really, really good basketball team.
When you play West Virginia you know first of all that they're going to play
terrific defense and you have to match their competitiveness defensively and
on the boards, and I think that it has been two really good games against them
just like it was against Oklahoma, so I expect it to be competitive. But it's
a quick turnaround for us, so it'll take some real focus on our team's part,
but they're really, really good.  
  
Q. Were there any adjustments made as far as Oklahoma making all the three
‑pointers in the first half? Did you say anything, do anything in the second
half?  
KAREN ASTON: We made a few adjustments during the second half. We switched
some screens which we didn't do much of in the first half. But I really
thought it was our attention to detail a little bit better, specifically at
the 4 position. I thought Kornet‑‑ well, not just Kornet, but Sharane Campbell
both hurt us in the first half at the 4 position hitting the threes, and we
really needed to pay a little bit more attention at that position. But I
thought that we also learned a little bit from our loss at Oklahoma because we
were in some of the same situations, late‑game situations, where defensively
we didn't do a good job at Oklahoma. We didn't hedge, we didn't switch when we
needed to. So I thought that our team probably learned from that experience
and made sure that they made the adjustments necessary.  
  
Q. Not really from an Xs and Os standpoint, but just you guys came out
strong, quick, scored points fast in the second half, and before OU knew what
was going on their five ‑point lead was now a deficit. Did you tell them to
come out that fast? Was that a focus, to start fast? I know you want to score
every trip down, but it seemed like they weren't matching your intensity
coming out of the half.   
KAREN ASTON: The only thing we talked about was winning the first four‑minute
game because I think every coach talks about four‑minute games and trying to
win them, but we focus a lot on winning the possession game, and the last two
four‑minute games of the first half, we lost both of those, so we really
didn't talk about anything other than this is one four‑minute game and we need
to win it, and not getting past that first four‑minute game, and I thought
they really focused on that and executed some things really well early in the
second half. I thought our bench was really good today, too. Everybody that
went in the game gave something, and it's really what our team is all about.
We don't have a superstar really, so it was a team effort.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Latricia Lovings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26544)

### [Zahna Medley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26543)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

TCU  75  
TEXAS TECH - 59

JEFF MITTIE: I thought Texas Tech played an outstanding, certainly, first
half. I thought they played very well. I thought our group was very resilient
and hung in there. Second half I thought, we‑‑ the difference for us was some
rebounding, hustle plays. I thought we had some big plays there. I thought our
defense created some offense. I thought Chelsea Prince at the front of the
zone was critical. And obviously we shoot 60 percent in the second half.  
This is a game where the baskets were pretty wide open. Both teams shot pretty
well. For us, I just think we were able to create enough turnovers to get some
offense.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys pulled away there in the second half, went on an 18 ‑3
run that spanned like seven‑and‑a‑half minutes. What were you able to do to
give you the advantage to pull away?  
JEFF MITTIE: I thought our defense created some open turnovers, some live
turnovers out front. Chelsea Prince, I get back to her at the front. We made a
little bit of an adjustment. We felt like they were getting us really wide so
we went with that I‑formation where Chelsea was at the top of it, and she was
able to create some havoc up there and obviously we got into a pretty good
rhythm. I thought on the offensive glass, we had some plays there, LT had some
big plays, I thought Ventress got on the glass better, so a little bit of
everything.  
  
Q. You have West Virginia coming up. The two games you played with them were
very close. What do you think you need to do to get over that hump tomorrow
night?  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, one, I think West Virginia is an outstanding team. We've
played well against them, but we'll see. We'll put together a game plan. I
think that they had such a great year. I think really for us it starts with
making sure that Bussie doesn't control the inside so much. She's such a
fantastic player. You talk about the shooters in Holmes, Taylor is an
excellent player, Stepney at the point I think is outstanding. We'll take a
look at the things that we can do a little bit better. Those things have come
down to we're not going to sneak up on them. We're not going to sneak up on
them. The two games we've had have been down to the last four minutes both
times. We're not sneaking up on them. They'll be ready to play, I'm sure.
We'll have to get some rest tonight and put together as good a game plan as we
can.  
Our team has played well, but I think we've done some decent things. When you
talk about West Virginia you've got to handle their defensive pressure first,
and then the second thing you've got to do is the things I talked about.
Bussie can't just own the glass all night long and then you've got to guard
their shooters. Other than that, not much (laughing). Other than that,
everything really, when you play a team like them.  
I will actually say this: I told my group the last time we played them in
Morgantown that I thought West Virginia was a top 10 team on tape, and because
they started outside the rankings they were very underrated. I think when we
played them 13. I actually told them top 8. I have that much respect for that
team, and you can see with them being co‑champions they've had an outstanding
year.  
  
Q. For both of you, tonight's game, big win, got the momentum. What are you
going to be table to take from this and moving into the West Virginia game?  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I think having poise and control, you know just staying with my
game plan and not ‑‑ they want a fast‑paced game. You just have to slow down
and play zone. We want a slower game, so just being in control on our offense
and defense.  
LATRICIA LOVINGS: I agree with Zahna, just play our game small. Tonight I
think they started‑‑ Texas Tech started out great, and we had to come back and
fight hard, and that's what we did, and just like we did the previous games
against West Virginia, we're going to have to grind it out the entire 40
minutes. That's what we're going to have to do tomorrow night.  
JEFF MITTIE: I will say one thing that I didn't mention earlier. Only one
turnover in the first half really kept us in it because the possessions, with
the way they shot the basketball, we had eight assists and one turnover in the
first half, so that was a huge key for us controlling the basketball. While I
thought we were a little edgy at times, I talked to our team at halftime about
poise and control the second half. Only having eight turnovers, that's a
really solid effort by our entire group.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Katya Leick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26538)

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

KANSAS  87  
KANSAS STATE  84 (OT)

  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, hard‑fought rivalry game, as it usually is when we line
up against KU. I felt, you know, this is a game in which really just one or
two plays down the stretch are going to separate you, and I was really proud
of the competitive intensity that we brought. I thought we battled very, very
hard through the course of the first 40 and all throughout the overtime.
Holding an offensive rebound here and there, holding the ball, simple little
turnovers sometimes separate you down the stretch, but all in all, I thought
we competed extremely hard and very proud of the way we fought through the
course of every minute out there to get that victory.  
  
Q. Coach, can you kind of just describe the last play that you drew up to
try to get the game ‑tying three‑pointer?   
DEB PATTERSON: Yeah, we were trying to set a wall screen and popped one of our
screeners to the corner. We were a little short on getting the space that I
had hoped that we would get, but still got Kindred out there to the corner,
got a big on her, Gardner, so it was hard to get a shot off at that point, and
just needed a dribble weave probably.  
But it was at that point 10 seconds looking for the three to tie it, and was
just hopeful we'd get that look or penetration kick or dribble weave three.  
  
Q. You mentioned Kindred, just the game that her and Breanna had. I know
it's tough tonight, but they probably set themselves up and it was a big
learning experience for the future?  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, I think we've seen great play from Kindred Wesemann
through the stretch here. As we've kind of gotten to the second half of Big 12
games, her confidence and her ability to impact the game and make us better
really escalated, so I was really proud of her growth. I told Kat in the
locker room after the game this was just a great individual effort in your
last game to show up and put the kind of game on the floor that she did
individually tonight was really impressive. You have to leave your career
feeling like it's very disappointing to experience the loss, but her
aggressiveness and her overall play tonight was fantastic, I thought.  
And then with another freshman here, Breanna Lewis, again, she's in there
battling against one of the best post players in our league, and I thought she
was an absolute warrior tonight, made great plays, defended extremely well
with great maturity. She was dialed in, and she's a young lady with a great
future ahead of her. Right about now, based on the way she competed this game
and the last couple games, you wish we had about 15 more to play because at
that point she might be turning that 20 into 30, which is pretty scary at this
point but also something really exciting to look forward to.  
  
Q. Coach, when you were up 16 points early, were you disappointed that you
weren't maybe able to keep your foot on the gas a little bit more?  
DEB PATTERSON: Well, you know at some point they're going to make a little bit
of a run at you. I thought we had a lot of wasted possessions during that
period of time. We got a little caught up on not defending the high on‑ball
screens well, came out at halftime and I think had that fix, but we gave him
them a little bit of momentum there on the defensive end. They started to get
some dribble penetration and most of their points during that time were off
the dribble and at the rim, so I thought we had a little leaking there
defensively. And at the same time we let that impact our ability to finish
shots, I thought, on the offensive end.  
Both ends for a while there got to be a bit of a struggle for us, so they're
just stepping up the ladder a little bit with those empty possessions and the
penetrations to the rim.  
Again, I thought we stopped the bleeding and got it fixed at halftime, thought
the kids stepped up and did a great job making those adjustments and putting
the game back at 50‑50.  
  
Q. Katya, it's such a young basketball team. How have you seen them grow as
the season progressed this year?  
KATYA LEICK: Absolutely, I think the growth that each and every one of our
freshmen have shown, let alone our sophomores and juniors, I think Lew is a
huge example of that along with Kindred and Leti. Every one of our freshmen
come into the gym every day and want to work hard. That's something I think
that is rare to find in a group of five freshmen that come in, and the
competitiveness and the amount of I guess you could say accountability we put
on each other I think shows the progress that we can make, and I think the
strides that we've made this season with our freshmen just shows the ability
where we can go, and I 110 percent believe in this team, and I cannot wait to
see what they have for next year. They're going to be great.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Chelsea Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24873)

### [Cece Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26537)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

KANSAS  87  
KANSAS STATE  84 (OT)

  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: It's how rivalry games should go down, don't you think?
Just, it's a rivalry game, it's a rubber match and in the Big 12 Tournament,
and it's we win or go home, and it was go back for us and it was all that.
Couldn't be more proud of the toughness we showed to get it into overtime.
They get the offensive rebound but we scored‑‑ think about it how many‑‑ three
of our out‑of‑state games, or seven games have been three points or less,
we've played more one‑possession games than any team in America I really
believe but we've not found ways to make plays on both ends. Chelsea's free
throws, we get the 50/50 loose ball finally and we get the stop at the end
with the three‑point game, and in those moments we've not done that. We've
been that close all year, and just excited for the kids that we were finally
able to get one, and it was that close.  
  
Q. Bonnie, just yesterday you were talking about being down 21 ‑0 to Kansas
State the last time you played them. This time you come out and get down
pretty big early, as well. Talk about the result of coming back from that?   
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Yeah, once we became more aggressive and they got eight
offensive rebounds probably in the first six or seven minutes, and we finally
cleaned that up. The difference was at our place I think we were still down
double digits and this one was a two‑ or three‑point game and we had a little
momentum going into the locker room because we cut it to nine at our place and
then it went back to 14 on three layups. So we didn't feel like, even though
we had cut it from 21, it was still 13, 14 so it felt different in the locker
room. The energy in the locker room was much different than at our place
because we still really hadn't gotten back. We eventually at the six‑minute
mark tied it up at our place, but it took us a while to do that where we cut
back into the deficit and made it a game at the half, and that worked
different. But give them credit, they came out just like they did at our place
and hit shots. They didn't shoot as well as they did at our place, but they
offensive rebounded and hit free throws, Wesemann hit three threes and Katya
hits a couple and it change defensively like we did with her. But a little bit
different in the locker room this time than at our place.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you talk a little bit about down six in overtime, just the
resiliency and the fight that you guys had to just capture this game?  
CHELSEA GARDNER: I thought we had a lot of energy and just not letting up and
just wanting to fight and staying with them and just making plays and going to
the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys handled Romero pretty well tonight and she didn't shoot
very well. Did you do anything special to defend her?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Well, probably nobody more excited a player than that kid
coming into this one coming into this after the showing at our place.
Honestly, we didn't have an answer. She had 26 and nine assists. We tried to
switch up the on‑ball screen and we played it three or four different ways
with her and then we started to go underneath, because she is trying to drive
and facilitate. She became a facilitator. At our place she was a scorer. She
was a scorer from the first possession. She took two pull‑up jump shots, so
her mentality appeared to be a little bit in this one early, where she just
got people shots. She did both at our place, but then at times she took over
certainly and scored and the kid's got mid‑range game and a three and the
ability to score at the rim. I thought we were a little bit more disruptive, I
thought, how we played and switched and tried to switch the match‑up a little
bit and not give her the same thing the whole time. Although we switched how
we played her in screens at our place as well. I think she became more of a
facilitator early here than she did at our place. She's good, though, heaven's
sake, she good.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys get another shot at Baylor tomorrow. It would
seem you guys are one of the few teams in the league that would be extremely
confident going into a game against them considering the last time you played
them you beat them. Can you talk about that momentum?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Keep in mind we play them tomorrow.  
CECE HARPER: I think it's all about just coming out confident and coming out
playing our game, just the prep that the coaches give us is amazing, just
knowing what we needed to do to put ourselves in the situation to win
tomorrow.  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: That's a good senior answer.  
CHELSEA GARDNER: I think we just need to fight, fight like we did tonight and
just fight, fight, fight. That's what I feel like we've got to do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about CeCe's play down the stretch in
regulation?  
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Yeah, probably three of the biggest ones in her career, the
and‑one and the two to grow the lead and get it to three. CeCe, defensively
how much different it feels when it's a three‑point game then it is a
two‑point game because we're switching everything, we're getting on everybody
to get beat off the dribble, let it go to the rim, let it be a two, fine, you
know what I'm saying where it's a two‑point game you're worried about
match‑ups switching everything because we're worried about it going to the
rim. Get an offensive rebound, you don't have to go rebound, you just stay at
the three‑point line. So those free throws turn into a three‑point game, but
essentially it's a whole lot different and we've been in those games where we
needed a three and the same thing happened to us to get that good look in
because of the switching and pushing and running off the line, and it was nice
for us to be in that situation where it was a three‑ and not a two‑point game.
Yeah, CeCe was aggressive and got to the rim and made good plays, and Nat
could be sitting up here with us, too, because she drove it, got fouls and
made free throws. When you look at a game like that, about being able to
score, when you're down six, you better find a way to score when the clock is
not running, honestly, and that's where we get back in it because how many of
those are when the clock is not running. Because we get back in it, because
I'm starting to talk to them about who we're going to foul. We call black,
black on, and all of a sudden we're back in it and I call 50. I was worried
for a second they were going to try to foul and I don't think they realized
that they could've got themselves back in it in two possessions because of the
and‑ones and the free throws.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that match ‑up and just what you were able to
do against them last time?   
BONNIE HENRICKSON: Well, we played a similar defense to them and honestly we
played the same thing when they had Griner. It's the exact same thing and Iowa
State has played it against them, as well. You're not going to‑‑ I don't think
it's possible to slow down‑‑ I haven't seen the Iowa State game. I watched our
game with them and what we did defensively, and I thought our coverage was
good, I thought we kind of hedged and got back and recovered and didn't really
commit, and with her we did. In the locker room we said, okay, what killed us
the first five minutes, they said she offensive rebounded on us, for a guy
that we're trying keep from touching the ball, she shot it and got her own
rebounds and other guys shot it and she got those rebounds, because it was
16‑3 at one point. They got all over us right away, because we got back in it
one possession at a time, we got some rebounds, we scored in transition, and
we rebounded the ball and they changed kind of how they played in the second
half and kind of answered that.  
They had to defend, and we don't have anybody in our league that can play her
one‑on‑one. We don't have anybody, let's just speak for me. We don't have
anybody that can sit down and guard her one‑on‑one because of how many
different ways she can score. I thought we brought help early, we got back and
rebounded and we made some big shots and drove it on them a little bit in
transition and we got some defensive rebounds, same thing how we got back in
this, we defensive rebounded and get some opportunities in transition.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Amber Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26545)

### [Ivonne Cook-Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26546)

### [Candace Whitaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25425)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

TCU  75  
TEXAS TECH - 59

  
CANDI WHITAKER: I thought we did a nice job of battling and being in the
ballgame and then had a big stand in the second half where we just couldn't
rebound it, get loose balls, get a stop and score on the other end, so TCU
went on a big run, and it was hard to recover after that run. But proud of our
team. They've been through a tough year, but they have always continued to
fight, and I'm really proud of that.  
  
Q. How big were Amber and Ivonne both tonight?  
CANDI WHITAKER: Man, they just, I thought, left it all out there. Amber played
40 minutes and Ivonne played 39. They were exhauster, but I thought they
played extremely hard on both ends, I thought they played every possession.
Ivonne stepped up and shot the ball extremely well, made big shots for us, and
Amber made big plays for us like she has all year. Really proud of both of
them and how they've developed over the year and how they've come along, and
excited to get to the offseason with them.  
  
Q. Amber, what was working so well defensively for you all in the first
half?  
AMBER BATTLE: I think just being active and calling out screens early and
communicating with each other. I think that really helped us. Following our
scouting report and really knowing their plays and executing our defenses.  
  
Q. Ivonne, after losing all of your conference games, was there a point when
TCU started to go on that run when you thought, here we go again, we have to
try to fight back?  
IVONNE COOK‑TAYLOR: Yes. We had our moments where we kind of like let down,
which we shouldn't, and that's something we definitely have to work on.  
  
Q. Coach, going into spring you only lose two seniors, so what was your
message to the girls in the locker room?  
CANDI WHITAKER: You know, that it's been tough, and I know that. They're
stronger for going through this season, as am I, but I'm excited to get them
in the offseason. I told them I'm already counting the weeks that we have
together and just what that's going to be about, that we have to have a fire
in us, that we are going to move this program forward, and we're never going
to leave this program or have this program in this situation again.  
A lot of young players, and we want to really evaluate where can we help them
get better. Our staff does a great job of developing players. It's something
we're proud of. We're going to work hard this spring developing weaknesses and
continuing to get better at our strengths.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you guys are really young. Obviously you guys start three
freshmen, and then a junior. A lot of momentum from this game even though you
didn't win. Is that going to lead you into next season?  
CANDI WHITAKER: Yeah, it's going to have to. I told them you never want to
lose, but when you do lose, you want to feel like you tried as hard as you
could and you left it on the floor. As long as they can look in the mirror and
say that, then I think you have a better feeling moving forward. We've got a
lot of work to do, and I think we have, again, the right staff that will help
get these players where they need to be, and I think they're the right kind
that want to be great, so we'll get to work here in the offseason.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Connie Yori.  
COACH YORI: We're an hour and a half late getting here. I didn't have time to
change my clothes. So pardon me for my casualness. But we have four starters
returning. Right now those four kids are playing very well. We have T, B, E
and Hai. That's Tear'a Laudermill, Brandi Jeffery, Emily Cady, and Hailie
Sample have been a big part of our success these past few years. They're
playing really good basketball.  
And they're showing great leadership and, of course, we have Rachel Theriot
who is returning as a First Team All‑Conference player who is playing really
well right now.  
From there, we have a lot of question marks, largely because we don't have a
lot of experience. And we have seven new players to ourprogram‑‑ six freshmen
and a junior college player who they're all a work in progress.  
I think we'll see them progress throughout the season and I think we're going
to see different kids at different times contribute for us, and we're going to
have to. We'll have to have some of our new players play at least a small role
and expand as they get better.  
So that will be a big part of whether we have success this year is how our new
kids do for us.  
  
Q. Coach, how have the returning players, the leaders, helped the newcomers
in their transition?  
COACH YORI: Well, our leadership is outstanding. We've had‑‑ you look at our
four seasons in our program as I mentioned and Rachel Theriot who I basically
consider as a senior because of the experiences she's had.  
Those guys understand what it takes to win. They understand the expectations
that we have in our program. They're not only great really good leaders by
example but several of them have taken on even a greater vocal leadership
role.  
We've always gotten that with Emily Cady. She's been a vocal leader for the
last couple of years. Rachel, even though she's a quiet leader, she's really
good behind the scenes as a vocal leader. And I think some of our other
seniors have taken on a greater role in that area.  
But in terms of leadership by example, those five don't have a lot of
questions from that standpoint. So our young players have great role models on
an everyday basis in our practice setting.  
  
Q. How excited are you to have Rutgers and Maryland in this league?  
COACH YORI: You asked the question excited?  
  
Q. You can phrase it however you like.  
COACH YORI: It's just made our league stronger. That's a good thing for fans.
It's a good thing for the media. Doesn't make it easier for the coaches and
players. I know our players love to play against great competition. But it
makes it harder to win basketball games.  
And the expansion to an 18‑game schedule I think makes the Big Ten even more
challenging. It's been such a great league for a number of years. And one of
the best in the country. And I think now with the addition of those two
programs, I mean, we have a chance to I think consistently be the best league
in the country.  
  
Q. You were in the situation that Vivian Stringer and Brenda Frese were just
a couple of years ago, I guess, but what are the biggest challenges when
you're coming into a new league?  
COACH YORI: You have to just learn‑‑ in these guys' case, they have to learn
13 new teams. At that point we had to learn 11, about 11 new teams. They only
have tolearn ‑‑ we only have to learn about two new teams, and at the point we
were coming in, everybody else only had to learn coming about Nebraska.  
So there's just a lot of depth to that, and I think now as you get into a
league, you have a better understanding of what coaches are going to do in
certain circumstances. You don't always know that when you have new coaches in
the league or new programs or new institutions coming to the league.  
So for those guys‑‑ I'm not feeling sorry for them. I'm going to tell you
right now. Because I think they'll take care of what they need to take care
of. They're two really well‑coached programs with great experience at the head
coaching position, and I think they'll do fine.  
  
Q. You talked about the four kids coming back, but the one loss, Jordan, was
possibly the most nightmarish matchup maybe in the league over the last couple
of three years. Did you have somebody ‑‑  
COACH YORI: I was trying to stay positive and then you go right down that road
(chuckling). Of course losing a player of Jordan's caliber changes who we are.
And there was such a focus from our opponents on her and she was essentially
face guarded in every game.  
What this does for us is it changes our spacing on the offensive end. It makes
some other players going to have to expand their games that have played a lot
for us.  
And Jordan leaves the Nebraska program as one of the best scorers and best
rebounders of all time. We've had a history of pretty good women's basketball.
So you lose the First Team All‑American and at least in one poll the Big Ten
Player of the Year, that's a big loss.  
We're trading seven for one. Right now, you know, we could take those seven
kids and put them together and maybe we could make Jordan, but we're not quite
there yet.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of emphasis and talk about this league, particularly
over the years how much more athletic, how fast, how much faster it's gotten
and a lot of emphasis particularly obviously with Maryland coming in and
Rutgers on the run. How much of your strategy will be on the running game as
opposed to the strengths that you have in the half court?  
COACH YORI: Well, we always have been a team that pushes the ball. We push on
makes and we push on misses. And there's not a lot of teams that do that.  
We were a really good half court execution team last year, too. But we were a
team that focused on transition, and we got a lot of stuff in transition. So
we'll continue to do what we do. But we better get back, get back in defense
and transition. There's some things there that sometimes you have to send two
back when you're playing against transition teams but we've been a team that
hasn't given up a lot of easy baskets over the years.  
Hopefully we continue to do what we do and keep playing our version of
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State coach Coquese Washington.  
We'll go straight to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've lost Maggie and a couple of other really, really good players. And
you've been like three ‑time defending regular season champions, where are you
right now as a team?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Where are we right now as a team?  
  
Q. Yeah, without those people.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, we're trying to find our identity. We'll definitely be
a different team. When you lose the four seniors we lost and the contributions
that they gave to the team, the leadership that they provided for the team,
you know we're clearly going to be a different team and we're really young. So
we've got the majority back, the majority of our team.  
And haven't had a ton of playing experience. I think we're going to be‑‑ like
I said at the beginning of the season last year, it's going to take time to
figure out what our identity and as players, who is going to step up and those
kind of things.  
That's the fun part I think about coaching college basketball is having the
opportunity to watch the young people grow, develop their confidence,
develop‑‑ each team developing their own style of play.  
So I'm excited about watching us figure out and determine who we're going to
be this year.  
  
Q. With that being said, who has stepped up as a younger player because of
the experience of going to the Sweet 16 for you so far in practice and who has
looked more confident because of that?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I certainly think, first of all, Tori Waldner, our senior,
she's a senior. She's a captain. She's been around a while. She's been a part
of all three Big Ten championship teams. She's played in the NCAA Tournament
all three of her seasons.  
So her experience has been extremely critical. With regard to our younger
players, I would say Peyton Whitted and Kaliyah Mitchell got the most
experience last year, and they've been able to step up and show a little bit
of understanding and accepting a bigger role this year.  
But I've also been really pleased with Sierra Moore and her explosiveness, and
Lindsey Spann is really a true freshman for us in the sense she didn't play at
all last year. She's showing some good things.  
It's really, really early for us. We've had about a week and a half of
practice and roles are still being fashioned at this point.  
  
Q. Follow up talking about your team's identity. But do you have a vision
for this team of how you see it at some point?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, the vision is very similar to what we've done in the
past. We still want to be up tempo. We still want to get up and down the
floor. Just how we do it may be a little bit different.  
We probably will focus and emphasize post play a little bit more this year
than maybe we have in the past. And the biggest thing for us is going to be
experience. So we've got to get on the floor.  
These kids have got to get out there and they've got to play on the Big ten
Network, they've got to play in front of 10,000 fans so we can really see how
they'll perform on the biggest and the strongest moments. So that's why I said
it's still really early for this team.  
In years past, when you've got four, five seniors or four or five juniors and
seniors that have played a lot, you know, it's a little easier to kind of
figure out what the identity is.  
But we've got one senior and two juniors and those two juniors haven't played.
So we're a really young team and it's going to take us some time to create
that identity and our coaching staff will be patient to allow that to happen.  
  
Q. How would it affect your coaching to not have that player on the floor
that can suddenly go off for 20 points in five minutes?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, I'm going to miss Maggie a little bit. But you don't
replace a kid like Maggie Lucas with one person. It's going to be‑‑ we're
going to have to replace her impact with the team. Everybody's gotta do a
little bit more. Everybody's gotta step up and really do what they're capable
of doing.  
So we'll definitely miss her, but the team will be different. And when we had
that player like you said who was capable of going off, we were able to play a
certain way. So we'll just have to adjust to the personnel that we have and
I'm confident that we'll do that.  
  
Q. Could you just briefly speak to the newcomers, what does Maryland overall
bring to the table in terms of style of play and some adjustments you'll have
to make and the same for Rutgers?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm really, really excited about Maryland and Rutgers
joining the conference. I definitely think it makes our conference more
competitive. It certainly I think heightens the reputation of our conference.
And I think the conference will be better for them having joined the Big Ten.  
As you noted, some different styles of play. Rutgers, Coach Stringer, they're
going to be really aggressive defensively and strong defensive unit.  
And you have to worry about their athleticism. And Maryland has always been a
very strong rebounding team. They get up and down the floor and they like to
play fast.  
So I think that the one thing that is really, really fun about playing in the
Big Ten is we have such a variety of styles from every team.  
So every night you're coaching against a different style and it makes it
really fun to coach, because it's not the same thing night in, night out. And
I think it prepares us for postseason play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Sharon Versyp.  
We'll start with an opening statement.  
COACH VERSYP: Yes, just very excited for the Big Ten to start. Welcoming
Maryland and Rutgers into our league again has just made our conference bring
it to another level, and I think that's very exciting. And I agree with what
Vivian said of we've always said the Big Ten top to bottom has been the
strongest league in the country. And now adding those two is just going to
hopefully continue to grow our conference and be able to march on during March
Madness.  
As for our team, we're very excited. Two years ago, no one thought that we
could replace Sam Ostarello and Drey Mingo and their scoring and rebounding,
and we were able to do that collectively.  
Now we have to make up for about 30 points and a lot of guard play. So we're
going to have to do it by committee. But very excited about the challenge
ahead with our young team as well as going into the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You talked about the strength of the league from top to bottom. Where the
Big Ten has struggled has been in the NCAA Tournament. And that probably is
why they're not considered with the other leagues. What does the Big Ten have
to do to consistently have that team in the Elite Eight and a couple in the
Sweet 16?  
COACH VERSYP: Just do what we're doing. I mean, we've got new coaches in our
league but you add Maryland and Rutgers. Maryland was a Final Four team.
That's why they're number one in the Big Ten this year. And it will all work
itself out and we'll continue to beat each other up and we're going to get
better that way.  
But that's something that all of us have discussed, and we need to continue to
do. But I think we have a very young league. Our players are very, very young
and I think you're going to see a big boom the next two to four years.  
  
Q. Last year the league as a whole took a jump offensively, and your team
did too. Is there more room for growth not only with your team from an
offensive standpoint but for the league to make another jump this year?  
COACH VERSYP: We discussed that last night when all of us coaches were
together. I think it continues with the style of play and the officials and
the rules, the freedom of movement, allowing players to get to the basket and
I guess the physicality of the game to back down a level.  
I think that will just continue to grow. And our league has, again what Coach
Stringer said, has skilled and talented players. I think there's always room
for growth.  
And I think hopefully you'll see another jump another four to five points.  
  
Q. When Rutgers and Maryland were announced, what were your feelings then
about actually picking up two new teams with two powerhouse teams with big
traditions?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's fantastic. We want to be the No. 1 conference in
the country. And we've been 2 and 3 here and there and we have to be
successful as we make that jump but you knew there was going to be a lot of
movement in the conferences.  
So it's just another‑‑ it's exciting. You get to go to the East Coast. I know
for them it's very difficult. They've got to work with 12 new teams, and
they're the ones who have to travel the furthest. So it's difficult on their
end.  
But you want to be the best. That's why we're in our professions. That's why
our student‑athletes come to our schools and again, we just need to forge
forward and enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. Who is that natural leader? For so long it was Courtney Moses, Kay Kay.
The complexion of your team has changed a little bit both from a leadership
perspective on and off the court. Who are the one or two leaders that does
that for you?  
COACH VERSYP: It's a combination. April Wilson is going to be our point guard
and our leader. She played with Kay Kay and Courtney for two solid years. Last
year she ran the point and had great experience playing with those two.  
So she has to do that on and off the court. Whitney Bays, our sixth player,
she's that emotional leader on the floor. She's that performer. And Liza
Clemons is really the one that's the glue to the team. Off the court she's an
amazing, amazing leader. But on the court she's kind of the point forward for
us, can really help April out quite a bit. Has been in the system for a long
time, and she's extremely effective scorer.  
Those three of our captains. So I think those three are I guess the big three
for us and they have to get our young kids‑‑ we have five freshmen. So we've
got to make sure they've done a great job with them.  
  
Q. You're going back to the 18 ‑game conference schedule which you guys
pulled away from a few years ago, what are your feelings about that?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I'll just reiterate what Bobbie said. We don't have a
choice in the matter. I think 18 games is what we have to go with. It's
obviously difficult and it compresses our schedule quite a bit. We don't have
much freedom to do some things in the non‑conference. So as we say it is what
it is and we just have to forge forward and just reality.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us next is head coach Vivian Stringer.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH STRINGER: Let me first of all say that I'm excited to be back. I
recognize some of those faces, and it's coming full circle and it feels good
to be a part of the Big Ten. And I'm just hoping that we can add to the
already storied program and the kind of opinion that people have across the
country.  
So we know that it's going to be tough. We're excited about that. But we do
come with a veteran team and one that is itching and excited about the
possibility of, one, qualifying for the NCAAs and going much further. So with
that, I'll leave it to you.  
  
Q. It's been a long time since you've been in the league. How do you see the
Big Ten differently maybe than you did when you left the league after you left
Iowa?  
COACH STRINGER: I see the Big Ten different top to bottom that the Big Ten is
a much stronger conference. There was no question that the Big Ten had
tremendous success. I think that during the time that I was there it was, if
you will, top‑heavy with Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue that were really a part of
the national scene and part of the national scene on a consistent level.  
There's no way that you can say that now. It would be those schools for sure.
But in addition to that now you've got Nebraska and Michigan State and
Michigan, and there is no one that you can count out.  
Like Bobbie Kelsey just said, her team will be experienced and ready to go,
top to bottom. And just to be part of a conference that has the kind of
academic and athletic prestige is just something very special for Rutgers.  
When I first went to Rutgers, I really felt that that's where we belonged.
That was our footprint, you know. Large land‑grant university with academic
prestige. And now to see this become reality is just so very special.  
But top to bottom I can't think of one team that is weak in the Big Ten. This
is a power conference and with the addition certainly of Maryland, I didn't
see any weakness then before and I certainly don't see any now. It's much,
much, much stronger.  
  
Q. I believe you return everybody from last year, at least all your
starters. Is that correct?  
COACH STRINGER: You believe that I‑‑  
  
Q. All your starters are back from last year?  
COACH STRINGER: Yes.  
  
Q. You had one or two freshmen last year that looked very special. Could you
just talk about them a little bit?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, I think that probably the one that's most outstanding in
your mind is Tyler Scaife, a young lady who played with no fear and just
played like she had been playing for 20 years and she returns much the same.
But I will say this: I think that the people who needed to be much more
confident and much stronger have really demonstrated that. And I'm really
excited.  
I think that two of the people that really are showing tremendous growth and
experience is Ariel, a young lady from the inside, and we needed that to
happen, as well as Kahleah Copper. And for sure Briyona Canty who many thought
she would be a great player from the beginning, it was just that she had open
heart surgery. She had knee problems the first year. And she had open heart
surgery her second year.  
And now she's playing with the level of confidence and the skill that we saw
when we recruited her. So even with those two‑‑ and in addition to that we've
recruited young ladies that can shoot the 3. Now, we had to go to California,
and we had to go to Utah to find them but we'll go wherever we need to get
what we need and they come in to get us that, give us that.  
  
Q. How would you define overall looking at the Big Ten, how would you define
the overall style of play and how does that style of play work to your
advantage, and if it doesn't, what adjustments do you have to make to make
sure that you can be extremely competitive?  
COACH STRINGER: Let me say this, I haven't had an opportunity to study the Big
Ten as well as I know that we will. But overall the style of play there,
highly skilled athletes that have outstanding coaches that are able to take
advantage of those skills.  
You have stretch 4s. You have people on the inside that are just throwing the
ball against the backboard. They know how to shoot it, when to shoot it.
They're just fundamentally very, very strong and you have people that work
hard and they're disciplined.  
And the game, while you want athletic people and you always need to have that,
you also need to have a high level of intelligence and discipline.  
And so the difference for us coming into the Big Ten is as I've shared with my
assistant coaches, you don't necessarily study the athlete. You can study them
for the skill that they may bring to a thing we want to be done whether it's a
3‑point shot or a drive, it is the coach that you study. And so in this case
we've got all new coaches.  
So it's a lot of work on our part, while they will look to study us, one team.
And Maryland, we have an entirely different job. So our styles are going to be
different. And I know they're going to offer the same kind of flavor that when
we were in the Big East we had all types of coaches doing a number of
different things that I think in our situation and being in the Big Ten really
best prepared us to handle what was going on on the national scene.  
And this is going to be much of the same and now with the addition of Maryland
as well as Rutgers, this is amazing.  
I'm excited. I'm excited. Excited. Excited for the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Marlene Stollings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27751)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Stollings.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH STOLLINGS: Good morning. I would just like to say that I'm thrilled to
be a Gopher and really excited about this team that we have inherited.  
Obviously Rachel being picked Preseason Player of the Year is exciting for us
as well as her. Amanda Zahui, returning post player, extremely talented. And
someone not many of you know about yet is Shae Kelley, a fifth‑year transfer
that we picked up from Old Dominion, who is here with us today as well. An
extremely talented, versatile player that we're looking to do big things for
us this year.  
  
Q. What kind of style of ball can we expect to see from your team?  
COACH STOLLINGS: We want to play an up‑tempo style. I'm big on offense. And we
like to play an exciting style that's fun for young ladies to play in as well
as very exciting for our fans to watch.  
We will run an opportunistic break, take early shots in our offense when
they're available, and we will also run a variety of quick hitters to try to
exploit defensive weaknesses as well.  
  
Q. What would be your biggest challenge in terms of taking over a team, and
what player has helped you in your transition in that regard?  
COACH STOLLINGS: I think one of the biggest challenges in taking over any
program is just implementing your style and your system. But our young ladies
have been extremely coachable. They've been a real joy to coach and our system
is very different than what they're used to. We've challenged them as much on
pace of the game, fitness level and things of that nature as anything. And
they've responded very well thus far.  
We're very pleased with the progress that they've made in those areas. But I
think just the changing of the system, implementing of the new system and them
obviously buying into what we want to do and where we want to go.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Carlie so far and what are your expectations for
her freshman year?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Carlie has matured beyond her years. Very talented freshman
we have coming in who is a scorer. And we love scorers. And not unlike any
freshman, she's adapting to the college level, the pace of the game, the
physicality, just what it means to be a student and an athlete at the same
time.  
But outside of those things, she's advancing very quickly. Her physical
conditioning, level of fitness and all that is well beyond most freshmen that
we see coming in. Her basketball IQ is solid. And just learning the game at
this level and the intricacies of it will take a little bit of time. But her
potential is very high.  
  
Q. Coming in it had to be great to be able to know that you're inheriting a
Rachel and Amanda. Is there a third element, though, that really excited you
about this team ‑‑ two‑part question. And then what is the one thing that you
looked at that said you know what, this has got to improve?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Thank you for the question. It's a relief on some level. This
is my third head coaching job in four years. A little bit unexpected in the
profession but nonetheless very grateful for it and two previous programs had
to come out of enormous holes if you will.  
At Minnesota, we inherited, as you've said, some talent. And I think that we
want to even overachieve, if you will, with that this year. Minnesota
historically is a program that is well‑known in women's basketball. And we
feel it's a program that should be in the national spotlight annually and
should be looked on as a top 25 program annually.  
Our goal is to take it there. And in answering your question in terms of other
players, potentially, that could step in and help us with the progression, I
think, Kayla Hirt is someone who is very experienced that we think can be
somewhat of an X factor for us this year. Some other young ladies, Mikayla
Bailey, Joanna Hedstrom that didn't see a lot of minutes fit our system very
well. And their ability to score will show through in how we play.  
  
Q. You brought Shae Kelley, came kind of not with you but where you were
last year. I saw her last year in Columbus, but how does she fit with these
kids and what is she going to do for you do you think to help you get your
style in your place?  
COACH STOLLINGS: She's our first signee and her game reflects the type of
player that we want to ultimately bring into our system. She's very versatile.
She's very athletic. She can play a couple of different positions.  
She can face‑up, step out and shoot the 3s. She can take players off the
bounce to the basket and is explosive in the open court as well as a solid
rebounder.  
So what she will bring is the ability to spread our offense and put a lot of
pressure on the defense in who they want to guard or who they want to
potentially double team.  
I think it will alleviate a lot of double teams from Amanda. I think it will
also open Rachel up even more. But it's going to be difficult to double team
players like Amanda or even Rachel potentially with Shae on the floor as well.  
  
Q. I know you knew of Rachel Banham before you took the job, but having her
every day in practice, what's that been like, and has she shown you things you
weren't expecting?  
COACH STOLLINGS: She has been a real joy. I will say that. We've had several
meetings since my arrival. We think her potential is I think even way greater
than she saw in herself. She's been very coachable and we've challenged her in
some areas of her game to raise to her level, and she's responded.  
I think you're going to see Rachel play at an even higher level than you've
seen previously due to her work ethic and desire to have an unbelievable
senior year and take this team to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Maryland and Michigan State have been voted 1, 2 in the conference by the
coaches and the media experts. Might you be one of the teams that is slightly
under the radar and could pose a threat before all said and done?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, we certainly don't mind being under the radar, being
somewhat of an underdog. Our expectations for the program are very high. We
certainly want to hang banners, want to win championships. So that is our
goal. That will be our goal annually.  
Those other teams are extremely talented and well‑deserving of the votes they
received for that preseason positioning. And I think that we're in a position
where we have to prove ourselves and where we want to take this team and our
kids know that and they've accepted the challenge of that.  
  
Q. With the addition of Rutgers and Maryland to the conference this year and
you being a new coach, what's your take on that, and what adjustments do you
see being made?  
COACH STOLLINGS: They've certainly helped make an elite conference even more
elite. I wasn't even born when‑‑ haven't been coaching as many years as Vivian
has and wasn't born when she started coaching.  
I have the utmost respect of the coaches in this league. 20‑year veterans and
basketball IQ in this league from a coaching standpoint is tremendous.  
It's exciting as a younger coach in the league to be challenged night in night
out going against some of the best and we certainly want to prove ourselves in
that environment. But it's certainly exciting.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Teri Moren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27752)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Indiana head coach Teri Moren.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MOREN: Well, it's an exciting time of the year for us at Indiana. And as
he mentioned, we have three returners. We feel like we have some momentum.
Anytime you win 20 games, winning breeds confidence. So we certainly have some
momentum on our side.  
We have a terrific player in Larryn Brooks, as most of you know. But we really
feel like with our freshman class that we've brought in some perimeter players
that can take some pressure off her and give her some much needed help.  
We understand that we have a lot of work to do. There's a lot of work to still
be done. But we're excited with the progress that we've made thus far with the
new coaching staff. And we just look forward each and every day just getting
better.  
  
Q. Coach, the coaching change at Indiana, Curt's leaving, was very sudden
and very unexpected. How much work did you have to do with the players to get
them past that sudden shock?  
COACH MOREN: That's a great question. It did. It happened suddenly. And one of
the things‑‑ our priority number one was building the relationship with our
players.  
There's no question that we are behind when we got there in August and a lot
of areas. But our number one priority with the staff was to build those
relationships with our players we needed to get to know who they were, what
they stood for, get them on the floor, evaluate their skill set.  
And one of the things I told them from the beginning is that we want them in
our office as much as they could be in and out throughout in terms of between
classes.  
And they've done a great job. I think they wanted to know us as much as we
wanted to get to know them.  
But I will tell you one thing about young people: I don't think we give them
enough credit for them being resilient and them being able to adapt and adjust
and move forward. And that's what I found with this group, is that they were‑‑
although it was a sudden change and it might have been surprising, that they
were ready to put that behind them and move forward with our staff and look
forward to the future.  
  
Q. This is probably one of the more heralded freshman classes Indiana has
had in quite time, now that you have had a couple weeks to work with them in
practice, do you see any of them starting, playing starter's minutes at all?  
COACH MOREN: It's too early to tell. We don't have any starters, per se, other
than perhaps it's going to be awful difficult to leave Larryn Brooks out of
the starting lineup right now with what she brings to the table.  
But to your point, Tyra Buss has really been great.  
I think the most surprising freshman for us thus far has been Amanda Cahill.
She's been terrific at that stretch four spot, but her ability to be around
the ball, rebound and just make plays while we've been in scrimmage
situations, that's been a nice surprise.  
And I think Jess Walter will give us a lot of much‑needed minutes. Jess is one
of those kids that does everything at game‑like pace and tempo, and that's
sometimes hard to coach. And she's been great.  
And Marra Muensterman from Evansville will find time at that combo guard spot
at some point.  
But our freshmen have been terrific. They've been extremely coachable. They've
been eager and excited to get better, and all four of them want to be coached.
And that's been, like I said, exciting for our staff.  
  
Q. I've never seen one of your teams play before. So could you maybe tell me
your style of play and what you found in the gym so far with the talent that's
there, how it fits with the way you like to play?  
COACH MOREN: Well, there's talent in the gym. And I can tell you this, they
like the offensive end a lot. Where I'm a little bit different is that every
stop that we've made we've always hung our hats on the defensive end. And
that's really been our emphasis here beginning has really‑‑ we've spent a lot
of time on that end defending and rebounding the ball.  
This is a group like I said that loves offense. They love to shoot that 3. And
that's okay. But on the nights that the 3 ball is not falling we need to rely
on something. What we've really tried to hammer home to our group is that
we've got to be able to defend and rebound on the nights that that's not
happening.  
So hopefully as we move forward with our program and our basketball team, I
want our identity to be on the defensive end. And, like I said, that's just
philosophy. That's what I've found to help us be successful and our kids in
every spot, they've really bought into that.  
So right now it's not that our players at Indiana aren't buying into that, it
just wasn't emphasized in the past, and that's up to our staff to make sure
that they understand that the defensive end is going to be as important and
maybe more important than the offensive end.  
  
Q. Will you try to institute your own offensive system, or are you trying to
mix what the girls already know and what they're familiar with?  
COACH MOREN: Sure. That's one of the things that we talked about when we took
the job, that we were not going to try to reinvent the wheel with this group.
The high ball screen or the wing ball screen offense that they have run in the
past, they found a lot of success. They like that.  
It gives players a lot of freedom.  
We've ran that at some other places I've been in. We haven't gone away from
that. The only thing we wanted to do as a staff is just make some subtle
tweaks to it and then add in some of the things that we've done at our other
places in hopes that we can put our players in positions to get
high‑percentage shots.  
We don't want to rely on the 3‑point shot night in, night out, but right now
our personnel is probably not going to allow us to really try to emphasize
getting the post and getting the ball inside as much as I would prefer.  
But that will be down the road with our recruiting. That will all change once
we have some different personnel and we have a better balance I think to our
roster. So we look forward to that.  
But right now I think our kids are‑‑ we didn't want to change a whole lot just
because of the confidence that they have in that offense. And they've
continued to be open, though, to some of those subtle tweaks like I mentioned
to change a little bit of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Suzy Merchant.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MERCHANT: Just excited to be here and be part of the Big Ten Media Day
and certainly with the anticipation of what the possibilities are for a new
season.  
So we're excited. Three returning starters back and a great group of
upperclassmen and vets that I think will lead us to hopefully promising places
and a really, really talented group of three freshmen that came in as well.  
So I will open it up for questions.  
  
Q. You mentioned upperclassmen. But a couple of your kids, your freshmen
last year, got playing time maybe quicker than up might think and one of them
is on the All ‑Big Ten Preseason Team here. But basically in the new class, do
you have any surprises like that who might make real quick impacts and in what
way?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, certainly, I mean, we were led ‑‑ last year our two
leading scorers were freshmen that led us to a Big Ten Championship in terms
of scoring. But I do, I think there's two kids on our roster that are freshmen
and a third depending on a little bit of how she comes along, will certainly
have the opportunity to be impactful.  
But probably the two out of the gates that I think we'll see a lot of playing
game is Jas Lumpkin and also Lexi Gussert. Those two, those kids and Kennedy
Johnson, the third, all have a very high IQ for the game and pick up things
very quickly.  
And obviously it's a very positive thing but they're also playing multiple
positions. The versatility in our system and the balance that we need in order
to have a really strong offensive attack is important to be able to move
people around. And they've been able to do that in the first week or so of
practice. That's been really impressive.  
I think Lexi and Jas I think you'll see significant and depending on Kennedy's
development in the post, she will certainly contribute as well.  
  
Q. Last year Tori Jankoska I think you had to play a lot more minutes at
point guard than maybe you would have expected one year ago at this time. How
do you see her role being different this year or what do you expect out of
Jankoska this year?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think the positive thing with Tori playing the point, is to
me I've had a lot of great point guards that usually ended up being more
deferring point guards, kids that defended a presence and ball presence that's
the things I talked about with great ball play. High volume shooters aren't
usually one of them.  
But with Tori at the point, she brings a nice dynamic to our offense. When we
move her and Klarissa Bell last year, kind of went back and forth at the
point, gave us a little bit more firepower offensively. I thought that was a
big difference maker for us.  
  
Q. You've probably had more than your share of injuries over the last few
years.  
COACH MERCHANT: You think?  
  
Q. Yeah, I do. How healthy is your team now? Do you have any physical
problems?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yes, we have physical problems. As many of you know, I get
asked a lot about Madison Williams. She's had four ACLs and a total of seven
surgeries. Just had another one on Thursday to clean some things up. So bless
her heart.  
She's really in a place right now where she's just trying to be able to live a
normal life, honestly, not wake up in pain. And we lost Branndais Agee this
summer, who had a great postseason, really second half of the season, but
great postseason for her. She blew her ACL in the summer. That's been a little
frustrating.  
We've had some kids nicked up a little bit, couple concussions here and there.
I don't know, maybe it's something in the water in East Lansing, I'm not sure.
We've had our share. But we're coming back. Those two kids obviously will be
out, but everybody else is practicing and healthy at this point and/or coming
back.  
  
Q. Last year the conference as a whole took a jump offensively. Some of it
patterned after the rule changes. But do you see more growth, not only for
your team offensively, but for the league as a whole?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, definitely. I mean, I've always sort of, in my career,
kind of built the foundation off the defensive side of the ball, we've been
extremely successful on the defensive side. For me to try to open up things a
little bit more, we've done some things in the past, I know from my
perspective to grow the game a little bit and give the kids a little bit more
freedom offensively.  
I do think the rule changes have helped, the freedom of movement, protecting
the shooter, protecting the ball handler, I think, has really changed the game
in a positive way.  
So I think for a women's basketball perspective, it was positive. I think
early on, just from a fan‑‑ some of the things I heard from fans and certainly
from coaches there was a lot of hand checking early until we got used to that
rule which meant a lot of free throws and kind of became a free‑throw shooting
contest early on.  
But I thought we adjusted well as a group. I thought the Big Ten Conference
did a nice job with that and had some really exciting players and offensive
schemes that people enjoyed watching.  
  
Q. Quick question on just your overall thoughts or I should say specific
thoughts on Maryland and also on Rutgers coming to the league, what do they
bring to the table and how do you adjust?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, I think our league has always had a great deal of
respect across the country in terms of the teams and the programs and the
players in it. But to me when we've added Nebraska and now we've added
Maryland and Rutgers to the league, I think from a women's basketball
perspective you're adding two very tremendous programs, great veteran coaches,
tremendous recruiters. Tough‑minded players.  
We've played at Maryland two straight years in the NCAA Tournament. So we
might be the one team that actually, I won't call it an advantage, but maybe a
little bit advantaged in that we've been there a couple times and have
traveled and stayed there as we've played back to back years in the NCAA
Tournament out there. But I love what Brenda and Vivian bring as people to the
league, the respect that they have nationally in our sport.  
And to us as coaches, we're excited to see how that translates in the polls
and in day‑to‑day grind of the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now at the podium is Northwestern head coach Joe
McKeown.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MCKEOWN: I'm real excited right now to get going, probably like
everybody. In a way it's like baseball spring training. You just want to get
playing and returning five starters for the first time since I've been at
Northwestern and two starters from the year before. So we call them the
Magnificent Seven. We really have seven that have started, that played a lot
of basketball for us.  
And it's just going to be fun. It's going to be fun. We're a fun team to
watch. Trying to score a lot of points. Defensively we've got to get a lot
better or else we'll give up a lot of points and really that's how we're
looking at it this year.  
And we have some great young talent. Just an exciting team. Give me some gray
hairs now and then but great attitude and great energy.  
  
Q. You talked about your seven players that have so much experience and as
players, as players go through grow older or whatever, they get better. Do you
have anybody on your team that has made a bigger jump, a bigger improvement
than you would have expected?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think we started three freshmen last year. So I think just
the experience they got and Christen Inman, who was a high school All‑American
from Texas, came in and started every game. Just had a great year.  
And I've watched her progress, and I think she's ready to step up. Obviously
Nia Coffey, First‑Team All‑Big Ten as a freshman, which has never happened
before at Northwestern.  
But I thought the progress that Christen Inman has shown me in maturity has
impressed me so far.  
  
Q. One of your kids who was a starter the year before, Karly Roser is back
okay this year, but not having her last year, did that inhibit maybe what you
did last year and will she help you do a little more this year?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yeah, Karly Roser was an All‑Big Ten player as a sophomore and
sat out 90percent last year pretty much and then just really, just threw a
curve ball on what we were trying to do, especially when you had a point guard
that started every game.  
We brought her in as a freshman and gave her the ball and said by the time
you're a senior you're going to be one of the best players in college
basketball. And I think she's evolved. She had a great summer, played on the
Canadian National Team, went overseas. And so I think that really helped her.  
And right now she's playing with a lot of confidence. She's one of the stop
student student‑athletes in the country, pre‑med major.  
Her whole life is on a fast pace, high wire. So I'm really proud of her. She
bounced back really strong.  
  
Q. With all the talent last year, the young talent in particular, there was
a lot of talk about they have so much potential, so much potential. Moving
from last year to this, what is the biggest area of focus that's going to get
you from potential to powerhouse?  
COACH MCKEOWN: That's a great question. I think the biggest thing is to go
from playing spectacular minutes to being consistent. And it's not an easy
thing to do. We had some great games, great minutes. We had some highlight
reels last year.  
But to be consistent now going into the sophomore junior year for a lot of our
players, I think is the hardest thing. And over my years as a head coach, the
teams that understand that, the teams that you built that foundation, now it's
time, you know what it's like the last four minutes of a game, you know when
you're down ten not to panic.  
You know you've been in these situations so let's take advantage of that
experience.  
So I think just being consistent this year and trying to compete every day.  
  
Q. How does Nia Coffey go from that consistency that you want?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I'll tell you, her work ethic over, since the season ended has
been incredible. And I think she's very, very humble. That's what I love about
her. I've been fortunate enough to coach 20 or 30 professional players over
the years. She has that skill and talent. She has that drive and she thinks
she's the worst player in our team.  
So she has the humbleness and she wants to get better every day. I think when
you have that, it makes my job a lot easier. She just wants to be a great
player and more importantly she wants to be a great teammate.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Hope not. If she's our worst player, we'd be pretty good.  
  
Q. You add two new teams to the league this year, and one of them jumps in
as the preseason favorite to win the conference. What do you think of the
additions of Rutgers and Maryland?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think when the Big Ten added Nebraska, they came into women's
basketball and were just an incredible‑‑ had a incredible run in the Big Ten,
whether it's the players they brought in, the coaches, the fan support.  
I think that's added a lot to our league, and to bring in a program like
Maryland coming off the Final Four and have won a National Championship.  
I was in Washington D.C. at George Washington for 20 years. I've played a lot
against Maryland and understand their growth and their talent and what they've
done. And of course being in the Atlantic Ten For 20 years and having great
games with Rutgers and Vivian Stringer and NCAA Tournament games and
championship games with Rutgers. I just have a great respect for both
programs.  
So I think what will happen, which I guess will play itself out, I think we
have one of the best if not the best leagues in college basketball in women's
basketball right now. We certainly‑‑ with the addition of Maryland and
Rutgers, I feel like as a conference we can go toe to toe with anybody. I know
it will play itself out later. But when you've got 14 teams, it's going to be
an interesting year.  
But they're both great programs and bring great tradition in women's
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Ohio State head Coach Kevin McGuff. Coach, an
opening statement and then open it up for questions.  
COACH MCGUFF: Very pleased to be here in Chicago with all of you. Excited
about the season. We've got a lot of really young talented players I'm anxious
to see on the court. And ready to get going.  
  
Q. You're down a couple of players already to start the season but you'll
have a bunch of new players and one of them is Kelsey Mitchell. Can you
basically start with her and tell us how she's going to affect your team and
then the other freshmen how they're going to fit in?  
COACH MCGUFF: Kelsey is a really special player. As dynamic a point guard as
I've ever been around, especially she's got great skill, obviously, but her IQ
and passion for the game I think really make her special. So we're excited to
have her in the program. As we've tried to transition to a different style of
play, Kelsey will be a big part of that and kind of like the engine that's
going to make things go for us.  
But I like our other freshman too. Asia Doss has been really good so far, and
maybe a little further along than I expected, as is Alexa Hart. And they have
really good talent, they're young, and I know we'll endure some growing pains.
But I really like the kids we have in the program, especially our young
players and feel like the future's very bright with these kids.  
  
Q. Now that you're getting more of your own type of players, what kind of
style would you like to see from this group this season?  
COACH MCGUFF: As we evolve as a program, we would like to have a much more
up‑tempo style of play. And we've recruited to that style of play.  
We want to have one of the fastest most aggressive teams in the country when
it's all said and done. We don't necessarily have the depth that I would like
to have at this particular point to play exactly how we want to play. But I
think you'll see more of a team this year that fits that style of play and as
we continue to move towards the future we'll continue to recruit players that
can fit in with that system.  
  
Q. With Kelsey Mitchell's development, how does that change how you plan on
using Ameryst, and what can she do differently that maybe we haven't seen in
her in the last couple of years?  
COACH MCGUFF: I'm excited about having Am and Kelsey getting to play together
in the back court. It's almost like having two point guards back there. Which
I think will make us dangerous off the dribble. And they're both so good, they
can create shots for themselves but more importantly they make others around
them better.  
And we struggle with that at times last year just our ability to break people
down off the dribble, our passing and just making plays. And so to have two
people as dynamic as Am and Kelsey on the floor at the same time I think is
going to be really fun to watch.  
  
Q. Last year one of the Achilles heels rebounding, is there something
significant you're going to be doing and who is going to be counting on the
boards for you to do a better job?  
COACH MCGUFF: We didn't get necessarily any bigger with what we added in the
off‑season. We are faster. I think we'll be able to be a little more
disruptive defensively and have a chance to maybe create more turnovers and
more points in transition, which we're certainly going to work at rebounding.  
But I think we'll be able to do some things, even if we don't get the
rebounding where we want it, the things we can do with this team can offset
that.  
  
Q. You've added a couple of new teams to the league this year. And one of
them is preseason favored to win the league and another one came off winning
the post NIT division what do you think of the additions to the league?  
COACH MCGUFF: Both great programs. Excellent coaches. They both recruit very
aggressively. They have great rosters. I think they'll really help raise the
profile of the league and the Big Ten has been historically incredibly strong
conference. We have great parity and one of the things we've lacked here
recently somebody who adds the deep run. It's great to add Maryland who just
came off a Final Four appearance. I really do think it helps our league in
terms of our national stature, and I also, I think with geographically where
they're located there's a lot of talent in those areas and hopefully that
helps some other teams in the league make inroads in those fertile recruiting
grounds.  
  
Q. Again, one of the kids you used sparingly last year, Lisa Blair, redshirt
freshman, kind of a raw player coming into college, how has she progressed
since last year?  
COACH MCGUFF: Lisa's continued to improve. My staff's done a great job working
with her skill development. Her size can change the game. She's a real
presence defensively. She gives us a little more of a chance to compete with
the bigger people from a rebounding standpoint.  
So I think she will be somebody that certainly helps us this year. And
hopefully she can continue to evolve and she has gotten a lot better and
hopefully she can continue down that path. But she's a great kid. She's worked
really hard to get to this point, and so I'm hopeful you'll even see a more
effective Lisa Blair this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Bobbie Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22737)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our first coach is Wisconsin head coach Bobbie Kelsey. Enters
her fourth season at Wisconsin, returns ten letter winners and four starters
from last year's squad, including Michala Johnson.  
Coach an opening statement.  
COACH KELSEY: Good morning. Thank you for having us here. We're excited about
the upcoming season this year. Wisconsin, we're still working to build our
program into what we know it can be.  
But we're very excited about the kids that are returning. As mentioned,
Michala Johnson, being a First Team All‑Big Ten selection last year, she's
ready to come back and show what she's been working on in the summer and her
improvement over the course of the off‑season.  
We also have Jacki Gulczynski as one of our veteran starters, Nicole Bauman
and point guard Dakota White and some others that are ready to make their mark
in this conference and really show that they've been working hard over the
off‑season to showcase their talents.  
So we're looking forward to our season this year and very excited about what's
to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Tell me a little bit about the increased number of games, conference
‑wise, 18‑game schedule, and how that will affect how you prepare your team
and in the future and how you go about looking at the non‑conference
scheduling?  
COACH KELSEY: It's definitely something that is a difference for us and a
change for the coaches having the two more games in the conference. It kind of
compresses the schedule a little bit there to make it a little bit more
difficult.  
You have to watch your minutes with the kids and practice time, really making
sure you preserve legs, so to speak, because you have more games in a week.
You could have maybe three in a week really back to back to back, and it puts
pressure on coaches to make sure they're maintaining their kids' health,
mentally too. Some of that is taxing on the kids.  
But it is what it is. That's what we have, and we have to live with that. But
I'm excited. The games are just exciting for me and the kids. So we're ready
to tackle our schedule and do whatever we need to do to have a great season.  
  
Q. With three seasons under your belt, how do things change now that in
theory most of these kids are kids you brought to campus?  
COACH KELSEY: It's nice to have veterans, kids that understand what you're
saying, your terminology, your philosophies, your expectations. We don't have
a very young team. We have three newcomers but only one is going to be able to
play this year.  
So it's not a big change for us. I know some of the coaches have a lot of new
players, and that's always very interesting when you have a lot of freshmen
and new kids in your system.  
But that should bode well for us going forward in that I don't have to do a
whole bunch of teaching and introducing new things. The kids really
understand. So our practices go a lot smoother this year.  
And we're looking to use that as an advantage for us going into the season.  
  
Q. Last year the conference overall got better, five or six points
offensively. Offensively, what are you looking to do? Obviously you returned
Michala Johnson as a firepower, but who specifically will help on you the
offensive end this year?  
COACH KELSEY: In addition to Michala, we're looking to Jacki Gulczynski. She
was almost a double‑digit scorer and rebounder, close in those two areas.
She'll definitely play a bigger role in what we're trying to do.  
Nicole Bauman had to play point a little more last year than we would have
liked to have her play. But we'll move her back to the natural position at the
2.  
And Dakota White, she played with the Canadian Junior National Team. So she
has a lot more confidence.  
When you're talking about a team that maybe hasn't had the success yet, it's
important for us as coaches to build their confidence because I always say you
can't necessarily give kids confidence but you can surely take the little bit
they have, if you don't coach them correctly, and encourage them to excel and
to make some mistakes. Sometimes as coaches we get on them, take care of the
ball, don't turn it over.  
But in order for them to take some chances and learn, we have to live with
some of that, if you want them then to have the confidence to go out and know
they're not going to be pulled or yelled at the first mistake.  
That's what I'm trying to do with my kids. And going into my fourth year as a
head coach, your first year, your fourth year is quite different. So I've
learned a lot. They've taught me a lot as a coach. And we're coaching them a
little bit different and making sure that we don't squash any confidence that
they have because again that goes a long way when you're trying to get them to
do what you want them to do.  
  
Q. You said only one of the newcomers would be able to play, who is that?
What is the status of the others, and if you could also address how Cassie
Rochel is in terms of her comeback?  
COACH KELSEY: Cayla McMorris from Minnesota, she'll probably play. She's
healthy and ready to go. She's been practicing. Roichelle Marble tore her
Achilles in the preseason. So she's out. And also we have a transfer that's
obviously not able to play because of NCAA transfer rules. So that's Avyanna
Young.  
Cassie Rochel, her back is better. It's not 100percent, but she's out there.
She's practicing. And we're being very careful with her, because we don't want
to aggravate anything that we don't have to, and right now she's a veteran.
She's a senior, fifth‑year senior.  
She doesn't have to be in the thick of things every day in practice to do what
we need her to do. So we're going to be very careful with her and make sure
that we're not aggravating anything that's there. But she's ready to go. And
she's very excited because she sat last year, and she's itching to get back
there show what she can do.  
  
Q. Where do you see the Badgers this year fitting in the conference?  
COACH KELSEY: The good thing about the Big Ten is that anyone has the
capabilities of winning it and competing at that level. Obviously with the
addition of Maryland and Rutgers, that puts a little bit more stress on it.  
But we like that. That's a challenge. Nobody's afraid of that. They're very
good teams but we also have some really good teams in our conference that have
shown that they can, that anybody can step up at any time and win a game.  
So we're excited about it, and we're confident that we can compete with what
we have returning and some of the new things that we're going to be
showcasing.  
So I can't tell you, but hopefully it will work out and we're excited about
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now joining us is Maryland head coach Brenda Frese. We'll start
with an opening statement.  
COACH FRESE: Well, first of all, it's really, really nice to see everyone and
definitely look forward to being able to get to know each and every one of you
a lot better.  
We are obviously really, really excited about our first season here in the Big
Ten and I'm really looking forward to the upcoming year.  
When you talk about the experience that we were able to be able to get going
to a Final Four, having our second, third and fifth leading scorers last
season be freshmen, Lexie Brown and Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough and Brionna
Jones, to know we have them for three more seasons is really exciting.  
I think this year's team will be by far one of the most athletic teams we've
had in my 12 years at Maryland, just our team speed, being able to get up and
down the floor the way we like to play in terms of transition, and I think
we're going to be able to do a lot of great things defensively in the full
court as well as in the half court.  
But I know for me personally being able to come back in the Big Ten, having
grown up in Iowa and know the Big Ten Conference extremely well, having
coached at Minnesota for a season, I can't wait, I can't wait to be able to
get back and play against the great competition.  
I have so much respect for the coaches in this league, what they've been able
to accomplish, as well as going into these different venues again with the fan
base and the crowds that our players are going to get to play in front of.  
So we're really looking forward to this upcoming season.  
  
Q. Coach, you lost an All ‑American. You can't replace the numbers she gave
you, but she gave you a lot of leadership too. Who do you expect to pick up
the on‑court leadership that you got from Alyssa?  
COACH FRESE: She really did. I think where we've really been fortunate at
Maryland is we've had a lot of players whose names and numbers have gone into
the rafters. So I think when you're talking about starting your 13th year, the
standard has kind of really been set.  
When you talk about from a leadership end what Laurin Mincy and Brene Moseley
are giving us as a fifth‑year senior and redshirt senior for Brene, they're
really giving us tremendous leadership.  
It's really been by committee. We're really challenging this entire team, our
sophomore class, to really step up.  
  
Q. You were in the league with Minnesota 14 years ago; now you're coming
back to the league. Do you see anything from the outside looking in as the
league has changed in any way in styles of play or depth or anything like
that?  
COACH FRESE: No question. The league has really changed. And first and
foremost it starts with the coaches. A lot of new young coaches that have
really improved in terms of from a recruiting end, with just great talent,
great depth. The league has become more athletic. I think you have so many
different styles of play in the Big Ten.  
So I think just when you talk about the competition we're going to face every
night, I think the depth of the conference is really, really strong.  
  
Q. On a personal level, what's it like for you now to come back to the
league? I know you're not going to come to Iowa this year to play, but just to
be back and be close to home, at least once or twice a year?  
COACH FRESE: It's funny, the first thing I looked at was to see if we were
going back to Iowa this year. But, no, I'm really, really excited.  
You know when you get to be my age and mother of twin boys, it's really
exciting as you get older to be able to bring your family back to where you
grew up and be able to have your relatives, aunts and uncles, family members
to be a part of it.  
I think that's what makes it so special is now 14 years later I get to bring
our team back, bring my family back in front of so many people and be able to
share with family and friends.  
  
Q. I think most coaches would agree that being a preseason favorite is a
much different position than being not in the pack. Have you had any
discussions with your players about what unique challenges being the favorite
might bring this season, or have you had to talk to them about it at all?  
COACH FRESE: We just found out today in terms of where the rankings were at.
But I think for us we have talked about the target on our back, coming off a
Final Four. And I do think our players understand the expectation and the
standard when they come to Maryland and it's something that we really welcome.  
We want to play and get everyone's best shot. We want to play against the best
possible competition that we can play against. We really try to embrace it.  
  
Q. What do you think the biggest difference is going to be for the team
competing in a different conference, or will there be any kind of change in
how you want to play?  
COACH FRESE: One of the biggest differences I think for our players will be
going into so many venues with the attendance and fan base. I know it's
prepared us when we've been in the Big Ten‑ACC Challenge, being able to go to
Purdue, being able to go to Nebraska and seeing the fan base that takes place
at so many of these phenomenal programs.  
So I think that will be a unique element. I mean, we've always had in the
previously in the ACC the biggest fan base. And so now we'll be seeing that
when we go on the road. So that will be a lot of fun to be able to play in
front of so many fans.  
  
Q. Are you going to miss playing against some of your traditional rivals
from the ACC, are you going to try to maybe schedule them in non ‑conference
games now going forward?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I'm not going to miss going on the road to Duke and
Carolina, to be quite honest. I always enjoyed having them at home but not
going on the road there.  
So from that end, those home games were always a lot of fun. But I think the
biggest thing that happens in any conference as I've been a part of is you do
create your own rivalries, and there's going to be nothing different when you
talk about in our conference.  
I mean, when you look at the proximity of Rutgers and Penn State for us, those
are going to be great environments. And then obviously we're going to build
when we go on the road so many great rivalries in this conference.  
So it's just great competition. I think at the end of the day your players,
your team, your coaches, you want to play against great competition, and we're
going to be doing that.  
  
Q. Coming off the Final Four appearance how much confidence did that infuse
into the team? You talked about your second and third and fourth leading
scorers returning, but everyone else, how have they changed because of that
experience?  
COACH FRESE: I think the most impressive thing, having come off a National
Championship team in'06 and then the Final Four this past year, is the
mentality of this team coming off of a Final Four. I think sometimes when you
have great success as a young person, you can get satisfied and you can feel
like you've arrived.  
This team has a different mentality. I mean, you would have thought that we
didn't have a successful season. They want more. And I think that's really
exciting as a coaching staff and program when you've developed the mentality
that we want to accomplish even more this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Matt Bollant. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH BOLLANT: Obviously very exciting time of year. October is one of my
favorite times of the year where we get to practice and get better every day,
get 20 hours a week to be in the gym and practice our craft and just be around
our players.  
And we're undefeated. We're 0 and 0 going in and haven't lost a game yet. It's
a fun time of year and really excited about the future of our program.  
I think in coming to Illinois we had a high level of athleticism. Certainly
the first year with Karisma Penn and Adrienne GodBold, those two kids
graduated. And we weren't quite as athletic and not as skilled as we needed to
be to do well in the Big Ten.  
And I think we've addressed that in our recruiting and changed that. Kyley
Simmons, who sat out last year, was starting point guard at Missouri, I think
will be one of the best point guards in the Big Ten. One of the best shooters
I've ever coached and a great leader.  
That's going to be huge to have your point guard on the floor be your leader,
your best player, I think she's going to add a tremendous amount.  
Obviously rebounding was an issue last year. Adding Chatrice White to the mix
will help change that. And an McDonald's All‑American. In that game, one of
the announcers said she may be the best rebounder on the floor in the
McDonald's All‑American game. And I think she's one of the best rebounding
freshmen in the country.  
I know she sat at a game last year with the recruits and the recruits said,
boy, they're not rebounding very well. And Chatrice said I promise you that's
going to change next year. And with Chatrice on the floor, Jacqui Grant, now
being 6'3" and 6'3" inside that will make a huge difference for us.  
Adding Brittany Carter was a great pickup for us. She will come in as a
senior, has a great chance to be our starting 2, passes the ball, really
skilled. Her and Kyley have come in, two new players, our two best shooters.  
We do a shooting drill each day. We did it yesterday in practice where they
shoot 50 3s. And in the past, if we had somebody make around 30, we'd feel
pretty good about that. Yesterday, Kyley was disappointed that she made 38 and
Brittany made 37. And this is after we did an hour of defense where they're
tired going into that.  
So Kyley has been making between 40 and 45 on a regular basis, and her and
Brittany will add a great deal. Then we did a thing called Celtic Shooting,
where they have to make two from five spots and rotate around, making 10
different spots, making two in a row.  
Last year if we got one of our 14, two of 14 to make it, we felt pretty good
about that. Yesterday we had 10 kids doing it because we had a couple of
injuries. Five of the 10 made it‑‑ 50percent of our kids made that 3‑point
shooting drill, which is better than we've had, similar or better than we had
at Green Bay.  
Excited about our skill development. I think our practices are extremely
intense. I know the coaches that come and go watch other practices, most of
them say we've never seen a practice like that. And our kids bust their butt
and give a great deal.  
And I've got a great staff. We challenge and stretch the kids every day. And I
know I felt like at Green Bay, when we were close to even talent‑wise, we won
those games, and we beat those teams.  
When we are at that in the Big Ten we'll do extremely well, as we did the
first year. And I think we've closed that margin and talent this year. And it
will be exciting to see where we're at.  
But I know the future's bright. The recruiting has gone extremely well. We do
have a McDonald's All‑American Chatrice White, and WBCA All‑American in Amarah
Coleman.  
And I think we're the only Big Ten school to have two different kids on those
teams. So pretty exciting being our second year.  
  
Q. I'll ask you about the recruiting aspect when Chatrice White says "yes."
What are those moments like for a coach. And again for somebody who is in the
process of trying to build something.   
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, it's huge. Recruiting is certainly a passion of mine and
our staff. And Coach Divilbiss and I made five trips over to see her play.
Eight to nine hours to Shelby, watch a game, drive eight to nine hours back,
get back at five in the morning, and we practiced at 7:30. We were at practice
7:30 in the morning. We did that five times during the year.  
We did that with a girl from the UP as well. And we took second on her. So it
doesn't guarantee anything, but Chatrice said I want to play for a staff that
makes me feel wanted and important. And I'd make 50 trips to go see that type
of kid in a year if we could if it was legal.  
So it changes your program. I think if anything, I learn from last year was
that, boy, recruiting is a huge piece of it. Because our practices last year
were intense and our kids gave a lot but we weren't talented enough to win. So
you've got to get players, it's about bringing in the right kids and bringing
in talented players and Chatrice White is a program‑changer for our program.  
  
Q. I know you've added a lot of depth this year, but it's kind of come from
different places between incoming freshmen and transfers and whatnot. How is
the chemistry going in the first few weeks of practice?  
COACH BOLLANT: That's been great. That's the one thing we've really challenged
our returners. I'll say they've had great attitudes. It's not easy. We talked
a lot about the incoming freshmen and about the transfers and our returning
players, they have some pride, too, and they want to be on the floor.  
And Ivory Crawford is a senior and really important to our program and Jacqui
Grant was having a great freshman year, would probably be on the All‑Freshman
team until she got mono in January.  
We have other seniors, Nia Oden, really embraces what college basketball is
all about. If you watched Nia practice every day‑‑ two years ago we told Nia,
I don't know that you're going to play.  
And last year she busted her butt, found a way to be on the court. And doing
the same thing this year. And give her a lot of credit. Alexis Smith has been
out with an injury, expect to get her back next week. And Taylor Tuck is a
senior.  
We have kids in the program, they want to win and value the right things. We
challenged them day one, put the team first and be unselfish. And that's what
you need to be in this program.  
If you can't do that, then we're not going to let you stay. And they've done a
great job embracing that and having a great attitude and doing whatever they
could to help the program.  
And our chemistry, when I ask players and kind of take a random poll every few
days or once a week and grab, how are we doing in the locker room, how are we
doing chemistry‑wise, and every one of the players this fall said it's the
best it's ever been. And excited about how they get along and how they act
towards each other.  
  
Q. Looking at this great mix of chemistry and looking at the competition
across the Big Ten, what would you say is your biggest area of strength with
this particular team?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, it's a little bit early on, honestly, to know that.
Because we have so many new faces, Kennedy Cattenhead, the girl that tore her
ACL, didn't play last year. Looks great in practice but until you get to games
you really don't know.  
I think the one thing we're going to be a really skilled compared to what we
were last year, but then you look across the Big Ten and what it returns and
top to bottom it's as good as any league in the country. So I think it's a
little early for us because we have so many new pieces.  
I will say the way we play, most coaches would say they play as hard as
anybody in the country, and I think that's something that separates us, the
effort that our kids play with, the level of intensity. I know the way we
practice every day not many teams do that. I know the high school coaches that
come watch us go to other programs, they usually say: Gosh, your practice is
way more intense than anything we've seen. So hopefully that will show in the
games as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Iowa head coach Lisa Bluder. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH BLUDER: By now you've probably heard most everything this morning. But
going into this season I think we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic with
the group we have returning four starters returning to the lineup, including
Sam Logic who today was named to the preseason team, very excited about her.  
But for Sam, it's not about being on the preseason team, it's about competing
and winning, and that's what we're excited to start this season and get this
rolling.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sam. Can you maybe talk about the role she's played in your
program not only on the floor but being able to sell your program to future
classes and how that's worked?  
COACH BLUDER: I've been around Sam for three years now and she continues to
amaze me at what she does. There's the basketball aspect, like you say.  
I think she's one of the most complete point guards out there in that she
leads our team in assists and rebounds and steals. Those are amazing
statistics. She's one of the leading passers returning in the country.  
And Sam has such a great‑‑ is a great leader that raises the level of
everybody else's confidence on the team. To me that's the sign of a great
leader, when you can make other people better. That's what Sam Logic does for
us. She makes everybody around her better, including her coaches. Because of
what she can do on the floor.  
Then there's the recruiting aspect. The kid bleeds black and gold. We know
she's from Wisconsin, but make no bones about it, she's a Hawkeye. She'll be a
Hawkeye for life. She loves promoting and talking about the hawks and loves
recruiting for the Hawks. She's been the best well‑rounded ambassador that we
could ever ask for.  
  
Q. 15 years ‑‑ you're the dean of coaches in the Big Ten. Can you just
compare the Big Ten, your first year with this year?  
COACH BLUDER: 11 to 14. You know, it's amazing how far our league has come. In
so many different ways the Big Ten Network, the quality of coaches in this
league, the quality of players. And to think of where we are now. It used to
be back then there was always a couple of give‑mes in the league there's no
such thing in our league. Every game is a tough game. The environments have
gotten better where we go to play, the fan support has gotten better.  
So every year this league has continued to grow and get better.  
  
Q. Lisa, last year you had a terrific season. How is that parlayed into your
recruiting, obviously can't talk about recruits for another couple of weeks,
but it's fairly highly touted anyway. Do you feel you got a lot of momentum
from last year into the recruiting and what do you think of your prospects
right now?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we have great momentum right now. Our program is
definitely in the right direction. We had a very good season last year playing
in the Big Ten championship game, winning 27 games. And I think that momentum
has carried into the recruiting aspect of it.  
I think players like what they see but I also think they like our style of
play. And I think we need to thank the Big Ten Network for that, because
before people weren't able to always see the Iowa Hawkeyes play. And now they
can.  
It's readily available for them. And it has helped us promote our program.
It's helped us tell the story about our program. It's helped recruits be able
to tune in and see our style of play and think, you know, I could see myself
in that type of atmosphere, in that type of game plan.  
  
Q. Last year I think Theairra Taylor had one of the more exceptional seasons
that I didn't see coming, and she was an amazing player. Who do you see
replacing her in terms of some of those leadership things and who needs to
step up as much as Taylor did last year for you for you to be successful this
year?  
COACH BLUDER: We have four starters returning. That's the one we lost,
Theairra, she's over in Prague playing now. Who is going to replace her? You
know, there's a number of candidates of people that could come in and replace
her on our team.  
And obviously I don't want to go into those now because they're still
competing for that opportunity. But it's not always one person that replaces
that leadership. And I think we have great leadership with our group right
now.  
I think our captains this year are Sam Logic, Melissa Dixon and Kathryn
Reynolds, another center. And I think Bethany Doolittle as a senior also
provides great leadership.  
I'm not worried about the leadership of our team because I think we're in
really good hands with that despite losing Theairra.  
  
Q. You can flat out score with anybody in the country. So when you look at
the fact that you're bringing back the majority of that scoring power, what's
that one area of focus that you think you can improve upon that's actually
going to take you to that next level? Is it an improvement in defense,
rebounding, what is that specific thing that you know you have to work on?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you've seen our team play. You said them. We need to
improve on rebounding, definitely. That's a statistic that really it always
irks me quite honestly because it's the first drill I do in practice because I
believe in it so much. It's opportunities to score when you control the
rebounds. And we've given away too many of those opportunities in the past and
we need to do a better job on the boards.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 16, 2014

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan head coach Kim Barnes Arico. We'll
start with an opening statement.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Good morning. I'm thrilled to be here, as always. It's a
special day for us and for our program. And really I think for the league.  
A few years ago I was at St. Johns, and we were in the Big East, the old Big
East, and I was there during a time where we had eight and nine teams be
eligible for the NCAA Tournament.  
And I feel like our league has now become like that. We have so many great
teams with Rutgers and Maryland coming in, but also with Michigan State and
Iowa and Nebraska and Northwestern and I can go on and on, just returning a
great group of players.  
I think everyone is going to challenge for the NCAA Tournament and for
championships. So I think it's really an exciting time to be in the Big Ten,
and the league is tremendous. The players returning, the incoming kids, and
the coaches, they're just phenomenal.  
So I'm thrilled to be here and great to see all of you, as always.  
  
Q. You have your top two rebounders back. I was wondering if you could talk
about Cyesha and Nicole and how you've seen them develop since they got on
campus and what strides do you expect them to make this year?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: It's exciting for me to have both those players returning.
Cyesha came off an outstanding year last year, outstanding. She came in really
and didn't play a lot prior to last year and finished the season as a
Second‑Team All‑Conference player. Almost rebounding, I think, ten a game,
which was pretty impressive. She's a driven kid. She's always in the gym.  
She wants to be better. So I'm excited to see with a year under her belt of
experience how she's going to perform this year.  
And Nicole Elmblad is just a special, special kid. Last year she was named an
Academic All‑American. I think she's received one grade under an A, might be a
B plus or an A minus. If it's a B plus and I'm saying this, she's going to
give me a lot of grief for it, in her time at Michigan.  
Not only is she driven on the basketball court but also in the classroom. And
she is our leader. She's just tremendous in everything she does. She sets an
example each and every single day and she plays extremely hard. I think
rebounding a lot of times is effort.  
And Nicole gives that effort each and every single day. We chart it every day
in practice. So at the end of our first week of practice, Nicole and Cyesha
were at the top of the rebounding board. Now we just have to get a couple of
the young ones up there as well.  
  
Q. Playing 18 games in the conference, how much did that change what you
want to do at a non ‑conference not only this year but also moving forward as
far as still maintaining the strong RPI and all those factors?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I think it will really make a difference. And it will be
interesting to see how that works out at the end of the year. I think that's
going to be really difficult because I think our league is so strong. And each
and every night there's not a team on our schedule that could say this is a
guaranteed win or this is a guaranteed loss.  
I think every game is going to be a battle and physically we might wear each
other down. I think you have to be smart about your non‑conference,
definitely. But I think I'm not sure how it's going to pan out. We still have
Notre Dame in the non‑conference and some other tough games, but we've kind of
tried to be smart about our scheduling and see where we are at the end of the
year, moving forward.  
  
Q. I noticed that the new team, Maryland, was preseason pick by both coaches
and the media, but how do you see the league in terms of overall maybe that
wouldn't be true, maybe somebody out there who might make that untrue?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Well, you know, being from the east, I've had an
opportunity to play against Maryland a couple times. I had an opportunity to
play against Rutgers many, many times. So I know the talent and I know the
coaches pretty well.  
They're both Hall of Fame coaches in my opinion. And top programs in the
country that are returning. I mean, Rutgers is returning everybody and they
have a number of all Americans on their team. So I think those two teams will
definitely add strength to our conference. No question about it.  
But being in our league for the last couple of years, I think Rutgers and
Maryland, by the end of the season will say oh my goodness because I know I
did after my first season here. This league is incredible and Iowa the players
they have returning and Nebraska the players they have returning and Michigan
State, and you can go on and on and on, and I think the other thing besides
the players that we have returning, are the incoming kids.  
I mean, last year we spoke a lot about the freshmen and the impact that the
freshmen in our conference made was incredible. Well, I'm interested to see
now what the incoming freshmen as well as those young women that are now
sophomores, the impact that they are going to have in our conference and
really in the country.  
So I think it's really exciting time for our league.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2014

  

### [Jordan Hooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21826)

### [Rachel Theriot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26542)

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska - 72  
Iowa - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement by coach and then
talk questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, it was a game where we couldn't make a shot, but yet
we found a way to win. That says a lot about our mental toughness. We pursued
the ball, did a great job on the offensive glass and gave ourself a chance to
have more opportunities to shoot field goals.  
We obviously got to the line from a variety of different ways and made a lot
of free throws. So you don't always win ‑‑ every game doesn't come down to
playing pretty, you got to find different ways to win and today we found a way
to win, despite the fact that we didn't shoot the ball very well. And that's a
credit to our players for their toughness.  
I want to compliment Iowa for their toughness as well. They had foul trouble,
they're playing four games in four days, and they hung in there in the first
half when they didn't have some of their starters on the floor and that's a
compliment to their program.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jordan, why were you guys able to have so much success on the offensive
glass?  
JORDAN HOOPER: On the offensive glass we just pursued the ball. We knew coming
in they were a great rebounding team so I think we just kind of wanted it a
little bit more, the ball. And I think that we just, like I said, we just went
after it.  
  
Q. Rachel, down the stretch there I'm sure both teams were tired, but what
do you think made the difference down the last three or four minutes of the
game?  
RACHEL THERIOT: I think that just us being tough and getting rebounds and
obviously, we hit a couple shots at the end. But just overall, we had good
defensive stops and took care of the balls and made rebounds.  
  
Q. Jordan, you talked about it yesterday, but now that you have won the
tournament, what are your emotions and what does this mean to you?  
JORDAN HOOPER: Well I'm obviously really, really happy that we won. Kind of
feels like a long time coming. We have been coming since my sophomore year and
we just couldn't get it done. And so to have this opportunity again and to be
successful is huge. It means everything. So hopefully we just keep this
momentum going into the next phase.  
  
Q. Rachel, talk about coming out that second half, you nailed I think six or
six points in a row or something, I could be wrong, but that was a major
change I thought. Go ahead.  
RACHEL THERIOT: I was hot, obviously, and my teammates got me the ball and we
executed what we had to do. When I was open, I just took the shot. When I
wasn't, I just passed it off, so.  
  
Q. Jordan, Rachel obviously had 18 assists in one game and was named the
MVP. From your perspective what does she do in this tournament that really
stands out?  
JORDAN HOOPER: She kept her calm, kept her cool and passed the ball like she
knows how. I thought she did a great job of being a point guard and getting us
the ball when she needed to and also taking the shots when she had them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, good luck in the tournament. Take questions
for coach.  
  
Q. With Iowa in foul trouble early in the first half did it become kind of a
concentrated effort to drive the lane and draw more fouls or is this just, is
that just kind of how the game played out?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, they played a ton of zone in the game. And for ‑‑ I'm
sure that they had game plan to play the zone but I think they probably played
more than they would have thought, based on the fact that they were in so much
foul trouble.  
Their zone is‑‑ I thought that we got good shots and I really did. I think the
shots, I would take them again, for the most part. But I think our ability to
get on the offensive glass, I think that to continue to put pressure on them
with their foul trouble. We got some offensive rebounds and got some fouls on
that.  
So we didn't necessarily penetrate their zone, but we did find ways to draw
fouls within their zone.  
  
Q. With Iowa coming at you late closing within one what made the difference
the last four or five minutes?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: We made free throws. We got stops and we made a lot of free
throws. I don't know when we made our last field goal, I don't have it right
in front of me here, but you got to make free throws in that situation, if
they're going to foul you. And we were aggressive. Even though we were
missing, we were aggressive pursuing the ball. Our ability to get on the
offensive glass was a huge part of the game. Look at the rebounding numbers,
that was pretty clear that that was a huge factor.  
We, Emily and Jordan, we knew that shots weren't going down and they just kept
going after the ball. And that's how we got to the line.  
  
Q. Rachel did a lot of things for you obviously this weekend, what impressed
you the most about her performance this week?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, she's just a really confident player. She's taking
shots when she's open. Earlier in the year I had to remind her about not
passing up shots. I still occasional have to remind her, but she's being more
aggressive looking for her shot. She's got a great feel on when she needs to
make plays. That's unusual for a kid her age.  
She knew that we were struggling and she needed to be the one that needed to
take some shots for us. And she did.  
Combined with the fact that she's a great passer, but today we needed her to
score the ball.  
  
Q. Can you address the significance of winning first conference title for
Nebraska?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well, we have had four cracks at it here in the last three
years and not everybody gets a second chance or a third chance and in this
case a fourth chance. It's a credit to our players for just being very, very
resilient and coming into this tournament knowing that take one game at a time
and try to win it.  
But we have been in the league for three years and we have competed for the
conference championship four times. So that says something about the
consistency of our program. I mean men's and women's basketball, we're not
just a football school any longer? All right? Okay.  
  
Q. Hailie Sample had a double double and I think she had a charge on that
three on one and took a charge on the three on one. How vital was that
performance to win a championship?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Yeah, Hailie is a really good player. She doesn't
necessarily score a lot, but she's a really good player in many ways. And she
played all the minutes for us. We don't have her out there just filling in,
she's productive in the things that she does. There's a reason why she's on
the team. I was really pleased to see that she was named to the all Big‑10
defensive team. She's been doing that for four years and she doesn't get a lot
of recognition and I think the coaches in our league are starting to realize
that there's a reason why she's on the floor for us.  
  
Q. After the conference season and the conference tournament are you looking
forward to preparing for a different team than what you've been doing?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: As always. It's the old adage that it's a grind and we have
now played‑‑ you play teams multiple times and it's always nice to see
somebody new. So we got one break here, we got to figure out a way to stay
sharp and yet don't wear our kids out. So we got a whole week plus before we
find out who we play.  
  
Q. After winning today and what you've accomplished, what type of seed do
you think you've earned?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: You know I really haven't thought about it. I'll look at
it, I think now, but I haven't really put a lot of thought into it, so it
doesn't matter what I think. It just matters what the committee thinks.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, coach, thank you.  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska 72  
Iowa 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Just want to congratulate Nebraska on their victory. Proud
of my kids. I'm proud of their effort. I thought we battled. We had to go
through some tough situations with some foul trouble. It was free throws, team
shots, 36 free throws to your 14 and then the box outs. So we gave up way too
many offensive rebounds, hard to win a game with those type of numbers.  
So unfortunate, but again, I'm proud of my team that we hung in there,
especially in the first half when things were‑‑ we had the severe foul
trouble, hung in there and made it a contest at the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What led to such a poor start for you guys?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think what coach said. It was, they got to the free throw
line 18 times, tough to be out scored by 11 at the free throw line in the
first half. Even in the first half we were shooting better than them, just
they got put on the line, we put them on the line 18 times.  
That's tough, obviously. With Dixon in foul trouble, you know, to even be in
the game where Thea's play's 18 minutes is huge, she's been leading us this
whole tournament, so that was unfortunate, but we battled. Like coach said,
could have definitely hung it up and so to only lose by seven in those
situations is pretty impressive by our team, I think.  
  
Q. For Allie, talk about how frustrating it is when a team takes two and
three shots. They had a big offensive rebound night. Talk about how
frustrating that is.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Obviously, it's extremely frustrating. To get out‑rebounded
like that, that's all on us. That's on our shoulders. Something we're going to
definitely work on in upcoming weeks to shore up but obviously, that's a very
frustrating part. But we were happy with how we handled a lot of adversity out
there. We handled a lot of adversity. We never gave up.  
  
Q. Sam, in the second half, Theriot really seemed to look for her shot. Did
you notice anything different from what she was trying to do in the second
half?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: She was just taking her shots. They were setting a lot more
screens for her on the top of that zone. Some of them were tough to get
around. So, she was looking for her shots there and a couple of them were, I
mean, you're going to let her take a couple of those. She knocked down a
couple of those tough shots, a couple runners that you're going to live with
her making. Obviously, she's playing really well for them right now and a
couple of those are just, just tough, tough shots. And some of them were over
screens, but that's what good players do.  
  
Q. How ‑‑ today, you got pretty significant contributions from Reynolds and
Peschel, how crucial is that for you guys moving forward as you go forward?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It's huge. Claire has played a lot this tournament. Kali has
played some solid minutes, Kas played monumental minutes yesterday. But the
minutes she played was great. But it's huge just knowing that we have
confidence and we can hang with anybody, even when we had some foul trouble,
but a couple players, three starters in the first half sitting out the last
part there, it was huge. We have so much confidence in them and it shows you
why today.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies. Good luck in the tournament.
We'll continue for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. You touched on it, but why the disparity in rebounds and the inability to
keep them off the offensive glass?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: We need to watch the film and check that. But we kept
talking about going to make contact on the weak side and I think we'll find
that they were just more aggressive going after the ball on the weak side than
we were. Offensively, you do have the advantage that you know when the shot
going to go up a lot of times and you can anticipate it and start crashing
almost before the shot.  
But at the same time we just, we need to be stronger in that situation and go
out. And there was a lot of long rebounds and in that situation you got to go
out and get farther away from the basket and make that contact and we just
didn't get it done. We talked about it at halftime and we didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the technical foul there.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I stamped my foot and that was why I got my technical
foot. Because I stomped my foot. Now I stomp my foot at my kids, kind of a
habit I do all the time and I've never gotten a technical for stomping my
foot, but today I did. And I don't think I had had one in 10 years, I don't
remember the last one I had. Seems lake a crazy time to get one and I take
full responsibility for that. It was a bad time to get it, and I apologized to
the team immediately for that. Wish I could have taken it back, but it's
almost a reflex.  
  
Q. They got out to the early lead, how tough is that for you guys when
you're playing your fourth game in four days to just exude that much energy to
get back in the game?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: No, I thought our ‑‑ you know, they got out to the lead and
we had the foul trouble. Maybe we committed all those fouls because we were a
little more tired. Possible. But I hate to use that as an excuse. I thought
our reserves came in and cut hard and did a great job of battling. I mean
Claire and Kali and Kathryn that first half, I thought they played so hard and
got a little spark back into us that we took into halftime. And we got in
halftime and we said hey, we're only down eight. With this many fouls, this
many, this much disparity in the rebounds and at the free throw line, and we
felt like that was good. We felt like that was‑‑ that we were going to win the
second half. We really did feel like we were going to win the second half
because we thought it should be a lot worse than that.  
  
Q. Your bench play, is there anything particular Claire did or just
confidence and maybe comfort in Claire out there?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Her confidence has grown throughout this tournament.
Claire's always been a really good rebounder for us, for her minutes played
she does an excellent job on the boards. Hitting that three, I think, was a
really special moment for her. She hit one at Purdue, she doesn't hit a lot of
them. It was a huge moment for her. You think that gave her a lot of
confidence too. But it's definitely something we can keep rolling with. I
think with all of those guys.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to the NCAA tournament, what kind of seed do you feel your
team earned and what do you, for lack of a better phrase, feel the strength of
your resume is?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I think the strength of our resume is excellence. We have
great quality wins, we have a win at Penn State, a Top‑10 team. We have a win
over Purdue that was a top eight RPI. We have a win over USC that is playing
in the title game of the PAC 12 right now. I could probably go on and on. We
got a win over Boston College. I'm probably missing some right now. But I
think we have an excellent ‑‑ we really don't have any bad losses either. Our
only bad loss right now on paper is Colorado but that's because they got hurt.
We lost a couple point game at their place when they were healthy and then
they got a lot of injuries.  
So, I think we have a excellent resume and I hate to predict seeds and those
type of things, but our RPI was about 23 or something like coming into this
and I know that's not the only factor, but it's a significant factor. And it
only could have gone up since we have been here. So I think we deserve a high
seed. A very high seed. I think we deserve a four or five seed. I think that's
really legitimate.  
  
Q. Do you think what your team kind of showed in this tournament and what
they showed during the regular season that this could kind of be the year that
you go deep in the tournament?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: That's what we plan to do. We're planning to be around for
a long time. We have home court advantage, we're going to use it. That's the
goal. That is the goal.  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, Lisa. Good luck in the NCAAs.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Allie Havers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26563)

### [Rachel Theriot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26542)

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska - 86  
Michigan State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH CONNIE YORI: It was a great team win on our part. We scored 86 points
and Jordan only scored 15 of them. That means that we have a lot of
contribution from others. The stretch that we had with Jordan on the bench in
the first half was, I'm thinking as that's going on, I'm thinking that's what
we're going to have next year and with a few more contributors coming in.  
But we got contributions out of a lot of kids in that stretch when Jordan had
two fouls. And as a coach you think, well should I put her back in, but we
didn't need to, because the fact that our kids played so well.  
So Rachel has been, yeah she's been iron woman for us and has just been
consistent, really throughout the year. And Allie came in and gave us a really
big lead in the first half and then Tear'a got going and she had that look in
her eye. So really good team win and our defense was great. Our kids were
really smart and they followed the game plan and executed it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Rachel, in the first half when you pulled away and opened the big lead,
what led you to being able to pull away like that.  
RACHEL THERIOT: Obviously, just coming from, I think it started with our
defense, obviously, getting stops. And then everyone was making big plays for
us and hitting shots. So everything was just rolling our way and I think we
executed well.  
  
Q. Can you discuss the year you've had and how your confidence has grown. To
be able to put up a performance like that today?  
ALLIE HAVERS: It's been a fun year and it's been really great talking about
the stuff that goes into the game and stuff like that, so that's where it came
from.  
  
Q. Does it mean more to do this against Michigan State?  
ALLIE HAVERS: It feels good, like, playing against Michigan State, but against
anybody it would be good.  
  
Q. Rachel, last night you obviously set the single game record for assists,
it seemed like early in the game you were looking to score yourself, was there
something you saw defensively that led to that?  
RACHEL THERIOT: I just took what they gave me and sometimes it's me finding
the open person and I'm also happy to take my own shot. I just read what they
give.  
  
Q. Rachel, can you talk about what it means to make it to the Big ‑10
championship game and kind of your thoughts on that.   
RACHEL THERIOT: These past two years most of my experiences these past two
years we have been competing for it and we have always been close, but haven't
got it yet. So, especially for Hooper, this is her senior year, just to bring
it on back for her, that's the main thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll see you tomorrow. Take questions for
coach.  
  
Q. How good was that first half going into halftime, what did you tell your
team, obviously keep it up and that, but can you talk about the first half?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: We did a lot of things right. There was some details that
we tried to clean up and changed some matchups in the second half. We needed
to continue to stay aggressive but also play smart.  
We were up 28 at halftime in a game before and I never think it's enough of a
lead. So I'm always a firm believer that you got to come out and play well to
start the second half in that situation. And we played well enough, not that
‑‑ we didn't let them score a whole lot to start that second half. We didn't
necessarily get it going on offense though.  
  
Q. What's it like to have a situation to have Allie come in and make a
contribution and see how much growth she's had this year?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well she mentioned it. She is putting a lot of extra time
in the gym to try to get better. It's nice to see an athlete's work pay off.
And that's exactly what that was an example of tonight.  
She spent ‑‑ she hits those shots in practice all the time. After practice she
gets an extra 20 or 30 minutes of practice almost every day. Sometimes she's
on her own, sometimes she does it with one of the coaches and she's just very
committed to that. So I'm really proud of her.  
  
Q. Going back to Allie, you talk about the work she's done, but what about
her confidence level. She came in and one of the shots was early in the shot
clock and it seemed like she ‑‑ has her confidence grown over the years?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: She's never lacked confidence. When she gets it, she shoots
it. So, that's never been an issue with her. But she's a competitive kid. I
think that goes back to her high school background, that she was a really good
all around high school athlete who was a competitor.  
And she won a state softball championship and think about a kid that played
short stop at 6‑5, she's an athletic kid and she's competitive. And then she
pitched her team to state championship her senior year. And so you are talking
about a kid that has played multiple sports and has been successful in
everything that she's done. She's competitive.  
  
Q. When you play Iowa tomorrow, both teams are playing their own game but
what do you feel like you need to do against them to get a victory?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Well Iowa is really hard to guard. They can really space
the floor on you. They have got a really good interior player in Doolittle and
then they have got four perimeters that can shoot it and drive it and they're
a very, very challenging team to defend.  
So if the game goes as we think it might go, it might be, there might be some
scoring in this game. So we're going to have to find a way to score.  
  
Q. How does your transition play help you out on offense?  
COACH CONNIE YORI: We definitely took advantage of some things that we do in
transition to get the ball where it needs to be. We got ‑‑ we got a few steals
that led to easy baskets. But we felt like that was an area that we wanted to
try to take advantage of in this game. We got ‑‑ we don't have big bulky
posts, so we got to be a running team and that's kind of who we have been and
who we will continue to be as long as we go with this personnel.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH CONNIE YORI: Thank you.

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Cait Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26509)

### [Martina Ellerbe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26452)

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

IOWA - 77  
OHIO STATE - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions from the student‑athletes.  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: It was a really hard fought game. I think both teams
played well, and I'm really proud of our players for the effort they put forth
today and through this whole tournament.  
We had several opportunities in the second half where we could have went away,
but we kept fighting and we gave ourselves a chance at the end. And a couple
things didn't go our way and but very, very proud of this group, especially
our seniors. Any time you take over a job, the thing you wish for most is you
inherit great kids. And we have some wonderful young women in this program and
it was a real pleasure to coach them this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Martina, the last shot you got, can you talk us through the play. Were
you the first option? Did it just go to you, did you think you had it in
there?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: The original play broke down a little bit. And Ameryst drove
the ball and then coach said if you get it, shoot it. And I got it and I shot
it. I wanted it to go in, of course.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For both of you, have you guys you really shot the three well in the
first two rounds and it wasn't really there as much in this game, but did they
defend you differently or talk about the three being off the third game the
third day.  
CAIT CRAFT: I think that they knew that we had a lot of 3‑point shooters, so
they extended their zone and they left the middle a little bit more open. But
shots aren't going to fall every day, so it's not an excuse, you just have to
find a way to adjust to that.  
MARTINA ELLERBE: I would say that we adjusted pretty well and I think we
stayed very aggressive. But to our credit I think that we put ourselves in a
good position at the end of the game, so, but things just didn't really go our
way.  
  
Q. In those last several minutes, Martina, you're a senior, Darryce is a
senior and you each made hugh plays to get back tight in the game. But the
emotions of those last few minutes, did you think you were going to get over
the hump and just how was it to play in a game like that?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: Of course we always think that we're going to go over the
hump. I think that just, as a competitor, you never think that you're going to
lose, you always want to win. I think that everyone on the team thought that
we were going to win. We kept fighting. So I would never say that we didn't
think we were going to win.  
  
Q. Darryce was really big down the stretch, made a lot of plays. It was
great to see her really kind of impose her will at times in the game.  
MARTINA ELLERBE: Yeah, I'm so proud of her. We both have come such a long way
and at the end it was like really gutsy.  
  
Q. Cait, I asked the Iowa players this as well, but have you ever played in
a game where there were two charging calls that were over turned and turned
into like a 3 ‑point play?  
CAIT CRAFT: I don't think I have. Iowa knew that we were going to take it to
the basket and we knew we were. It was a matter of beating each other to the
spot. The charge at the end, I was fortunate enough to be there and see that
my teammate needed my help. But I don't think I've ever been in a game where
it's been overturned like that, no. But the officials are going to do what
they're going to do. And I think the officials did a good job of taking their
time and figuring out what they were going to call.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Is this tournament something that really to build on for next year and
for years to come the way these kids kind of responded?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: I think so. What I think we can take away from that is I
think we took significant steps in just consistently playing hard and imposing
our will on the game.  
Also, I think you saw a little more glimpses of how we want to be from a style
standpoint. We were very aggressive, we were up‑tempo, and those are all
things that, the direction that we want to move towards and the type of kids
that we're recruiting.  
  
Q. Did you think that they played with a lot of confidence all three days?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: Yeah, that was the key. We came out, we were confident, we
were ready, we were focused, we were excited to play, we were excited for each
other and I think that certainly had a significant impact on our play.  
  
Q. Coach Bluder said that she played a defense that she had never played
kind of before to keep Ameryst out of the lane. But how much did the fourth
foul hurt her offense over the last several minutes?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: Yeah, it did hurt for sure. When she picked up her fourth
foul I think she was a little more hesitant trying to get to the basket. And
one of the things, I think overall today, although we shot 51 percent, we
weren't as good at being aggressive to generate open shots.  
Like yesterday we made every shot, but they were all open too. And they were
open because our execution and aggressive play was great. We didn't have as
much of that today. So we got good shots, but we got better shots the first
two games than we got today.  
  
Q. Is that because it was the third game in three days?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: Yeah, with what we're trying to do from a style standpoint
and as aggressively as we want them to play and got them to play, it certainly
caught up to us a little bit. But to Iowa's credit they were playing the same
thing, third game in three days and they really battled through it. So yeah,
both teams played really, really hard. They made a couple more plays at the
end and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Was there any sense even before you left that you would be seeing this
kind of performance from them or is it impossible to predict?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: It's hard to predict, but we just wanted to do the best
that we could to prepare in a manner that would get us ready for Northwestern.
And we did that. And then coming into the Penn State game we wanted to make
sure that we took our best shot at them. And we did that. And then today we
wanted to be focused and prepared and we were and we just kind of came up a
little bit short.  
  
Q. Talk about playing with confidence, is that almost kind of the secret, is
that a really important thing that can be hard to really get a team to do as
you go forward?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: It is. Part of, one of the things we battled this year a
little bit is with Martina, Cait, even Darryce to some degree, Amy, although
they were upperclassmen, they're almost like freshmen, because they never
really had a role before. And so like people who have never had to
consistently do that, we were a little up and down. And so if they had a bad
game, it could lead to two or three in a row, because they had never really
experienced that.  
And so, but I think that here at the end you kind of saw us put it together a
little bit more, where everybody played with a sense of confidence and it
really worked for us. It's disappointing to lose this game, because we had a
real chance. But it was a great game and both teams played really hard.  
  
Q. What did you want for the last play?  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: Well, we had, the first thing we were looking at it is in
action to get Darryce the ball around the basket. She had really come alive
down the stretch and was playing hard, getting great position, finishing. So
that was the first thing.  
I actually think she was open, but it's something that Cait was a little bit
‑‑ you know, rightfully so, trying to make sure we didn't turn it over. I
think she could have thrown it, but. And then we had like an action after
that, kind of that offense we run and we got a great look. And I'm glad that
we got a chance at a three and a chance to win the game and did a great job of
drawing two. And they were probably smart stopping her, because she was on her
way trying to get to the rim and they stopped her. And she threw a great pass
to Martina and she stepped into it and had a wide open look and it didn't go
in. And I think the thing you hope for most as a coach is that you get a
chance. We got a chance, but it didn't go in.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH KEVIN MCGUFF: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

IOWA - 77  
OHIO STATE - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get a statement from coach and then go to the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: I'm thrilled for our team. Ohio State has played extremely well.
Ameryst is so hard to defend. She is playing tremendous, but really, their
whole team has played so well in this tournament. Again, just feel great about
the victory. I thought our kids were really mentally tough down the stretch.
Thei's basket was incredible. I think she just willed that thing in.  
I think the whole Iowa fan base willed that ball in. Defense held the last few
seconds, the last minute there, and very, very glad that we survived this one.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Take me through that shot. Did you heave it up there, or did you know the
whole time that it was money.  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Good question. Well, I saw the opening, but I didn't know if
I had the touch to kiss it off the glass the right way, but luckily I did.  
  
Q. Ally, you guys built a 10 point lead and Ohio State kept coming back, but
they never took the lead, what does that tell you about your team?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Obviously, great teams make runs and that was a game of runs,
but I think that out there we really showed our resilience, we stuck together
as a group and down the stretch we all made plays, whether it was Thei out
there hitting those two free throws at the end, everybody stepped up on the
offensive and defensive end.  
  
Q. Melissa, there was a point in the second half and Ameryst was close
posting up and scoring off you guys and then basically she stopped. She
couldn't do it any more. How do you stop her?  
MELISSA DIXON: We just stayed together as a team, we got back to playing team
defense and staying together and making sure that we had each other's help.  
  
Q. Melissa, what was going through your head as you stepped to the line for
the final two free throws?  
MELISSA DIXON: We practice our free throws in practice in that situation, so I
didn't regret being in that position. In my head I knew that when I got to the
line I would make them.  
  
Q. For any of the three players, have you ever played any games where there
were two charge calls overturned and went back the other way in a game like
this happened today?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Absolutely not. It kept us all on our toes. We had at least
30 seconds to find out what the final call was going to be.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I agree with everything Tierra just said.  
  
Q. For any of you, have you had a chance to talk to Kathryn after the game?
I don't know what the situation was before if you guys expected her to play or
anything, but just if you got a chance to talk to her afterwards.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: We didn't know for sure with her it was kind of touch and go.
But, obviously, Kathryn coming in and playing those minutes and doing a good
job hitting with the pressure was awesome. And afterwards we were all so
excited for her and if you would have been in that locker room you would have
been pretty happy too.  
  
Q. Tierra, what does it mean for you and for this team to be in the position
now to play for a championship tomorrow?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: It's an amazing feeling. I can't think of a better script or
a better team to be going to the championship with. I think we deserved it, we
work hard, we played team basketball, we play the game the way it's supposed
to be played and we're all excited to play tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you, ladies. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Logic had one point and four fouls and I thought she played an excellent
game. Talk about the stuff that she does without the ball and in that kind of
taking charge and that kind of thing. Talking about Samantha.  
COACH BLUDER: Nine assists and one turnover. Sam has never been about being
about herself. It is all about, I will do whatever it takes for our team to
win this game. I don't have to score a point, it doesn't matter. And I think
when you truly have that feeling, I mean, some people can say that, she lives
it. You need a rebound? Fine, I'll rebound. I don't need to score, I don't
need my name in the paper, I'll do whatever it takes. And that's I think her
performance out there.  
She's our floor general, she leads us, she didn't have her shots today so she
didn't force it. Some kids get in that situation and they will start forcing
shots because oh my gosh I haven't scored yet. I have to do something.  
  
Q. Take us through on that Disterhoft charge and reversed call back to the
block. What did you see from your perspective?  
COACH BLUDER: It was the other way around. I thought they called the block and
then they called the charge at the end. Yeah. Obviously they went to monitor,
they looked at it, so they got it right. I thought that Ally would go to the
free throw line. I mean, I think we were celebrating that she went in there
and took it and I think she took a hard foul, but obviously, she didn't.  
  
Q. I asked the kids and they gave me the coach speak, but how did you stop
Alston from getting inside, because she was hurting you for awhile?  
COACH BLUDER: She was hurting us a lot and it was just her drives to the
basket were so strong and, um, we started having to switch every single thing.  
I mean at the beginning of the game we were only going to switch through ball
screens and we just had to switch every pitch, every handoff, every single
thing and try to keep her in front of us. And that was really the adjustment
that we made. I thought that when we went back to the zone, that also mixing
it up a little bit was good and trying to keep her out of the paint all day.
We shifted our zone personnel around as well. Never done that all year long
and did it tonight for the first time. Never practiced it even. Crazy. I know.  
  
Q. Theairra had a couple highlight reel plays, is her will to win kind of
what's pushing this team so far in this tournament?  
COACH BLUDER: I think she's playing great basketball right now, she has so
much confidence going to the rim, she's having fun, she's putting no pressure
on herself. This team, again, they love her so much, they want to win for her
so badly, and they celebrate so much when she has a move like‑‑ I mean she
provides me with a lot of wow moments and I love those.  
  
Q. I think you addressed this with the zone changes, but did you have to
approach defending this team differently than maybe the one you played 10 days
ago, based on what they did the last two days?  
COACH BLUDER: Oh, yeah. Being aware of their 3‑point shooting was totally
different how we prepared for them this time. What they have done in this
tournament was amazing. But it did catch up a little bit today and they only
made like one in the second half and three for the game.  
  
Q. Was the officiating at all a distraction in this game?  
COACH BLUDER: I don't think we let it be a distraction. And I think again,
that it kind of goes back to the mentality of our kids. You certainly can
get‑‑ you can let it get into your mind and start worrying about things or
your focus becomes that instead of the next play, and I thought our players
did a really good job.  
Even that last stretch where Ally‑‑ that call, they just talked about playing
great D. They didn't talk at all about the situation of the charge, they just
talked about all we need is one rebound. One rebound. That was all.  
  
Q. Is Kastanek going to be another game time decision?  
COACH BLUDER: Most likely. We'll look at her tonight and see how it goes.  
  
Q. Seems like you talk about this every game, but how good was Ally today,
especially in this type of situation that she was in?  
COACH BLUDER: Not playing like a freshman, is she. She's playing like a
seasoned player. She is playing with authority out there. She is not scared
and not backing down to anybody.  
It's just so much fun to see. It's so much fun to see her development, her
confidence grow, her rebounds at the end, you mean she was one that was
grabbing those defensive boards at the end when we had to have them. So not
afraid to take the ball to the hoop, I'm thrilled with how shes playing right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH BLUDER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Brandi Agee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26564)

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Becca Mills](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24891)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska - 86  
Michigan State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Suzy Merchant. Coach, we'll go to you for
an opening statement.  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: Well, that might quite possible be the worst game we ever
played. Give Nebraska a lot of credit though their upperclassmen and leaders
really showed up and set the tone early.  
And then it was just kind of a snowball affect. Kids that don't even really
play in the rotation were double figure scorers. We didn't have good
leadership from our vets, I thought a bright spot really this whole weekend
has been Brandi. She really came through for us this weekend in both games.
And you like to see that. We just need more doing that. But give Nebraska a
lot of credit, I thought they did a really nice job with setting the tone and
really punching us in the mouth and we just kept taking it. So I guess we, it
is sometimes what you get sometimes in that situation. We didn't punch back,
that's for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Can you explain maybe why you guys didn't punch back?  
BECCA MILLS: I think that we were just really flat in the first half and I
think that we weren't disciplined and we weren't executing. And I think that
we had the effort, we thought we were making an effort, but we weren't making
the right decisions and defensive positions. We wouldn't be in the right
positioning and so it wouldn't matter how much we hustled. And we weren't
disciplined. I think that was the biggest part.  
  
Q. Brandi, coach talked about your weekend here, how do you feel about what
you've done in this tournament?  
BRANDI AGEE: Well, the first game I thought I did good and the second game it
just wasn't enough. It was a tough loss.  
  
Q. Becca, what else kind of happened? Was there anything that they did to
you guys during that run, after Hooper picked up that second foul was when
they took off. Was it more you guys or something they did specifically?  
BECCA MILLS: You know, it was us, they came out attacking us and they were
shooting the ball well and we weren't doing anything well to make a difference
on that. They were beating us off cuts, shooting it in our face, but it was on
us, it wasn't, they were attacking, we just weren't responding.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said this might be your worst game ever, you weren't kidding,
right?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: No. I wasn't. Especially from a defensive perspective. I
mean that first half was, I mean, as bad as you can get. We couldn't set a ‑‑
we just, we were awful. And it didn't matter what position, I felt like that
our point defense was bad or whatever, the one kid we were guarding, we
couldn't stop the backup. That's not a good sign. And it was bad.  
It was ‑‑ you can't dig a hole against Nebraska. A 10 point lead for them
feels like 30. So when you're down by 23 at halftime, 30 whatever it was, more
than that, I guess, I don't want to look at the stat sheet, but it was bad.
It's just, it just felt monumental. So the second half, you're within five,
but when you're down by 23 points, you know, you lose by 30. And to their
credit, they came out and they really stuck it to us and like I said, you
think you either answer or you don't.  
I don't think our upperclassmen vets were anywhere to be found, quite
honestly. And that's what this game is about, to have a good showing for your
seniors and juniors who have been here and done it, and they need to do their
job. And we didn't get that out of them today. And obviously it affected what
we needed to win the game.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on calling a timeout when things were starting to spiral out
of control there in the first half?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I mean, I just felt like it was one of those things
where watching it, quite honestly, you know, our kids were really making tons
of excuses, quite frankly. I was just sick of it. So sometimes you got to
learn a lesson and play through it. I didn't think it was going to matter. As
bad as that sounds. Sometimes they got to take the heat a little bit and it
wasn't about timeouts.  
I could have called four timeouts and be down by 30 at halftime. I mean it
just was the way it was. They need to fight through some things and I felt
like that was one of those situations where I wanted to see what kind of grit
we had a little bit, and see if we could pull ourselves up. Because every time
we ‑‑ I mean a media timeout after media timeout. How many timeouts do you
need? How many more can I call?  
At that point I just felt like every time they came they had a reason for why
they weren't performing or what was going on with the officials or each other
or something. And I'm not going to add to that. I just ‑‑ sometimes you need
to own up and be accountable and gut things out. And I don't think it would
have made a difference, quite honestly. You get a media timeouts every four
minutes, you can get your self together at that point.  
  
Q. Where do you go from here you got a week off before the selection show.
What can you do?  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: Well, work. I know that. I mean, obviously, we'll have a
day or two off, but we got to get back and work together a little bit better.
I thought we were a little ‑‑ even in the first game we were a little bit
sluggish. I think that we got back to some individual focuses instead of team
focuses. Really work on execution in the quarter court. We didn't pass the
ball with each other. Even in that first game a lot of our offense, even
against Michigan, was really created off of rebounds, it wasn't a good flowing
offense and I think that's something that we have to do a better job of.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Good luck, coach.  
COACH SUZY MERCHANT: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  61  
Michigan  58

  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, it wasn't the ‑‑ you know, the ideal first half for us.
I thought you know, give Michigan credit, they were really taking it to us out
of the gates. I thought off the bounce in transition we were a little bit out
of sync and just couldn't get into a flow. And that last like eight minutes of
the half to really kind of push our way into single digits and be as close as
we were given how poorly we were playing and shooting it, I was proud of our
kids. I felt like if we could just keep attacking in the second half off the
dribble or inside, we would have a chance.  
And you know, we made some really key plays down the stretch. I've really got
to give these two credit, as well as I thought Brandy Agee off the bench and
Jasmine Hines was really big for us.  
  
Q. To me, it looked like sheer will to win out there. Annalise, can you talk
about what you guys were thinking? You got ‑‑ you had get within a couple of
points and they'd score three or four and get within one point, they'd score a
couple. You kept beating your head against the wall. And then the last, what,
a minute and 18, I think you finally got ahead. Talk about the sheer will to
win.   
ANNALISE PICKREL: I think when it comes to Big Ten play, it's games like that
‑‑ it's just back and forth, you know, the lead changes all the time. And I
think that especially against Michigan, for us, the will to win is probably
the most important part of the game, you know, along with your focus and your
energy. And so I have to give credit to them, though. They really stuck it to
us in the first half. But we were able to overcome, you know, the things that
we weren't doing in the first half, we were able to, you know, get it together
in the second half. And it made a big difference for us that we were able to
come together communication‑wise and also start attacking them like they did
to us.  
  
Q. Tori, did you notice any fatigue on their part? This is their second game
and they're only playing six people. Did you notice any fatigue at all out
there on their part or what do you think happened at the end of the first half
to them and the end of the second half?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Yeah. I would ‑‑ in the beginning they were really giving it
out and pushing it on us and we struggled to get back in transition. But
towards the end of the first half and the end of the second half, well, half
of it was because we were getting stops and they weren't making every shot
they were taking so we were able to get the ball out and go in transition,
which usually helps us. I think that was one of the main reasons why we ended
up taking the lead and bringing the lead down in the end of the first half.  
  
Q. Tori, what has the process been for you kind of finding the right mindset
for the role you're playing and theminutes you're playing now for this team?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Well, Kiana was out in the beginning of the season for some
medical reasons. And that gave me a little bit of a chance to see how it was
to play point guard whenever Klarissa was out or in the middle of the Big Ten,
it helped me out a lot just learning and adapting to the way you have to score
at the point guard position, and just having the ball in your hands most of
the time and getting everybody in the right spots and having the right mindset
to be the point guard instead of a shooting guard.  
  
Q. Annalise, could you talk about what you did in the first half to keep you
guys in the game?  
ANNALISE PICKREL: I just tried to keep everybody composed and keep everyone
kind of focused and energized and really wanting to win. But I would
definitely have to say that my teammates have put me in positions that I was
able to score, and Coach, as well. So the credit goes to them. But I just
tried to keep us glued together in the first half.  
  
Q. Tori, I don't know if you covered this or not, but on your last
possession when you drove for the basket, did you see Annalise open and what
was your thought process there?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I didn't see her open but I thought‑‑ I don't know how many
seconds were left, but there wasn't very many. So I figured we should slow it
down instead of getting a quick three. I mean, she could have made it and she
probably would have. I just thought time, score, possession, like Coach always
says, we need to slow it down and make sure we got a good shot. And really
having the offensive rebounding position like Brandy had and got an offensive
board and put the basket back in.  
  
Q. Suzy, did you ever think you would win with Aerial shooting one for
nine?  
COACH MERCHANT: No. I think Aerial got in her own way to today, that's for
sure. You know, she was overthinking and not just playing. But it was nice to
see other people step up and really to add to that, Klarissa was not very good
today. You know, she was kind of ‑‑ I mean, just in a place that I hadn't seen
her in a long time. So you know, it was good. She got some rest, I guess, is
the best way to put it. Her and Aerial didn't play extended minutes. But it
did allow I thought Jasmine Hines and Brandy Agee had some huge plays. I mean,
that steal down the stretch, the rebound, a couple of defensive possessions at
the very, very end. That's been something we've really been harping with her
on. She's got great length and athleticism, but sometimes she can do some
things like in the first half where she just went after No. 2 for no reason
and just got her second foul. So we've really tried to get her to be a little
more disciplined defensively, and I thought she's as good as she's has been in
the second half and really sparked us in some key plays.  
  
Q. Touch on Brandy. Just kind of talk about the way that she's kind of
stayed ready for you guys and kind of prepared for a moment like this.  
COACH MERCHANT: Obviously she's been getting a lot more minutes as of late,
the last eight, nine games. I think it's hard as a freshman; everybody's
journey is different, especially in her situation when there's three freshmen
and two of the freshmen are starting and playing and people are talking about
them. They've had good seasons. It's not that maybe Brandy is doing something
wrong; sometimes it's that there's a veteran senior in her position, and
that's kind of the case where you have Klarissa, who's really a natural swing
guy and started the season that way, as well as Annalise.  
I think the credit goes to Brandy because she didn't allow that to get her so
frustrated that she wasn't focused in practice. There's things she has to do
better. She's really worked at them. And that being the defensive side of the
ball for us. There's natural things she does, driving the ball and rebounding,
that kind of thing. Little things. She made her free throws today. She really
defended well in the quarter court when we needed someone out there, because
Klarissa has been our defender. I really give Brandy a lot of credit. It's not
an easy pill to swallow when you watch two of the three freshmen start and
play a lot of minutes and you're just trying to fight for yours. But since
there's been a transition there with Kiana, she's really taken advantage of us
and sparked us in many games.  
  
Q. On their last possession, it seemed like Becca was out guarding?  
COACH MERCHANT: We were switching every screen. Yeah. I don't want to hedge
them. I thought about taking Becca out, but actually Becca does a pretty good
job in late‑clock situations when you know they're going for a three, maybe
not so much when you know they're going to drive it and turn the corner, but I
felt like they were going to stay behind ball screens and rescreen and flare
screen, and she's usually pretty solid at that with her length.  
I thought if she could switch out on the No. 2 or Ristovski, she would at
least maybe bother the shot some. So I did keep her in there and we did go
with the switch everything situation, which was, I thought, the right thing to
do. But certainly I can understand the angst that maybe some people saw when
Becca was going against Siera Thompson.  
  
Q. Going back to the will ‑to‑win thing, again, your team had gotten out,
you know, you kept batting your head against the door, so to speak, and
finally broke through. What do you think was the key to that? Was it just
leadership? What was it that put you guys over the top?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think there was a few things. You have to look at our vets a
little bit. I do think Annalise's will to win, as you mentioned, you know, was
there from start the finish. And sometimes when things aren't going our way we
can kind of become an individualized team. Everybody wants to put the team on
their back, but because of that, it's like one‑pass shot, we're one and done
and that kind of thing. She didn't allow that to happen. And then I thought
when Becca and Jas played together in there, their experience, their ability
to play together, feed each other, rebound, defend Goree and Val Driscoll at
the same time, I thought those three in particular were really instrumental
the whole game. I thought Brandy's will to win there down the stretch really
plummeted us in into an opportunity where she basically won the game for us
with the steal and the rebound put‑back and the defensive tie‑up.  
  
Q. A what role or roles did you envision Tori playing when you guys started
preseason?  
COACH MERCHANT: The kid is, she talks about point guard position. You know, I
didn't recruit her to be a point guard. I thought she would play some every
now and then as a scoring point guard. I think that's something she does
bring. She can hit that three behind the high‑ball screen. We call it a Texas
screen. You know, she has the ability to pull the trigger from there. It gives
us a different look. We can go into a big lineup.  
I mean, I anticipated her playing some, certainly not this much. To her
credit, to hear her talk about time, score, possession, I almost had a heart
attack. I thought I was going into arrhythmia. It's just gratifying a little
bit to hear that. It's not her natural position. It's not something that she
came here to do, but given the circumstances, it is what it is. And we've had
many players that have been in that situation and have triumphed and been
resilient, and she's one of them. She's a high‑character kid. And I think
high‑character kids will do whatever it takes for the team. That's what I've
seen out of her. If it's point guard, it's point guard. If it's two guard,
it's two guard. She'll do whatever we need her to do.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Jordan Hooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21826)

### [Rachel Theriot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26542)

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  80  
Minnesota  67

  
COACH YORI: Sure. Well, I thought, you know, our execution in the second half
was really good. We made a lot of plays in the second half and down the
stretch when the game got tight. You know, we had a number of players make
plays. I thought obviously Jordan had a great game throughout the game, and
Rachel was a big part of that. I told Rachel I don't know what's up with one
turnover. I don't get it. I mean, what's the problem? But any way, she, you
know, facilitated for us, but you know, Jordan was the recipient of a lot of
them.  
But also we had some other players make some plays down the stretch.
Laudermill, three; Emily; Hailie had a chance to have an and‑one. We just had
some kids that did some things. We tried to take away their strengths on their
offensive end, and I thought we did a really good job for the most part on
Banham, and I thought we stuck with our game plan. It wasn't always perfect.
They had some kids who made some shots, but at the same time I thought the
fact that we were scoring on offense allowed us to continue to do what we were
doing defensively.  
  
Q. Jordan, it was a two ‑point game and then you guys pulled away the last
four, five minutes. What stands out in that last stretch to pull away?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I would just say probably, like Coach said, T's big three and
Em's big three, they kind of got the momentum swung, I guess. And then we made
some stops on defense, and I think that was the biggest key.  
  
Q. Rachel, sometimes players will talk about being in the zone as a shooter.
Did you feel like you were in a zone as a passer tonight?  
RACHEL THERIOT: Yeah, you could say that. I mean, just finding my teammates
and knowing that they can hit open shots and stuff and make plays.  
  
Q. Their center was in foul trouble obviously most of the game. Why was it
not maybe possible to capitalize on that a little bit more than you were maybe
hoping for I guess?  
JORDAN HOOPER: Well, they have great posts that can pretty much interchange,
Riché and Zahui. They do a really great job down low. So I don't think it
really matters which one is on the floor. They're going to pick up where the
other one left off. That's why there wasn't any letdown when she did leave.
Riché is great. She did come off the bench this year a little bit more, but
she's a really great player, so I think that's why there wasn't any letdown.  
  
Q. Rachel, can you talk about, obviously the last game against Purdue did
not go how you guys wanted. What does it mean to go out and get momentum kind
of back on your side as far as executing and getting a win?  
RACHEL THERIOT: I think it's just one game at a time. Obviously that game just
happened, put it in the past and just keep getting better as a team. I think
right now we're just getting back to how we play the Nebraska way.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's it like out there offensively when you can keep things
around what Rachel's passing and you know coming off the pick the ball is
coming to you at the right spot?  
RACHEL THERIOT: I think that means everything to everybody. We know we're
going to get the ball at the right time in the right spot because Rachel knows
exactly where everybody is going to be. She can find ‑‑ even if it's not your
pass, she'll find the next person, and that's pretty cool.  
  
Q. Looking at Rachel's game, what about Minnesota's defense and also what
she was able to do tonight, she's also had high assist games in the past, but
tonight what enabled that? Was there a trend you were seeing with a lot of her
assists?  
COACH YORI: We actually didn't run as much ball screen stuff tonight as we
kind of thought going into the game, but Jordan had it going we tried to take
advantage of some other things. Rachel, that's been Rachel all year. I mean,
18 is obviously a little unusual. But you know, she's had a lot of games where
she's had nine, ten, 11 assists this year. So she just you know, she's good in
a lot of ways. She just really dissects defense.  
  
Q. Coach, what was kind of the game plan to limit Banham, especially in the
second half? I think she only had four of her 12.  
COACH YORI: Well, I think Hailie did a good job on her. You know, she's a
tough cover. You know, we tried to take her strengths away. And I thought
Hailie really kind of locked in on that. And I think two of the baskets that
she scored was when someone else was on her, and in fact, maybe three. But you
know, we just tried to take away her strengths. And you know, she's a really
good three‑point shooter and she likes to use her right hand. And we tried to
take advantage of those things. Hailie was very disciplined in what she was
doing. We also played some good team defense. They set ball screens forward.
You got to be able to defend those. We have a decent match‑up for her.  
  
Q. When the player is hot shooting, you call plays for them to get open.
With Rachel the way she's passing, do you have specific plays that you know
she's going to get loose to pass it, or is that just the basic offense you're
running?  
COACH YORI: A lot of stuff goes through Rachel. Not all of it, but she gets
her chances to be the facilitator in a lot of the things that we do.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, what are one or two key things you have to do
tomorrow to win again?  
COACH YORI: Well, Michigan State is very physical. And you know, that's not
necessarily our forte, and we're not a very big team. So we've got to figure
out ways to guard their interior game and at the same time, you know, do a
good job on their perimeter game. And what makes them tough is that they have
a good inside‑outside game, and we've got to find a way to guard that. And you
know, but we have, you know, at times found different ways to do that. But
we're going to get back to the drawing board and get back to our banquet room
and watch some film.  
I do want to comment that I think Minnesota deserves to be in the NCAA
Tournament, and I think they've had a great year. They've had a great
February. They've played well down the stretch. They got a win yesterday in
the tournament, and I think you know, with the strength of our league and
their RPI, I think they need to be in the NCAA Tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Ariel Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26510)

### [Dara Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26511)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  99  
Penn State  82

  
Q. For either of you, what do you think it was in the first half that
allowed them to thrive from outside the arc?  
DARA TAYLOR: I think our defensive intensity was low to start the game. They
came out strong and came out hot, executed. We weren't bumping and we weren't
quick enough in the zone, and they had a lot of open looks.  
ARIEL EDWARDS: I agree with her.  
  
Q. When you guys were warming up, a couple of times you were kind of
encouraging everybody to be a little more emotional. Did you guys feel like
you were maybe a little flat early on?  
ARIEL EDWARDS: Definitely. They came out and they started the game great. Our
energy was low. We didn't come out the way we needed to, and they took
advantage of it.  
  
Q. Dara?  
DARA TAYLOR: Yeah, I agree. I think a bunch of us hadn't been in this position
before and we just weren't ready to start the game. They were completely ready
and locked and loaded. We didn't answer their energy.  
  
Q. Ariel had a big day with 29 and 10. Especially in the second half she was
playing very well. What would you say about her fight personally with numbers
like that today?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought she did a good job of being aggressive and taking
what was available for her.  
  
Q. Talk about your decision to stay in that zone until the second media
timeout. Did you think about dropping it after four minutes, or were you
hoping they were going to cool off, I guess, the first 10, 12minutes of the
game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, they're a tough match‑up for us man‑to‑man.
You know, as you could see, we gave up, I don't know what, 96, 97, however
many, 99points. You know, they're a touch match‑up for us man‑to‑man, and when
they're making the outside shots like they did at the start of the game, it
makes it tough for us.  
So you know, we didn't want to go man‑to‑man early because of their dribble
penetration.  
  
Q. I mean, how frustrating is it when you you've got a strategy when you
look at all of the numbers that makes perfect sense and the other team is just
doing things you're not expecting them to do?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I thought they did a good job of getting really good
ball movement against the zone and getting open shots, and we didn't adjust
quick enough defensively to prevent them from getting open looks. You know,
when you play zone, you know you're going to give up threes, three‑point
shots. You just want to give up certain three‑point shots. And we just didn't
rotate quick enough or aggressively enough in the zone to prevent them from
getting wide open looks. And they did a really good job of attacking gaps and
making the extra pass to get three‑point looks.  
  
Q. Coach, is there anything you can take away from today's game that you
would use in the first round in the NCAA, especially early in the game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think it's a little too early to say there's some
takeaways. You know, I'd like to watch the tape and you know, digest the game
a little bit before you know, I start making grand pronouncements of what you
can take away from the game. But yeah, the good thing is we've got a little
bit of time off to regroup and get ready for the NCAA Tournament where we know
we're going to play some quality opponents.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Liza Clemons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26519)

### [Courtney Moses](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21782)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Purdue  80

  
COACH VERSYP: That was a great basketball game. Saw a lot of offense obviously
from the first play in this game. Iowa is obviously a very good team. Both of
us pretty much had the same records. Knew it was going to be a battle. People
say upsets and this and that. It was just a great basketball game. It could
have went either way. And I wish them the best of luck as they move forward.  
  
Q. Courtney, just the turnovers today, is that sort of what the game came
down to, you guys giving up a few too many possessions?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, that was the talk at halftime. Coach, as soon as she
came in, she put up the stat for the turnovers at halftime and we needed to
change that the second half and it didn't happen. We ended with 20 turnovers
to their 11, which that's a huge difference. A lot of them were charges, and
we didn't adjust to the way that it was being called, and when we were getting
those charges, it means we're not getting a shot up and they're getting the
ball back. So I think the turnovers are definitely a huge key.  
  
Q. Saying all of that, you have I think a six ‑point lead with about five
minutes to go, what changed in that next few minutes that maybe brought them
back in the game?  
COURTNEY MOSES: They got the ball in transition. They got a few buckets. They
were getting layups. They were getting to the foul line and they were hitting
their foul shots.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys came out of time ‑outs two times in the a row there
late and had the turnovers. Just how much does that in particular hurt?
Because I imagine you guys have something set up coming out of both of those
that you feel like you might be able to score on?   
COURTNEY MOSES: Any time we aren't getting a shot up and we're giving it right
back to them, it definitely hurts. If we're not getting a shot up that means
we're not able to get an offensive board maybe. So there's a lot that you lose
when you turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Lisa, what advantage did you guys feel like you had inside and being able
to you know, do you feel like you exploited that enough today?  
LIZA CLEMONS: Apparently not good enough. We did finish. We got Doolittle in
foul trouble, which was huge. We just needed to capitalize when we had post
players on us. Get inside offense rebounds as well. And since they front, it's
easier to get an offensive rebound. I mean, we tried. We should have tried
harder.  
  
Q. I guess the same question I guess, just the two time ‑outs and the
turnovers coming out of those two, what did you hope for and what happened on
those?  
COACH VERSYP: We were setting up wide open, our post players were wide open
and the ball just didn't get there, whatsoever.  
  
Q. With the ‑‑ what's different about this game maybe than the last, you
know, six when you had really taken care of the ball really well?  
COACH VERSYP: You just got to look at people that had the turnovers.  
  
Q. What was Iowa doing to not allow you to get any stops late in the game?  
COACH VERSYP: We weren't playing any defense. So they were just driving right
past us and then we were just trying to get be swat machine rather having two
hands straight up. So those two combined getting beat off the dribble and then
thinking that we can be a fly swatter wasn't really conducive to what we
discussed.  
  
Q. As you look ahead to the NCAA Tournament, do you feel this game should
have any bearing where you guys should be?  
COACH VERSYP: That's going to be up to the committee. My opinion never matters
in anything. So you know, our RPI is 7. Supposed to look at the whole season,
injuries, et cetera. Iowa is a great team. They're ranked in the top 25. Their
RPI is 28. Do I need to go on? I don't know. It's not up to me. I hope we're a
four or five seed. I hope they're a four or five seed. I hope Penn State, they
were a three seed; this may hurt them. I hope they're a four or five seed so
the three of us have a chance to do something.  
  
Q. KK Houser was suited up today. What was her status? Could she have
played?  
COACH VERSYP: No. Just going through the warmup. For the game situation, where
I needed to have her come in maybe to shoot a free throw if they were pressing
us, if we needed a free‑throw shooter rather than defender, I would have put
her. Or if it was the other way around, if we had a good lead, I would have
put her in just because she deserves that opportunity.  
  
Q. At the end of the first half they're in foul trouble and only having that
four ‑point lead as opposed to what it was at nine, when you reflect back, how
big was that sequence for you guys?  
COACH VERSYP: It was big. We're ahead by nine. We're not supposed to hop off
any ball‑side shooters. We had turnovers and we had charges and four plays
that we were supposed to execute, we didn't execute one. That's when we wanted
to take advantage of their lack of size. We were trying to get it inside,
trying to get lobs in, and we didn't do that one time in the last four
minutes.  
  
Q. You basically started to answer it there, but you just didn't take
advantage enough of getting the ball inside for not only then but for a lot of
the game?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah. We needed somebody to take control out there. Nobody was.
If you push the ball you don't have anything, you need to bring the ball back
and then you need to be executing and be zeroed in on what we're looking for
in the mismatches, and we did that very poorly today.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

### [Theairra Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24379)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Purdue  80

  
COACH BLUDER: We feel really good about this game. Coming from behind,
battling foul trouble the first half, beating a very, very good basketball
team, a team that's going to do incredible things in the NCAA Tournament. So
it always makes you feel good when you beat a team that you respect. And we
have a lot of respect for Purdue and the program and Sharon and Courtney
Moses, and so that one makes this one feel good, those reasons.  
  
Q. Ally, I guess I'd sum up this game with Iowa is you; you were 0 for nine
at one point, banged your head into the basket, fell on the ground. The second
half was just different, you kept attacking and attacking. What made Iowa win
today?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I think we just did a great job distributing the ball. That's
kind of something we pride ourselves in is playing very unselfishly, always
looking to make that extra pass. Obviously the first half for me was a little
rough, but my teammates and coaches were just encouraging me throughout
halftime and the second half. We believe in each other so much, and when you
have a group of girls that believe in each other that much, you can do some
pretty great things and, I think that's what we did here today.  
  
Q. Samantha, you guys scored on nine straight possessions there late in the
game to take them into a seven ‑point lead. What stands out execution wise in
that stretch there for you?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think keeping our composure with 12minutes left, you're down
seven, easily could fold or easily could just lose your focus, and I think we
kept our focus today. Like Al said, just distributing the ball. You just don't
know who the ball is going to go to. And on our team anyone can make a play.
We had a couple of different people today at some point make huge plays, and
that's what we feed off of.  
  
Q. Sam, what did you guys think of the pace of the game? Is that the type of
pace you guys wanted, the back and forth seesaw type of thing?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, I think so. We want to get up and down. In the first
half we weren't able to do that too much because we weren't rebounding on the
defensive end, letting them get put‑backs so we couldn't get out and push. We
did a little bit better job in the second half, I think. That's the best place
that we distribute the ball. Obviously with three or four people that can lead
a break, it makes it really fun.  
  
Q. I think a couple parts of the game you had to match up with Courtney
Moses. What sort of things as a defender can you do to try to limit her effect
on the game?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: You're not going to just stop her in the game. You just want
to contest her shots. She's good at coming off screens. They set a lot of
down‑screens and flair screens for us. We just wanted to show on those screens
and our focus going in defensively was to stop Courtney Moses. She's a great
player, but I think we did a good job at the end in contesting her shots.  
  
Q. Ally, what was your reaction when you heard Ohio State won and kind of
your thoughts on a few things that you guys need to do to beat them?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, you know, we were watching the end of that game, and
you know, obviously they played a great game. But you know, we're just going
to focus on what we need to do to win. Obviously having played them twice this
season, I think that gives us a bit of an advantage. We kind of know what to
expect scouting‑wise. Like I said, we're just to focus on playing Iowa
basketball.  
  
Q. Sam, you touched a little bit on the foul trouble. Particularly in the
first half I think you guys only had 16 fouls, but it was you two, Dixon two
and Doolittle two. How did that come into effect in particular in the first
half and especially the closing of the first half?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: You know, we usually sit out with two fouls. Didn't want to
pick up that third one, so Beth was out for awhile, Dix was out for awhile. So
it was important that our bench played really well again. Obviously they gave
us a lift yesterday, and we got a lift going into halftime again. Just to keep
it close, that's all you're going to do and that's what ‑‑ we know we can win
those kinds of games. They did a great job. But just got to try to stay out of
that.  
  
Q. There were two times in the last three and a half minutes out of a time
‑out Purdue had a turnover and kind of threw it out of bounds. Can you take me
through those two plays, and were you expecting what they were going to try to
do or how those played out?  
COACH BLUDER: They were trying to force the ball inside. I think we did a good
job in getting our feet and getting them around and make it a harder pass.
They were trying to really take advantage of Ally inside. Again, I think our
footwork kind of created a harder pass. But also I think when they lost the
lead it took a little wind out of their sails, and obviously the momentum
shifted.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you think your bench played tonight? In particular, Claire
and Kali had to give you a lot of minutes in the first half. Can you assess
how you thought they played?  
COACH BLUDER: They were big. I was just looking at that right now, Ryan, is
that Lex plays 16 for us, Claire plays 15, Kali plays 13, all huge minutes,
and they played really well in their time. That's what's been so nice, you
know, the development of our bench in the last month or so. Claire Till's
basket in the last few minutes there, that was huge. She just took it up
strong. And they're just not trying to overdo. They're not trying to do too
much. They're coming in and they're playing their role and they're giving us
good quality minutes.  
  
Q. Lisa, the two turnovers that Brian talked about, overall Purdue committed
20, but being able to capitalize on those mistakes, how big was that for you
guys?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, I think we scored 32points off of their 20 turnovers.
That's a lot. You know, we had a couple of times they threw it out‑of‑bounds
but we also took five charges in this game, maybe even more. That number
stands out to me right now. It's not easy to take a charge. I really admire
players when they take charges, because it's hard to put your body in the way
of somebody coming in full force to the basket. Once you get a couple of them
you realize they are going to call this. We are going to be able to pick it
up. Then it kind of snowballs. I think that happened to us today. We realized
we could do this, and it kind of got everybody a little bit more inspired to
give up their bodies.  
  
Q. Doolittle was pretty much a nonfactor in the first half. What sort of
things were you guys able to do to get her going in the second half?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, Bethany can have a bad first half. Ally can have a bad
first half. Although I don't like it, I still believe in them. I believe in
both of those players so much that they're going come back. Halftime they
regroup mentally, come back and give us some great minutes. First half Bethany
got into a little bit of foul issues. I'm just never going to back off of her.
I won't back off of either one of them. I think they're both great players.  
  
Q. How much did what happened in the first meeting when you guys had the 18
‑point lead maybe fuel your team when you got down six or maybe the end of the
first half to stay in this game?  
COACH BLUDER: That was big. It was referred to quite often in the last
24hours. And you know, honestly probably before then even, too. Our players
wanted this rematch. They wanted to have the opportunity to play Purdue again.
Again, not ‑‑ in all full respect to Purdue, I mean, they're a great team, but
it hurts when you're up 16 and you lose by one point. Those things stay with
you a lot. And so they were very excited about having this opportunity.  
But you know, we'll get down ‑‑ we were down seven with 12minutes. We had to
kind of remind them again of those situations that we had a big lead and they
came back and beat us and you know, we can turn the tables here.  
  
Q. Lisa, did you have to kind of breathe a sigh of relief at the end? That
one really came down to the wire. I guess how on edge were you throughout
maybe the last two minutes or so of the game?  
COACH BLUDER: I've been on edge the last 24hours. So it wasn't really the last
two minutes, to be quite honest. I mean, Purdue is a great team. They're an 8
RPI. I mean, to beat a team like this‑‑ somebody asked me something about an
upset. I said we were tied with Purdue. It wasn't really an upset. They beat
us by one point. But yes, breathe a sigh of relief when we got the ‑‑ I think
it was an seven‑ or eight‑point lead late. That was nice. It didn't have to
come down to the wire like it did last game, the last shot.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you guys need to do well tomorrow?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I have not ‑‑ I didn't watch the game today. My
assistants did. But I did not. I didn't watch them yesterday, either. I've
always believed in focusing on the next game at hand and not really looking
ahead a whole lot. So I have great assistant coaches that have prepared us and
I'll meet with them right after this. I do know that Ohio State shot the three
really well in this tournament, extremely well. So we're going to have to get
out and cover their three‑point shooters. Ameryst is a great player. We
definitely have to keep track of her, just like Courtney Moses is a great
player. You have to know where those people are and she's having a fabulous
tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Madison Ristovski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26531)

### [Siera Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26532)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE  61  
MICHIGAN - 58

  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought it was a great basketball game. I'm sorry to be
on the short end of the stick. I thought we really played well as a team and
they did a tremendous job of offensive rebounding and giving themselves
second‑chance opportunities and that's where I thought they really beat us.
But at the end of the day it was a great game and I'm sorry we came out on the
bad side.  
  
Q. Siera, could you talk about that last possession, please?  
SIERA THOMPSON: On the last possession, we were looking for Madison for three.
And they did a good job on defense of denying her and denying everyone else
and switching out on me on screens.  
  
Q. Madison, can you talk about your second half, especially in the threes?  
MADISON RISTOVSKI: I just noticed that in the first half every time that
Cyesha or Val were down low that the defense would collapse on them. So I just
kind of told them to look to kick it out and I would try to move to an open
spot. So we kind of talked about it and I was pretty confident going into the
second half to get those shots.  
  
Q. The forwards had, you know, the three of them had some foul trouble this
game. How does your role change when Nicole is out and when at various points
midway through the second half you have three forwards with three fouls?  
SIERA THOMPSON: We just have to step up when other players are down. And I
think we did that very well offense and defense. So that's what we tried to
do.  
MADISON RISTOVSKI: We just have to make sure that we're always letting them
know that they're in foul trouble, to make sure they stay in the game. They're
a big asset when that happens. When that happens us guards have to help them
with their people that they're guarding.  
  
Q. Coach, toward the end of the first half and toward the second half, they
had ‑‑ they basically made runs that you guys had played yesterday or last
night and you played again tonight. Was there any fatigue at all or was it
just a breakdown in the defense or something?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought at the end of the first half when they made that
run it was because Cyesha Goree was on the bench and they continued to play
with two bigs on offense, which made us not really be able to guard them. So
we had to go to zone and they really took advantage of our zone and they went
inside at the end of the first half. And I thought that was really critical. I
thought the start of the second half Cyesha was back in but we were playing
tight. And we just needed to get back to playing how we played in the first
half. I think after we called the timeout they relaxed a little bit and they
played more confident. I think when they did make those runs it was probably
due to some of our key players being out with foul trouble.  
  
Q. If you could tell us about the decision to go to look for Madison on the
last play. You have Siera out there, two great three ‑point shooters, just
what the thought process was?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Maddy was hot. We always say let's try to go to the hot
hand. Maddy was making shots. She missed a couple late, one I don't think she
was ready on the catch. The other one before the last play she had an open
look. And she missed that one. But you know, we just try to get the ball to
the hot hand and she was playing really well.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Rachel Banham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23253)

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

### [Stabresa McDaniel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26493)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  80  
Minnesota  67

  
COACH BORTON: I was really proud of our players for really battling tonight
for the entire game. I thought we played a great 35minutes. It felt like down
the stretch the last six minutes of the game, you know, we missed the
wide‑open lay‑up, we were down four, we missed a wide‑open lay‑up underneath,
which would have cut it two, and I felt like it really affected our defense
from there. We never got closer than that after missing that lay‑up.  
I was really proud of our players for battling tonight, and got to give a lot
of credit to Nebraska for putting a great game plan together.  
  
Q. Stabresa, just kind of talk about your mindset coming off the bench and
being able to do what you did tonight.  
STABRESA McDANIEL: I just have to play with confidence. My team and coaches
gave me a lot of that. We can't always depend on Rachel and Amanda to do all
the scoring, and they were playing awesome so I just drove off them and tried
to attack and create others for my teammates.  
  
Q. Rachel, just kind of talk about what they were doing to kind of limit you
on your looks and what you're able to do tonight?  
RACHEL BANHAM: Hailie Sample did a good job of face‑guarding me and playing
over the screen. So even if I popped there, it wasn't very open. They did a
good job of plugging the lane when I put the ball down. So they did a good
job.  
  
Q. Got to be happy with that bench play, 25points, I mean, from ‑‑ history
is you've got a couple of scores, but it must have been nice to see that
effort from them.   
COACH BORTON: It really was, you know, and Mikayla Bailey and Stabresa
McDaniel have been out a lot of the season with injuries, and I feel like
those two are playing their best basketball this time of the year. They're
kind of getting in the flow. They're getting some confidence, and I thought
Mikayla and Stabresa did a great job for us. I thought Micaella Riché did a
good job coming off the bench and giving us some good minutes and giving us
some offense when Amanda was on the bench, but I thought our bench played very
well tonight.  
  
Q. Pam, Connie said that she felt that your team deserved to be in the NCAA
based on the strength of the schedule, based on the strength of the league.
Last night you said you felt you should be in. But tonight, have your thoughts
changed in any way?  
COACH BORTON: Absolutely not. I think we're a team that's got 20 wins. We're
in the Big Ten. We're .500 in the league after the tournament here, and you
know, we've won ‑‑ we've had a great February and a strong run here towards
the end of the season.  
  
Q. Obviously I mean, with Amanda's second score for the team, how
detrimental was it tonight for them, early foul trouble and they keep her on
the bench as long as she was?  
COACH BORTON: Well, you know, I give a lot of credit to the rest of our team.
We were in the game the entire game until the last six minutes. I thought
Micaella Riché did a great job coming in and really filling a role and scoring
for us inside and just really played smart defensively. I thought it really
took Amanda really out of the flow of her game. She came in the game and
scored a couple of baskets, but she didn't defend very well. She gave up a lot
of points off of ball screen defense, didn't plug the lane like she was
supposed to. I really thought Amanda really got her out of the flow, and I
thought she really hurt us defensively tonight.  
But she's got to play smarter, and I thought her second foul that she picked
up was 94feet from the basket going over somebody's back. Just got to play
smarter so she can stay in the game.  
  
Q. Do you think with her being a freshman some of the pressures of being in
the Big Ten on this stage, she had I think three or four travel calls
yesterday, a couple more today, some turnovers, not catching the pass down
low, do you think some of that pressure is getting to her as a freshman?  
COACH BORTON: I don't think it's pressure for Amanda. I think she handles
things extremely well. I think she's mature beyond her years. I think she is a
freshman. I think a lot of times she'll do things, she'll miss a pass, she'll
travel, she'll miss an assignment defensively. This is a big game against a
great team in the Big Ten, and Amanda has been consistent for us all year
long, and she's going to make mistakes. You know, I think we can live with
those. She needs to clean up her footwork inside. You know, sometimes she
plays like a freshman, but 95percent of the year she has not.  
  
Q. Talk about Bre's game tonight. I mean, two games in a row she came in and
gave some very positive things. She's also a freshman. Talk about her play
tonight.  
COACH BORTON: Well, I think Bre is just getting more confident as the season
goes on and you know, she's only been back for you know, five or six games
from a concussion and she's been out with a hamstring and she's been out with
a lot of different things throughout the year. I think she's playing her best
basketball this time of the year and she's getting better and better each and
every day and more confident.  
  
Q. I think the score was tied at 52, and it almost seems like you guys hit a
wall. You talked a little bit yesterday about fatigue. Do you think there was
fatigue coming in to that later part of the game?  
COACH BORTON: You know what, I thought our kids looked a little more tired at
the beginning of the game than they did at the end. I thought our kids looked
great tonight. Their shots weren't short. They were running the floor. They
were defending. Nebraska has got a motion offense that makes you run all over
the place. I thought our kids looked great. I thought they came down and hit
three huge shots. We were in their face. Hooper hit two over the top of us.
Katie hit one over the top of Mikayla when it was 52 to 52 and they went up
six immediately. But I thought we battled back and tightened the score and cut
it to a one‑possession game with about six minutes to go.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Ameryst Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26453)

### [Cait Craft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26509)

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  99  
Penn State  82

  
COACH McGUFF: Well, you know, obviously a terrific performance by our players
today. I'm really, really proud of the effort that they put forth. We beat a
very good team in Penn State. You know, I think the key when you come into a
game like this is that in a tournament format, that you play extremely hard,
obviously because it's win or go home, but also that you're loose and your
players are enjoying it and they don't have the weight of the world on them.
And we certainly played like that today, and just a great win for our kids.  
  
Q. For both Cait and Ameryst, the first half is the best probably I've seen
you all season, but what was going on in the first half? What allowed you to
get into that flow? Was it just being loose?  
CAIT CRAFT: I think in the beginning, you know, a few people made some shots.
When that happens, it becomes contagious for everybody. I think everybody
comes out and plays for each other, trusts one other. When you have team
nights like that it's easy to come out and play like that.  
  
Q. Ameryst?  
AMERYST ALSTON: That was our focus for the game, to come out hard and go hard.
Nobody wants to go home. We play every game like it's a championship game,
like Cait said. We were hitting as a team. Like she said, it becomes
contagious, and that helped a lot.  
  
Q. At any point this year, you guys practice, just messing around or
anything during a game, have you guys shot as well as you did in that first
half from downtown?  
CAIT CRAFT: I don't think so, honestly. You know, that was honestly ridiculous
I think, because it seemed at the beginning like nobody could miss and I don't
think that's ever happened, you know, in a stretch of practice or a game
obviously this year.  
AMERYST ALSTON: I mean, it's great when everybody's out there on fire. It
definitely helps a lot, you know, and because we were shooting very well, they
had to contest the shot, and you know, it makes it easier to drive. So I just
think offensively we did a great job.  
  
Q. Ameryst, I'm guessing you noticed when you shot them out of the zone and
that did make it easier for like Raven and you to get into the lane and score
that way?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Yes, I can hit some outside shots. Obviously when I'm on, I'm
on. And you know, I'm a driver, and they know that. And a lot of people know
that and so they try to play off of me. I really brought it today. My
teammates really brought it today. We always go back to our bread and butter,
just driving.  
  
Q. Cait do you think you shocked them at all? Could you see them talking to
each other in the first half as you were building your lead?  
CAIT CRAFT: Yes, like I told the girls at the end, I think it was under the
four‑minute timeout, they started bickering a little bit. When you get teams
arguing amongst themselves, that's already like another member of your team
playing against them.  
  
Q. Ameryst and Cait both, they made a real hard comeback in the second half
and Ashley Adams came off the bench late in the game. Can you speak to the
moments that she gave you?  
AMERYST ALSTON: I mean, I thought that was great. For her to be sitting you
know, and to come out there with great energy and help, you know, move the
lead and she did a great job getting some key rebounds and blocking shots.
They had a stretch where they got some runs, but it just came down to you
know, focus and concentration.  
CAIT CRAFT: You know, yeah if you have a player, you know, that sits that
whole time and comes in and plays like Ashley did, that's one of the most
unselfish things you could have as a teammate. But the whole game when she was
on the bench, she was encouraging us, yelling at us, being positive. When she
came in, like Ameryst said, she did things which we needed her to do, which
can be hard if you're sitting for that amount of time. But for her to do that,
you know, it's just amazing.  
  
Q. Ameryst, I mean, they beat you fairly easily two times this season so how
much of that was in maybe surprising them, shocking them, and showing them
that you were a good team?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Both times we played them, I thought we did, you know what I'm
saying, a great job for the first 20minutes. You know, they didn't ‑‑ I don't
think they came out right out the gate just you know, blowing us out or
anything like that. And today the focus was play 40minutes instead of 20
because we're always in the game the first 20minutes, it's just about
finishing and we finish.  
We played hard the first 20minutes and went back in the locker room, and it's
0‑0 from there. We went out the second half and we played hard.  
  
Q. Cait, any nervous moments in the second half when they got it down to
about ten?  
CAIT CRAFT: No, I mean for me personally there was no nerves. I think my
teammates, as well, we knew if we stayed focus and stayed calm, because teams
make runs, it's a game of runs. They were bound to make up some points since
we had held them to a lower score than they're used to for most of the game.  
  
Q. One more for Cait: There was a chasing of Maggie for a lot of the game,
maybe the whole game. That was you mostly. How did that work do you think?  
CAIT CRAFT: I think it worked well. Part of the reason it did work well, I
knew if I got beat I had Ameryst, Raven, Martina, 'Ryce behind me, Lisa came
in and did what she needed to do as well as Ashley. They were behind me, so my
only guard was to guard her because I had trust in them that they were going
to stop the other four, which I think that they did.  
  
Q. Kevin, you looked sluggish last night; you may disagree with me, but all
of a sudden you seemed to hit on all cylinders and your kids built some good
roles out there tonight. Talk about all of the kids and how well they did.  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah. We obviously came out with a lot of energy and focus. The
first thing is when you have such a quick turnaround, our kids did a great job
of moving on from the win against Northwestern and just getting really focused
in a short amount of time for certainly a different challenge in Penn State.
And then like I said earlier when he was talking I wanted them to come out and
really, you know, enjoy the moment and seize the day, rather than you know, be
caught up in hey, we played Penn State twice and we lost, and as Ameryst spoke
to, one of the things I really talked about is we had some really good
stretches versus Penn State when we played them earlier.  
But to their credit, they played closer to 40minutes than we did this those
games. So our goal today was to get closer to 40minutes than they did, and I
think we certainly did that.  
  
Q. I think somebody asked the question, have you seen this three ‑point
shooting team that you had in the first half very often this season?  
COACH McGUFF: Well, I've said it a lot of times, if we can get everybody kind
of playing at their best at the same time, I think we can have something
special. I think that's basically what you saw. It doesn't happen all of the
time. But it wasn't like there was anybody out there doing something they
can't do. We just had everybody kind of doing what they're capable of at the
same time.  
You know, sometimes Am's on and Cait's off and so forth. But everybody was
kind of in a great rhythm and we were in a really good rhythm offensively as a
team.  
  
Q. Why did you decide to insert Ashley when you did and how did that affect
the game?  
COACH McGUFF: Well, I think it's huge. And you know, Lisa has done a lot of
great things. You know, obviously Darryce was in foul trouble. But Lisa's done
some fantastic things here late in the season. But also, Ashley has a little
more experience being a senior. So I thought, you know, for that moment that
she would give us the best chance and you know, she had 11.5 rebounds and
three blocks in eight minutes. She was really huge down the stretch in holding
them off.  
I'm really happy for Ashley and proud of her for coming in there and playing
with great focus and great energy.  
  
Q. You hit 10 of 14 threes in the first half. You really didn't look for it
in the second half. Did you basically get back to what you wanted to do in the
second half?  
COACH McGUFF: I think as we shot it so well in general, in the second half,
too, they had to speed the game up a little bit and play man and try to force
us into some turnovers and so forth. So they were guarding the three‑point
line pretty well in the second half. But it did allow us to really get to the
basket with dribble penetration. I thought we got a lot of great shots. They
just weren't three‑point shots.  
  
Q. It's easy to look this way when you're scoring 99points, when you're
talking about mindset, is this the best mindset focus your team has had?  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah. From the start we didn't look nervous or scared. We were
like hey, we're going to show up and put forth our best effort, win, lose or
draw. That was the other thing we were talking about, don't bring anything
back to Columbus. We're going to leave it all here in Indy. I think our kids
did that. When you start off well you quickly gain confidence. I think that
allowed the confidence to really build that first half.  
  
Q. Could you feel that in shoot ‑around today, that they were going to come
out loose and easy?  
COACH McGUFF: Well, we didn't have shoot‑around because they played so early.
We didn't have shoot‑around. We had breakfast at 8:30.  
  
Q. At breakfast?  
COACH McGUFF: I didn't really notice anything at breakfast, but they seemed
fine. I could tell before the game they seemed like hey, we're really ready to
play and we're going to compete, and so they did.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State‑86  
Northwestern‑77

  
COACH MCKEOWN: I thought it was ‑‑ you know, just a hard‑fought back‑and‑forth
game. You know, in the last two minutes, they just made a couple of extra
plays and that was the difference in the game. I'm proud of our team. You
know, we really fought hard today. We just you know ‑‑ I'm really proud of our
seniors, the leadership, what they've done for Northwestern and women's
basketball at our school. So you know, just you know, one of those things that
this is their last Big Ten tournament. And again, they've helped turn around
‑‑ turn around Northwestern into a prominent women's basketball program now.
When they got here, you know, when they were in high school, that wasn't the
case. So I'm really proud of them and the effort that everybody put in
tonight. Congratulations to Ohio State. Wish them the best in the tourney.  
  
Q. Meghan, a lot of runs in that game. Can you talk specifically about the
run in the end of the first half? I think it was 16 ‑0 that you guys closed on
at halftime.   
MEGHAN MCKEOWN: We always‑‑ especially when we're coming from behind ‑‑ we try
to push in transition. You know, we were hitting a lot of shots. We had a lot
of energy going. I felt like, defensively, we were doing well. We were
executing our game plan very well at the end of the first half.  
  
Q. Karly, can you talk just about the last couple of weeks and then again
today? It seemed like you're finally kind of rounding in the form. I know it's
been a rough season for you. But looking to score a lot today and contribute
more on the offensive end than maybe we've seen from you before.  
KARLY ROSER: I've just been trying to contribute in any way possible, whether
that be on the opposite end or defensive, whatever my team needs me to do. And
today I thought that by attacking I can lead the front and other people would
follow. And we had a hard time scoring in the second half, but I thought the
energy was there.  
  
Q. Meghan and Terry both, can you guys talk more than just today, but
overall in terms of closing out your career and just what the feeling has been
for you for the last four or five years in Northwestern. Terry?  
TERRY TAYLOR: Yes. My coach mentioned earlier, we've changed the atmosphere at
Northwestern as far as winning. I think we've become a very competitive team,
a very competitive program. It's been great to grow in this program.
Especially this year, being injured and learning how to develop as a leader.
I'm grateful for my experience and I've seen a lot of girls since I've been
here. It's just great to see.  
  
Q. Meghan?  
MEGHAN MCKEOWN: Yeah. It's been a really special four years for both Terry and
I. Just seeing when we came in here, the program was on the rise, we were on
the brink of post‑season. In the next few years, there's definitely going to
be a lot of success here in the program. I just want to thank Northwestern,
coaches and administrators and the whole university for everything they've
given to us as student athletes.  
  
Q. Was there anything that you had tried to do differently the way the first
game went?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yeah. I thought, you know, the first half our game plan was
pretty good and defensively, you know, they came out pretty hot. And then I
thought we did a real good job of closing them out and ending on a really
strong run. You know, I thought the key for us was the first half the last of
the game in Columbus, you know, the first half really dug a hole. Today we
went up at half ‑time three of four and a shot at the buzzer. I felt like we
did what we wanted to do in the first half. The second half we had some
breakdowns on the glass.  
  
Q. Joe, what went into the decision to use Karly as much as you did today?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, two things. Number one, Deary was sick. Sick before the
game and started out the game played well. And Karly played extremely well
today. Probably, obviously, the best game she played since coming back,
really, in the beginning of February. So you know, a combination of things. I
thought they both did a great job. But Karly, you know, showed what she's
capable of. You know, Deary has had a great year for us, incredible year. We
wouldn't be eligible for post ‑season if it wasn't for Deary.   
  
Q. You had them taking a lot of outside shots. Was that kind of what you
wanted to force Ohio State to do?  
COACH MCKEOWN: We did. I didn't know they were going to make 11 threes or I
would have changed my mind. But, you know, they make four or five a game and
tonight, they just shot the ball really well. And Ellerbe hit a big three late
in the game. I think we were up one, gave them the lead back. I don't have the
exact time. But that was the big play. You know, we just ‑‑ I felt like first
half we rebounded after misses in the last eight, nine minutes. Second half,
they rebounded their misses late in the game. That was the difference. And
Moore made big plays down the stretch. Just sealed us. And once I think she
had three or four plays in the last probably three or four minutes that I
thought changed the game.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Bobbie Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22737)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  74  
Wisconsin  66

  
COACH KELSEY: We're just very disappointed right now. I don't know if we can
really articulate the disappointment we have. But you know, give credit to
Minnesota. They fought back and they made some big shots. And we had a couple
of mental letdowns and that kind of killed us.  
But it wasn't for lack of effort. Michala played really well. She battled in
there all night, and just needed a little more help.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Alexis Gassion](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26488)

### [Curt Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24308)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  82  
Indiana  57

  
COACH MILLER: Obviously we're disappointed in the end result today, but you've
got to give Michigan a lot of credit. Our team has heard me preach not only in
our regular season match‑up with them but getting ready for this tournament
game, that Michigan is the hardest working team in the league, bar none. And
they can take your spirit away because you work long in the shot clocks to
defend them, and you get them to make a miss and then they can take your soul
away when they get those offensive rebounds. So possessions against Michigan
can last 45, 50 seconds to a minute, and that really wears on teams,
especially young teams.  
I thought we played competitively for awhile, but we didn't play with the
effort that is needed at this time of the year. So we addressed it at
halftime. Really challenged our team to play harder. We outscored them in the
first ten minutes of the second half by five points and had a big possession
with around 9:30 left in the game when our best player got a wide‑open three
to cut the game to seven, and unfortunately that shot didn't go in.  
I think that would have really brought the whole crowd into it, gave us a
home‑court advantage at that point and a lot of momentum that the game would
have been down to seven points with just over nine minutes to go.  
But unfortunately, that miss, you could see some of the wind out of our sails
and the effort that we had given so much in that first ten minutes of the
second half you saw our shoulders drop and you see us get tired, and they
immediately went on a 12‑0 run to basically sock the game away.  
A lot of credit to Michigan. I have a great deal of respect how hard they
play. We're going to continue to learn from this. We've had a great year,
considering how young we are. And we truly believe we will receive a
post‑season bid and we hope to receive a post‑season bid and we'll prepare
hard for it.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you put some perspective on this season? You were unbeaten
top 25 for the first time in decades and rolling along, still 18 ‑12 is pretty
successful?  
ALEXIS GASSION: Yeah, we definitely worked hard in practices and prepared a
lot, and a lot of credit to our coaches because they prepared us so much. I
think we've gotten a lot better. We're just trying to come together as a team
and play better.  
  
Q. Alexis, was it hard for you guys down the stretch here ‑‑ you know, I
think you lost six of your last seven. Anything you can identify that was a
difference, or is it simply that, you know, the level of competition was just,
you know, too hard to climb over?   
ALEXIS GASSION: Yeah, it got a little tough. I think we at times got
outworked, and you know, our shoulders kind of dropped, and you know, that was
tough for us. So yeah.  
  
Q. Alexis, how tough was it for you guys to kind of respond and make a run
when it seemed like every time you guys would cut the lead to ten they would
be able to respond and get that offensive rebound like your coach had
mentioned? How tough was it to kind of regroup when they seemed to be getting
every second chance?  
ALEXIS GASSION: That's very tough. Credit to them because they were very good
in transition and they were getting all those rebounds. Yeah, it felt like
things weren't going our way, but we just had to try and come together and you
know, play as one.  
  
Q. Alexis, just what was working for you offensively tonight?  
ALEXIS GASSION: Just trying to get out and run in transition, trying to take
open shots and trying to get rebounds, offensive rebounds as much as I could.  
  
Q. Midway through the first half it seemed like you guys were getting stops
on defense, just couldn't get those rebounds, keep the ball inbounds and just
preventing those second ‑chance opportunities. How deflating was that to get
those stops but not be able to capitalize on them?  
COACH MILLER: Well, their offensive rebounding percentage in the first half
was 50 percent, which is extremely high. They shot 50percent from the floor
but they got half of their misses back. Again, one of the things that Michigan
does is if they don't score in transition and you can get them to run a
half‑court play, they're going to be very patient, they're going to run the
shot clock deep into the shot clock and take a shot. And when you don't get
that conclusion of your defensive stop with a defensive rebound and they get a
second chance, those possessions end up lasting nearly a minute long, and that
is really deflating and really deflating to a young team who has a fragile
psyche, and we talked about that and we talked about having to play through
those offensive rebounds.  
But when they start to happen, and they've heard me preach and they've heard
the coaches preach about what that can do to a team, it's really deflating. I
think that was a big part of the story. They shot 50percent. But more
importantly, they got 50percent of their misses back.  
  
Q. I believe you've tripled the number of victories this season from what
you had two seasons ago. It may be difficult to get a few more and get into
the NCAA tournament. I mean, what specifically do you think that Indiana needs
to do next year? I think you have two extra Big 10 games, two to, say, climb
up to 8 ‑10, and that might get you in the mix?  
COACH MILLER: Well, you know, certainly it's a process. And you know, we
believe we certainly moved ahead of schedule this year and surprised ourselves
even and exceeded expectations which was a mantra for us all year, to try to
exceed expectations. But if you're not human if you don't get a little greedy,
and after our start, I felt like we got a little greedy.  
There was nights in the Big 10 that we were out‑talented. What is discouraging
for us are the nights where we feel like we're outworked, because that has
nothing to do with talent, and there's some really talented teams in this
league with scars.  
Michigan beats you with a team approach and an effort approach, and those are
the ones that are discouraging because they don't put a superstar out there.
They are just workmanlike and I've got a lot of respect for Michigan when they
do that.  
We've got to continue to recruit. We believe our freshman class will form a
strong foundation to build upon, but we've got to continue to get better and
better players. We don't have a top‑100 player in our program at this point.
You can't look at not one other roster in the Big 10 that doesn't have a
top‑100 prospect coming out of high school on their roster.  
So we're proud of what we did. We've exceeded a lot of expectations. But we've
got to improve our talent level. We've addressed shooting. We rewrote a lot of
record books in improved shooting. We wanted to improve skill. We have four
really talented shooters coming in. Now we have to get more athletic and
bigger. That's not going to happen next year. We're going to be undersized and
really skilled. But in the future we've got to get longer and we've got to get
more athleticism in our program.  
But we've addressed shooting. I said if we would address that first, our skill
level will improve through recruiting, and I think it has and it will with the
incoming class we have.  
  
Q. You talked about Michigan being a hard ‑working team. Was that just the
biggest thing inside for them was just them outworking you guys?  
COACH MILLER: They really execute and take high‑percentage shots. You know,
they're really patient. Their shot selection is fantastic. They don't force.
They pass up some open shots at times to get better shots. They share the
basketball. I mean, literally when they get into the game if you can stop them
in transition they run about three plays consistently. Three. They don't throw
a big playbook at you, but they understand if you take this away, we're going
to do this. They're a very smart team. They don't over‑coach it.  
They're very good at what they do. They share the basketball, and they shoot a
high percentage because they share the basketball and they take good shots.  
Sometimes we force shots. Sometimes we take too quick a shots. And if you
watch consistent tapes on both team teams, you'll see that. When we're making
shots we look like a million bucks, but at times we can force some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, six times during the second half, your team had a chance to cut
the deficits to single digits but each time Michigan seemed to respond. What
made it so difficult to sort of get over that hump?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we had to expend so much energy to get ourselves in that
position that again, for the first ten minutes, almost nearly ten and a half
minutes, we had outscored them in the second half by five points. That only
got it down to ten. And I'm telling you we missed a huge three with about 9:30
left on that clock to get it to seven.  
And I think the momentum would have really changed. But now you've played
nearly 11minutes and you've only been able to cut the lead to ten. They're
looking up and giving our heart and soul out there, and we still only cut it
to ten. Eventually they're going to make a run, and that 12‑0 run in that
moment took it from ten and potentially seven with that made three, to all of
a sudden it was 22.  
And it was over and probably looked a lot worse than it was because we really
competed that first ten or 11minutes of the second half. We ran out of gas.
But I hope they learned how hard it is to play at the effort that we need to
play with.  
  
Q. Obviously you like to run and get out in transition. They tried to take
that away, how did you feel about the pace offensively?  
COACH MILLER: Well, we couldn't get defensive rebounds, so we couldn't run as
much as we want. I thought when we did get defensive stops, which included a
rebound, and we got out, we had some looks, we had some openings and
mismatches that we liked early in the shot clock. But they shot a great
percentage for the night, 50percent for the game. They offensive rebound a
high percentage of their misses.  
There just wasn't enough opportunities to run against them that we wanted, and
that plays into a Michigan game. The possessions are lower, and it plays into
their game, and they played well. They played well. I don't think our freshmen
understand night in and night out how hard. They've never been in the Big 10
Tournament, and the one thing that I asked them to believe me is the intensity
rises from Big 10 regular season to Big 10 Tournament, and this is going to be
harder and harder.  
I hope they see how hard you have to play in Big 10 Tournament time. I've been
associated with five teams that have won conference tournaments. I understand
how hard it is, and I hope now they see that.  
  
Q. Coach, were there unique challenges bringing this team home over the last
month after such great success to start with? You said such a young team just
trying to get them to understand it's not always going to be that easy to win
games?  
COACH MILLER: You know, the unfortunate double edge of having such a great
nonconference and then upsetting Iowa to go 14‑0, they didn't have much
adversity, and so they thought it was going to be pretty easy. You know, and I
don't think they thought they were going to run through the Big 10, but they
thought maybe they were a little bit better than they were.  
And we kept on talking you know, what's coming and who we're playing and
you've never seen Maggie Lucas and you've never seen Jordan Hooper and you've
never played in front of 8,000 on the road. And until they experienced it, I'm
not quite sure young teams totally buy into it. And our seniors hadn't had
enough success to really for them to believe you know, the seniors saying,
hey, we know what's coming. Do you guys understand? So you know, the hard part
is that we never want to give back any of those wins.  
We're really proud of our start. It's the highest rank Indiana's ever been
ranked in the history of the program. They can never take that away from us.
But it did not set us up to have much adversity until mid January. And I'm not
sure we always handled that or understood what was coming. But I'm proud of
the year. I really believe we're deserving with our RPI and our 18 wins that
we're a post‑season team, and we're going to prepare for two weeks to
hopefully receive a bid to the WNIT or the WBI, and we'll go out and represent
not only Indiana but the Big 10.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

### [Amber Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21787)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

IOWA  81  
ILLINOIS - 62

  
COACH BOLLANT: I thought we showed a lot of fight, and the stats showed that.
We had 16 steals and 17 offensive rebounds, forced 24 turnovers, which showed
a lot of fight. I thought the difference of the game was the end of the first
half. It was 30‑29 with two minutes left in the half, and to get outscored
11‑0 at the end of the half was really disappointing. That foul trouble with
Ivory getting three and Jacqui hurt us that that first half and our bench
didn't give us the lift we needed there as we went into the half.  
We battled, got down the second half, came back, cut it to nine. I thought it
was a big charge call driving to the rim. It would have been great to keep a
little more pressure on them, but the charge call kind of changed the momentum
of that and didn't get it done. But obviously the shooting percentages, if
you're looking at that, jumps out at you, as well. Credit Iowa for making a
lot of shots, and Doolittle played a really good game, but the shooting
percentages really hurt us.  
  
Q. Doolittle obviously had a big game. What was it defensively you guys were
lacking or what were they doing offensively to lead to that?  
AMBER MOORE: I think we weren't getting the trap as hard as we would like in
the short corner. That's where they hurt us the most, and getting that back
side over to take away that pass.  
  
Q. Amber, for a senior, how tough is that last walk off the court, and what
are the emotions?  
AMBER MOORE: It's tough just knowing that this is my last game in college, and
just being to play with my teammates and knowing I can't play anymore. It's
emotional, but I think as a team we fought, and that's all you've got.  
  
Q. The same question I asked the players. What about your defense or what
were they doing offensively that led to Doolittle having such a big game
today?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, I think part of it, throwing the ball over the top, I
think our lack of size hurt us and Grant just not being physically as strong,
when she got touches she was able to finish, and I think they threw it over
the top a few times and just our inability and lack of size to be really able
to contest her, and then in the first half she got out and ran, and I remember
I thought that was a big bucket. She had an and‑one in the first half that I
thought showed her athleticism.  
She's gotten a ton better. Give her a lot of credit for really working on her
game. She plays much more aggressive than she used to, and we didn't limit her
touches, but her lack of size limited her ability to finish.  
  
Q. When Logic was on the bench with fouls, it's kind of obvious but how much
of a momentum ‑‑  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, I felt like that was the difference in the game. We were
down 30‑29, up 28‑27, and Logic on the bench, and for them to go on an 11‑0
run to end the half was just‑‑ that really hurt us. We got in foul trouble, as
well, so we had a couple of our best players on the bench, but with Logic on
the bench, credit their bench players for stepping up and making plays to help
them finish the half really well.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Ally Disterhoft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26467)

### [Bethany Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25279)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa‑81  
Illinois‑62

  
COACH BLUDER: We knew this was going to be a hard‑fought game. It didn't
matter what happened last Sunday, new game, new season, everybody is 0‑0 all
of those cliches, but it's true. I wouldn't expect anything from Illinois but
to give us their best shot.  
I thought Amber Moore did an extremely good job for them today. I have a lot
of respect for her. But I thought our team obviously didn't take care of the
ball as well as we did last Sunday. But we still got high percentage shots. We
got great paint points. Bethany had a career high 26points tonight, and a lot
of those came right around the basket. And we had some great assists in order
for that. We had 20 assists on 27 baskets. So nice job with that.  
We shot the ball well from every area. I thought it was a good first
performance and, now, we have to move on and get ready for Purdue.  
  
Q. Ally, can you talk a little bit about Bethany's game? What was Illinois's
defense allowing and what were you guys able to do offensively that led to her
having so much success today?  
ALLY DISTERHOF: Yeah, I think their zone just got spread out and we did a good
job identifying that. And Bethany is a pretty wide or long target in there. So
I think we capitalized on that.  
  
Q. Samantha Logic obviously played practically the whole game for you and
because of fouls in the first half, she only had ten minutes. How do you feel
you guys adjusted without her on the court for so much time?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think she stepped up to the game and I think everybody
did their part to give us success tonight.  
  
Q. Ally, did you kind of take it into your own hands, or did you decide that
you needed to take the game into your own hands, kind of late in the first
half or was that something that Coach Bluder told you to do?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I think it just came with the flow of the game. Like I said,
we had kind of a rough start with the turnovers, but at the end of the half,
we gained a lot of momentum. I think we got some defensive boards and then we
looked to run and push. I think we had a couple of and‑ones. Those and‑ones
get us pretty pumped up so that was nice to ride that momentum going into half
time.  
  
Q. Ally, obviously you just mentioned those and ‑ones. You had one in
particular that came across the lane blocked. I know your bench went pretty
crazy. Bethany had the and‑one on the other end. What do you feel about that
play and do you feel got you guys going for half time?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, I was just trying to be in good outside position. I
don't think she knew I was coming across. Just went for the ball and got it.
Someone hit Bethany and she got that and‑one. So, yeah, that gave us a ton of
momentum. Yeah, I think obviously you could tell they were pretty excited
about that one.  
  
Q. Bethany, did you expect to have this much and ‑ones or was that part of
your game plan or something that kind of came along?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think we definitely tried to look inside tonight. I think
that was a good advantage for us. Our passes are really great on the outside
and finding people when they're open. And when people work hard and get
position down low, they find us and we can make the baskets.  
  
Q. Ally, obviously the first game against Purdue went down to the wire. What
are one or two things that you guys have to do tomorrow to come out with the
win?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I think we have to come out and execute. Our last game with
Purdue, we felt like it was our game, and we kind of gave it away. We have to
come out strong from the beginning and carry that throughout the game. They're
going to play physical and we just have to match that.  
  
Q. Bethany, how much do you look forward to that game and just, as Ally
said, the ways you guys lost it, is it something that you've been were you
kind of looking forward since you saw the brackets?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, we have to definitely focus on Illinois first, and
now that game is over we can focus Purdue. I think that's a huge focal point
for us, and we're looking for that revenge tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, how happy were you with the way that your team kind of handled
that situation for having Samantha out for the last four and a half minutes
for the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: We built a big lead when she was out. That hasn't happened for
us. I think that's great for us to go through those experiences and understand
that if Sam goes out fine, we can handle it. That's a great experience that
we're going to be able to draw upon later. She had five assists she played
well tonight.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the first half it was a little touchy. Did you feel
like your team got caught up on what the refs were calling?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it's easy for players to get caught up on that. That's
my job and not their job. I definitely think that sometimes they can get
caught up in it.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say about Ally's maturity that she was kind of able
to recognize that as a team of struggling a little bit and that she needed to
do something on her own?  
COACH BLUDER: Ally is a competitor. And I know she looks like a little scrawny
kid. She's not. She's tough. And, mentally, she's very, very strong. She's, I
mean, won a state championship. She knows what it's like to compete. She's
played in tough AAU tournaments. So it doesn't surprise me at all that she
would understand that she needs to step up. And for our two freshmen to come
in here and play this well on their first Big Ten tournament, I think is a
great thing.  
  
Q. Same question I asked the players, what are one or two things tomorrow
that have to happen for you to win?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, you know, Courteney Moses is playing very, very well right
now. And we just cannot let her have an incredible night like she had in the
second half against us the first time that we played them. You know,
defensively, we let up too many easy ones in the second half. We did a great
job in the first half. But we let‑up in the second half. And so, just
understanding‑‑ you know, just never having those let‑ups and keep going until
the horn is sound. With them, they have so many sets and there's no way
without a practice that we can prepare for all of those sets. It's got to be
really relying on our fundamentals and resorting to that. Hopefully, since
we've been practicing since June, they have some of that stuff down.  
  
Q. Coach, how crucial was it the way that you closed out the first half and
to how you guys were able to approach that second half?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought that gave us great momentum going into the half. I
think it was 13‑2 or something like that. I'm not sure exactly what it was,
but it was great momentum going into the locker room feeling like that. And it
also let us know that, Hey, we can have another run in us like that again. We
got up 20. They got it. We said, Okay, we've been here. We've done that. Let's
do it again. We had another run in us still.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

### [Nicole Elmblad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24827)

### [Cyesha Goree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26487)

### [Shannon Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26486)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  82  
Indiana - 57

  
Q. Cyesha, what happened on that play where you went down, and how are
you?  
CYESHA GOREE: I'm fine. I just took a charge and hit the ground pretty hard
but I'm good.  
  
Q. Shannon, can you talk about the job you and Siera had to do in dealing
with Larryn Brooks and how successful you were on the defensive end?  
SHANNON SMITH: She's a great player, and I think she played great defense. We
couldn't do it without our teammates.  
  
Q. Cyesha and Nicole, can you guys talk about why you were so effective
inside today?  
CYESHA GOREE: Our teammates made an effort to look inside, go inside out. I
think they did a really good job of executing that. That's one thing we really
wanted to work on, preparing for them to look inside out. And we did a great
job of finishing strong.  
  
Q. Nicole?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: I think our coach did a pretty good job of figuring out our
game plan and knowing that we needed to go inside because we could. Especially
Bird and Val who have been playing really well, finishing really well, so we
just kind of focused on that this week and making sure that we're in position
as guards to get passes down to the post and really help them get going.  
  
Q. Shannon, Cyesha, there were six times in the second half where you cut
the lead to ten points, and each of those times they couldn't really get over
that hump and get single digits and you guys seemed to be able to respond
every time. What was behind that?  
SHANNON SMITH: I think we just played well. We just tried to stay strong
throughout it. It's a game of runs, so we showed them if they make a run, we
got to make a runback.  
CYESHA GOREE: I agree with Shannon. It was all about getting stops. Sometimes
we relaxed but we ended up catching ourselves and regrouping back together in
the huddle and making sure we closed out next time or fixing it and not
getting beat the same way twice.  
  
Q. All three of you, how do you feel about playing Michigan State again?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: I was really excited for the opportunity. We had such a close
game with them back home. We were disappointed to come out with the loss. We
are just excited especially on this stage of the tournament to be able to have
another shot at them and be able to go and play hard.  
SHANNON SMITH: They're a great team. I'm looking forward to playing them.  
CYESHA GOREE: I'm excited. Were treating this like another game. It's the
second round, so we're going to be ready.  
  
Q. What color are your pants going to be tomorrow, Shannon?  
SHANNON SMITH: Beige and blue.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought our team played exceptionally well in the first
half. We shared the basketball we tried to establish an inside presence. That
is something that we watched on film and we tried to make a concerted effort
in going inside out and getting Cyesha touches early. Shannon Smith has been
playing exceptionally well lately, being able to attack and draw people. We
were able to draw a lot of fouls early on and get to the free‑throw line. In
the first half our energy was terrific and I was really proud of the effort
that we gave today.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you're a little under the weather today. How hard is it
just to be out there and keep that energy level high, even though you're not
feeling well?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah I was feeling great until about two o'clock and we
were at the pregame meal, and I was like, I'm not feeling well. My baby who is
five, she was up the entire night before we left. I guess her bug kind of
caught me. I went back to the pregame, didn't eat much. I spent the rest of
the time in the bathroom, any time that I wasn't on the bench in the bathroom.
I was a little concerned because of the young team, you're never really sure
how they're going to respond.  
But our kids have been playing so well. Our shootaround was terrific. We had a
lot of time to prepare. They were focused.  
We always talked during the year about Cal Ripken, who they're too young to
know who he is and so I had to go through that, and just how people play with
broken fingers and people play with the flu, and people play when family
members pass away. It's just something that you've got to do. I tried to be
out there for them. They really carried it. I was so proud that they told me
before the game, I said guys, I might need to lean on you a little bit today.
They said no worries, Coach, we got you. And then after the game they were
just giving me hugs, which I hope I didn't give them any germs. I was proud of
the way they responded, and from a coaching perspective, that's all you can
ask of your team. They just were unbelievable today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the scoring distribution and how you were getting off
offense up and down the lineup?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: When we're playing well, we're really able to do that. I
think that we're usually very successful when we have great balance. We knew
that if we would go inside early and establish Cyesha early they would
probably look to double that. And then that would open up Val and that would
open Shannon up on penetration, and that would open Nicole because they'd be
doubling off of her, as well. And it did.  
Val was able to knock down some shots. Nicole was really aggressive and drew a
lot of fouls.  
But when we're at our best, we have great balance, and that's what we had
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Michigan State and how they've changed since
you played?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah. They ‑‑ you know, I think our team has really grown
since we've played them. And you know, we've had our bumps in the road but
we've also responded. But they have grown tremendously. Obviously they lost
their point guard, who always seems to hurt us when we play them.  
But the people that have stepped in for her are playing unbelievably. Aerial
Powers, I feel as if she's playing at another level. She's a tough match‑up
because she rebounds the heck out of the basketball and she runs the floor.
When she has the ball in her hand, she can distribute. She can go
coast‑to‑coast. She's just phenomenal.  
They're a senior‑laden team, obviously led by Pickrel and Becca Mills and No.
21, Clarissa Bell. But they are experienced. They're senior‑laden, they're Big
10 champs for a reason. And they're an incredibly tough team and it should be
an interesting match‑up for us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Cyesha's injury and also the play of Nicole taking
three charges two in like a minute stretch in that second half?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Unbelievable. You know, it's funny and we've probably
talked about this before but we keep a record of charges and loose balls and
we really try to pride our program on that, whether it's in practice or in
games. And Cyesha and Nicole, we have a block end hanging on everybody's
locker, and you get a basketball sticker for taking those plays, and Cyesha
and Nicole are in a battle for first place. The winner is going to get
something special; I don't know what it is. But their block ends are full. And
there's other people on our team that have two and three.  
So those are two young ladies that have incredible motors and do the
intangible things and really sacrifice themselves for the good of the team.
And Nicole's three charges were incredible.  
I think Cyesha is going to be okay. She took a charge and she landed kind of
awkwardly. And we wanted an opportunity to rest her at that point. So I
thought it was in our best interest to try to save some of our energy for
tomorrow.  
But she was ready to go back in. I just think Nicole Elmblad is one of the
most improved players in our league. Obviously Cyesha Goree is, as well, but
Cyesha didn't get on the court last year. Nicole has played for us and has
probably tripled every one of her numbers. She is an incredible asset for our
team.  
  
Q. You handled Indiana pretty easily down in Bloomington. Did this game
resemble that one?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Similar. Indiana made their runs down there, as well. I
thought down there our turnovers led to their three‑point transition, and here
today I thought our misses led to their transition. I thought when they got
out in transition against us is when they were really success.  
  
Q. Coach, there were six times in the second half where IU cut the deficit
to ten. How were you able to fend that off?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I think a couple of those situations we had time‑outs,
which was good. We really wanted to make sure we executed. And we drew up some
things and talked about our looks. And I just recall one coming out, we got a
terrific high‑low and it kind of ended their run. It was a really great play.  
I think the other thing, too, is Shannon Smith made two tremendous plays
getting offensive rebounds when they were making their run. She's a little
thing, barely 120pounds. She gets knocked around all of the time. She got in
there and she got two big offensive rebounds and big put‑backs, and those were
two key plays that stopped their run, as well.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  74  
Wisconsin  68

  
COACH BORTON: Was really really proud of our team for really fighting back
through a lot of adversity through the game. I thought we got ourselves down
on the first half. I thought they did a great job making a lot of shots in the
first half they normally don't make, and we just really kept our heads down
and just really believed in each other, and our kids really stepped up in the
second half, and in overtime defensively, did a great job defensively and on
the boards and just made enough plays on offense to pull out a win.  
Our kids believed in each other. They found a way. We've won the last seven
out of our nine games. And these kids know how to win and they did whatever it
took tonight.  
  
Q. You got to play almost 30minutes tonight in maybe your team's biggest
game to date. Talk about your performance tonight?  
STABRESA McDANIEL: The first half I had a rough start, but second half my
teammates believed in me. I know Wisconsin, they wasn't playing that much
defense on me so I just have to attack the rim and find an open player and get
rebounds.  
  
Q. Rachel, let's talk about that play to tie it up. It looked like you were
kind of looking off to the left maybe to distract your defender and you were
able to get a clear shot. Just kind of walk through that progress.  
RACHEL BANHAM: You know, we weren't really running our offense. I knew that we
needed to get a shot off pretty quick and I was kind of looking around and I
decided I wanted to shoot it. She was playing far enough off me where I could
get the shot off and it went it. That was pretty much it; it wasn't much of a
play.  
  
Q. Rachel, you were obviously off tonight a little bit early. I mean, what
gives you that confidence to just keep putting it up and keep putting it up
and be that leader that your team relies on?  
RACHEL BANHAM: I think a lot of it is owed to my teammates and my coaches.
They give me the confidence and let me take whatever shot I need, regardless
if I'm missing or not. They help me with my confidence, and I'll just keep
going, keep shooting. If I'm not making them, keep getting boards and keep
getting put‑backs. So usually it works out in the positive way and I owe that
to my teammates, to help me with my confidence, keep shooting.  
  
Q. For Amanda, did Wisconsin play you differently this time around as
opposed to the first two games that they played against each other? If they
did, how were you able to counteract that tonight?  
AMANDA ZAHUI: I don't think that they played differently. I think that I let
them play me out in the first half and in the beginning of the second half
kind of like pushed me out the block. Coach told me to play tougher, and I
needed it for my team. My teammates needed me. That's when I play the best,
when I'm closer to the rim, so I had to go in and do that.  
  
Q. Throughout the game, whenever your team made a stop, you was trading
baskets, you wasn't getting the kind of stops until late in the game. Was that
a concern for you and how was you able to get your team to understand to get
past that barrier?  
COACH BORTON: Well, we kept switching up defenses quite a bit in the second
half. We made a little bit of the run. We got ourselves down by 14 to 16points
and we cut it to eight. Once we got it into single digits I think the kids
really got a lot of confidence and started saying, hey, we can do this.  
I think defensively we did a great job. We just kept switching things up
defensively. You know, I was hoping they were going to go a little bit colder
than they were in the first half with their three‑point shooting, and they
did. I thought they missed a lot of shots, and we did a great job on the
boards. We came down and executed pretty well and made the plays that we
needed to offensively.  
  
Q. What was kind of the message at halftime to stop them on defense and turn
your offense around?  
COACH BORTON: Well, you know, we wanted to stay positive with the players. I
know they were pretty down because we were taking good shots in the first half
and they just seemed short. I don't know if it was nerves or jitters or what
it was. I thought Rachel did a great job attacking. Kayla was taking great
shots. Just keep shooting the ball. We were just a little short. We needed to
get our inside going. We needed Mikayla and Amanda to get some touches. I
think they only had two post touches in the first half. We really needed to do
a better job posting up and getting the ball inside to relieve a little
pressure from the perimeter.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were concerned a little bit towards the end of the
regular season about fatigue. I mean, over 40minutes for three of the
athletes. How concerned are you since you're going to be playing back ‑to‑back
tomorrow against Nebraska?  
COACH BORTON: I don't think our players looked tired out there until probably
the end of the game. We have TV time‑outs. We have our best players on the
floor, and when you're playing only six or seven players there's just great
chemistry out there. They know what they're supposed to. I think that's why we
won the last seven out of our nine games. We have great chemistry on the
court.  
  
Q. Do you think that run in this game solidifies your tournament bid?  
COACH BORTON: Absolutely.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Ameryst Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26453)

### [Martina Ellerbe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26452)

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

OHIO STATE  86  
NORTHWESTERN - 77

  
COACH McGUFF: I'm extremely proud of our players today in that I think we put
forth great effort to get this win. Northwestern played well, and both teams
made a lot of big plays down the stretch, but we just made a few more to get
the win. It's a great opportunity for us now to move on, and we'll be very
diligent with our preparation tonight and show up and play a very good Penn
State team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Both of you, what was it like being in the middle of the flurry of those
last five minutes of that game?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: I think we just knew that we needed to play hard, and we were
just trying to stay focused, stay with the game plan, and just grind it out to
the end.  
AMERYST ALSTON: Just remembering back from last game, we came out really
strong, but we had some downfalls down the stretch of the game, so I think
concentration was really key that last five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Martina, there was a stretch where you guys were just back and forth and
back and forth and they were answering your baskets pretty quickly, but you
got back on a play I think that turned into a steal for Craft. Can you just
set me up what happened on that play and how you got back there?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: I knew they were running really hard in transition, and I
think I was just trying to get back, and I kind of got lucky I got in the way
of that one, just trying to stop the long pass because if she would have got
it, it probably would have been a lay‑up.  
  
Q. Ameryst, when she did that I think she followed that with a three ‑point
on her own, but how big was that for the outcome?   
AMERYST ALSTON: That was really big. They had been getting some transition
buckets and that caused to kind of go back and forth with the scoring, which
is something that we don't want to do, so she did a great job of getting back
on defense, and that gave us some momentum, and we pushed it in transition.  
  
Q. Either of you, how big a lift was it to get two or three big plays from
Lisa Blair?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: It was definitely big. I mean, we all have confidence in her,
and I know it's her freshman year, and to see her go out and do great, we're
happy for her.  
  
Q. Martina, the inside play, I think you wound up with 13 rebounds, but
basically Darryce had 10, but just what was it like inside, I guess, playing
against these guys inside and how hard was it to get the rebounds?  
MARTINA ELLERBE: I mean, their team is really good, and their post players are
really athletic. But we as a whole team were like boxing out pretty well, so I
don't think it was really just me, I think it was everybody just boxing out.  
  
Q. What was it like in the first half when things weren't going well for you
guys?  
AMERYST ALSTON: We can't get down on ourselves. That's something you really
don't want to do. The game is over, we go to the locker room, we talk about
it, and it's 0‑0 from there and you just play the rest of the second half
really hard, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Could you ever relax in that game? Did you finally relax in the last
minute?  
AMERYST ALSTON: No, we never relaxed. It doesn't matter if we're up 30 points.
It doesn't matter. You play the hard game all the way to the end until the
clock says zero.  
  
Q. Kevin, the end of the first half wasn't going very well. What did you
talk about at halftime and how do you think your kids answered what was going
on?  
COACH McGUFF: The biggest problem we had, our transition defense was really
poor at the end. Northwestern was playing hard. They were running harder on
offense than we were getting back in transition defense, and so that was the
biggest issue. To compound it, we were taking a lot of quick, contested threes
which were resulting in long rebounds for them and igniting their transition.  
  
Q. You had some foul issues in this game, too, but Darryce was in foul
trouble and you went to Lisa in the second half. What kind of minutes do you
think she gave you?  
COACH McGUFF: I think Lisa was terrific. She had a tremendous presence around
the basket, especially on the defensive end. Even there late in the game when
I put her in, she altered a shot Douglas got at the rim. She plays really
hard, and she also had two big free throws during that stretch where we needed
them. Her minutes were really good in the second half.  
  
Q. Overall can you speak to the offensive execution in this game, especially
down the stretch? Is it about as good as it's been this year?  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, for the most part we played very aggressively, and we had
a great balance of driving the ball at the rim and either getting to the rim
with shots that we could make or sucking the defense in and pitching it for
open threes. But it was just our aggressive nature, I think, that made the
difference in today's game on the offensive end.  
  
Q. I was going to ask about going to the basket, but I guess was this the
best that you guys have rebounded?  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, we had great effort on the boards, and part of like as a
result of us really being aggressive driving the ball, we'd force their post
players to help quite a bit on the drive, so even when we missed some of those
shots, Darryce or Lisa were able to clean them up on the backside.  
  
Q. You don't have much time to celebrate; you come back tomorrow against the
No.1 seed. You've seen them twice this year. What makes them the No.1 seed?  
COACH McGUFF: Well, they're deep. They're big. They're very physical. They
have an elite scorer and player in Maggie Lucas. I thought last time we played
them at home, we played them pretty well, but in the second half Maggie Lucas
made a lot of big plays, especially down near the end of shot clocks because
she can do that and she's a special player. But they're also really big.
They're the hardest team in the league to score around the basket. We won't
necessarily get the same looks tomorrow that we got today.  
  
Q. Did you see a reaction to them? They were pushed a few times where maybe
in the past the other team goes ahead and surges by, and this team really had
two or three answers to things like that.  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, and one of the things I was really happy to see was
Martina and Darryce had their best games in quite some time. If you're going
to win this time of year any time, you just have to be with your seniors. They
played like people who didn't want to go home, and so I think that was the
difference. We had a lot of effort, great effort, and that was‑‑ Am was
certainly special today, but our seniors, in particular especially Darryce and
Martina were exceptional.

## March 15, 2014

  

### [Alicia Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26753)

### [Gritt Ryder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26600)

### [Ryun Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25027)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  77  
Colorado State  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State. Coach, if you could make a few
comments about tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, this obviously isn't the way we wanted our season to
end. Our kids have done such a tremendous job of competing and winning all
season long.  
I'm proud that we put ourselves and they put ourselves in this situation.
Tonight we just didn't make enough basketball plays. The big thing is this
game stinks, it stinks to lose this game. But we've got to look at the journey
that we went on and the grind that we I think conquered, winning the league,
winning a lot of basketball games.  
So really proud of these two and really proud of our group, our locker room.
It stings right now in there. Rightly so. We have very, very competitive young
ladies. We'll be better because of this.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Fresno State came out with many three ‑pointers. Was that like setting up
the tone for the game to stay in the game?  
ALICIA NICHOLS: We knew that they were a three‑point shooting team. We know
that's a part of their game.  
I don't know. We just knew we needed to stop that. What's her name, 33,
Thompson, Farley, too, are looking to shoot. We needed to stop that. I don't
know what else to say.  
  
Q. It seemed like you have been a little bit more tense ever since that loss
at Wyoming. Doesn't seem like you have played with the same offensive flow.
Has it felt that way, especially in this tournament, playing not to lose
instead of playing loose and to win?  
GRITT RYDER: No, I don't think so. I guess we said losing happens. Of course,
the loss at Wyoming, that hurt. But it's so far back now we don't think about
that.  
Yeah, I don't know. I thought our offense has been flowing pretty well. We
just haven't made the shots we needed to make and that's what it comes down to
today.  
  
Q. Fresno won this tournament last year, I think they've won their
conference tournament five of six year. Did you get a sense playing them they
were used to this atmosphere?  
GRITT RYDER: Fresno is a good team. They knew when to step up and they did
that today. I don't know if it comes from being used to being in a tournament
or if they had a really good day.  
Obviously with leadership like from Taylor Thompson and Bree Farley, you come
a long way with that.  
  
Q. You get it to two points in the first minute of the second half, they
stretch it back to 10 pretty quickly. Was there anything you remember that was
key during that stretch for them, something you didn't do?  
GRITT RYDER: I just felt like every time we got a momentum, they would hit a
three. That's all I remember from the game. Credit to them. They stepped up
when they needed to.  
  
Q. You've accomplished so much this season. Does this detract from it? What
do you take from this going onto maybe an NIT berth now?  
ALICIA NICHOLS: Like you said, we have a chance going to the WNIT. As a
senior, you're always wanting to go to the big dance. It didn't happen today.
We have a good shot at the WNIT.  
We're a great team. We feed off of each other. We know how to bounce back. So
we're going to do that, do our dangdest to get far in the WNIT.  
  
Q. How much did last night's game take out of you guys? You played three
overtimes, almost the equivalent of two games. Did you feel any ill effects of
that as a team tonight?  
GRITT RYDER: No, I don't. We wouldn't be a good team if we weren't able to
play tonight. I think we came ready and we just came up short.  
  
Q. Do you think Fresno, with the way they play defense, is perhaps the
toughest matchup for you guys, from your offensive perspective?  
ALICIA NICHOLS: We have offensive threats for them. I mean, this is a
championship game and they're going to step up and defend us. They showed up
today. We just couldn't hit our shots at times we needed them, so...  
  
Q. Was there a point in the game where you felt it slipping away or did you
always feel you were going to come back and win it?  
ALICIA NICHOLS: Yeah, back at home we were down by 11 at half. I mean, we're
always fighting to get back into the game. I didn't really feel it slip away.
I don't know. We just needed to hit those threes at the end, but they didn't
come, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Looking at the season, you go on that big run 17 out of 18 you won, three
losses in the past couple weeks. Do you think that's a matter of teams getting
the book on you and adjusting to the way you're playing?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. It's not like you're going to win every game. I
mean, losing does happen, like our kids said. When it happens, I don't know if
that's a big deal. I'm not going to read into that that we didn't play well
down the stretch.  
Yeah, we didn't shoot as well as we did earlier on in the year. We've been
kind of a streaky team all year. We go 5‑22 against Utah State, 5‑21 against
Wyoming. We didn't shoot well and we still won basketball games.  
It just came down to that tonight. We won almost every offensive category as
far as we have 17 more shots. We shoot better from the foul line. We cause 18
turnovers. We just didn't make enough baskets. We didn't shoot it.  
It wasn't that we didn't play good offense. We got plenty of good shots,
folks. We got plenty of good shots. It just wasn't a night that they got
converted at the clip they needed to get converted.  
  
Q. You talked about having to remind your team in the first two games of
this tournament to loosen up, relax, have fun. Did you feel they were a little
tense in this tournament and tonight compared to the regular season?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, I don't know. I don't know if I read into that, to
be honest with you. Yeah, they want something really bad. Maybe they squeezed
a little hard.  
But these kids have always been ready. You don't win 25 games with this
bunch... Their emotions in the pregame, our shoot‑arounds, everything is the
same. We haven't shot it all that well here the last couple weeks.  
I don't want to credit that to being tight or anything like that. It didn't
happen.  
  
Q. When you look back on everything this team has done this season, what do
you take from it? Four new starters, eight new players, picked to finish
seventh in the conference.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Like I said earlier, I think our kids can feel a tremendous
sense of pride and accomplishment for what they did. Winning the regular
season and winning that grind, that's pretty special for a group of new kids
when you're picked to finish seventh in your league.  
Teams get hot for three games in a row, and it's not always the No.1 seed.
That's what is tough about a night like tonight. You feel very, very defeated
and you feel frustrated and you feel like you let something slip away.  
It's really important we take a step back and look at the big picture. That
was quite a run. That was quite a journey. I think these kids, they brought
CSU basketball back to life. We'll continue to get better.  
We aren't going to stand still, that's for sure. We always say 'onward,' and
we'll continue to move forward and hopefully perform really well in the WNIT.  
  
Q. They hit 10 threes, 9 from their two guards. Anything you should have
done differently?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Just because they shot them doesn't mean they have to go in.
Farley was great tonight, Thompson. Those two kids made clutch, clutch shots.
They're big‑time performers. We did know that. Those are two seniors that
stepped up and had big‑time senior moments, 50 points between the two of them.  
You have to tip your hat to those performances. Those are pretty special.  
Yeah, give them credit. I forget your question. Ask it again because I had a
really good answer.  
  
Q. Anything you could have done differently?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. I mean, they made 10 threes in Ft. Collins. They
scored 47 points with 10 threes. They hit big threes tonight. They just
daggered our momentum. Every time we cut it to five, to two, here comes a big
three. We made a couple mistakes in some defensive rotations.  
Thompson was on the attack tonight. We drew the defense. Hit the right kids.
They shot it with a ton of conviction.  
Yeah, there's some things we would have done differently, but they made the
plays, we didn't.  
  
Q. They seemed to be pretty effective. Sam was held scoreless. It seemed
like they were able to take away parts of her game. What was it they were
doing or was it just the size?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We've always struggled scoring on the block against
Vandenberg. 6'6", 6'6". I think where we've been effective in the past is
we've drown her out, play Sam on the perimeter. That was effective in Ft.
Collins. We just didn't shoot the ball from the perimeter as well.  
Sam is a really good pick‑and‑pop kid. Just struggled is all. It does open up
the rim, as well. We did have some drives at the baskets that we just didn't
finish.  
They do a good job guarding, but they also give you some stuff. What they gave
us we just didn't convert.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  77  
Colorado State  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, just a couple comments
about tonight's game.  
COACH PEBLEY: If I could just take a second personally and thank God because
He was with us all season. We went through a lot of adversity and that
adversity made us so much stronger and so much better. Really grateful.  
This was a great game. It never felt comfortable. Always felt like Colorado
State was right on our heels. That's because Colorado State is such a good
team and they're such a smart team and they play good defense.  
Prepping for this game, I knew we were going to have to really put two ends of
the floor together. We were going to have to dominate the boards. I don't know
that we dominated the boards. But we got it done. We were going to need some
big performances.  
No better people to turn to for big performances than these two young ladies
to my left. They had a great supporting cast all the way down to our bench.
Even the women who didn't play, they're absolutely 100% a part of this
victory.  
It's really, really special to coach this group and learn from them 'cause I
did. I learned a lot. I grew as a coach this year coaching this team. It was
really special watching how much they grew.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Taylor, were you feeling it with the threes tonight? It seemed like you
really came out quickly hitting the threes.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, we definitely came into this tournament knowing
what we needed to do. We came in confident tonight. We knew that we needed to
hit. I mean, we did a great job getting people open.  
I felt like we had a lot of open shots, and that has to go for our people
penetrating. So we did a great job just all‑around team effort of doing that.  
  
Q. How much do you think that softened up their defense?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: When any team is hitting threes, you have to make sure you
get out on 'em. That opened up the lane for us a little bit and we got some
inside shots.  
Our team just did a great collective job inside and out. Couldn't ask for a
better win.  
  
Q. Taylor, you've won four straight conference championships here. How does
this one compare to the others? Do you find this any more challenging, less
challenging?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: You know, each year is different. Each team is different. We
lost some great players going into this year with Kiki Moore and Rosy leaving.
Our team and our coaches did an excellent job just throughout the year of
overcoming adversity, working together, getting over humps. I mean, I'm so
proud of our team for doing that. It's got us where we are.  
  
Q. You were a good three ‑point shooting team, but I don't think as good as
you've shown these past three games. Anything different about the tournament
time?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Tournament time, we came in saying it's our time. Like I said
before, we came in confident. That was good for us. We got people open. Our
teammates got people open. I really think that's what was key for us, getting
our shooters open. We did it. It worked out for us.  
  
Q. Can you describe the rush of walking up the ladder again.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: It's certainly a great feeling. It definitely never gets old.
It's awesome every year. It's something that you'll remember for the rest of
your life. I definitely won't forget it. It's definitely an awesome, awesome
feeling.  
  
Q. Bree, how much did the fact that you have been through these tournament
runs help you the next time around?  
BREE FARLEY: I think it does help a lot. Especially when teams go on runs,
because if you're not experienced you can get really frazzled in that type of
situation. Us being more experienced, we learned to like accept the runs and
not freak out, if that makes sense.  
I don't know. With experience, yeah, it definitely did help us today.  
  
Q. How key was it to keep Sam Martin scoreless?  
BREE FARLEY: I didn't realize she was scoreless, but I knew she got into foul
trouble. That was definitely key for us. Being able to use our bigs more
effectively, making Colorado take different shots and just to stall their
offense a little bit definitely helps us.  
COACH PEBLEY: Being a Colorado graduate, I picked up on it. It should be
Colorado State.  
BREE FARLEY: Colorado State, sorry.  
COACH PEBLEY: The sensitivity is there.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Was this just better execution on the three ‑pointers in the tournament?
  
COACH PEBLEY: I don't know. I think we've really shot the three well a lot
this year. I think that's something, you know, when we're able to penetrate
and get into the paint, we're able to take threes off of that, then we're a
team that I think can hit.  
But Colorado State can, too. They just had a tough night. I think we worked
hard defensively, yeah, but they had some open looks, too. It was unfortunate
for them and lucky for us that they didn't go down.  
They are absolutely, as you noted, I think first in our conference in
three‑point field goal percentage defense. That was something I didn't even
bring up to our team. But I was aware of it.  
Part of our game plan was about attacking the paint, looking to be physical,
going to the rim, penetrating that zone. I think it was big that we were able
to get them out of that zone and just loosen up some more options offensively.  
  
Q. Did you see a different level from Taylor today?  
COACH PEBLEY: No. I just think that's Taylor. Taylor Thompson is 5'3" when she
stretches but she's got a giant's heart. She's a great leader, fantastic
Bulldog. So excited she's going to be a GA with us and stay around.  
Early in the season, before practice started, we said, Taylor, you're a fifth
coach on the staff. You're a coach that gets to play. These are young
freshmen. I'm going to trust you. We're going to talk. We've got to talk to
each other like coaches talk to each other and have that open dialogue.  
She owned that. Taylor, you guys don't see it, but her personality is
painfully shy. She's very shy. But she steps on that floor and she's a servant
to her team and does whatever it takes to win and to compete for her
teammates.  
That's being so humble. That's the heart of a champion right there.  
  
Q. After they cut the lead, score the first basket of the half, it's a two
‑point game, you responded with a 9‑0 run. How key was that?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, we've talked a lot about this season, just an IQ with the
game that I like our team to understand and not fear runs, know that we're
going to go on runs. The system that we play does create runs. There are very
good teams in our conference, and very good teams will go on their own runs.
You can't be surprised when that happens because they are a good team.  
Also, you know, we just try to play through it, know that they were due, but
stop the run. We've got specific things we talk about in stopping runs and how
to do that. Senior leadership I think really stepped up.  
Alex Sheedy is so important to our success right now. Getting Sheedy back
before the conference tournament, she got a couple games under her belt, she
got to practice, feel the game back after being out for 10 games, was huge.
I'm grateful her family has genetics that heals bones quickly. She's a
tremendous, experienced stretch four that helped us a lot this tournament.  
  
Q. How big was that Boise game? It was the third game in the stretch of
eight straight now, a downright battle to the end. How much of this run do you
credit with pulling that win out?  
COACH PEBLEY: I think it was huge that we were able to go two in a row on that
trip. We've been on the road a lot lately. We were gone that whole week, that
Boise, San Diego State. We spent a lot of time together.  
It was kind of funny. We had one of her players leave her phone at home. She's
a player that's on her phone a lot. It was just kind of cool for our team
because we all just were like, This is going to be good. She's off her phone.
You got to interact with each other a little bit more.  
They all just really poured into one another. Our team was already really,
really close. But winning and having fun on that trip, it helped momentum. We
had to play a very good San Jose State team who beat Colorado State, our
Senior Night. A great atmosphere. A great home crowd.  
I think all that led into coming into this tournament beautifully.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  95  
Wyoming  92

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State. Coach, if you could start with
a few opening remarks about today's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Great college basketball game. I just think you saw two teams
that didn't want to lose. There was obviously added intensity when it's a
rival game. The border war knows no boundaries or borders, obviously.  
It came down to kids making plays at the end of the game. Wyoming, they made a
lot of big shots. Our kids made a lot of big shots. You just saw a lot of
courageous student‑athletes out there tonight.  
Fun to be part of it. Proud to be part of it. We respect the heck out of
Wyoming. We're happy with the win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Gritt, you kept going for layups at the start of each overtime period.
Was that something you saw or a determination on your part that you were going
to make sure you got the first bucket?  
GRITT RYDER: I didn't think about it like, Oh, we need to get the first
bucket. It was just what opened up. We played that play throughout the year
and it seems to work pretty well so we just kept going to it.  
  
Q. Sam, what went through your mind when you finally won it?  
SAM MARTIN: It was definitely a rollercoaster of emotions. But extremely
happy. I was extremely happy. I mean, what a great win by our team. We found a
way to win. It was a hard‑fought game by both teams.  
We're going to the championship game. Nothing gets better than that, so...  
  
Q. Sam, 11 ‑12 for you from the free‑throw line. Picturing that moment do
you think helps you stay calm and make those?  
SAM MARTIN: I think so. I mean, coach always says, Be a winner, make 'em pay.
Just got to step up to the line and shoot with conviction. That's kind of what
I think our team did tonight.  
So we made the free throws when they counted. I think that was huge for us.  
  
Q. Gritt, you just find a win. You took that to the extreme today. Where do
you think that comes from, the ability to, no matter what the circumstance, be
able to pull it out in the end?  
GRITT RYDER: Honestly I think it's because we love each other. We play for
each other. We just want to win. We want to play for CSU. I think that's what
like showed up towards the end where we kept making plays when it counted the
most. I think we did that for each other and the program.  
  
Q. Given the way this game went, how tough would it have been to have not
come out on top?  
SAM MARTIN: That would have been a heartbreaker, I think. We have the rivalry.
It's the semifinals. It definitely would have been hard for our team. You
know, that didn't happen, so we're not going to worry about that (laughter).  
  
Q. With so many people fouling out, you had a lot of players that rarely
play that came in and made some clutch plays down the stretch for you. What
was that like? Did you have faith in those players? Were you a little bit
nervous about what might happen?  
SAM MARTIN: No, I had complete faith in them. Hayley came in and made some
huge rebounds, some huge defensive plays. Then Hanne came in with the first
two free throws of her career. I think that just shows what Gritt says, we're
playing for each other, we're playing for this school, we're going to do
whatever it takes to win as a team.  
It was a whole team, it always is. But today everyone contributed in some way.
I think that was a huge part.  
It's because we get along and love each other, we believe in each other.  
  
Q. Sam, you played 48 minutes, then obviously you turn around tomorrow and
play another game. I assume the tournament atmosphere and everything, you're
not going to worry about being tired tomorrow.  
SAM MARTIN: No, take an ice bath tonight. In the morning we're ready to go.
It's the championship game, so we'll be there.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What were you thinking as you went into the third overtime, you're losing
starters right and left to foul trouble, pulling people off the bench?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I can't tell you what I was thinking (smiling).  
Yeah, those are situations that you really don't practice throughout the year.
We had a lineup out there. I got a card that I carry, we have some concepts
and actions that we think maybe can get us a good shot. With the personnel we
had out there, she doesn't know where to go on that one.  
It was kids making plays. That's what we told our kids in the timeout. Go play
basketball. After every overtime, go play basketball, go make plays, go have
some fun with this thing.  
Apparently we love each other, and that's a good thing. I don't know if I've
ever been part of a game quite like that. To come out on top, obviously we
feel very, very fortunate.  
  
Q. Being that you split the border war series each at home during the
regular season, what was it like getting a post ‑season tiebreaker on a
neutral site?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's always good to beat Wyoming for a lot of reasons. It is
the border war, but also because it's a really good basketball program and
they've got really good coaches and really good players.  
It's great that we're moving on. We earned it because we beat a really good
team. Wyoming ended our season last year. It was 60‑58, we were having a
little different press conference last year at this time.  
It was a good win for a lot of reasons.  
  
Q. You got the chance between games to go back and watch your daughter play
a pretty critical playoff game. What was that like? How worried were you about
that detracting from preparation?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Probably prepared me well for this game. I didn't know it was
going to be triple overtime. Being a parent and watching your daughter play in
a state semi, it's probably a little more stressful than today.  
I was ready for this, folks. What a neat opportunity that was for our family.
When you're a basketball family, you have a daughter playing high school
basketball, they're in the state semis, I do work for the best boss in the
business who understands priorities and made a really neat thing for our
family happen.  
We should have probably brought some players back with us on that plane. We
needed them with everybody fouling out (smiling).  
  
Q. Seemed like every time Wyoming would answer, you were able to stay calm.
Your presence rubbed off on your players.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I was calm. I couldn't move.  
No, we've said it all year long, right, that the big strength of this
basketball team is its poise, its composure. They go out and they compete.
They find a way. I feel silly that we say that after almost every close win.
That's what this group is all about. I think they do trust each other. That
brings a poise and a calm to that huddle.  
So when you can put a lot of bullets out there, a lot of trustworthy
teammates, they do have a great team belief. I think that showed up. When
Hanne stepped up and made those free throws, I don't know if you're going to
ask that question, that was big‑time. Those were Hanne's first two free throws
of her career. She was doing jumping jacks behind the bench.  
Those are tough situations for players. They don't play a lot of minutes.
They've got to come in in crucial situations and perform.  
She was a rockstar for those two free throws. She had great, great confidence.
They practice hard every day. They prepare themselves for that moment. So no
surprise that those babies went in.  
  
Q. Sam has waited a long time for this, probably has a different perspective
than the younger players in your rotation. What will you tell them about the
opportunity they have tomorrow?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's a once‑in‑a‑lifetime opportunity. As a basketball team,
we've been through a lot. It's a grind. These seasons are a grind. To get to
this stage and to have that opportunity, just make the most of it. Let's go
have some fun with this thing. Let's see what we can do.  
We should play relaxed tomorrow. I think sometimes as a 1 seed, it's tough to
get here, tough to get to this spot, especially going through a great Utah
State team, then a border war rivalry game. You get to the finals, I think our
kids sense a relief, perhaps. It means a lot to that locker room.  
Especially kids like Sam, Hayley, they've been program warriors. They've been
through the ups and downs of the last four years, what that program's gone
through. For them to be a part of this, to really help turn this thing, to
have a huge responsibility in helping turn this thing, there's no better
feeling.  
I'm so happy for our group.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  95  
Wyoming  92

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming. Coach, if you could make a few opening
remarks about today's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, I've only been involved in a three‑hour basketball
gameone other time. There's plays to be made, there's plays that are left out
on the floor. But the heart from the players on the floor were just tremendous
today.  
It just seemed like we were always trying to maybe have one more possession.
And I thought Kaitlyn Mileto came through and hit two big free throws to send
us into an overtime. Kaylee Hoffman, a senior, hits one. So you start taking a
look at what was happening in that game. Both teams had several very good
players sitting on the bench in foul trouble.  
I thought that the players that stepped on the floor for the players that had
fouled out gave tremendous effort. That's all you can ever ask. As I always
tell 'em, we just needed the ball to bounce our way one more time. But I'm
proud of this group, that goes 1 through 13, because we had to call on people
in the third overtime that probably have not seen the court for quite some
time.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chelan, can you describe the emotion, especially in the second half of
the game.  
CHELAN LANDRY: I think personally we were just trying to get over a hump.
Seems like we were either always down two or down three, trying to catch back
up, but didn't.  
In the second overtime, we were up. But then I fouled and they got to the
free‑throw line and we tied it again.  
The game just went up and down through every overtime, the five minutes. They
were up, we were up. It just kept going back and forth.  
  
Q. You played a lot of minutes in the second half, overtime. Physically have
you ever played that many minutes?  
CHELAN LANDRY: I'm a little beat. It's my senior year. I tried to go out and
do everything that I could for my last game. I think I did that. I just needed
to make a couple more free throws, a couple more layups.  
But we came up short. I love the way we played. We all played with heart. We
didn't give up. We fought till the end.  
  
Q. Kayla, you're one of the many that unfortunately fouled out. What is it
like sitting on the bench in a game like this?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I mean, we all had confidence in the team. We kept saying,
They got it, we can still do it. It was back and forth, like Chelan said. We'd
be down, they'd be down, tied. We had a lot of faith in them. They fought hard
till the very end.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, what was so difficult in the first half before you got going?  
KAITLYN MILETO: Their defense was to stop us from scoring. That's what they
did. They held us really well. They followed their game plan really well to
stop what we were trying to throw at them.  
We just keep fighting through that period of time and hope that we can get
something going.  
  
Q. Kayla, looked like you wanted to be a little more aggressive going to the
basket.  
KAYLA WOODWARD: It just seemed like, even the last time we played them, they
were really guarding the threes. We have to be aggressive to try to score, to
try to even kick out that will get our threes open.  
So always being aggressive helps.  
  
Q. Chelan, what was this game like for you obviously being a senior? How
much of a sense of urgency did you feel throughout the overtimes to keep
pushing?  
CHELAN LANDRY: I had a lot of sense of urgency. This was by far one of the
best games I've had playing at Wyoming. We've never gone in double overtime,
triple overtime, whatever we did.  
I just kept pushing the ball, you know, trying to get my teammates open,
Kaitlyn for threes. Trying to distribute in any way I could.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, do you hope you keep playing here, to find a post ‑season
tournament?  
KAITLYN MILETO: Absolutely. We're not done playing basketball. Especially for
our three seniors, we want to continue to play for them especially.  
So whatever we get we'll take gratefully.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. Obviously the three overtime game you reference was the NIT game for you
guys. Is there any kind of comparison to this game?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think when you take a look at games like this, you think
about as a coach all the plays that you left on the floor, whether it's a
missed free throw, a missed layup. But then you start realizing how many plays
were made on both sides of the basketball. That part of it was very evident
out there.  
Neither team gave in. It was possession by possession, big play by big play.
Pretty soon you sit back as a coach and you just marvel that a player comes up
with another play. We have Kayla Woodward fouling, Lewis, two of our top
scorers sitting on the bench. Kayla played 50 minutes. She would have played
55 if it wasn't for foul trouble. We weren't going to take her out.  
You're just pleased with the plays that are made from sometimes players that
surprise you. I thought Chelan got us going with a big three there in the
second half that energized us. Once again, our crowd is unbelievable. So much
energy to play in front of Wyoming fans. They were able to get that group
going again. That in and of itself is something that just gets you through
three overtimes.  
  
Q. Talk about your senior play in the second half.  
COACH LEGERSKI: It's always difficult. You bring them in as freshmen. Everyone
wants to play. Then they start realizing whether or not they're good enough.
You convince them to hang in there and you're going to be part of something
special in your four years. I think that is definitely what Chelan and Kaylee
have gone through. To see Kaylee shoot that shot, she stepped right up and did
what we talk about, knocked it down. Then, more importantly, we defended and
battled throughout the whole time.  
Like I said, you give CSU credit. They did the same thing. They were sitting
with players on the bench, asking people to step up, make plays. It was just
one of those classic games that everybody's going to remember and talk about.  
  
Q. You mention there were so many plays made by most teams. You missed 17
free throws. You mentioned layups. What was the biggest?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think when you take a look at it, we both shot mid 40s from
the free‑throw line. We shoot 45, they shoot 43. They make 32, we make 28.
It's a three‑point ballgame.  
It's not only about when you miss 'em but it's about when you make 'em as
well. That's about Kaitlyn stepping up and making two big ones. Colorado State
stepped up and made a lot of big throws down the stretch. You give credit
where credit's due. I think free throws is a big phase of what you take a look
at in this basketball game.  
  
Q. You mentioned some unlikely contributors. You've asked for Kaylie to play
big minutes before. 12 points, battling. Talk about the performance from her
continuing to battle there.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Kaylie Rader is a young player who is just trying to figure
out how to play. When I talk about that, it's with the intensity. She was
intense today. She gave us everything she could. That's all I can ask.  
All of a sudden we had an inside presence. That's something that we've been
looking for all season long. It's very hard to keep winning from 15 to 22 feet
with jump shooters. Kaylie gave us that big lift today, going six of ten, 12
points, grabbed some rebounds. I'm very pleased and I'm glad she's a freshman.
She's only going to continue to get better.  
  
Q. Did anything change with Kaitlyn, scoreless in the first half, didn't
seem to be in a rhythm, then stepped up when she felt like she needed to?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think the biggest thing with shooters is confidence.
Shooters like to be able to make shots to keep giving them that confidence. We
got Kaitlyn open on a curl. She made it. You could see a smile start
happening. Then she hits a three. That's so much of a shooter's mentality.  
They're going to keep shooting the basketball, but you want that confidence.
They get confidence very quickly, just by making one or two shots. Then I
thought Kaitlyn became a little more aggressive.  
Even at the end we had a design that Chelan was going to push the basketball,
but we were trailing Kaitlyn in to almost shoot it just on the other side of
halfcourt. Kaitlyn was there, too. But I thought Chelan had a very good look
at it. Ball just didn't go down.  
  
Q. Was there anything wrong with Jordan in the second half or was it matchup
issues?  
COACH LEGERSKI: No, the biggest thing was is you take a look at what we needed
energy‑wise. We talked about going small over the two days that we had to
prepare for this. It gives us ability to be able to put the ball on the floor
and attack. Then I thought when you take a look at Kaylie Rader, I guess a
post scorer scoring at a 60% clip. I have to keep her in the basketball game
as much as possible.  
The other thing that I thought was important with Kaylie, she made some great
passes. She only has one assist, but I thought we missed a few of the lay‑ins
that were passes by her. That just gives me so much confidence in having
Kaylie on the floor because of her passing ability and also giving us the
bonus of points today.  
  
Q. Do you feel this is a team that is deserving of playing in the post
‑season?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I don't know. I like this group. They always give me a lot of
fight. You get down 12, 13 points. I talk to them about just stepping up and
winning the next four minutes. We talked about that in the second half. We cut
the lead from 13 to 8 to 4, to 3, to 2, to finally a tie.  
Every media timeout, all we're talking about is that we're winning. That's the
mentality we play with. We don't talk about what the score is. How are we
playing at that timeframe.  
You could see our bench, they started believing that we were cutting into this
lead little by little and going to have an opportunity. So if post‑season
comes, this group I know will be anxious to play. But it's not what I base
everything for us on right now for this team. In a couple days I'll be wanting
to play, but right now we probably all hurt just a bit.  
But what a basketball game. Like I said, give Colorado State a great deal of
credit. They made a lot of plays as well with having players on the bench.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  82  
Nevada  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, if you could make a few
opening remarks about tonight's game.  
COACH PEBLEY: It sounded like a broken record, but we feel very fortunate that
we were able to get this W. I know that a lot of preparation went on that we
had to go into this game. I know Nevada did, too. They're a great team, well
coached. I think Jane has done such a great job with this team. Leadership for
them, you can tell they've had strong leaders this year.  
You know, it was kind of fun watching not only the two teams prior to our game
battle, but it was fun watching the two teams back in the tunnel handle, Okay,
we're ready to go, now we don't get to go. We have to go back to the locker
room. We had to stretch two times at least.  
That was fun. That's some of the joys of playing in a conference tournament.
We're really excited to advance.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Moriah, I think you missed five three ‑pointers last game, you came out
here and make a bunch in the first half. Anything particularly different? Were
you feeling it?  
MORIAH FAULK: I have to give all the credit to my teammates. They just
continue to encourage me, give me the ball and tell me to shoot it. So all
credit goes to them.  
  
Q. There was the point where you fell mid ‑court. What was that all about?  
MORIAH FAULK: I went to make a pass to Taylor. I just rolled my ankle.  
  
Q. Taylor, how big was it to get that contribution from Moriah coming off
the bench?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Our bench did awesome tonight. I can't tell you how many
points they contributed, but that's a full team effort. Tonight was definitely
a whole team. Coming off the bench, we had tremendous, tremendous effort.  
So, I mean, it was key for us to win tonight, for everyone to do their best.  
  
Q. They get up five points with three and a half minutes left, then you went
on a 10 ‑0 run. Did you feel a sense of urgency?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: I mean, definitely, it could have easily gone either way. We
could have either got down. But instead I felt like we had great leadership
and our team came together. We said, We got to get some stops. We did a great
job going into the half doing that.  
We ended up pulling out in front of them. That gave us good momentum going
into the half. I mean, our team handled it very well.  
  
Q. Then you go on a further run in the second half. How important was
that?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: We had great defensive stops that got us great points on the
other end. That was very key for us to go on that run in the second half.  
We played well together tonight defensively and offensively. You couldn't ask
for a better team contribution.  
  
Q. Bree, can you talk about what that was like, having to wait through.  
BREE FARLEY: It was a little strange. Like coach said, we were ready to go,
then we had to wait another five or ten minutes. We were ready to go again.  
I think for us we just had to remember that we still had to win our game. We
had to try and focus on right now it doesn't matter who wins this game, we
have to focus on winning our game, otherwise we won't advance.  
It was hard to stay focused on what we were doing. I think, you know, our
coaches and leaders did a good job of keeping us together.  
  
Q. Their tall center, you were still attacking the basket despite her
presence there. Was that part of the game plan?  
BREE FARLEY: I mean, just attacking the basket was deliberate for us. Getting
anyone in foul trouble helps us out. It just happened to be Mimi on this
occasion.  
  
Q. Bree, the way you finished the first half and started the second half,
you're cooking like that, what is that like to be a part of it?  
BREE FARLEY: It's exciting. The first time we played Nevada, it was a
score‑for‑score game. We knew if we got into that scrappy kind of game, it was
going to be hard to finish. It was crucial for us to go into the second half
with momentum. It just continued on for us.  
It's fun to play that kind of basketball.  
  
Q. Moriah, there were a lot of games where you scored five points or less.
What was that like after having a non ‑conference period where you were
scoring in double‑digits? Was it hard to keep yourself in it?  
MORIAH FAULK: No. My main focus isn't scoring. When I wasn't scoring, I was
just trying to look for my teammates and get them easy scores. Yeah, it's just
a team effort, so scoring wasn't a big deal.  
  
Q. Moriah, usually when it comes to zone defense, you're pretty good about
finding the right person and passing. Today being more of a conscious scorer,
did you know that was going to be your role?  
MORIAH FAULK: I was just trying to take what the defense was giving me. They
were leaving me open in the high post. I was just taking open shots.  
  
Q. Is this exciting or is it just business as usual to be back in a
championship game?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: I mean, it's exciting to be in this tournament, obviously
going into the championship is exciting. It's definitely business. We're here
for one goal, and that's to win a championship.  
We're definitely going to try and do that tomorrow night.  
BREE FARLEY: It's definitely a matter of just knowing what you're here for.
Our team keeps talking about our time here, that nothing's guaranteed. It is
exciting to go on to the next round. When we started in this tournament, that
wasn't guaranteed for us.  
I'm really proud of our girls and coaching staff to get into this championship
game. Hopefully we can just win tomorrow.  
COACH PEBLEY: I want to add, a lot of questions about Mo and her scoring. But
Mo also had three steals and three offensive rebounds and six total boards. I
think her bringing a presence to the floor in those other areas allow her
mentality offensively to play smart and play Fresno State‑style basketball.  
She brings more to us than scoring. When she's rebounding and playing great
defense, I love how Mo is embracing post defense as well as perimeter defense,
we feel like that's a cherry on top.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You drain your first 8 of 13 three ‑pointers in the first half there.
What was happening that would allow you to hit at such a high rate?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, we moved the ball well. I think there was opportunities
that our players didn't pass up that were good shot attempts, and the right
players are taking them. But we also talked a lot about, you know, let's not
finish this game taking 38 threes. We've got to approach and attack the
basket, the rim. Those threes are going to be there, but we've got to build
our confidence in the paint as well.  
I liked the balance we were able to find.  
  
Q. This rivalry, if you want to call it a rivalry, was very one ‑sided. Do
you get a sense that the other side is catching up a little bit?  
COACH PEBLEY: I think Jane's done an excellent job. You know, they had a
roster this year with a lot of players that had a lot of experience. I think
experience is always going to help you, no matter if that experience is on the
floor or on the bench.  
Jane's experience, as well. Excellent coach with a ton of wins under her belt.
You look at our whole entire conference, we've got Gordy Presnell with I think
over 500, Joe Legerski with hundreds and hundreds of wins, Jane with her track
record as well, Kathy Olivier. There's so many great coaches in this league. I
don't think it's just Nevada has elevated their play, I think our whole league
has done that.  
You see in the conference that all teams were beating each other. It was just
a dogfight throughout the whole year. You had to bring your best game every
game.  
  
Q. Talking about those dogfights, all the barn burners you had, second game
in a row you get five players in double figures, is that a good thing going
into the championship, that it hasn't been stressful these last two games?  
COACH PEBLEY: It hasn't been stressful (laughter)?  
  
Q. As stressful?  
COACH PEBLEY: As stressful? It feels stressful. No worries there.  
It's exciting. We're really blessed with a bunch of players that work hard at
developing their skills and their versatility. We have a lot of players that
can put the ball in the hole. But Colorado State does, too.  
I think our two teams match up to each other really, really well. We're very
similar in how we're built. We're both going to try and put the ball in the
hands of our best scorers whenever we can. The players are the ones that knock
it down. We coaches just get to clap a lot when they do it.  
  
Q. Does your approach change at all going into triple overtime and having
slightly more tired legs?  
COACH PEBLEY: Not at all. I remember being a student‑athlete. It's getting
longer and longer ago every day. But when you hit this time of year, you don't
think about your legs. You don't think about fatigue. You're thinking about
the task.  
So I think they're a deep team. I think there were players that didn't play
those minutes that you might think because they fouled out in regulation,
early. I think it would be a mistake to just think, Oh, they're going to be
tired.  
We both had two days off leading into this game. I think, again, our approach
will be the same as if they hadn't played a triple overtime.  
  
Q. Getting Mimi into foul trouble and still attacking the basket early on,
was that part of the game plan there?  
COACH PEBLEY: It wasn't a specific strong focus that we have to find ways to
attack Mimi. But we just told our players, we tried to bring not too much
attention to Mimi. By doing that, that continues to allow us to be focused on
our strengths. They go against Jacinta in practice every single day.  
Their fundamentals need to come into play. You have to protect your shot, you
got to shoulder off, you got to stay focused and fingertip finish and all
those things. If Mimi is going to foul, Mimi is going to foul. Don't become
consumed.  
I've coached 6'7", 6'6" players before, you see teams stop being aggressive
and not collapse the defense.  
It wasn't focused effort to attack her, but I'm glad to see we weren't afraid.  
  
Q. Coach Albright was talking about the zone, attacking their point guard
that you were showing in the second half. Can you describe what you do?  
COACH PEBLEY: No. I won't. But it's nothing new. We've been doing it all year.
Again, we're not putting anything new at this time of year. Players need to
play instinctually. I felt like their defense was very good. If we
overadjusted as a coaching staff, our players would be thinking too much. They
needed to just play, play instinctually, play confidently. That goes for the
defensive end as much as the offensive end.  
  
Q. Moriah has been up and down with her outside shot. She was on fire in the
first half. Do you see her playing better as the season goes along?  
COACH PEBLEY: She definitely has played better as the season has gone on. I
think, again, as I talked about in the last press conference, she's a player
that went a year and a half without playing basketball. It's taken time for
her to find her groove, her confidence, trust in her body and her knee that
she's solid.  
I think she's just done a good job. I really think Mo has done a great job
continuing to focus on preparation and practice. I'm big on practice. No
player should come play for me if you don't like to practice. We practice.  
She has bought into practice, and that has made her a better player, a better
teammate. Her teammates have told her, Mo, we can't win without you. We need
you competitive in practice to help us. She listened to it, and teammates
speak to one another way more powerfully than coaches do. I think that was
huge for Mo.  
  
Q. It was only five points, but they get up on you. Anything that was
said?  
COACH PEBLEY: Just trying to keep us confident, positive, committed. We didn't
panic. You can't panic.  
Then experience. We were down quite a bit. Where were we down at? San Diego
State right at the end of the regular season. Came back down double‑digits in
the second half and won that game. Just knowing you can create your own runs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH PEBLEY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  82  
Nevada  71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada. Coach, we'll ask you to make an opening
remark about tonight's game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, I'll just first of all start out by congratulating
Fresno State for being in the championship game again. Last year they started
at a completely different place at the end of the year than we did. They were
in the championship game, they won the championship game, they got to the NCAA
I don't know how many of the last years.  
We don't have that history at our school. I'm really, really proud of our
young ladies because we were picked at the bottom, I think 10th. I think
Fresno State was picked 1. Who knows what will happen tomorrow.  
But to be able to get to this game and play as well as we played and as hard
as we played, really proud of them. There was about a four‑minute stretch in
there that they got away from us.  
Moriah Faulk was the X factor in the first half. She hit five threes. We were
trying to key in on Taylor and Bree because they're the ones that usually kill
us. I saw Moriah play yesterday's game and I thought she had a great game.
She's really a great player. Obviously a transfer from UCLA. Did a lot of
things.  
Their senior leadership is very evident in Bree and Taylor, a lot of
experience. We really hadn't been in these type of games before. The
experience we have you see in our seniors. Arie was all heart and soul today,
seven assists and 17 points is a great line for her. Emily, you know, she's
the other person that has experience, not a senior. She's logged a lot of
minutes. 14 rebounds and 13 points, so a double‑double in a game like that.  
It wasn't lack of effort on our part. Again, they're great shooters. They only
hit three threes in the second half. Again, Moriah was definitely the X factor
in the first half until it got away.  
I felt our kids kept plugging away, did a good job on the boards. I think we
out‑rebounded them. We turned the ball over carelessly in the game, but that
comes in a game like that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How disappointing is it to have this loss?  
ARIELLE WIDEMAN: It was disappointing because I felt like we've had such a
great season. We only didn't play well for about four minutes, and Fresno can
get away from you that quick. 36 out of the 40 minutes we played well. They
shot the lights out when we slipped up.  
It's disappointing, but I know we'll get to play in the post‑season.  
EMILY BURNS: I disagree with Arie. I think there are four minutes where we let
it get away from us. But otherwise we played a great game.  
It's disappointing to know the regular season is over. If we made it to the
NCAA tournament or not, it's one season down. I think we're looking forward to
keep playing and show people that we're not done yet.  
  
Q. Talk about the second half. They came out and they very quickly started
doubling the point trying to deny inside. Were you prepared for that? How did
you react to that?  
ARIELLE WIDEMAN: It was a little different because it was a twilight zone. We
prepared for it, but we didn't execute as well as we practiced. They kind of
got us off balance, so...  
  
Q. For a long time, Fresno has been more than just a little bit better than
Nevada last couple years. Do you feel like you're closing the gap, leaving
this school with a better legacy than it had before against the top teams?  
ARIELLE WIDEMAN: Yeah, I definitely think we changed the culture here. We've
closed the gap. I think two out of the last four we've won. I think the gap is
just decreasing between us and Fresno. I think coach Jane is just helping turn
this program around so it's top in the Mountain West Conference.  
  
Q. Emily, how much more difficult is this team when they're hitting their
three ‑pointers the way they were?  
EMILY BURNS: They're pretty difficult because they do have big post players.
It's not like you can just say let's guard the outside and leave the inside
open. They keep us spread out and that's something we need to work on. But I
think it's something we can do. It's definitely going to be coming up in our
practices now.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Jane, if you could address the second half when they decided they wanted
to double the point. How much more difficult was it for you to get into your
offense?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: To be honest with you, that's how they play. You hadn't really
seen it, but that is their system. We have prepared against it all year.  
They didn't do it in the first half. We just had a couple of back‑to‑back
turnovers against it, then I think we panicked. The twilight zone is a great
thing. They've had a lot of success with it. We certainly, like Arie said, did
not execute. But we were not surprised.  
We shot the ball really well. Pretty much if you look at the statistics, I'm a
number's person, check the free throw count. That's where the game was. Mimi
was on the bench, I think she played four or five minutes. So that was one of
the things that we weren't able to do, is block shots like we normally do.  
But the foul count, and I'm not saying we didn't foul, I don't want anybody
getting me in trouble, but free throws, you know, they all shoot‑‑ you're all
sitting in the stands thinking, there's only 10 points fouling. Well, they all
shoot like 80% from the free throw line. There's always a reason Taylor has
the ball in her hands, because she's never missed a free throw since she came
over from Australia.  
I mean, it's free throws. But that is their system.  
  
Q. How difficult is it when they are hitting their threes? I think they were
8 ‑13\.   
COACH ALBRIGHT: They were. Moriah usually doesn't hit five threes. Certainly
you can only guard so many three‑point shooters, which is why they're great.
When they don't win, it's because they don't hit those shots. But when they do
hit 'em, that's a lot of threes.  
I thought our defense was decent on it. But when you break down, they make you
pay for it. Moriah's shots were all uncontested. I told you yesterday, I don't
want to play these people in horse. We know that. We have to contest. That was
at the top of the list of what we knew we had to do was contest shots.  
We had a few blocks. We contested them. Their numbers went down in the second
half from the three because we contested three. I think it was two in
transition for Moriah, Taylor got one from our 2‑3 zone at the top. They were
total breakdowns. They just make you pay. We can't guard them man. We tried,
but that was really a disaster.  
  
Q. Was losing Mimi to so many minutes, was that tough?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: That was very tough. Yeah, it was really tough. It's part of
the game, but it's really tough. She's our starting center. She's co‑defensive
Player of the Year. Taylor played how many minutes? 38. So, I mean, yeah, 16
isn't enough minutes for her for us to be good. Look at the rebounds.  
That's why I felt like Emily really stepped up. Aja and Nyasha, Julia, they
had good minutes, but they're not 6'8".  
  
Q. Talk about the post ‑season.   
COACH ALBRIGHT: Getting 3 spot in a major conference like this, we feel pretty
confident we could get an NIT bid. A lot of it for sure I don't really know.
I've been told there's a good chance.  
I'm really disappointed in the system of the RPI because I know we certainly
are worthy of having a couple of teams. Colorado State and Fresno State should
both be in the NCAA tournament. Only one of them will get in. I don't think
any way RPI‑wise both will get in. I'm sad for our conference because they're
both NCAA‑worthy teams. Wyoming, in my opinion, is, too. I think those would
be the teams that get to go. Maybe even Boise. I don't really know.  
I know a lot of teams that get to go to the NIT. I think it's 64, isn't it?
We're pretty hungry to go and they know it.  
  
Q. The season overall. Pretty happy with the way it's gone?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: I'm ecstatic. This is my 30th season. This was one of the most
enjoyable seasons I've ever had. They're a group that they work hard. They
done what we asked them. They don't always cover shooters. But if that's the
worst thing they have... You saw them, they take these little things with
them.  
We ask them to change the culture of our program and I believe that they have.
I think we've had a great recruiting class coming in. I think I can legally
talk about that. We've got a kid playing in the state championship down in New
Mexico. She's already the district MVP. We have two more playing in the
championships in California.  
Last time when we got to post‑season, we really had a drop‑off. We knew we
would because we had gone the junior college route with Tawny. This year we
feel like we're loaded up like you're supposed to be. I feel our freshmen are
pretty good players. I don't play them because we have so many seniors. But I
think we'll be all right.  
  
Q. This rivalry has been one ‑sided for so long, where do you feel it is
now?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, I mean, if you say this year, yeah, I think it's a
rivalry. Before people would say Fresno, are they your rival? How can they be
your rival, we never beat them. I think they have some respect for them. I
think Raegan has done a tremendous job of taking over. Adrian left them with a
boat load of players. Goodness gracious.  
She knew exactly what to do with them. They've all worked really hard. She's
tweaked the system, but kept them doing great. I think it's a pretty good
rivalry.  
  
Q. The other night when you were talking about Fresno State, you were
saying, Boy, aren't they fun to watch unless you're coaching against them.
When they were clicking tonight, how would you describe that when they're at
their best?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: It's harmony. If I had paid to come to this game, I would have
loved watching them. I was unfortunately on the bench not enjoying it a lot.  
Look how many assists they've got. 17 assists on 26 baskets. It's really,
really good basketball. They're very good defensively. Very fundamental.
They're very, very, very good.  
They just have so many people that you have to guard. I'd like to throw a
little‑‑ Ron Stewart has done a great job as their coach, too. He was with us.
He's come in and brought some things. We can see his touch on them.  
Congratulations to them. We maybe played‑‑ we probably played about 80% of
what we are. I don't know if they played that high. For a few minutes they
did. You saw the game. We were 5 up, then just like that (snapping fingers). I
don't think I've ever used my timeouts with how many minutes left to go. I
just felt like it was getting away from us, so trying to stop a run some way.  
  
Q. They ended on a 10 ‑0 run. How did that affect you guys?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: It took the wind out of us, for sure. We were able to run. We
did some things today we hadn't done before. I think it might have bothered
them a little bit. We played some 3‑2 zone. Never played that against them.
Didn't take them long to figure it out, so...  
But certainly that was the minutes we were talking about. That and the
beginning of the second half, I still thought we would be okay. That's when
they kind of threw the twilight. We had a plan against it. We had back‑to‑back
turnovers there, I believe, at the beginning.  
Again, give them credit, we did not have the composure in a big game. But we
hadn't been in that game before. Then we had to watch a doggone triple
overtime game. We warmed them up three times. They did, too. We weren't the
only ones waiting. This was a huge deal for us. For them, they're just getting
to the finals like they do every year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Thanks to the Mountain West. Y'all do a great, great job. Good
luck the rest of it. We're headed back to Reno.

### [Stacie Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26587)

### [Cierra Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26589)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Nevada  53  
San Diego State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State. Coach, if you could open with a
few remarks about tonight's game.  
COACH TERRY: I'm disappointed, disappointed that we lost. Obviously our goal
this season was to win a championship, and we fell short this year. So I'm
disappointed. Disappointed for these two, that they didn't have that
opportunity.  
But really proud of the way that our kids fought tonight. Did not give up.
Played hard the entire game. Our defense was so good, so good. I told them
early if we kept this game in the 50s, we had a shot to win. We definitely had
that.  
So I'm just proud of our effort. Thought we played really, really hard. And
we're going to build on that going forward.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. When Mimi came back in the game for Nevada, seemed like they took control
of the game. Was she just a bigger presence than you were expecting or shots
weren't falling?  
CIERRA WARREN: I mean, she is a big presence, but what she really did was
crash in the paint, so that makes it really hard, being that most of our
points do come from the paint.  
Watching Air Force, they probably saw that was how to win the game.  
  
Q. With the one ‑on‑one battle against her, is that something you get up for
knowing she's one of the better centers in the league?   
CIERRA WARREN: I mean, every game you get excited. It doesn't matter who
you're playing.  
I mean, yeah, she is a great player. But any game you play you want to get
excited, you want to score, you want to do your best.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Could you comment about Mimi when she came back in the second half, do
you feel that was a turning point there?  
COACH TERRY: I do. I think her presence makes it tough for us to score in the
paint. But not only Mimi. I thought they did a good job of clogging everything
up, making it tough for us to get some easy points.  
She does a great job altering shots, as well. So she kind of took us out of
our rhythm. Normally we can get to the paint and get to the free‑throw line.
We didn't have that opportunity tonight. So obviously that is reflected in the
score.  
But she's a big presence. Anchoring that zone, I thought they played a very
good game tonight.  
  
Q. I thought defensively you were strong the whole game. Forced the 10
‑second violation in the final minute. What play were you trying to run
there?  
COACH TERRY: We ran a couple things. We were looking to come off a double
screen, down screen, and get the three. We were just going to take the first
available shot at that point because obviously time was not our friend. So we
were just looking to get something easy.  
Chloe came through and made a couple buckets at the end, Desi Culberson got a
good look for us to get it back in range. A couple calls didn't go our way. I
mean, it's a different ballgame.  
I want to say this. Nevada did an awesome job executing their game plan.
They're a very talented team. They're going to really make some noise in this
tournament.  
I mean, they just did a great job executing their game plan against us.  
  
Q. It's hard to sum things up after the game is over. If you can look back
on your first season, analyze things you did well, things you would like to
improve on.  
COACH TERRY: I don't know if we have the time for all that.  
I think we grew a lot as a team. I inherited a bunch of young women who didn't
have a lot of experience. And the ones that did ended up getting injured. So
our record, I don't want to be judged on our record, I want to be judged on
the growth we made from the start to the finish because that's really what I'm
most proud of.  
We finished the season without a point guard. For us to come and be
competitive, down the stretch, in this league, is a testament to how good and
how hard and diligent our young ladies were this season.  
For me going into the spring, we're going to work on our ball handling, we're
going to work on shooting, being better shooters. We have excellent post
players. Our guards have grown a lot, too. But for me that's going to be the
key so people can't pack it in like they did this season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  72  
Utah State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State. Coach, just some general
remarks on today's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, when we saw this draw, Utah State right now is the
hottest team in the league. When you've got guards like Schlott and Williams,
we knew that was going to be a very, very tough draw for us. With them having
nothing to lose, we knew we were going to get a great shot.  
Utah State was exceptional today. They were exceptional. I credit our kids
with keeping the poise and the composure. We've said it all year long, they
just kind of find a way to win. Sometimes we win pretty, sometimes we win
ugly, sometimes we win shooting it, and sometimes like tonight you don't win
many games shooting 5 of 22 from the three. A pretty gritty and gutsy group.  
Happy with a victory against a Utah State team that is as hot as anybody and
is as good as anybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, what was going through your mind when they took the three ‑point
lead with a minute? Were you seeing your senior year and your career flash
before your eyes at that point?  
SAM MARTIN: Well, it was a little stressful at the end. Honestly, I really
believe in my team and I believe in these girls. We always find a way to win,
as coach always says.  
I had a lot of faith we were going to be able to get this back. We just said,
One more score and we're there, one more stop and we're there. That was our
mindset, just most important play. We kept that in mind during that last
minute there.  
  
Q. Gritt, can you talk about your team's poise in the final couple
minutes.  
GRITT RYDER: I think like coach said we find another way to win every time. I
was confident that we were going to find a way. Maybe wasn't going to be a
three, but an offensive rebound from Sam or a drive by Elly. As Sam says, just
take one play at a time. I think we did that and I think that's why we won.  
  
Q. Sam, can you tell us what it was like for you late in the game knowing
you had the opportunity to tie it up?  
SAM MARTIN: It was fun. Every time Hayley and I always practice, every time we
shoot free throws, it's like, This is for the Mountain West. It was like, I've
been here before in my head.  
I was more excited when Elly hit that layup. It was a fun game to play with my
team.  
  
Q. Gritt, you shot more free throws by yourself than Utah State did as a
team. What were you seeing out there on the floor?  
GRITT RYDER: We know Jennifer Schlott was an important player and she was
guarding me. They ended up fouling me. That's why I ended up at the line.  
  
Q. Sam, it seemed like the first half you were content to play their style
of game. In the second half you seemed to turn more to play your style game
with the quick inside post feeds, quick buckets. Did it feel that way on the
court?  
SAM MARTIN: Definitely. I think that we went out in that first half a little
timid. I think we were playing good defense, it just our offense wasn't
rolling. We weren't playing CSU basketball. We went in at halftime and talked
it over, Let's play our game, let's keep getting stops and play confidently
our offense.  
We came out a little timid in the first half, I would say. But we definitely
came back out and finished with CSU basketball.  
  
Q. Gritt, you had to guard Jennifer Schlott. What is it like having to guard
a player like that?  
GRITT RYDER: She's really, really, really good. I'm happy I'm not playing
against her next year.  
It was a collective effort from our group to keep her from scoring. I think we
did a really good job in the second half. But a player like that, you can't
hold her down. I have a lot of respect for how she played tonight and has been
playing all year.  
  
Q. Sam, can you talk about Gritt's game today.  
SAM MARTIN: Gritt played really, really well tonight. I think that our team as
a whole wasn't able to make a lot of things, and Gritt was there being
consistent, making the plays, doing a lot of things to keep our team in there.
It's easy when you're not making anything to stop. Gritt kept our team going.
I think she showed great leadership out there and composure in the end of the
game with getting stops and did everything today. I think that was huge for
our team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What was the mood like at halftime? What did you say to these kids?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Our mood was fine, very matter of fact. Here is what we have
to do to win the basketball game. That's not the first time we've been down. I
think the last four or five games we've had close games at half or been down
at half.  
The strength of this team is the composure of this team. That's exactly what
our halftime message was. You do have to take it possession by possession.
Let's just go out and execute the way we're capable of executing.  
I thought we needed to do a better job defensively on Schlott. She had a
really big first half. We kind of walled her up much better in the second
half. Then offensively we needed to get the ball to Sam inside.  
You talk a few adjustments. But these kids are smart basketball players. They
made the right plays at the right time tonight.  
  
Q. Now you have two days before you play again. A little bit different in a
conference tournament to have this break in the middle. What do you do the
next two days?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're going to hit every show in Vegas, I mean every one
(laughter).  
No, we're going to treat it just like a normal conference season where you
play on Wednesday and then you play again on a Saturday. We're going to treat
tomorrow like a Thursday.  
We need to rest our bodies. We'll get a nice little practice in and get some
treatment on some kids.  
It flows right in nicely with how we've gone all year. We're not going to
change anything with our game routine.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Elly's three ‑point play that put you ahead. She
stayed in there and put you ahead.   
COACH WILLIAMS: Elly has made some big plays all year in crucial situations.
She just stays with it. She just keeps playing. That was the perfect example.  
That was a huge basket. The shot clock was going down. We did have them spread
out there in our late‑game situations and we needed to attack. That's why we
got to the foul line late.  
Elly is a really good driver. She saw her hole. It was a great finish. To make
the free throw, that got us over the hump.  
  
Q. Stephanie had two points in the first half. Were you expecting her to go
off like that in the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: First of all, Bairstow, what a terrific game. You can see her
grow as a basketball player. You saw that in her brother, too. Let's hope she
doesn't get that good.  
But she was somebody that we were always concerned about, first half, second
half. This time of year it's about players stepping up and making plays.
Bairstow, she did that today. You got to give her credit. 9 of 13. It wasn't
that we weren't guarding her or competing on her; she made plays.  
  
Q. Coming in in your first game and playing a Utah State team that if
healthy is probably at least a four or five seed in this conference. Do you
feel like this is as big a challenge you might face in the tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Maybe. Everybody in this tournament's really good, right?
We've talked about the parity of this league from day one this year. This
tournament is no different.  
But playing a Utah State team with those guards, I mean, those guards are
big‑time players, terrific players. So they're not an eight seed like I said
earlier.  
It surely gets our urgency level where it needs to be early on in the
tournament. It surely got us spurred and ready to go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thanks, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  80  
UNLV  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State. Coach, just some general remarks
on tonight's game.  
COACH PEBLEY: We feel really fortunate and excited to survive and advance.
This was a very tough first‑round matchup. I really think every single game so
far in the tournament has just been a fight. That's a credit to our conference
and the players that are in our conference, the coaching that's in our
conference. Just so much parity.  
Our team knew, and we talked about it all season, that anyone can beat anyone
in our conference. You've got to come focused and prepared and confident. I
love how we started the game. I think that helped a lot because we created a
cushion.  
UNLV is a very good team. We knew they were going to go on a run, if not more
than one run. That cushion helped secure a little bit of our lead when they
did.  
Just, again, really, really proud that we get to continue to extend these
seniors' season. They're two special women. We're really fortunate that
they're at Fresno State.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about those first five minutes when you jumped on them,
controlled the tempo.  
BREE FARLEY: I think as coach said, you know, anyone can beat anyone in this
league, and we knew that. We didn't want to let UNLV in from the word 'go'. We
came out pretty fired up and ready to go. We were really focused.  
I think we just took shots that were good for our team. It was nice that we
hit them.  
  
Q. Taylor, it seemed like when you wanted to play at a fast tempo, that was
working for you. When you slowed it down, that was working. Talk about the
shifting of gears.  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, UNLV's a great team. They put everything at us.
They were in a zone, they were in a man. So I think our team responded well to
that.  
We knew that pushing on them was playing our game, but we also knew we could
slow down at times.  
Going off of what Bree said, our focus was there and I think that was key for
this win today.  
  
Q. Winning the way you have in conference tournaments the last three years,
what is your mindset going into this tournament? How much does that help you
with all that experience?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: I mean, experience I think always helps players and a team
and coaches. But this is a new year. Right now I feel like the tournament is
just a season in itself. The games before do matter, but I feel like, like we
said, anybody can win at any moment. So we have to show up for every game.  
So we're definitely focused on one game at a time. I think that's key for our
team, to stay humble but also confident.  
BREE FARLEY: I just agree with Taylor. You can't overlook anyone in this
league. There's almost been a few upsets. Games coming down to the very last
possession.  
To get into a position where we don't have to be at a game coming down to the
last possession was very positive for us, knowing that we can push the lead
out a little bit and have a good win.  
  
Q. It's an odd scenario to have two days off, not know your opponent. How do
you prepare with two days off?  
TAYLOR THOMPSON: I definitely think these two days off are key. We have to,
you know, rest our bodies. We have to make sure we're staying hydrated. We
have to stay focused.  
We're going to watch the game tonight. But any team that we're up against we
have to be ready for. So I think having these two days off is good for us, but
we also have to make sure that we're using them to our advantage.  
BREE FARLEY: I think it's just, yeah, making sure we prep ourselves for
whoever we play, just making sure we rest our bodies and look after ourselves
and keep mentally sharp. You can't take any time off.  
We'll have a bit of a rest but making sure that we focus whoever we play next.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you see Bree looking for a shot early and making them, how much does
that set the tone for the rest of the team at that point?  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, I think it's good when she can do that. But what we talk
to Bree a lot about in her growth as a player is she stays consistent in
looking for her shot.  
Bree doesn't force anything, which I think makes her a great teammate, a great
person to play with. It allows her to stay consistent and it won't make her
confidence hit peaks and valleys. She moves really well off the ball. She's
got teammates that know how to get her the ball.  
So it helps. But tonight we have five players in double figures, which is the
first time that's happened. I know we've had a few times with four. That is
Fresno State basketball, where we want everybody on the floor to be confident
that their shot when created throughout the offense and by their teammates is
the best shot, especially when they're open.  
It is really nice when you see your team hit some shots early in the game. I
think that opens up other people, as well.  
  
Q. There was a stretch closing out the first half when Taylor is on the
bench. The possibility of playing three games in five days, how much of
managing those minutes do you have to take into account?  
COACH PEBLEY: Taylor has had a lot of experience playing a lot of minutes. I
think her body is conditioned and her mind is conditioned as well. She's a
very mentally tough woman.  
I don't feel like we have to manage it too much. She was on the bench because
of foul trouble. We won't kid anybody on that. So she sat, great job by the
end handling a press situation with Taylor off the floor, executing really
well.  
Then huge stops defensively when Taylor was out, and getting rebounds.
Brittany Aikens came off the bench, she's a walk‑on for us who really has been
a great asset for us. Her and Raven have been two players we've been able to
go to with different needs and situations, and they've really stepped through
throughout the last month and a half.  
  
Q. Between the winning streak you're on, having Sheedy back now, tonight
having five players in double figures, are you playing your best basketball
right now?  
COACH PEBLEY: I think we are playing with a lot of momentum, more momentum
than we've had all season. I always think ‑ probably most coaches do ‑ that
you're never at your best, that you can always be better. There's areas you're
trying to minimize your weaknesses and play to your strengths.  
I have fun watching this team play. I've had a lot of fun coaching this team.
They're coachable. They play hard for each other. You just see them coming up,
and sometimes it's just finding a way. Sometimes as a coach, I have the
opportunity where I get to step back and not over‑coach them, really let them
lead.  
That's a great advantage as a coach.  
  
Q. You touched on Alex Sheedy coming back. This was her third game. For her
to get 15 points, her contribution means a lot to you, but specifically what
does she bring to the table at tournament time?  
COACH PEBLEY: Experience. Alex Sheedy definitely brings experience. She won a
championship as a freshman and started and played a lot of minutes for them.  
There were times in timeouts in the second half today where she ran the
timeout. She said, Listen, ladies, get me the ball when they're playing behind
me. To see that kind of confidence come from one of your players, and her
teammates respect her so much, they then executed off of what she said, was
really, really cool.  
Again, that's what I mean by sometimes as a coach you guide 'em, but they're
the ones out there playing the game. At this point in the season sometimes we
can over‑coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like Moriah had kind of a dip in conference play. Is she
starting to come on? How important could she be to you if she's really playing
well?  
COACH PEBLEY: Moriah is a player that sometimes I forget this, she went a year
and a half without playing basketball because of her injury and her transfer
situation. Even last year as a redshirt, she couldn't practice because she was
rehabbing. She had an additional procedure done on her knee that slowed her
being able to come back.  
A player that's in that situation, it takes time. I think Moriah is showing
the potential that she has to be a great player. It's fun to think we still
have a lot of years left with Moriah. I love that girl. I really, really love
that girl because she just never gave up on herself. She had teammates that
never gave up on her, as well.  
She really showed some conviction as a student‑athlete, as a woman, to stay
committed to the process when she could have really gotten frustrated when
you're talking about that dip in the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH PEBLEY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  61  
Boise State  56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming. Coach, if you'll just give some
general remarks about tonight's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think the game is what the Mountain West is about. Two teams
giving everything that they have out there. You knew it was going to come down
to maybe the last possession. Sure enough, we're up 10 with three minutes to
go. We have to make a stop defensively.  
You give Boise State credit. They came at us in the last three minutes to
create either a lay‑in or a three‑point shot. That was something we were
trying to take away. I thought that was a big part of our game plan.  
In the first half we had to go small when Kaitlyn Mileto was in foul trouble.
I thought Chelan Landry came in and gave us a big lift. We talked about being
more aggressive. Marquelle Dent sure was that today. We had things designed to
give Marquelle every opportunity to make things happened and she delivered.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How hard is it to keep being aggressive when you're getting bumped and
hit, maybe a couple fouls not called?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think it potentially being our last game, you just have to
keep going out and giving it your all. No matter what the foul calls are, you
have to keep being aggressive, go to the basket, find your open teammates and
stuff.  
  
Q. What was the game like for you, Fallon? Seemed like a prize fight.  
FALLON LEWIS: It was extremely physical. We knew coming out that it was going
to be a really physical game, that we had to match that energy.  
Like Marquelle said, any game could be our last. We keep driving and forcing
the ball in.  
  
Q. Fallon, it was a game where you got out early, they came back and took a
lead. You don't always respond well to that. You did today.  
FALLON LEWIS: I think we had a great start coming out. That really gave us
some momentum to keep pushing. Coach told us that we were going to have runs
and they were going to have their runs. We just had to hold our ground, stay
in the game.  
  
Q. I know they held you scoreless in the first half. Did anything change in
the second half?  
FALLON LEWIS: I kind of just calmed down. I was kind of forcing things,
forcing my shots. I kind of let the game come to me. Marquelle is great, and
Chelan both, finding the open player.  
We calmed down and found one another.  
  
Q. Chelan, you had a big tournament last year. When you were called upon,
were you confident or nervous?  
CHELAN LANDRY: I think we all were a little nervous in the beginning. Right
after the tipoff, I think we were fine.  
  
Q. Marquelle, it seems like last couple games here you've been even more
aggressive, on the throttle. Has that been a mindset for you?  
MARQUELLE DENT: Yeah, it's definitely a mindset just to be more aggressive. I
think when we are more aggressive, it opens up a lot more shots for my
teammates and stuff.  
That's definitely been a mindset throughout these last couple games.  
  
Q. Fallon, Joe mentioned after Friday's game that Marquelle was running, but
the other players weren't running with her. How much did you put that as a
premium?  
FALLON LEWIS: Earlier in the season, I think we all were running. That's how
we were getting open looks. We had to find that again, come out with her today
and run with her, we knew she would find the open person. I think we did that.  
  
Q. Fallon, what was it like, you play well at home. What was it like having
that kind of support even in Vegas?  
FALLON LEWIS: Yeah, just coming out for warmups, seeing all that gold in the
stands was awesome. They really gave us that home atmosphere. We felt very
comfortable playing in front of them. So it was great.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. How big was it having this kind of fan support, creating that energy
throughout this game?  
COACH LEGERSKI: One of the things I mentioned at the start of the game when we
got into our huddle before tip was that you need to give this group something
to cheer for. Wyoming fans are great supporters of this program. To see the
number of people in the stands today, just to hear the roar during
introductions, I think that really energized this team.  
We talked about giving them something to cheer for. I thought that we did that
today, right through the very end. It definitely helps having that energy. It
makes my team play a step harder than maybe what they want to do. I know
there's going to be a lot of them here Thursday for the men's game and again
for ours on Friday.  
  
Q. You talked after the CSU game on Friday where you feel Marquelle is
becoming the emotional leader of the team. Are you surprised when she has
performances like this and takes over a game?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Sometimes we forget she's a sophomore. She really came on at
the end of last season. It takes a little bit of time to adjust to that role
of where we want the basketball in her hands to make decisions.  
We did a lot of high pick for her today and she delivered. That's the biggest
thing you ask a player to do.  
It was difficult. When you look at the stats, you see that Fallon and Kayla
were 6 for 28, baskets were not going to come easy. We needed somebody to be
able to step up, and that's Marquelle.  
I thought we really ran today. That's the big thing, is that you cannot have
Marquelle attacking one on three. We have great shooters on the wings. They
need to get out with Marquelle and give her options. When they do that, it
makes the game a lot easier.  
  
Q. Fallon didn't have any points in the first half. Were they taking
anything away or did something change? Did you make adjustments in the second
half for her?  
COACH LEGERSKI: First of all, Boise State is very good defensively. They
create some issues for you. One of the things that I thought with Fallon is
she understands being a senior. Everything that this year has meant to her,
from a small school in Wyoming, to putting on that jersey. She wants to keep
putting it on as many days as she can.  
I thought she was tight early. We just talked to her to let the game happen
for her. There will be enough people to help her out.  
I thought she did that in the second half. We moved her a little bit, we
adjusted how we were attacking to try to free her up. And Marquelle and Chelan
found her with easy shots. There's nothing better than to get an easy shot
when you're not making any shots.  
  
Q. It seems like at times she was hitting the floor pretty hard like a prize
fight. Did it get a little more physical than maybe you thought or expected?
Was that kind of typical?  
COACH LEGERSKI: No, I just think with tournament play, everybody's giving 100%
effort. We talk about you win, you advance; you lose, you go home. Give
everything you have. I thought Fallon did that.  
She was diving on the floor. In fact, I thought both teams gave everything
they had today. I think that's why you saw such a great basketball game. Very
entertaining, exciting right to the very end. Then Marquelle Dent steps up and
makes two free throws. For all us Wyoming fans, I'm very proud of what
Marquelle was able to accomplish today.  
  
Q. You just mentioned it, but there's been a couple games during the season
where you haven't finished quite as well. With them making that run, what
allowed you to put an end to that?  
COACH LEGERSKI: One of the things we talked about is that every team makes
runs. Boise State happened to make theirs in the last three minutes. We had to
remind them we were the team that was ahead and to play that way. Do not get
tentative, keep attacking the basket, keep rebounding, let's win the final
four minutes.  
As it ended up being, we won the game. It's a learning experience for this
group. A year ago we just threw the ball to Chandra Sewell. It's a little
different this season. They're still trying to figure out where the leadership
comes from, where the points come from every night.  
Even when Kayla doesn't shoot the ball well, she had nine rebounds and five
steals. That's an important night. Jordan Sibrel had six offensive rebounds,
gave us extra opportunities. Every play becomes so important in close
basketball games.  
  
Q. The last time you played them, they were really hot from behind the three
‑point arc. Did you do anything differently to try to cool them down a little
bit?  
COACH LEGERSKI: When you take a look at the box score, we knew we could not
give up three‑point shots. We gave one up at the end where we made a defensive
mistake. To their credit, they made us pay for it. Only to give up three, I'm
very happy with that effort.  
That was an effort going into this game that we knew we had to take that away.
The last time we played them, they shot the ball extremely well from three. We
didn't have many answers to try to guard what we were trying to get done. I
thought tonight we did a better job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  80  
UNLV  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV. Coach, just some general thoughts on
tonight's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I thought we battled. It was just difficult to give up as
many points as we did at the beginning. They were really hot. Fresno was hot
at shooting the three ball in transition. When a team shoots like that, it's
just hard to, you know, come back. Like we were constantly fighting to try to
come back and stay in the game.  
We made a really good run in the first half, the end of the first half. We
made a great run. And then the second half we kind of sputtered a little bit
at the beginning.  
But Fresno's a good team. They have a lot of players that can shoot the ball
well. They have good size inside. They have a really good floor general in
Taylor Thompson. They got a lot of different weapons and they did a really
good job tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Mia, when you came out of the game, what was that emotion like for you?  
MIA BELL: I don't know, it's hard to explain. I can't really talk about it.
It's something‑‑ it was just hard. I can't really explain the emotion, it's
hard (tearing up).  
  
Q. What memories do you think you'll take away from your time here?  
MIA BELL: Everything. I've had five years, so I have a lot of memories: good
and not so good. All of them will help me in the future. I'll use my
experience this year to help me be successful later on in life.  
I know that will happen, so...  
  
Q. The way the season just ended, do you think that gives you strong
motivation going into the off ‑season as far as trying to make up for how the
season went? Sum of what kind of team you think will come back next season.   
RÉJANE VÉRIN: Yes, it's definitely a motivation for next year. We will lose
key players like Mia. But I hope we will, you know, be successful next year
and be able to win and come back strong.  
  
Q. Do you feel pretty good about the team coming back?  
RÉJANE VÉRIN: Yeah. We still have like key players like Dani, Alana, Aley and
everybody else on the bench. We have some good freshmen coming up, too.  
I think we'll be all right. Not all right, I think we'll be great.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. That first stretch early on, how difficult was that for your team to keep
up with the pace, the performance they were putting out those first five
minutes?  
COACH OLIVIER: The pace, I mean, we've seen that before. It's more they
stretch you out. That's kind of one of our weaknesses. We're not great in
transition D. Fresno does a really good job of stretching you out. They have a
lot of weapons from the three range. That hurt us in yesterday's game, and it
hurt us again today.  
I was surprised to see Fresno be on fire as much as they were for their first
tournament game. I thought it would take them a second, but clearly it did
not.  
If you don't get out and contest... I thought we did a much better job in the
middle and towards the end of the first half matching up with them and
contesting more their threes. When you contest them, they struggle a little
bit more.  
Wide‑open threes, they're going to hit those. I mean, that's what they do.
That's what they love. It's very obvious they run rhythm.  
  
Q. How do you go into this off ‑season? Do you think you need to change
things up? Do you feel good coming back?  
COACH OLIVIER: You know, this year was hard from the get‑go. Mia went down.
She missed four pre‑season games with a high ankle sprain. She's just such a
good leader. She's always been a really good leader for us.  
We lose Rmanii, Amanda and Friederike. Every year you go through that
rebuilding stage. I think the players we have coming back are great. I think
we have great size. They're just getting stronger and stronger. Alana had an
unbelievable year. She's very consistent. Danielle Miller gives her guts and
constantly improves, constantly works to improve over the summer.  
Aley Rohde, she sat out a year. It took her a second to get comfortable. She
dislocates her arm while she was the number two or number three scorer in the
Mountain West. We have her on the bench. She comes back and puts up some crazy
numbers.  
Réjane is very capable. I thought she had a great game today. So I really like
the people we have coming back. I'm missing Bri. I really like our group, our
core. We have five freshmen coming in. Out of the five coming in, three of
them are still playing in state championships. We have one of the best point
guards coming in, Southern California. We feel really good about that. We have
four others that are very talented. They're AP students. They're workers.  
We worked very hard, our coaches worked very hard, to get the balanced
student‑athlete that we know are going to improve. We are convinced these five
coming in will help us, along with the nucleus coming back.  
  
Q. Talk about replacing Mia Bell, what she meant to this program?  
COACH OLIVIER: She couldn't even answer you. She's obviously very upset.  
Mia, she's just such a good leader. She works extremely hard at practice. She
is the player that's always gonna stay after, get extra threes in, get extra
shots in.  
She had a great run. What was that, her junior year, sophomore year, because
she sat out the next year, wasn't 100%. You know, had a great run with Lanita
and Jamie and Sandrine and Marquelle [ph]. Great run. We win 22 games. Beat
Iowa. Beat K State. Didn't do a good job in this tournament, which saddens me.  
People think it's a home court. It's not. We played in COX. That's the reality
of it.  
Mia has done so much. She's constantly up in the office. She helps us with
every recruit that comes on campus. She talks to the parents. She meets with
the recruits. What do I need to do to make us better?  
We just had a senior celebration. She was talking about, you know, one thing I
would tell all of you, her teammates, don't be afraid to think big. Why not
us? We have everything we need. Why not us? We just have to get that mindset
to think big and to go for it.  
  
Q. What did you tell them in the locker room just now?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I mean, hopefully I don't get sad talking about this. We
don't like our record. That's not fun. But for the most part our team, they
just had really good attitudes. They're a special group. They've worked hard.
We had so many close games at the beginning of the year. We just kept telling
them, Keep your heads up, things will change. Mia hadn't played for a year.
Aley hasn't played for a year. It was almost getting adjusted.  
I said, You know, good things come to an end. We're not saying this is good,
because you want to sit there and say we have over 20 wins, but the reality is
they're a really special group. They represent UNLV and Lady Rebel basketball
with lot of pride. We had alumni up in the stands. I had a lot of texts. We
have done a very good job with this program as far as representing this
university and being proud basketball Lady Rebels, so that's what I told them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  72  
Utah State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State. Coach, if you could make a few
opening comments on today's game.  
COACH FINKBEINER: Yeah, I was really proud of our team, as you saw. I thought
we were in charge of the game, in control of the game, probably the better
team for probably 36, 37 minutes of the game.  
I thought their poise really showed up the last minute and 15. They had a
chance to get tight. They had a chance to cough some things up. They delivered
in the last minute 15. Credit Colorado State.  
We broke down defensively with strong right‑handed dribbling. As our scouting
report, they go right, they go right, they go right. It wasn't just one play,
it was 40 minutes of hard drives to the right.  
Thinking the discrepancy in the fouls, maybe that was it. Maybe that was the
reason. I don't know. We won in all offensive categories except for free
throws. They drew those free throws out with the hard drives.  
So it's hard to know what to say this moment other than I remember the first
time we played Colorado State, they beat us by 20‑something, third time 20 or
30‑something. We really thought we had a chance in our game plan. The spirit
of our kids, last eight games, we've been playing really well.  
Obviously, our season's over with. We'll evaluate this tape real close.
There's some questionable plays the last minute and a half. I probably better
not watch. From our perspective when we had the ball, we were guarding. The
game was that close. I'll look at it as a big picture of 40 minutes, where
things broke down the first minute, the last minute.  
The very first game of the season we played Colorado State, I impressed upon
coach, they have kids that have a lot of poise. They play with poise ahead.
They play with poise behind. I think that was the difference the last minute
14.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Seems like Colorado State adjusted their defense in the second half to
lock more on Jen. How did that open things up for Stephanie?  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Yeah, they really sagged in a lot on me. They focused
basically their defense around me. Steph found the open gaps and knocked down
shots. She was big‑time for us today. She really kept us in the game.  
  
Q. Jennifer, Sam Martin took over for a stretch there early in the second
half for them. You had kept her from doing anything in the first half. How
much of a factor was that in what happened?  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Yeah, she did. She's a great player. That's what great
players will do. They definitely dominate down low.  
I thought she got good position on us. They have great shooters so we couldn't
sag in that much. That's really what happened.  
  
Q. Jen, what defensive adjustments did they make against you in the second
half?  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: They were in their zone and they just kind of closed up
driving lanes for me. They contested the three pretty well, I thought.  
  
Q. Stephanie, it seemed like the first half they were willing to kind of
play your guy's kind of game, trying to shoot the threes. It was working in
your favor. Did you feel more you were playing Colorado State's style of game
in the second half and maybe that was why they were able to pull it out in the
end?  
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: A little bit, yeah. I felt that, yeah, we couldn't really
get our shots that we really wanted to take that second half.  
Fortunately enough I was able to get my shots in the end, but it didn't really
come out in our favor, so...  
  
Q. Steph, can you talk about Jen, what it's been like playing with her. She
became the all ‑time scoring leading today. What has that been like?  
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: Jen's a phenomenal player. Probably the best player I've
ever played with her. It's been a real honor playing with her at Utah State.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the final minute.  
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: I remember coming off the bench. We just said, Lock down
D. We were trying. I unfortunately had an error on my part in the final play
by them. I fouled. She got an end one. I was a second behind. I think it came
down to that in the end.  
  
Q. Rebounding gave you such an edge today. How did you try to match up with
Colorado State and ultimately beat them on the boards.  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Yeah, they're a great rebounding team. But we just knew that
we needed to box out. That's been our Achilles' heel the whole season. That
was a big focus on us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What do you tell your team after a game like this?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Well, some I can't say here because as a team you spend so
much time together, there's a lot of emotion right now in the locker room.  
I think what I told them is that, you know, I think we're the best team in the
conference the last six, seven games. We had good health. Mak Williams is back
in the lineup. We had a lot of confidence coming into this tournament.  
Saying that, I'm saying this to the world right now, that's kind of the
player/coach thing. Just let them know that we did everything right the last
three weeks with team relationships, chemistry, saving everything we had for
the last. We did everything right.  
I just wanted the girls to know that we felt as a staff, you know, coming here
that we felt like we could win it, we really did. So it's a letdown right now
in that locker room. I thought the girls, you know, showed some good things
right here. It was tough two minutes ago.  
So our sights was not being on the eighth seed. We tried to use everything as
a positive. We came in here, having one game underneath their belt. We had one
game already on this floor, using that as a positive. We promised them some
things the next days, with two days off, getting ready for the semis.
Everything was set.  
We made some errors the last four minutes. I look back, where I'm going to
lose sleep, we had multiple four‑ and five‑point margins the last 10 minutes
and we could not get a defensive stop. Again, I got to flip it across to coach
and the Rams. Every time we got four or five points ahead, they got a bucket.  
We were one rebound away, one shot away, one hold away from I think maybe
giving us an advantage strategically.  
Again, I get back to I'm so impressed with Colorado State and their poise they
have. I'm using that word a lot. Just calm girls out there. The scary thing is
most of them are pretty young.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Jen becoming the all ‑time scoring leader and talk
about what she's meant to the program, this being her final game.   
COACH FINKBEINER: Yeah, Jen, she's gone from two and a half points a game her
freshman year, four and a half her sophomore year, to about 13 last year, and
all of a sudden 27. It's just a testament of keeping the nose to the road and
grinding things out. She's a little kid that has a lot of bumps and bruises,
just always keeps bouncing back. Wants the ball in her hands.  
She's also an academic All‑American nominee, a great student. She's got
everything a coach wants.  
I remember back, I've told this story to our media, when I got the job two
years ago, my son Ben is assistant coach at Boise State. He said Jen Schlott
is your best player. Looking at the stats, with two points, three‑ or
four‑point average, this little kid, my baby is bigger than she is, but it's
just been a pleasure to coach her.  
It's going to be good for her body the next two weeks to get away from the
game a little bit. She has a chance to play at the next level, a couple
different levels. If she wants to do it, she's going to have opportunities.  
I can't stress enough the academic side of Jen Schlott, just the girly girl
she is in some situations. Just the perfect student‑athlete.  
  
Q. Wondering in general what do you feel your program takes away from this
Mountain West tournament experience. Young players stepping up for you.  
COACH FINKBEINER: We've had six or seven games this year that have been just
like this, maybe seven or eight games in conference, where we've had control
and lost in the last two or three minutes.  
I think the new kids on the block, it's all about transitioning into
opponents, the routineness of travel, where you're going, what this gym looks
like.  
I just really was proud of our girls as we finished the journey this year in
our first year that we were ready to go. We're just ready to go.  
But it was a transition that I'm so impressed with the Mountain West. I'm so
impressed with the coaching staffs. This Las Vegas venue. I mean, it's just a
good place to be for Aggie basketball.  
Our recruiting will change a little bit. We need to get a little more
physical. We had a little smoke and mirrors we were working with this year. We
look forward to the membership in the Mountain West and how we can contribute
to it.  
It's been a good first‑year ride. Our record I don't think shows how
competitive we were. We're looking forward to the future here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH FINKBEINER: Thanks, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  61  
Boise State  56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State. Coach, if you could give some
general comments about tonight's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: I thought Wyoming played a great game. They were very
aggressive. They penetrated the ball on us pretty much at will.  
I thought that we competed. I thought we got ourselves back into it, showed
the heart of our team. We had a struggle with energy that first half. That was
a telltale toll.  
The two things that stand out mostly, 24 field goals to their 20. Offensive
rebounding and free throws. In today's game free throws come from driving the
ball and offensive rebounds. We did not stay in front of them and we did not
keep them from offensive rebounding.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Miquelle, could you talk about the rebounding advantage they had.  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: I don't know. I don't think they had an advantage. They worked
harder for them than we did. I think that we're still struggling to, like,
play 40 minutes. That comes into play, when we don't rebound and let them get
three offensive rebounds in one play.  
  
Q. Second half when they went on the spurt and went ahead, what did you see
there?  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: We just got to keep making it so we can make our own energy.
We usually fuel our energy off offense. If that's not coming, we have to make
sure we can fuel it off getting a stop, getting a rebound. Just making sure we
play our game and not letting how we're playing affect.  
  
Q. How hard was it to stop Dent?  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: Yeah, we just need to have better help side. She beat us off
the dribble anytime she wanted to. That's a weakness we need to fix.  
  
Q. Deanna, could you talk about the way the team came back. You got it
within two. What were you able to do toward the end that worked so well? What
were you not able to do to finish it off?  
DEANNA WEAVER: I think we just played harder at that moment. We realized we
didn't have a lot of time left. We waited too long to realize it was now
coming to an end. We needed to get up.  
We realized that. We just wanted it. We played hard and we made the stops we
needed to.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts right now after losing this game, when you look at
the season, losing in the first round?  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: I'm disappointed. I really thought we could have taken the
whole thing. We just have to play together. We have to play with energy. We
have to play for a full 40 minutes and we didn't do that today.  
  
Q. Deanna, looking at this team going forward, obviously pretty much
everyone is supposed to come back. What do you think about the potential?  
DEANNA WEAVER: I'm excited for that. Yeah, we'll have everybody back. We had a
lot of freshmen this year, underclassmen. I think we'll be able to make a lot
of improvements. Next year will be a really good year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. How tough was Dent in the second half?  
COACH PRESNELL: She was really active. She was that way at our place, too. We
felt like the shots she took, obviously they didn't fall as well. It kept
Woodward from shooting the ball. We knew she was going to attack us, but we'd
rather have her shooting than Woodward. She was 3 for 17 and Dent goes 9 for
20.  
  
Q. I know they did have 16 offensive rebounds to your five. How much of a
difference was that tonight?  
COACH PRESNELL: I thought they were aggressive early. Offensive rebounding,
like I said, is absolutely the key to rebounding‑‑ key to free throws in the
post area. Traditional posts don't go to the foul line like they used to. But
rebounding is the key. You get an offensive rebound, there's going to be some
contact.  
I thought they were very active, very aggressive, did a great job. They really
kicked us in that area of the game, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Foul trouble really sort of bit you tonight. How were you planning on
managing that? Did you foresee that being an issue?  
COACH PRESNELL: That's what Dent really hurt us with, was Jai [CK] got two
fouls right off the game. We decided right at the moment, if we can keep the
game within three to five, we wouldn't put her in for a third. We got it down
to one or two at half. We thought she would get rolling.  
She struggled with energy at the beginning of the second half. Then I thought
we kind of picked it up a little bit and hit a couple shots. We need to get
our momentum out of defense a little bit more, maybe not so much hitting
shots, that sort of thing.  
I'm really frustrated, I'm hurt for our team. Also we have four or five
freshmen, four or five sophomore and one junior. We get three kids back that
are hurt. I feel very positive about our season, our conference season, the
maturity of our kids. I think we'll have a very, very good program for sure.  
  
Q. Fouls, 18 to 8. Was that them getting more contact?  
COACH PRESNELL: At the end of the game, the last probably seven, eight
minutes, we just went motion and tried to attack them. That's the nature of
the game. But we should have done that a little bit sooner, a little bit
earlier.  
But I thought they really attacked us off the dribble every chance they got.
That's a change of pace for them over the course of the last few years.  
We have a traditional post in Miquelle, so it's hard to run that drill drive
all the time.  
  
Q. Toward the end of the game, you're down 10, less than three minutes left,
you have a chance to tie it, your thoughts on that stretch. The key play was
the steal, hitting the three.  
COACH PRESNELL: Dee was fatigued a little bit. We put Brit in there. She's
really active, she's a lot more athletic than people give her credit for.
She's quite an athlete. She picked off the ball, threw it to her sister, who
threw it to Jai. Then I think down to two, we called a timeout. We ran a
kick‑back to Dee. She got a good look at the basket. It would be interesting
if she hit that if the game changes at all.  
  
Q. Was there a hand on it?  
COACH PRESNELL: I couldn't see it. I asked. I felt like we got a pretty good
look at the basket and we were going to drive the lane as hard as we could. I
thought they executed that pretty well.  
But give Wyoming credit. They're extremely well‑coached. He's as good as there
is in the country. They came ready to play and they beat us. Obviously I feel
good about the 24 field goals, but they beat us offensive rebounding, yeah,
free‑throw line, too.  
  
Q. You mentioned looking ahead with who you have coming back. How do you
look at what you had to overcome losing the four seniors, having it end like
this? Can you look at the season and looking ahead to next year.  
COACH PRESNELL: It was hard losing the four seniors. We lost our starting
center 15 minutes into the first practice of the season to ACL. Obviously
Lexie I think is one of the premiere trail posts in the whole league, 11 and
7, 11 and 6. Just to lose that two weeks ago. She's kind of the glue of our
team. That was a very difficult loss.  
I thought Kayla stepped in and did a nice job. Kayla is five‑ten and plays a
little more three, and Lexie is six‑one. I'm excited about having those guys
back. Kinzi Poteet, Diana Lee. Then our whole team will be back. The whole
team will be back for two more years other than Deanna.  
I'm really proud of them. It's a hard loss. A hard loss for them. But Wyoming,
they just beat us at the point of attack in terms of rebounding. Yeah, should
have done a better job in that area.  
  
Q. What was your message to the team after the game?  
COACH PRESNELL: This loss needs to stick with us. It's a good season. It's a
really good season. It's a great conference season. If this loss will stick
with us in April, June, July, August when we need to be with our strength
coach and working. If we let this loss go, it won't be as good of a season as
we'd like.  
It's an amazing group of kids. It's the finest kids I've ever coached in terms
of values, academics. They're just a great group.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Nevada  53  
San Diego State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada. Coach, just some remarks on tonight's
game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: We're just glad to get a W. I thought that SanDiego State
played really hard. I don't know if y'all can tell from where you are sitting,
they're a big team. They're big, athletic, strong. It's so hard to rebound.  
In the first half we couldn't get many rebounds and we weren't able to run at
all. That was our game plan.  
We're normally a much better offensive team than we are defensive. But tonight
it proved to be the opposite.  
I thought our team defense on Cierra, she was one for eight. First team
all‑conference, I thought we doubled her, had a great game plan, and they
followed it. She is a dominant player. Trust me, we've watched her and she can
play, play, play.  
Really kind of sagged off I think their fatigue. We kept telling our players
if we could get to the last 10 minutes, we'd be all right.  
I think Mimi had seven blocks, which is one of the reasons she's co‑defensive
Player of the Year. Danika hit some tough shots in the first half, extended
it. In the second half we got to the free‑throw line. That's really where the
battle was won, with the free throws and our defense.  
We didn't shoot the ball well. It was just hard to find shots. They're just so
long and strong and big.  
I thought T‑Moe, when she was at point guard, started a run for us. I think we
got down by three. They got to the free‑throw line. As she can kind of will
things to happen, she did a really, really good job there.  
SanDiego State was in the championship game last year. The last three years
they kind of owned everything. For us to be picked 10th in the league, we only
played them once this year, I thought that would be an advantage, I don't
think it was much of an advantage tonight. They seemed to know what we were
going to do and take it away.  
I was really, really proud of our players. They found a way to win. It was a
very ugly basketball game. I know that. It probably looked like there weren't
a lot of shooters out there.  
We didn't make 11 threes. Last time we played them we made 11 threes. We made
five. That was the difference in the game if you look at it. We won by five
free throws in that, didn't we?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Danika, talk about what changed when Mimi came back in after her third
foul?  
DANIKA SHARP: Just her presence in the key is a huge factor for us. She is a
defensive threat. Like coach said, that's why she's co‑defensive Player of the
Year. We need her in there because she changes shots a lot.  
  
Q. Mimi, you picked up your third foul in the second half. How hard was it
to sit on the bench and fight?  
MIMI MUNGEDI: It was really hard. But I knew my teammate, we are a good team,
we stick together, which is one of our motto. I think that's what we did. I
was just encourage them, We can do it, let's go, let's go. We got it. So I was
pretty happy about it.  
  
Q. Talk about facing Fresno State in the semifinals and having two days off
to prepare.  
DANIKA SHARP: Well, obviously we know they're a great team. They're the No. 2
seed for a reason. But we split with them in the regular season, so we know we
can compete with them. We have to guard all their shooters because defense is
going to be a huge factor.  
MIMI MUNGEDI: I think we have to perform better on offense and defense to beat
them, to be honest. They're a really good team.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: They didn't have much trouble finding the basket today. We
watched that game. They're fun to watch, aren't they, unless you're coaching
against them. That's not a lot of fun.  
We'll come up with something. We don't have as big of bodies. I think we just
couldn't find the shots we normally can find. Hopefully we'll be able to find
some of those shots.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Last year you played in the opening game, won that. This year you find
yourself as the No.3 seed playing in the semifinals. If you had to pinpoint
one or two things, what has been the biggest turnaround for you?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: I think the off‑season was. It was our first year in the
Mountain West. Boy, what a difference it was. It was a lot of distance between
us and the other teams physically. I think Matt Barber, our strength coach at
the time, he's now at Maryland, and now Bubba, our kids committed to get in
the weight room. They're stronger, faster, more agile.  
They changed the NCAA rules. It was the exact perfect time for us because we
got 'em in the gym. They all elected to stay at summer school. We're fortunate
that we have administration who paid for them to be at summer school. We saw
them a lot.  
They paid their own money to go over to SanFrancisco and play in a ProAm game.
I think that probably helped Mimi the most of anybody. She got a lot of
minutes. Her team only had two post players. She had to play a lot.  
That's the first long answer, is the off‑season.  
My staff was tremendous in their player development.  
The other thing is the chemistry on this team. They're so unselfish. They get
along very, very well. They have given up any individual goal. We never had a
Player of the Week. I think we are the only team that never had one. I'm not
saying we should have.  
Our depth, you probably didn't see our depth tonight. We feel like our depth,
we can usually outscore the bench about 20 points. It was a little different
tonight because we played Mimi more minutes.  
I was thinking about this, our depth tonight almost hindered us a little
because everybody was nervous when they went in there. The second time they
all did well. You saw it in Nyasha at the very first of the game, we had a
little lead, she just gave it right to them, then fouled them.  
When you are doing that with a lot of people, we couldn't get the flow, so we
shortened the bench the second half. We'll get back to that probably when we
get to Fresno State.  
  
Q. Moving forward with the game against Fresno State, you split with them in
the regular season, what do you see as the keys to Friday's game? You played
them without Alex Sheedy and then with. How different are they?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: They're better with her, that's for sure. She just gives them
another player that can play three, four, five. They all play all positions.
They're really tough.  
But when all is said and done, we'll do the very best we can. They won the
tournament last year. It's a tough game. I mean, it's got to be a tough game,
doesn't it, when it comes down to the four teams.  
I think that Taylor Thompson, she's just such a heady point guard. They spread
the defense so wide. If there's a team that is exactly opposite to guard, then
SanDiego State who is inside, you can pack it in. Oh, my gosh, they're so
outside oriented. They could hit 20 threes in a game and it would just be easy
some nights.  
But they are not invincible. They've lost some games this year. We've got a
lot of tape, a lot of ideas. We're excited to have two days off to prepare for
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Cierra Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26589)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  6  
Air Force  56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State. Coach, just some general
thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH TERRY: Sure. Just really happy we got the victory tonight. I thought Air
Force came out and gave us a really good game.  
Their record does not reflect how good they are. I just want to give them so
much credit because they play hard and play everybody tough. I admire that
about that team.  
So excited for us to get the win, but thought we have a lot of things to
improve on. One thing I'm most proud of, we had 17 assists, which is huge for
us. We're playing shorthanded without a point guard. For us to take care of
the ball and share the ball like we did tonight is a good omen for us going
forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You were up 50 ‑42, Air Force scores three quick baskets about five
minutes to go. What is the mindset as you were in the timeout talking over the
strategy?  
KHRISTINA HUNTER: I think our mindset was just to stay calm and play harder.
It's win or go home, and we're not ready to go home yet.  
  
Q. Sometimes a natural tendency with a team like Air Force, their record,
teams can overlook them a little bit. Did you have any of those thoughts
coming into this game?  
KHRISTINA HUNTER: I don't want to say we overlooked them. I think we were just
nervous being here knowing that we're one‑and‑done. I think they came out as
hard as they could. We came out and we just got to pick it up for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Last year you entered as the heavy favorite coming into the tournament.
You made the championship game but fell short. Does that motivate at all
coming back this year and playing?  
CIERRA WARREN: I mean, I didn't play last year so I didn't actually get to
experience that.  
But just being there, I got to watch the last game, I knew we were a better
team, we want to get back to that spot and get the win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the offensive glass there the last few minutes. You
were strong. Was that a matter of you being a little bit more aggressive and
attacking the basketball in those situations?  
CIERRA WARREN: In the beginning they were boxing us out, keeping us away. We
knew we had to go to the board and score. That's how we win our games.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround going into tomorrow's game. Nevada got you the first
time going in. What are you going to look to do differently?  
COACH TERRY: I don't know if we're going to do a lot of things differently. We
just need to do some things harder. I don't think we played our best game up
there. Excited to have another shot at them.  
We need to rebound the ball. We need to rebound the ball better. We need to
take care of the ball to have an opportunity. We're shooting such a very high
percentage from the field, we shoot ourselves in the foot and turn ourselves
over.  
We didn't have opportunities to score. But they're a very good team and can
score a lot of different ways. They have bigs that can match up with our bigs.
They have guards that can shoot the ball and beat people off the bounce.
They're tough guards. We have to go back and prepare and give a good effort to
be competitive.  
  
Q. You're playing without a point guard right now. I thought your girls did
a good job of making the extra passes to get open looks. Is that something you
were working on in practice?  
COACH TERRY: Absolutely. Everybody knows how talented our bigs are. The two
that sat next to me are two of the best in the conference. Everyone knows that
we're going inside.  
Air Force did a great job taking that away. That being said, our guards were
patient, knocked down shots when they needed to. Chloe Johnson had seven
assists for us. She was amazing for us. If she can play steady like that,
we'll be good.  
You're right, we're playing point guard by committee. Khristina is a point
forward. We've made many references to Magic Johnson. They probably don't even
remember who that is, they're so young.  
Like I said, if we get a shot up, that's good for us. Our offense is offensive
rebounding and getting a second chance. They did a great job taking that away
from us tonight. We were very resilient, got some big boards down the stretch
that we needed to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH TERRY: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2014

  

### [Sara Halasz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20578)

### [Yvonne Sanchez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23329)

### [Deeva Vaughn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25001)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah State  69  
New Mexico  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with New Mexico. Coach, if we could start with some
general comments on today's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: You know, big game for the fans. Came down to the wire like our
last two games did. Again, just like the last couple games: we just didn't
finish it out.  
We had some really good performances by these two on my left, Sara and Deeva
Vaughn. We're going to miss them tremendously.  
It's just a tough game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sara, the first half, both sides shooting the ball well offensively. You
had the lead. Do you think the four ‑point lead they were able to convert
changed things at all? What do you feel the turning point was in the second
half for you guys?   
SARA HALASZ: We didn't come out the first four minutes ready to play. That's
been our Achilles' heel every game we've come into. I don't think the
four‑point play had anything to do with it. We just need to come out and
execute and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Deeva, you had the chance to tie late. Talk about that last play and the
look you were able to get.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: The last play of the game?  
  
Q. Yes.  
DEEVA VAUGHN: We were going to specifically go for a three‑point shot.
Communication didn't flow like it should have. That's pretty much what
happened.  
  
Q. Jennifer Schlott is a very focal point. How do you feel you were able to
deal with her defensively?  
DEEVA VAUGHN: I think that helped with us as post players coming up and just
giving false pressure, if you will, so she wouldn't drive all the way into the
gut of the court, if you will.  
I think we did a fairly decent job in the second half with that.  
  
Q. With the close games this season, that's been a recurring theme. To end
the season with a close loss, how tough has it been?  
DEEVA VAUGHN: For us as seniors, it's very tough. It was a pattern obviously.
But this is a whole different season. We started out 0‑0\. I felt like we were
trying our best to win. Close games, I mean, I don't even know how to answer
that question.  
SARA HALASZ: That's part of basketball. That's what you come out on the court
for, to play close games, have competition, have fun with it.  
In the long run, we just needed to come out and finish 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difficulties of guarding Schlott and the
difficulties she creates for you guys.  
COACH SANCHEZ: She's very talented. She's smart. She'll go left and mostly
score. She'll go right a few dribbles, three or four. She likes to go back
left.  
We know what she likes to do. She's still hard to guard. She's got an array of
moves. She's very smart. She does a good job.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed Utah State was focused on keeping you more
on the perimeter. The first half you were successful getting the ball down
low. Anything they were doing specifically that was keeping you from getting
the points in the paint?  
COACH SANCHEZ: They did a nice job of denying that high post. We just didn't
do a great job of passing the ball. We turned it over. That killed us the
first four minutes of the second half. We turn it over from the high post, we
turn it over from the short corner. We made just really errant passes when we
were converting those in the first half, we weren't as aggressive. Then we
settled for jump shots. Short corner was there, the dive was there, the high
post was there.  
It was still open. We just did a really poor job of finding it in the second
half, getting the ball to those people. You shoot 22% in the second half after
shooting 58% in the first half, that's a lot, because we settled for jump
shots instead of going inside.  
We went to the line 17 times in the first half, I think went seven in the
second half. That's attributed to us settling for shots instead of going
inside. We went away from what we wanted to do. We had four people in double
figures, which should have been enough.  
Credit Utah State, they did a terrific job, they really did.  
  
Q. Everybody knows about Schlott, how good she is scoring ‑wise. Bairstow
seemed to step up and one of the biggest games of her season.   
COACH SANCHEZ: She's a good player. For whatever reason, why she didn't have a
good game the last two times I'm not real sure because she's a really good
player.  
So she played the way I feel she can play. I mean, she hit some threes, she
hit some good shots, she's smart. We sent her to the line a few times. But she
hit a couple of really big shots when they needed to.  
Again, I mean, I don't know for Utah State, I just think she's a terrific
player. I wasn't real surprised. Williams, we held down a little bit. But I
think Bairstow is a fantastic player. I'm not surprised with what she did.
She's just good.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the last play.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Sure. We were running two up. We ran it a little bit
differently than we usually do to try to disguise it. Brea went a little bit
too soon and didn't let the screen get set.  
By the time she cut out, it was just a miss‑timed play. Still had ten seconds
left. We were trying to get a ball screen in there. It just didn't work out.
We just didn't take a very good shot there at the end.  
I told them, If we don't get the three right away, go in and get a quick two.
I think they might have panicked a little bit and jacked up the three. With 10
seconds left, you can get a quick two. You still have time for a foul, maybe
get a trap, a turnover. We just didn't get it done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  78  
San Jose State  75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with San Jose State. Coach, just some
general remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I think we played with a tremendous amount of effort. Our
lack of depth sometimes hurts us. A little bit of foul trouble. But I just am
really proud of my kids. I thought they stepped up, made big plays, especially
these two. They came up big and we came up a couple possessionis short.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rebecca, could you talk through the last minute. It was really
frenetic.  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: We were trying to get a three, and we weren't able to run
the play correctly. And it was tipped out of bounds. I mean, I don't really
have much else to say.  
It just didn't go as planned.  
  
Q. Classye, maybe describe what UNLV was trying to do defensively to you
guys in the second half.  
CLASSYE JAMES: I think that we really weren't probably taking advantage of our
open looks. I think we had the same looks in the second half that we did in
the first. They were overplaying our passing lane. I think if we would have
looked to back door, would have gotten a couple more looks.  
All in all, they had solid defense both first and second half.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's defensive play tonight.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, we were in the pressure matchup that we've been
running. I thought we were really active. Thought we missed a few box‑outs on
the backside, and it cost us.  
I was overall pleased with the effort defensively. A couple lapses at the end.  
  
Q. You play a very wide ‑open style, fast‑shot opportunities. That plays to
your strengths, but at times did it hurt you, too?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, I think it's hard to teach a team to play fast and then
to tell them to put the brakes on.  
I actually didn't tell them to put the brakes on. I felt like we got a little
tight and tentative, maybe playing to not lose a game that we hadn't won yet.  
We take shots. Becca Woodberry takes open threes. She shot some early open
threes in the shot clock, but they were still wide‑open, so it's a good shot.
A kit who has hit 80‑some threes on the season. I thought the key for us was
that we got into foul trouble.  
Jasmine Smith, 15 minutes, five fouls. It really limits us in what we can do.  
  
Q. Now that you've wrapped up your first full season on the job at San Jose
State, how do you feel the girls handled your system this year, things you
liked that they did?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Well, I think we put about half the system in. We need some
depth to be able to do what I really want to do defensively. I'm really
excited about who we have coming back, the kids we have sitting on our bench
as redshirts.  
We're going to go faster than we did this year. You'll see an up‑tempo style.
I'm really excited. I thought they embraced me and what we were trying to do
and showed a lot of maturity in that, so I was very proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  63  
Air Force  56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force. Coach, just some general thoughts on
tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's the best game we played all year. It was great team
energy, effort, focus from the tip with our scouting report, what we wanted to
do. Especially the short turnaround.  
I was proud of how they came out both halves. It's usually been the story of
us, one half better than the other. Puts us in the hole, where we're up and
can't sustain. Good to have that team energy and focus and execution tonight.
No better place than the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jimi, you were able to tie the score at 50 late in the second half. What
was the confidence level when you were able to tie the score?  
JIMI BLAGOWSKY: I think at that point we knew they were going to go on runs
and we were going to go on runs. We were able to make another run back at
them.  
Then we thought the focus was there, the energy was there. Then we just, you
know, couldn't get them off the boards. They were able to make another run. It
was a little too late for us to make a final push to get back and beat 'em,
so...  
  
Q. If you could talk about the rebounding advantage SanDiego State had
towards the end.  
JIMI BLAGOWSKY: We knew that was going to be one of our main focuses coming in
with the height disadvantage. We did one of the best jobs we did all season in
rebounding and keeping them off the boards. Just kind of let up a little bit,
couldn't get them off, couldn't push them back. Just one of those things. Game
of inches. Just a couple inches here and there.  
  
Q. Camille, this has to be a tough season for you, not a lot of victories.
What was the mindset coming into the tournament? Was it loose, positive?  
CAMILLE THOMPSON: We were really positive. Our mindset going into the
tournament was 0‑0\. It was a close game, our last home game, we knew we could
beat this team. We had a very positive attitude. We were ready to give it our
all and give everything it took to win.  
  
Q. Talk about defending Cierra Warren from SanDiego State?  
CAMILLE THOMPSON: We were in a sagging 2‑3 on the defensive end. We were
concentrating on her as well as other posts, packing in the zone, not letting
them throw it in.  
That was basically our mindset, do everything we could, push back for her not
to be able to score and take away her feet as well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The last few minutes, SanDiego State taking over the glass, was that
something about them being more aggressive or the ball bouncing their way?  
COACH WILLIAMS: They're big and they're going to come at you. That's part are
their mindset and that's their game. They miss a shot, they're going again.
They're very athletic.  
They went on a run, second‑chance points hurt us. Rebound put‑back. They're
terrific athletes. Cierra Warren is phenomenal. All‑league player.  
Again, our kids battled, fought back. One of our focuses was rebounding and
trying to make it closer than it has been than before, try not to give up. You
know they're going to come after you, it's tournament time.  
  
Q. You mentioned the battle and fight of the team. How proud were you they
were able to stick with it for all 40 minutes?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, definitely proud. I'm proud of them. They were fun
to coach all year, although it doesn't translate into wins and losses that
way. We've had different people different times of the year not with a full
till of 15 players. So who is going to show up this time?  
We're going to need our big two to score for us to be in a game. The first
half against Boise, those two didn't score. You can imagine what our offense
is going to be.  
For them to refocus, short turnaround, tournament time. These seniors were
part of the group that won the first games three years ago. They tried to
reiterate that to the freshmen that that can be done and set that legacy for
them.  
It was good to see. It was great energy, effort, focus for the 40 minutes, the
two halves, what we needed to do all year, able to get Ashton Williams back on
the floor after being injured. Again, Missy Byrd trying to be another
rebounding force for us.  
They didn't quit. The energy, focus and positivity is great. It's a great
locker room that we have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  78  
San Jose State  75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV. Coach, just some opening comments on
tonight's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, we knew San Jose State was going to be a really tough
matchup. They're just so explosive. They were shooting the three ball well
this evening, which was a little scary, but I thought we had some key stops
down the stretch and made our free throws. That was pretty much the difference
of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Mia, you went to the line with those three free throws, made one. When
you went back to the line to make the two critical shots, how were you able to
put that out of your mind?  
MIA BELL: Really, the two I missed, they both went in and out. It wasn't like
in my mind, Oh, God, I have to make these two free throws. I wanted this game.
That's all I was thinking about. Take your time and make them. And I did.  
  
Q. Right after you took the lead, you had that key steal down at the other
end. Talk about what you saw and the importance of that play.  
MIA BELL: I saw opportunity, but I just felt like I had to go for it. It was
now or never. I kind of just had to go for it, so I just went for it.  
In a couple plays, I threw the ball to Dani. I screamed her name. She saw me.
I tipped it to her. Okay, we're good. It was a heads‑up play by her to begin
the play.  
  
Q. Just prior to the steal, you were relentless. You could see it in your
eyes. There was a lot of determination there. You yelled, Switch, switch, you
were slapping your hands, getting on your teammates. From the start of that
play to the steal coming back down, take us through that.  
MIA BELL: When you look up at the scoreboard and you need one stop, I think
you kind of feel it. You kind of feel the urgency of the entire play. I
definitely felt that.  
It was like we get this stop, we can live to fight another day. If we don't
get this stop, we go home heartbroken. I didn't want to feel that feeling. I
felt that before. Didn't want to feel it again.  
  
Q. Aley, you have a large ice pack on your shoulder there. Tell us about how
much pain you're in, what the injury is, how you were able to go out there and
make all six of your field goal attempts.  
ALEY ROHDE: Well, I mean, as far as we know it's torn, so it's pretty painful.
But I'm at the point, right now, what Mia said, you got to live to fight
another day or you're done.  
I already have surgery set up, why not go for it. Already going under the
needle, so might as well do what I can.  
COACH OLIVIER: She was finishing, too. At the right place, at the right time.
Big target and finished everything for her teammates.  
  
Q. Dani, talk about the determination you had to make the basket off the
layup, then the two free throws.  
DANIELLE MILLER: Well, me and Mia had communication where I thought she wanted
to get the ball in transition. I thought she wanted to make the layup. I guess
we kind of, you know, had like a miscommunication at the end of that play.  
Fortunately they didn't box me out on the weak side. I was fortunate to be in
the right place to be able to have that basket.  
Basically I'm just feeding off of Mia the entire time. Like she stated
earlier, I was in the right place at the right time almost three or four
possessions within that game.  
I'm just feeding off the captain's defense and go for it at the end of that
game. We both felt that feeling together of not being able to play in the
second round of the conference, you know, just being in that locker room for
this 30 minutes right now not feeling great. We just wanted to really be able
to be here right now, live to fight another day, so...  
  
Q. Mia, I've talked to you a lot about how important these tournament games
are, your senior year. How important and how much does this win mean to you?  
MIA BELL: It's a huge win for us as a team. I love these guys. I love our
coaches. I love our team. I feel like we have a very good team.  
We just get another chance to show how good we can be. We know we have things
we can get better at for tomorrow. We'll do that. We'll come out and be even
better.  
For me it's just another chance to keep playing and having those four letters
across my chest. Nothing better than that.  
  
Q. They hit you with two big runs. How were you able to gather yourselves
both times and hang in there?  
ALEY ROHDE: I mean, I think it's just kind of what we've been playing. Like we
know that if we lose, we're done for the season. No one wants to be done at
this point. We've been knocked out of the first round the last couple years.
Like, we didn't want to deal with that again. Sit in the locker room for 30
minutes, hearing them cheering, us down.  
You have to keep yourself together. Basketball is a game of runs. It's going
to happen. It's inevitable. As long as you keep yourself together, work as a
team, don't do all for one, then you'll take care of the business you're
trying to take care of.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What did you tell the players when they were knocking down all those
threes as far as weathering the storm?  
COACH OLIVIER: It was interesting 'cause when you asked that, I was going to
jam in.  
They were on fire. They were hitting their threes. We weren't. I don't think
we hit one three in the first half. I knew if we could get a hand up, contest
their threes, making sure we were doing all we could to contest their threes,
we could get the rebound and try to fast break a little, get on a fast run. I
thought we did at the end of the first half. We needed to do that because we
weren't making our shots.  
We needed to get our easy buckets. Our easy buckets come by our defense. When
Danielle and Mia were talking about being in the right place at the right
time, they're active. They're very long, have great defensive positioning.
When they play defense like that, their defense and our defense creates our
offense. I thought we did a good job of that during that run.  
We just kept talking to them about getting stops and really doing all you can
defensively and we'll get some easy buckets on the other end.  
  
Q. Was it harder to weather that or once you finally caught them they hit
you with another run?  
COACH OLIVIER: I mean, they're an explosive team. They made me nervous from
the very get‑go when I saw that's who we were going to play. I thought, Oh,
gosh. Jamie does a really good job. She has them doing that system, push, push
and push. They look like they can play another game right now. They know the
shots that they're going to get.  
So for us, it was more of just staying disciplined defensively, making sure we
match up better. The first half we played more zone. I don't know how smart
that was on my part. Second half we played more man. We could match up easier
in transition. That to me was what the difference in the game was.  
I thought Réjane was the difference in the game, too. When she came in I
thought she immediately changed the ballgame. We were just more in attack
mode. I thought that was big, too.  
Then Aley, she came in and made some things happen. But Réjane for me was the
one that made the difference offensively.  
Defensively I thought there were several of them. Again, when we play good D,
our offense clicks a little better.  
  
Q. Considering they hit 11 threes, did you consider on their last possession
fouling them?  
COACH OLIVIER: No. I don't do that. I get nervous about that. I don't like
giving teams opportunities to put points on the board.  
I'm going to be honest. It crossed my mind. I thought, Oh, I'm not even going
to go there. Our team was dialed in to get a stop. We really talked about just
getting a hand up, contesting everything without fouling. If they're going to
take it to the basket, let them go, don't even think about an and one.  
We were dialed in at the end. In the beginning, you have to know, these
players are great people. They want to win so much. They want to do whatever
it takes. They almost try to do too much. I think that's what Aley was saying.
Everyone was trying so hard that it's counterproductive.  
We finally simmered down, settled down a little bit and things went our way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about ending this dry spell in the first game of this
tournament. Do you feel more joy or relief?  
COACH OLIVIER: I mean, again, I say this to my family. I don't really talk
about it to other people. But I just think that we have a good basketball
team. I keep saying, I don't get it. I don't get it. I feel like we're 13‑18\.
I have to look down because I completely don't even want to look at that.  
I feel strongly that this team can beat anyone. I know that we just haven't
played consistent. When we're all on the same page, striving for that one
goal, that same goal, we're a much better team.  
I thought we did that the last five minutes. We were just playing together. It
was Lady Rebel basketball. I don't think they're selfish. I don't think people
are gunning. It's a different kind of, I want to do this so bad, I'm trying to
do it for so many reasons. It's just counterproductive.  
We try to kind of just, again, settle them down. When we did that, we played
Lady Rebel basketball and it was much better.  
  
Q. The officials called it really tight on both ends in the second half. Did
you make the decision to take advantage of that and see if you could get to
the line as much as you could?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, it made me a little nervous. I mean, they've been doing
that all year. It's nothing new. I think that's what the game emphasis has
been all season. We've been very smart about it. We've done a good job of us
attacking the basket, not allowing other teams to get to the free‑throw line.  
That's why I like to go zone. I don't like to get all those fouls. But we
really had to pick up the tempo defensively and go man. Thank goodness we
didn't file.  
Danielle, her offense is created by her defense. So she was getting after on
the break. I just thought Mia did a good job attacking when she needed to,
getting Alana open shots, Réjane, Aley open shots when she needed to. She has
such a good feel for tempo.  
When we do a little bit of both, that's when we're a good basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH OLIVIER: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah State  69  
New Mexico  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State. Coach, just some general comments
on today's game.  
COACH FINKBEINER: I think on paper going into this game, looking at all the
first‑round matchups and possible second‑round matchups, I thought this game
would be the closest one probably played in the next 48 hours just because the
two games we played this year against New Mexico were all five‑point wins and
a two‑point win. My biggest objective was to convince the girls if you beat
them twice, you can beat them a third time.  
I really like the way we kind of grinded it out. I knew it was going to be a
tough matchup. There's some reason our two teams, our two programs cancel each
other out in some key positions. I thought these two here obviously came
through for us and put us over the hump.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense you played in the second half.  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: I thought we really clamped down, especially on the
defensive boards. We got a couple really good ones. I thought our effort was
just key, though. We really just knew where the shooters were. We talked
through some things. It was great.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the last play. You were defending the three ball
they were trying to get.  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Yeah. Well, we knew they needed a three. We didn't want to
give up anything. But we just switched everything, kept our hands up really.
That's about it.  
  
Q. Stephanie, can you talk about your game today. You've been finishing
strong lately. Had a good game at Wyoming.  
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: I feel pretty good about today, the way that I played. I
think I came out and did what I needed to do, took the shots that I wanted to
take, yeah.  
  
Q. Talk about Mak's four ‑point play at the end.   
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: That was huge for us, really, really big. We were sort of
getting down on momentum. We came out the second half with that good feeling
that that brought.  
  
Q. Jen, talk about Stephanie's play.  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Steph was huge tonight. She made some really good shots. I
thought her one face‑up jumper towards the end was huge. It was a big‑time
shot. It's just what we expect from her. She's a great player. She's just
going to do this night in and night out, I think.  
  
Q. Let us in in terms of the short turnaround time for tomorrow's game, how
you get ready for tomorrow's game.  
JENNIFER SCHLOTT: Well, we played them twice. We know them. They know us.  
But, yeah, just watch film. Just try and focus up really. We know what we have
to do. They know what they have to do.  
But I think it's just taking all that energy we had from this win and just
bringing it to the next.  
STEPHANIE BAIRSTOW: Yeah, I think we're just going to go home, get some good
food, get some good sleep tonight because it is a very quick turnaround. Come
out ready to play tomorrow.  
We know we can do it, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. New Mexico had 17 first ‑half field goals, then you cut that down to six
for them. What was different with your defense in the second half?  
COACH FINKBEINER: You know, first of all, we're very inconsistent defensively.
We don't know what defense is going to work from one game to another game.
Sounds like bad coaching, and it may be. But we went to several different
defenses.  
I thought New Mexico had a free spirit about the game. They just let 'em fly.
They surprised us with attacking the basket in the full court against us.
That's what really surprised us.  
We were just playing on the defensive the whole game. The second half, we told
our girls at halftime, sit in a 2‑3 zone and match straight up, let's just
kind of collectively gather our breath here a little bit and try to slow the
game down a little bit.  
Then I think, too, like Stephanie said, that four‑point play at the end of the
half really helped us. We were struggling I think emotionally even, just kind
of questioning some things.  
When Mak hit that four‑point play, instead of eight, we're down by four. Like
Steph said, we had a new lease on life. We realized, Hey, let's go attack, and
defensively let's try to get a little more stability about us, protect the
basket better. Because I thought New Mexico did a good job out of the gate
attacking the basket from both the full‑court and the half‑court offense.  
Consequently we got a lot of free throws, too, the first half. So we just
controlled defensively, slowed the ball down defensively. I think that kept
them off the free‑throw line and gave us a better chance to get rebounds, too.  
  
Q. We hear a lot about Jen and Mak because they put up a lot of points. Talk
about Elise Nelson and the hustle play she makes for you and the difference it
makes in the game.  
COACH FINKBEINER: Good question. Elise, when the conference awards came out
this week, we knew Jen was up there in stats, exposure. I was keeping my
fingers crossed. The eighth‑placed seed we still get the MVP out of it,
because she's that good.  
The crazy thing about Elise Nelson is she's that good defensively. I really
appreciate the coaches in the league recognizing that. It's almost Elise kind
of covers for Jen defensively, and Jen kind of covers for Elise offensively.
We have a pretty good package there.  
Elise is a two guard, but we play her as a three because we need defense in
the back line. She's typically our leading rebounder every night. She was
tonight also. Just a strong kid that has a lot of character, a lot of fiber
about her.  
That's a good combo. Jen is our poster girl and Elise is our blue‑collar in
the back line. I was happy for Elise this week to get that all‑defensive award
as I was Jen being the MVP of the conference. They cover each other.  
  
Q. Talk about Stephanie's play tonight.  
COACH FINKBEINER: I joke with Stephanie. She's my first recruit to Utah State.
I've got a little bit of a protectiveness over here, a little bit of pride,
just kind of a mentoring, you know, thing about her. She's a good player.
She's kind of fought through some things this year, questioned herself last
summer. She lives in her brother Cameron's shadow. I've been joking with her a
lot lately. Play a little bit more like Cameron, Steph, and you'll be okay.  
She hit her stride six games ago. We played good ball the last six games,
seven tonight. I think you'll see this is the Stephanie Bairstow of the
future. She's an inside‑ out girl. We'll work on her foot speed this spring
and summer. Motivated. Her big brother is her idol. If I ever want to
challenge Steph, I say, What would Cameron do? Her eyes really brighten up.
Sometimes she tears up a little bit. I don't use it to make her feel guilty, I
just know that's her idol.  
Steph being an inside‑out player, that's a valuable commodity in the men's or
women's game. Stephanie, you saw a little bit tonight, what we're going to
feature next year. It's going to be the Mak and Stephanie show offensively.
They're both starting to get it, both being sophomores.  
  
Q. What is the message you'll give to the team for tomorrow?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Good question. I told this 20 minutes ago, We have to play
the best game of the year tomorrow. We have 22 hours to rest up, prepare, get
after them.  
Colorado State, they're the best team in the conference. They beat us easily
both games. We're just going to have to play really well. Jen is going to have
to get hers, Steph is going to have to get hers, Mak is going to have to get
more than hers.  
We're going to approach it the same as New Mexico today. We want to go up and
down, score points, run, gun and have fun. Don't count us out. But at the same
time we're realistic, we have to play our best game of the year tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH FINKBEINER: Thanks.

## March 25, 2014

  

### [Asya Bussie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20577)

### [Christal Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24894)

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  76  
West Virginia  67

  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, congratulations to LSU. I told our players for two
days, the game is going to be won or lost in the paint. You can't give up 24
offensive rebounds. We quit getting the ball inside, and we had it going the
second half, got the lead, and quit going inside. You know, but I'm proud of
our players. They had a heck of a year, won 30 basketball games. We felt like
we gave one away here today. But congratulations to LSU.  
  
Q. I know that obviously 40 minutes is what you guys preached your entire
year, but those four minutes at the end is when Coach Carey said he wanted you
to the in the game. What went wrong in those Final Four minutes that you
allowed the lead to go away and lose the game?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think we lost our focus. We weren't defending the way we were
and not executing the way that we were to get into the game. I just think down
the stretch we didn't do the things that we were supposed to do.  
  
Q. Obviously the people that you probably scouted to play were absent a
large part of the game, Shanece, Theresa and Jeanne. Did that in any way
affect your preparation?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I don't think so, regardless of who was on the floor we
should have defended. We've seen different things all year long so I don't
think anything they put at us was anything different, we just stopped
defending and we stopped boxing out on the boards.  
BRIA HOLMES: Like Christal said, I think we just should have stepped up and
playing defense and boxed out and not allowed the offensive rebounds that they
had.  
  
Q. Asya, Ballard had 32 rebounds in the two NCAA tournament games this year.
Have you ever played against a guard her size who was able to rebound like
that?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Not that I can remember, but she did get a lot of rebounds, ones
that we should have had, and I think that might have been the difference in
the game, just having the guards coming in and crashing not only the post,
their guards were coming in, also.  
  
Q. A lot was made of having to play LSU on their home floor as a 2 seed. How
much of a difference do you think it made, especially late in the game as the
crowd was really getting into it?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Regardless of where we play, we just have to play our game and
execute and defend, and down the stretch we didn't do that, and I think that
towards the end the crowd did get into the game and hyped the players up, and
that might have been a factor, also.  
  
Q. Christal, talk about as a senior what was it like to go back into the
locker room as a senior? What is this moment like for you?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I hate it. Just to know that we lost the game‑‑ you're
going to lose some ballgames, but I know just deep down in my heart that we
did not play our best game and we did not do some of the things I've seen us
do all year long that I know that we can do, and just to go out like that, it
really hurts.  
But at the same time we've done really well this year, and we've had some
great accomplishments, so you can't get down on yourself too much. Right now
it's still fresh, and it hurts.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Same. This game really hurts. We definitely didn't want to lose
like this. We planned on going a lot further than this. But regardless, I'm
really proud of the team and everything we've accomplished this year.  
  
Q. Christal, you were shooting something like 3 of 18 or 19 or something
like that. Is it an off ‑night, or were they doing something to help that out?
  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I just didn't hit shots, and I feel like I rushed a couple,
probably took some bad shots. But at the end of the day I just didn't make
them.  
  
Q. Coach, they were talking about the defensive effort, but I'm saying the
last three minutes you guys went almost without a score at any point. What
were they doing defensively to stop your offense?  
MIKE CAREY: We took some bad shots. When we took the lead and went up by I
think six or seven, we were getting the ball inside, and then all of a sudden
we turned it over some and we took some bad perimeter shots, and we weren't
hitting them. And then the turnovers. We had turnovers off our foot and stuff
like that, and then I think when it started down there, that one possession,
they were down there for‑‑ I think we had two fouls and they got two offensive
rebounds, and I think they were down there until they finally scored.  
We just quit rebounding. We went to a zone. We just quit rebounding. And then
on the offensive end, we were having success going inside, and it's hard to
tell some of your good players that are wide open on the perimeter not to take
the shot. They've hit them all year, and we just didn't hit shots, but again,
we've got to be smart enough to go inside. Asya was just dominating inside the
second half.  
  
Q. Similarly to what I just asked Asya, those final four minutes, you guys
had talked about that coming into this one. Was it as simple as getting away
from what was working with Asya doing so well on the inside, getting fouls,
getting to the free ‑throw line?   
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think we got away from getting the ball inside on the
offensive end, and on the defensive end we quit boxing out. It was as simple
as that. We started fouling and putting them at the foul line and not boxing
out and giving them second and third shots. They got a couple and‑ones. It
just kept going. We just didn't box out. It's obvious, they had 24 offensive
rebounds. It's hard to beat somebody. And then they had 38 points in the
paint. I mean, I said coming in two days ago, the game was going to be won or
lost in the paint, and that's exactly where it was.  
  
Q. And regarding the seniors, just how difficult it is to see them go out?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, it's tough right now because I feel we gave one away there.
And again, give LSU‑‑ nothing against LSU, they deserve a lot of credit. But I
just felt we gave one away. Seniors have done a great job since they've been‑‑
not just this year, since they've been here. So I'm very proud of them, it's
just tough right now for them and myself.

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  76  
West Virginia  67

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: This is one of those moments that as a fan and a coach, a
spectator, that you honestly can say this is one of the hardest fought games
between two very good teams, and a lot of credit to West Virginia for really
pushing the envelope as far as pushing us to our limits, and a lot of credit
to these young ladies for answering that call.  
You know, we give out a game ball and I want to give one to every our of
games, but the game ball obviously went to Jasmine Rhodes. I can't say enough
about when you have a player step up and make huge contributions, and Jasmine
did that for us tonight.  
  
Q. Danielle, would you say you played your two best games of the season here
in the NCAA Tournament? You had 46 points and 32 rebounds combined in the two
games. How much did you feel like you had to carry the team with Jeanne hurt
and Theresa and Shanece in foul trouble?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, I felt like since Jeanne was out, I felt like that we
as a team had to step up, especially me being one of the scorers on the team.
I felt like I needed to get to the hole or just get a wide‑open shot for my
teammates. There was a lot of pressure, a little bit, because I'm used to
having Jeanne talking a lot on the court and just directing us in offense and
defense. It was kind of tough, but we played through it.  
  
Q. Theresa, what was going through your head when you got the fourth foul? I
mean, honestly were you at all worried or upset knowing that this was your
last home game and possibly your last game ever?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: What was going through my head was that if I really wanted
to get a foul, I would actually make them pay for the foul and not have little
ticky‑tack fouls.  
Going in, I haven't really been a player that fouled much and I got into foul
trouble and so did Shanece, but I wasn't really worried. There was a sense of
calmness going through our bench. We just had stability. We weren't the
biggest lineup out there, but those are some of the girls that fight the
hardest, and we had a lot of people step up. Jas did a great job the second
she got in. I get a deflection, Jas grabs it and takes it the full length of
the court for a bucket. That was a very quick turnaround play. We just have a
lot of great team camaraderie. I wasn't worried. I was disappointed in myself
for not being able to contribute more, but my teammates did a great job
tonight, especially Danielle Ballard stepping up to the challenge and being
Danielle Ballard, doing what she does best.  
  
Q. Danielle, seemed like there was a little bit of frustration when West
Virginia took a lead late. How did you overcome that?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yes, we were just saying like stay together, don't get
discouraged, just play hard, keep playing hard, keep trying to rebound and do
all the little things. We tried to have energy, talked about energy, because
at first we saw that we didn't have energy on the court because our back was
against the wall. But in the huddle we were saying some positive things.
That's what got us going.  
  
Q. Jas, is this one of the situations where you're just kind of too young to
really know what's at stake? You were really selling out for almost all the
balls. You were really kind of the spark plug there for a while. Is it one of
those situations where the situation didn't overwhelm you?  
JASMINE RHODES: No, not really. I mean, I knew what was at stake, and coach
always said that it's tournament time, so someone is going to have to step up,
so I just answered the call like she said and I played my best and my
teammates definitely encouraged me to keep going even when I messed up. It was
a team win, and I'm proud of what we did out there, so it was great.  
  
Q. Theresa, this was a game of runs. Can you just talk specifically about
the run that ended the game? What was your team doing so efficiently?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We were just doing the little things. It started really
earlier in the season. We worked with the Marines and we went through their
obstacle course one time and we were all dead tired after that first one and
then they sprung on us that we had to go through the entire obstacle course
all again. Our times the second time through were better than our first time
because we dug deep and we just had that extra effort in us. Coming into this
game, we just have to dig deep and find that extra effort.  
The play from our guards stepped up tremendously. At one point our two biggest
people on the court were Anne Pederson and Sheila Boykin, who may be 6'0" and
going against 6'4", 6'5" guard lineup that's 6' even with them. Just the heart
of our team was so strong tonight and we were all beating as one, and it
really showed in that last run. We just didn't want to give it up, and it was
on our home court, and our home crowd really pulled us through, as well.  
  
Q. Jasmine and Danielle, when you looked over and saw Theresa and Shanece on
the bench, was there a sense to keep our seniors' season alive?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Absolutely because me personally I didn't want the season to
end for them because they are seniors, but I felt like we have to play hard
and tougher, we have to play hard and think smart at the end of the game. I
give credit to Jasmine. She did her thing. She had‑‑ the reason why it was
like help plays, she come in here rebounding and scoring, doing all the little
things, so that just kind of pumped us up even more.  
JASMINE RHODES: I definitely agree with her. I think that we definitely hit
adversity like in the middle of the game and we kind of started losing a lot,
going down a lot I mean, and I think we came together more after we hit
adversity. We just wanted to play hard for them and for the fans, for the
coaches, everyone.  
  
Q. Theresa, I know you all want this season to continue, but do you see a
little bit of a passing of the torch to some of the younger girls assuming
those roles?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yes, most definitely. When your upperclassmen go out, there
was a sense of urgency from the underclassmen. They really stepped up to the
challenge. It's nothing that was of any shock to any of us. We knew they could
handle it. They handle it every single day at practice. So you know, at
tournament time, like Jas said, somebody is going to have to step up and face
that challenge, and we hit adversity tonight, and I was very proud of our
underclassmen for really stepping in there and picking up where Shanece and I
and Jeanne really left off. Credit to them, they just did an amazing job
tonight, and we wouldn't be moving on if it weren't for our underclassmen.  
  
Q. Jasmine, I hate to give away a good stat here, but you had as many points
tonight as you had minutes in the last five games. How hard is it to stay
ready when you're not getting as much game action, or is it easy just being
able to go out there and practice every day?  
JASMINE RHODES: I mean, it's neither hard nor easy. You've just got to stay
ready. Coach puts you out there, you've just got to do what you're called to
do. I might not have that scoring role or that fantastic role, but I go out
there and I hustle and I try to do things that other people can't on the floor
at the time, and I try to pump my team up. It's a win‑win situation, I guess.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Can I add to that?  
  
Q. Sure, honestly you can.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Jasmine Rhodes is one of the hardest working players I've
ever seen, and her minutes haven't been as great, but she has greatness in
her. Every single day of practice she comes in and works as hard as possible,
and that's something that's hard to do. I've been in Jas's shoes before. My
freshman year I wasn't seeing the court, and that's where I didn't step up and
I wasn't the big person that Jas is. I stopped working hard. I just thought it
was a hopeless cause. I just found no hope in it, and Jas really sticks to it
and does everything that's expected of her. She always does the little things
for us, rebounding. I've never seen a guard, besides Danielle, that crashes
the board every single time and gets and‑ones like Jas does. She's an amazing
player, and she has a lot of potential. She's growing every day. She did a
great job today.  
  
Q. Danielle, tell me what was maybe going through your mind when you slammed
the ball off the floor at the end? Seemed like kind of a punctuation to two
big performances?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: What was going through my mind was we did it again. I was so
excited. I was like, yes. All my frustration went out on the ball. That's the
reason why I really throwed it down, I was so angry at the referees
(laughter).  
But that was just a happy moment. I did that one time in the year. Playing in
this game, we made it to the Sweet 16 again. It was just a joyful moment and
it was just exciting.  
  
Q. I suppose with five SEC teams moving on, it validates what you said about
a tough schedule and maybe your record not reflecting what kind of team you
were going to be in the tournament?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Right. I feel like the SEC is one of the toughest or the
toughest conference in the country. By showing how many teams are moving on
just is a testament to that. The SEC, really when you're going against team
after team, top‑25 teams, anybody can win on any given night. Even the people
that are at the bottom of the SEC, they would give out tough games every
single night. There wasn't a game that you would go into and you would go,
this is a win like you don't have to worry about it. Every single game is a
battle. Every single game is a fight. Just six teams moving on out of one
conference, I think eight made it out of the SEC. That statistic is
incredible. I'm proud to be a part of the SEC, and it's a tough conference to
play in.  
THE MODERATOR: We have a statement from Jeanne Kenney. "I'm so proud of the
heart, the fight, the determination and courage shown by my teammates tonight.
Forever LSU."  
  
Q. Do you have any information on Jeanne's status? Was it a concussion? Do
y'all have any idea?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, at this moment I don't know, but I will tell you that we
will be very cautious in moving forward with Jeanne Kenney due to the fact of
the history of concussions. So at this moment I don't know exactly what her
status is.  
  
Q. When you lose someone, not just a shooter like Jeanne but an emotional
leader like her, how does that change up the game plan going forward?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You look at your team and you reassure them that they're still
ready and they can still come away with a win. Your strategy doesn't change,
how hard you want your team to play, do the little things, hustle plays,
making sure that we're pushing tempo. When we have numbers, that doesn't
change.  
I think something that stirs up in them as players, though, when you lose a
leader, and they chose to dig a little deeper and give a little more for
Jeanne because she's been just that for them for a long time, and I think
that's what made the difference. I think that's why you've got Danielle
Ballard able to say, hey, I've got to do more, even though my partner here in
JK is out I've got to do more. You had players step up, and that's a testament
to the relationship and the friendship that Jeanne has developed amongst her
teammates.  
  
Q. This may be wild speculation, but from the outside it would appear that
you had three known commodities in your seniors and you added some talent this
year that was maybe a challenge to mesh throughout the year. It would seem
that you've come together in the postseason. Could you talk about if that's
true and how proud are you that these young girls were able to rise to the
occasion?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we have a core coming back after losing Adrienne Webb
and Bianca Lutley, and we brought in a class that is by far one of the hardest
working classes that I've been affiliated with in all of my coaching. They
would finish one, two and three, that's Rina, Jas and Ray, in all the sprint
work. Everything that you want from a student‑athlete, they exemplify it, and
they're so mature.  
And so to bring them in with the returning veteran squad, it was just going to
be a matter of time where everybody's role was going to be defined and
everybody would accept that maybe a lot of the limelight will be shifted to
some of these younger players. So we bought in, and we've done so, and I'm
extremely proud of this team for realizing how great they can be, and they've
shown time and time again, although our record did not reflect it, that they
could play and potentially beat some of the best teams in the country.  
This is a great victory for so many reasons, not just for our seniors, but
it's an amazing feeling as a first year, and Jasmine Rhodes is never going to
forget this moment, and she will carry it with her for the rest of her career.
I'm extremely proud of our team for staying the course and not allowing
adversity to just separate us. If anything it brought us closer together.  
  
Q. Was there a time when you reminded the team of last year's team and how
y'all were able to fight the adversity? You were down to one bench player. Did
any doubt ever creep into your mind at any point?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No. You know, I didn't even talk to them about last year. I
talked to them about taking in the atmosphere right now, feeling the energy
that's in this building with the fans, making sure that they understand that
this game is going to be won, and it's going to be won because it may not show
up in the stat sheet, it's going to be won in a quiet way but in a ferocious
way. We talked about that in timeouts, how we would be able to win this game.  
They played like that. There were little glimpses of it, whether it was a hard
cut or a hustle play back on the defensive end. It was just little things, and
as a competitor, you could see that the momentum was starting to shift in our
way, and the momentum started to change because they started to make it
happen. They did it through their play.  
But our huddles were tighter. After a free throw was made, you could see them
all go up and just touch each other. Our bench energy was unbelievable, and
even when there were calls made against us, our kids still stayed the course.
They didn't go crazy, even though I know they felt they wanted to. They just
stayed the course, so that's a sign of a team that's very mature and a team
that felt as though this is still a game for us to pull out if we just do
these small things.  
  
Q. Talking about Rina, she didn't get a lot of playing time late in the SEC,
17 minutes. Is tonight one of the best games for her?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You know, Rina has been one of those players that had started
for us early on. She had some great games then. She also had a tremendous game
here at our home against Tennessee. I thought she played with a lot of just
confidence, and as a freshman you've got to have your ups and downs, but when
her number was called tonight she answered it, and she was fearless out there,
and she played with a lot of courage. She did not play‑‑ she nor Jasmine,
neither one of them played like freshmen tonight, so extremely proud to have
Rina a part of our family, and I know there's going to be great things in
store for her.  
  
Q. I know this game just happened, but compared to last year's, the drama of
last year's win over Penn State, can you compare the two at all? This looked
in some ways even more desperate considering the foul trouble and
everything.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You know, the only thing that's a similarity is you have
players that are in and out due to injury, and this year it's been such an
interesting ride and journey because we started out very strong, we started
SEC play very strong, and then we tapered.  
Last year was the reverse. There was desperation and there was that sense of
urgency at the end, and we kept it going. So regardless, we've got good
momentum right now, and whether we have seven players, eight, nine, 10, at
this time of year you just try to do your best to keep everybody healthy. But
that's something that we can't control, so we try not to focus in on that and
just stay positive and really focus in on what we can control, and that's the
healthy bodies that we are able to put in there and making sure that they
understand that they can do it and reinforcing that empowerment into our team.  
But that starts also in the offseason, and we traveled to Spain and we've had
that small lineup. We've had Theresa and Shanece in foul trouble before, so
they've played that play. They played at Tennessee without those two and
Jeanne. So we've drawn on that, and they've had success when adversity has
hit, and that's what we did tonight.  
  
Q. Can I get your response to my SEC question from before with five teams
advancing?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Theresa said it best, it's the toughest conference in
the country, and when you have five teams advance to the Sweet 16, that's a
testimony to the players that are in our conference. There's amazing talent.
You can look at South Carolina with Mitchell and Coates, and Tennessee
obviously with Harrison and Simmons, LSU with our players. It's a tough
conference, and you don't really get a full view of it unless you play in it,
and what Theresa is talking about, the bottom of our conference, Ole Miss took
us to the wire, Alabama beat us. So you can't just walk into an SEC game and
say that that's going to be a win. It's so competitive, and obviously it's
helped us prepare for NCAA, and that's a reflection of why we have so many
teams that have moved on.  
  
Q. What are Moncrief's prospects going forward?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Right now she's out with a knee injury, so we wish that we
could have her tonight, and we will not have her the rest of the season.  
  
Q. Obviously emotions are still high from this one, but Louisville comes up
on Sunday, so I guess what is the mentality knowing you have this momentum
throughout this week of practice going into that contest?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I think the thing that we're going to do, I want our
kids to continue to enjoy tonight and enjoy tomorrow. They have a day off, and
we'll get them ready. But I know they know the brackets, so we'll have some
that will already want to come in and want their scouting report, but I'm not
going to give it to them. I want them to understand that what they just did
and what they accomplished with the challenges that we had was amazing, and I
want them to enjoy the moment. Let the coaching staff get them ready for
Louisville, and we'll be the ones watching the film and staying up late. This
group, they deserve a day, a full day, to just enjoy beating a very good West
Virginia team, beating a very good Georgia Tech team to advance to another
Sweet 16.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, first off, I'm extremely excited to continue our play.
Our team did a very nice job yesterday against a very good team in Georgia
Tech in executing our game plan.  
West Virginia is a team that obviously when you look at their guard play,
Holmes has really done a nice job as far as setting the tone as a go‑to player
for them.  
Caldwell, she's explosive with the basketball. She's very good with her
mid‑range game and playing off the bounce, and then their supporting cast.
They just execute Coach's game plan. They're a very good team in transition,
and so our transition defense has got to be key, so taking care of the
basketball, again, another area that we've got to be very committed to doing,
and also getting on the offensive glass. We've got to make sure that we're
giving ourselves opportunities to rebound the basketball.  
But this group, they are motivated, and our team is very excited to be able to
play another game.  
  
Q. Albany fell behind 17 points in the first half, but they were able to put
together a run and I believe get to at least five points in that game. What
did you see in that run that showed you something that you could do against
the West Virginia defense?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I saw an Albany team that didn't quit. They played with a lot
of energy. They picked up their pressure defensively and really tried to
disrupt West Virginia. They trapped a little bit more, which I thought that
gave them, gave West Virginia, a challenge at times.  
And then also Albany did a nice job of really establishing their inside play.
They were very determined to get the ball inside, and it worked for them.
Paint points is going to be key.  
And then Albany also started to give themselves opportunities to score the
basketball by taking care of the basketball because West Virginia defensively,
they bring a lot of pressure to the ball handler. They don't make it easy for
you to enter the basketball to the wings or to the high post. So ball security
was key for West Virginia‑‑ I'm sorry, for Albany, to get back into that game.  
  
Q. Theresa, just going up against an all ‑Big 12 player in Asya Bussie, what
have you seen from her so far and what kind of challenges does she present?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I feel like their team is all‑around‑‑ an all‑around
great team, and she's obviously‑‑ they're obviously led by Bussie. She does a
great job of controlling the tempo for them. They go as she goes.  
We just need to do‑‑ we need to have a great defensive effort against this
team and especially her. If we have any shot of pulling this win out.  
  
Q. Jeanne, you've been on both sides of this game where you lost and you
didn't get to move on, and then last year you of course moved on. I know it's
one extreme to the next, but can you summarize the emotions and the
differences in the two?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, honestly this is my first second‑round game I've ever
played. I didn't really play last year. I was kind of out. So I'm really
excited to be here and just to put my jersey on one more time at the very
least. I'm glad to be able to do that.  
But I guess just to move on is an experience in itself. I mean, you have 32
teams that are already out. I'm just very honored to be able to wear my LSU
jersey again.  
  
Q. DaShawn, looking at this West Virginia team, I know your coach just
talked about how top to bottom it's a really good group, but in scouting them
I'm sure that you've come across the depth that they have, the players that
they can bring in this case of foul trouble or just to give somebody a
breather. What sort of challenges does that present your team just seeing such
a deep opponent that you're going to be facing?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: They have a really deep bench, but I think we have a really
deep bench, too. So I'm not really sure if that's really an issue for us.  
  
Q. I guess any of the players can answer this one, whoever feels most
comfortable. But I was curious when you look at your scoring total which shows
an all ‑time tournament high for LSU, how much do you think that was a product
of the style of game, or do you think there was something more to it in the
context of the team's development throughout the season?   
JEANNE KINNEY: I actually believe yesterday we carried out our game plan. It
has to be the first game we've stuck to our game plan for the entire game.  
Sorry, Coach.  
But our game plan was to be aggressive, and we did a very, very good job of
it. It's been difficult for the season in its entirety to put together 40
minutes, but I really do think we played a collective game yesterday, and just
pushing the tempo. We were extremely effective in transition, in our
transition offense, and everyone was committed to running from Theresa to
Shanece to all of our guards. We really were. If you get your bigs running,
you have to reward them. Personal opinion.  
  
Q. Theresa, I think it was last year in the FIU tournament you played West
Virginia. Basically the same West Virginia team, they only lost one player.
What do you remember about that game?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, I don't remember much about that game. I remember
that I was very sick prior to that and I wasn't feeling too well the entire
weekend. It kind of ruined my little Miami trip.  
But what I do remember is that they were extremely aggressive. Offensively
they really pushed tempo, and if their shots weren't falling they had five to
the boards every time and they were just determined to get that offensive
rebound, which I feel like is the same team that they have this year. All five
crashing the boards, and they're really looking for that offensive rebound,
which is a really tough thing to defend.  
Also they do a really great job on defense and pressuring our guard play and
trying to take away the high post, so that's going to be a challenge for us to
work around. You know, they have a lot of similarities from last year to this
year, and I feel like they're very worthy of their seeding and their spot
because they're a very tough team to contend with.  
  
Q. DaShawn, you guys mentioned about the pressure and Georgia Tech pressured
you yesterday and you committed 23 turnovers, but that didn't faze you. Why
not? How were you able to overcome the turnovers and still get the game plan
executed?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: You just have to keep playing. If you let the turnovers faze
you, then that's when they just keep coming. But I guess they kept coming
anyway.  
I mean, just keep playing, not really worry about if you turn the ball over or
not, just try and get it back on defense.  
  
Q. DaShawn, not to discredit the hard work of your seniors in that first
game because the trail was amazing, but your play, Danielle, what did LSU show
about what's next for the Tigers in that first game of the NCAA Tournament?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: I think that yesterday was just something that we should have
been doing all year, like how we can play. We haven't been playing our best,
and I think we all just decided to show up yesterday. Basically that's the
team that we are. It didn't surprise us because we know how we can play, and I
think that's just the beginning of what's going to continue throughout the
tournament.  
  
Q. Jeanne, to focus on the play of the seniors and specifically your play,
you had kind of memories of Pistol Pete type flash. You looked like you were
having a lot of fun out there. Is that the case of the senior knowing that
this is the last chance to show up for Tiger Nation? What elevated your play
yesterday? There was no tentative in your game.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, that comparison is a bit strong, but thank you for that.
I just think our game plan was to be aggressive, and we carried that out. I
mean, I was having fun, and that's something that you always have to remember,
that it's just a game. I do think that the whole thing of it being my last
game‑‑ that could have happened. But I mean, we were just‑‑ that chemistry
that we had was so great with everybody, like everybody had that chemistry,
and it just‑‑ you couldn't help but smile. You couldn't help but‑‑ those 50/50
balls, those passes, that we probably shouldn't have made them, were
happening, just because we were going hard, we were playing together, and it
just came to us. But we were very fortunate yesterday.  
  
Q. Theresa, to follow up on the finality of playing the final game, what
that was like?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Just the realness of there really is no tomorrow unless you
give it your all today. It really sunk in yesterday that this is really‑‑ they
say play every game like it's your last, but really every game from here on
out could be my last game. LSU means the world to me, and this is a place that
I wish I could stay forever.  
You know, it's pulling at my heart that one day I'm going to have to hang up
my jersey, and I'm going to do whatever I can to prolong that. I know the
seniors feel the same way, that we just‑‑ LSU just has a special place in our
heart. They say you bleed purple and gold when you come here, and that's an
absolute true statement.  
That just had a big part of our competitive spirit, and I know our
underclassmen care a lot about our class, and they want us to go out on a good
note. So we have a good group of underclassmen fighting pretty hard for us,
too.  
  
Q. This one is for Jeanne. On what you said just now with the chemistry of
this team and how you guys played yesterday, is this closer to the team when
you peaked in your best SEC play with anybody can have a big night out
there?  
JEANNE KINNEY: I would say that, but I would also agree with DaShawn on how
everybody just came out to play. We know we've been capable of playing this
way all season, but we haven't been able to put all the pieces together, and I
think a lot of our pieces came together last night. You just saw genuine came
for each other out on the court, and it didn't matter who scored. I mean, we
had 98 points so everybody scored basically, but it didn't matter if you were
the passer or the scorer at that point, and whenever you can get that,
especially when you're in the NCAA Tournament, when it's win or go home,
that's a special moment.  
  
Q. Jeanne, just to clarify, you didn't play in the second round game two
years ago against Penn State?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Oh, yeah, I did. It's a concussion. We lost, so I don't really
equate it. I did play.  
  
Q. West Virginia is seeded where they are for a reason. They won their
conference. You guys have two things: Your home ‑court advantage and the
experience factor. They don't have any players who have been past this round
of the tournament before. How can those things help you in tomorrow night's
game, those two factors?   
JEANNE KINNEY: I think that the energy that our fans bring is just so
electrifying. I've said it so many times, but they really are the sixth man on
the court, and they help us out tremendously.  
But I also think West Virginia is not here by fluke. They're a great team. I
mean, they're a 2 seed, and their record proves that.  
And the personnel that they have, I do think experience comes into play, but I
also think that when it comes to NCAA, everyone is going to play their best,
whether you have the experience or not. You're just going to go out and play,
and I think that's when individually you're at your best, when you just‑‑ when
sometimes you just can't think about everything, you've just got to go out and
play. We're all Division I players, so you should be able to have the skill
set to just go out and play and do your thing.  
But West Virginia is a very good team, and they're going to challenge us, but
we're always up for that challenge.  
  
Q. A lot of teams in your league are very aggressive, in ‑your‑face, man
defense. I wonder what your impressions are of West Virginia in that regard.
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I'll tell you, their defense can really disrupt you
offensively with your rhythm. We're a rhythm team, and so the flow of the
game, we're going to have to make sure that we're meeting every pass, that
we're‑‑ as a sever you're putting yourself in the position to get open because
they do an extremely great job of denying one pass away. They will play uphill
on our post game, so they're taking away wing entry, post entry, so we've got
to be creative in our offensive attack.  
You know, in the SEC there's so many teams that play that way or have that
style of play. I know Kentucky is that way. We've played A&M, Tennessee can
get after you, and obviously Georgia guard play, they also defensively can
disrupt your guards, and you can keep going down the list. Mississippi State,
there's so many great defensive teams in our league.  
So I hope through our experience that we're going to be prepared to face this
defense. But at this time of year, I think Kenney was trying to allude to it,
it's going to be about your attitude because you can pressure us or you can
pack it in or you can zone us or man‑to‑man; what is your attitude as a
basketball player when you know that you have one game guaranteed, and you
only have 40 more minutes left to play in your career for our seniors? So are
you going to work extremely hard to open up those passing lanes? Are you going
to be that team that plays aggressively against an aggressively defensive team
or are you going to be passive?  
So the attitude of our team I hope will be the attitude of a warrior.  
  
Q. Coach, do you know Moncrief's status? What is she going through today in
terms of evaluation? And what is Derreyal Youngblood's status on the team?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: As of right now, we've got Moncrief, she will go and see the
doctors today around noon, so we'll have more of an update with her situation,
so we're very hopeful with having her back. Derreyal Youngblood is suspended
from the team for team violations, and we will obviously continue to focus in
on the task at hand, and this group has done a great job of coming together
and playing this game still with Derreyal in mind and obviously with or
without Moncrief. We are still going to play this game with those two and
carry them with us.  
  
Q. When you talk about offensive creativity that you're going to require
tomorrow, how do you think Ballard's kind of dynamic on ‑court skills compare
with Kenney's Pistol Pete, fake passes and transition lay‑ups will help in
that regard?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think it will be to our advantage because they're playing
the game very relaxed, and they're not fast forwarding the process. They're
enjoying every moment of being an LSU Tiger. And Jeanne is a very emotional
player, and she gambles a lot, and I give her two a game. She gets one a half.
And so she knows she can take those risks, but also know with Jeanne and
Danielle, they're the type of kids who you want to have the ball in their
hands. They've shown that they can not only attack to score for themselves or
Jeanne Kenney spotting up for a three to open up the game, but they also can
pass the basketball, so they're great play‑makers for us, and that's what
we're going to have to have against a very talented West Virginia team.  
I like Ballard being able to attack off the bounce because that's who she is,
so allowing our kids to play to their strength, I think that's going to be key
for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the warrior effort that you want. Is that
something that has brought this team together maybe that it hasn't seen prior
to this point, and is that something maybe as a coach you wish would have come
sooner rather than later?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, I think it's‑‑ I think the season is what it's supposed to
be, and we're where we're supposed to be. We've had some great 20‑minute,
30‑minute games this season. We just hadn't had 40. And if we were playing 30
minutes, we probably could win a lot more games.  
With that being said, this team has evolved in such a way where they've found
their way, and as a head coach, the only thing that you can do is you can
provide basically‑‑ I tell them, I'll give you a shell, like we'll shell our
offense and we'll shell our defense, but it's really up to the components to
make it work.  
It's not what we run, it's how we run it. It's not what defensive scheme we're
running, it's how hard you're going to play it. We're choosing to play every
possession like it's our last, and when you have your team with that type of
sense of urgency, they've just got to maintain it, and if we can maintain it
for this 40 minutes on Tuesday night, then we have a better shot of winning.
But if we deviate from it and we don't have that warrior mentality, or as we
call it, we label it like the acronym for NBA. We're not talking about the
National Basketball Association, we're talking about no babies are allowed
here. So when you get to the NCAA Tournament, you've got to have that type of
mentality, and that's what we've been really trying to instill in our student
athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked earlier about Bria Holmes in your opening statement,
but for her to go 1 of 12 from three ‑point range, Christal Caldwell with 26
leading the way, that guard combination and their versatility, what kind of
problems does that pose to your team?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, that combination, that's a tough combination to defend.
I mean, you've got two kids who are very good in the open court, and their
ability to score the basketball multiple ways, Holmes with the spot‑up three,
although she didn't make a lot of threes. I think she only made one. But she
had some great looks.  
So you can't run the risk of, well, will she be off again against us. But we
just want to make sure that we're aware of where she's at at all times because
she is very explosive.  
And then Caldwell, I'm wondering if she's related to me. I've got to find out
because her game, she's got‑‑ her skills are very good, and mine were okay
back in the day, too, so I'm going to claim her.  
No, I think she's an exceptional mid‑range player, like her ability to play
off the bounce, and she's a great athlete. Those two really do a nice job, and
you go as your guard play goes, and West Virginia, they have two very, very
explosive guards in those two.  
  
Q. You've obviously been a part of a number of great teams and great
programs, and wondering if there's any common denominators there, and kind of
looking at the West Virginia program that's trying to get over the hump into
the Sweet 16, do you get the sense that they're close to getting over that
hump?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Oh, of course. I think West Virginia has shown through their
body of work this year that, one, they are worthy of a No.2 seed, and that
they've shown that they can not only play with the best teams in the country
but beat them. You have potential all‑American type players on your roster.
That gives you an advantage there when you can go to multiple players.  
But their team is, they're playing extremely hard on the defensive end, and
they believe in their defensive scheme and their defensive system, so you see
how they can disrupt you and turn you over and execute on the offensive end.  
And players are playing together. No one is‑‑ the body language of the team is
very positive. No one is‑‑ even when you look at Holmes, not making a lot of
those threes. They were still trying to find her, so that says a lot about
their cohesion as a team.  
  
Q. One of the interesting things about the first half of that Albany ‑West
Virginia game is Albany shot 55 percent but they were still up 17 because they
had 11 turnovers and they shot 3 for 11 from the free‑throw line. You've been
practicing the fundamentals throughout these past few weeks. Do you think
that's going to really benefit you, because this seems like an opportunity you
can have if you just make your free throws, take care of the ball?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, the free throws, I was very proud of our group for
making free throws and really doing a nice job of‑‑ I think Ballard really did
a nice job of knocking down hers, and as a team we shot a very high
percentage.  
The taking care of the basketball, that's been something that has‑‑ what's the
identity of the LSU team? Well, we're going to turn it over 20 times. We joke
about it with our kids because I feel as though they don't intentionally go
into games wanting to turn it over. It's just that they have the freedom, they
have the play action that allows multiple people to touch the basketball. I
mean, if we wanted to limit our turnovers, all we needed to do was just keep
the ball in one person's hand and just say milk the clock, milk the clock,
then go. But because we want to develop our kids, and it's not just about our
seniors, it's about allowing our underclassmen to have that freedom and to
make those mistakes because through those mistakes you will grow as a
basketball player.  
We had 23, 24 turnovers in our last game, and I tell them, I said, but if
you're going to turn it over that many times, then you need to force that many
turnovers, as well, because we need to cancel that out. If we can balance or
tip the scales a little bit in our favor, then that stat line doesn't really
affect us as much.  
We also talk about having good turnovers versus bad turnovers, and so I said
let's try to at least have half of our turnovers be good turnovers, and they
know what that means. They know what that means.  
We definitely have addressed it, and we have done everything from two‑ball
passing to medicine ball passing to just goggles and what have you. We're
going to get better as an LSU basketball program in that area. We're still
young when I look at our team. We've got three seniors, but we're very young
at the guard play, and so we're going to have those challenges. But it won't
be a matter of us not trying to get it back on the other end. So that's what
I'm looking for, because to me that builds their character.  
  
Q. Do you remember the last two second ‑round games here?   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Yes, I do.  
  
Q. Would you just summarize the emotions between the two, staying here at
home and not moving on, and do you feel like those experiences have helped
you, and now even though you're the lower seed do you feel like you have a
good shot?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think this time of year it's anybody's game to take. I think
when you look at us having a veteran squad, we've got four players who played
really valuable minutes last year from that team, and they have a taste of it,
they know what they can accomplish and that feeling. So it's in there, that
feeling of advancing and winning that second‑round game and knowing the next
step.  
Are we going to be starving for that again, or are we just going to be hungry
because I think there's a big difference when you're hungry versus starving. I
hope we're starving for it and that the team that wants it the most will come
up with the victory tomorrow.  
  
Q. Also, have you given any thought if you move on will Derreyal Youngblood
be back or do you know how long that suspension will be?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Right now the suspension is not a suspension where she's going
to be back immediately.  
  
Q. I wanted your take on my question about scoring, how much of it was
specific and how much of it was a bigger picture thing, the high scoring, and
second, did you notice that there was actually a lot of relatively high
scoring across the women's tournament first round and what might have caused
that?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I think the one thing about the scoring for us and our game
was we did not want to set up our offense versus their defense, and so that
was very scout specific that we wanted to be aggressive and attack as many
times as we can against their pressure in the full court and in the half
court.  
Playing against a 2‑1‑2 defense, which you call the buzz defense, where they
trap, trap, trap, there's not really an offense that you run where you say,
okay, I'm going to come out, ball is on the wings, set a ball screen,
whatever; it's more a mentality of player placement to get a score, so some of
our action was one, two passes, score it. So we had been practicing against
that type of pressure. But again, the players have to go out and execute it,
and I thought that they played and executed our game plan to perfection on the
offensive end.  
High scores around the country? You've got great players, and players that can
make plays, and then when they get on a roll this time of year, you're not
seeing a lot of people lose those leads. And then I think when you're down 10,
20, it's hard to come back from that because you're maybe putting a little bit
more pressure on yourself this time of year knowing it's your last go‑around,
so that may have something to do with it. I just hope that we're not down.  
  
Q. You might be a couple players down tomorrow and you have a propensity to
turn the ball over. Last year you beat Penn State with seven healthy players.
You guys have a little drama that goes along with you sometimes ‑‑  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We're women.  
  
Q. I wasn't going to say that. Y'all seem to deal with it somehow, winning
most of the time. How are you able to do that?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We're women.  
No, I think the one thing about women is we adapt, and we have to. We have to
adapt to you and men and everybody else. But no, these young ladies, they've
been through so many different things and challenges, and this is just one
more thing that they're going to add to their college experience.  
As long as they understand that every day, okay, regardless of what happens
tomorrow, and I tell them this all the time, the sun is still going to come
up, so it's just our mentality and our approach to postseason. I think we're a
team that we're considered the underdog, and I told them, I said, that's fine.
No one really thinks about that when you go on and you're cutting down nets,
who was the underdog. They just look at you, and you've gained that respect
and that momentum as you continue to advance. And it is about gaining that
respect, and we're trying to establish that respect here at LSU, or
reestablish it, because obviously this program has been rich in tradition and
winning and going to five consecutive Final Fours. That's what we're trying to
get this team back to, this program back to, because I thought when you look
at Sue Gunter and what she's meant to the women's game, I just hope that we're
getting a smile down from her and we're trying to do things the way that she
would approve.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, I'd like to just say that I'm very proud of our team
and where we're at right now. We're getting ready for a tough game tomorrow
night against LSU, and we know it's going to be a tough game. It's going to be
a tough atmosphere, but we've played in tough atmospheres this year.  
It's a great challenge for us, but we're looking forward to the challenge, and
there's no doubt in my mind we'll come out and play extremely hard.  
  
Q. Christal, this is a bit of a silly question, but Coach Caldwell said she
was going to check out and see if you were related. She said she was ready to
claim you since you played so well yesterday against Albany. Do you have any
idea if you guys are related?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I don't think we're related, but I'll just go ahead and
take that as a compliment.  
  
Q. Christal, what does it say to you about an LSU team that can turn it over
23 times, yet still score 98 points and beat a good Georgia Tech team by 20?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I think it's mostly because they get out in
transition and they try to score early. If you give them a lay‑up, they'll
take it. But still, our defense if we play the way we can, I think we can turn
them over a lot.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I just agree with Christal. I think they get out in transition
like us, and if we do a good job defensively on their guards, they penetrate a
lot, I think we'll have a pretty good shot, and we also have to guard their
bigs.  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it's because they get out in transition and they look to
drive and get into the paint so they take those chances of getting a turnover
or get the basket. It's just something that we have to deal with, and we just
have to defend dribble penetration.  
  
Q. Asia, just being a 2 seed and being rewarded with a high seed like that
and having to come down here and play on the road in a hostile environment, do
you think about that, and how do you feel that could be different in the
future?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it's great being a 2 seed, but it is difficult coming
into someone else's arena and trying to score and get the win, but I think
we've done that in the past. We've proven that we can go into other people's
gyms and come out with a win.  
  
Q. Christal, yesterday Bria gets 20 points but she does it while missing 11
three ‑pointers. You guys kept feeding the ball to her, though. How important
is it if things aren't going well you continue to sort of feed the players?
Obviously you have the depth you could bring somebody else in, but what was
the importance of making sure that you didn't give up on Bria yesterday
despite the struggles she had?   
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Because we've seen her make those shots all year long, so
just because she wasn't making them yesterday doesn't mean that she can't. We
have that confidence in her just to know that you're a shooter, you miss a
couple, you just continue to shoot. We know she's a great player, so continue
to give her the ball and she'll make some.  
  
Q. We were talking to the LSU players and they said you guys have depth but
they feel like they do, too. If you could talk about how deep you feel this
LSU team is and how well you match up because of that.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I think they play well but so do we, and I don't want
to get into too much of talking about that. I just want to get ready to play
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Asia, going up against their center, pretty good, around the same height
you are, a little different than yesterday. What challenges is she going to
bring, guarding her?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Well, I think she's a familiar body compared to the Big 12, so I
don't think that's something new. Just still playing the same way I've played
all year, attacking, rebounding, playing defense and helping the team out as
much as possible. I don't think it'll be a big difference from what I've been
playing against in the Big 12.  
  
Q. For the players, LSU obviously didn't end their season, the regular
season the way they wanted to. They've had a couple wins here and seem to have
found something. How dangerous is it to play a team that's just getting it
together in the postseason?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, with them not ending the way that they wanted to,
that lets you know that they're going to have a chip on their shoulder. It's
tournament time, they're coming off a good win yesterday, and we're on their
home floor, so they're going to come out hungry and ready to play. You can't
really talk about what they didn't do at the end of the season because they're
still a great team.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, I think they're going to come out really hungry. Like we've
been saying, it's one‑and‑done, so they're going to give their all and play
their best. I don't expect them to do anything less than that.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think they're going to come out hot from the jump. I think
that they have a chip on their shoulder like Christal said, and I feel like
they have nothing to lose. Playing on their home court will give them more
confidence.  
  
Q. Asia, we've talked so much about potentially playing a team on their home
court, and now it's here. How important is it that if they are coming out hot
right from the opening tip ‑off and the crowd is behind them and all that,
that you weather that, that you're able to with stand any momentum that they
do get early in the game and realize that there are 40 minutes to be played?
  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, we expect them to come out hot and try to get the crowd
involved, but we just have to play our defense, the defense we've been playing
all season long, and we expect it to be a roller coaster, and play until the
end, and I think it's going to be a full 40‑minute game and it's going to come
down to the stretch.  
  
Q. Asia, they've asked you about playing on LSU's home court. Even though
you're the No.2 seed in this game, do you feel like you guys have kind of an
underdog mindset going into this game?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Not really, but I do feel like we have a target on our back, and
it's been like that all season long. We don't get the respect that we should
get, and we just have to go out there and prove it every game, and I think
this whole season we have had to prove people wrong and just show that we are
a good team, we deserve to be a 2 seed, and I think that's what we continue to
do even throughout this tournament.  
  
Q. Brooke, I assume y'all have had goals of getting to the first Sweet 16 in
program history and getting to the Final Four. How do you set that aside and
get through the one game, not to let the emotions or thoughts of those goals
get in the way of what you have to do?  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think the most important thing in tournament play is just
take one game at a time and focus on the present and not the future, because
you don't know exactly who you're going to play in the next round anyway. I
think just one game at a time and advancing into next round is the most
important thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, this would be your first Sweet 16 under you but the
second for West Virginia, right? They had one in '92 or '93?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Christal, you played a lot of the same players a year ago in a tournament
in Miami. What are some of your recollections of that game?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, they took us off a lot of ball screens and they
dribble penetrated a lot, so we are going to take that into consideration and
go over scout and some of the things that they do and just try to play our
defense and just sit down and try to stop their guards from getting too deep
into the paint and setting up other people because they do have some
three‑point shooters.  
  
Q. Starting with Christal, I think every team feels like they're dissed or
underrated or whatever. But I've heard that a lot from you, that you guys at
least in the last week since the brackets came out and the people at ESPN
seemed to kind of dis you there. Can you give me some examples of what you
mean when you say that people don't give you any kind of respect and the
things that have gone on this year that give you that idea?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, we've done so much this year. We are co‑champs in the
Big 12. We've only lost four games this year. We set so many records. We have
a 30‑win season. We've just done so much, but I think a lot of people don't
take that into consideration. Maybe it's because they think that you can't
live off of that. But I think we've done so much and people just don't really
give us that credit.  
But at the same time it doesn't really matter, we just have to come out and
play basketball.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Just thinking back to the beginning of the season, we weren't
even preseason ranked and just to be in the top five and the top 10 now, I
think that shows you right now how great our team is and people didn't think
we were that good from the beginning of the season.  
Maybe like the media coverage we get or like how much we get talked about I
feel like we deserve a lot more as a team.  
BROOKE HAMPTON: I think in the beginning of the season our team was
underrated, but I think we proved a lot of people wrong and proved ourselves
right in the postseason and everything. But I think now we're considered
unrespected, being a 2 seed and playing on the No.7 seed's home court and then
the No.3 seed's home court. But I think that we do a good job of playing away
better anyway, so I think we'll have a good shot.  
  
Q. Coach, they made some pretty solid points. Do you think it's a legitimate
argument?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, we want to have a chip on our shoulder. I think we play
better when we have a chip on our shoulder, so you know, I'm going to bring up
everything to them because I want them to have a chip on their shoulder. I
want to have a chip on my shoulder. I feel like I coach a little bit better, a
little bit harder when I have a chip on my shoulder. So anything we can find,
we're going to try to find it and use it.  
  
Q. We were just talking to Nikki Caldwell. She said there's a difference
between being hungry and being starving. She feels like her team needs to be
starving for this opportunity to go to the Sweet 16. You are a team that has
had so much success this year but still clearly has something to strive for.
Do you feel like they are starving for that next step to continue on in this
tournament?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think so because this group hasn't done that, has not went
that far. I guarantee you that they're hungry to move on.  
It's going to be a tough game. You go to the NCAA Tournament, you're going to
play tough games, and you're not going to play them at your home arena. If you
want to move on to the next level, you have to play against good teams, and
sometimes you have to play them on their home floor.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot from the beginning of the season, internally you all
knew what you had coming back and knew what this team was capable of, but I
think one thing that we haven't discussed is you did have to bring in two new
assistant coaches, and that dynamic of getting used to the way you want to
scout, I know Coach Reeves has some familiarity, but knowing what you had
personnel wise, did that factor into the hiring, and how did that mesh over
the course of the season for y'all?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think the assistant coaches meshed in well. You know, I've
been in coaching for a lot of years. I'm not going to change my way, so
really, they've got to adjust to me, and they've done a great job of that.
Like you said, Coach Reeves was with me before, and I think all the coaches
have adjusted well and are doing great job for us.  
  
Q. Not being able to get to the Sweet 16 at this point except for the one
time in the early '90s, how much of that is a reflection for having to travel
for the first and second round games, and why have you guys not had the
opportunity to host some games?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I think‑‑ first of all, there's good teams in the NCAA, and
if you looked at our seedings in the past, usually we were playing a No.1 seed
or a No.2 seed the second round, and it's been tough.  
You know, don't get me wrong, we should have probably won a couple of those,
and we didn't, and we have an opportunity here.  
My philosophy is if you can get to that point, eventually hopefully you win
one. If you keep knocking on the door, hopefully it's going to open up for you
a little bit. Our teams have done a great job to get to this point, and we
need to take the next step. I said that before the year started, we need to
take the next step in the NCAA Tournament, and we have another opportunity.
Now, hopefully we can take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Players were asked about this, but Bria Holmes coming off yesterday, do
you say anything to her? Obviously you know what she's capable of, and how do
you handle that going into tomorrow?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, shooters like Bria and Christal and some other shooters,
I don't say a word. I heard Bria saying to a couple of teammates, I'm not
taking a three the next game, and I said, well, you will or you'll come out of
the game. I'm more, if that's your shot, shoot it. If you miss it, you miss
it. I don't get caught up in that stuff. The only thing I'll do, because
sometimes shooters when they're not hitting their shot will get a little tight
and then the next shot is tougher. Sometimes I'll say just kiddingly, it's
okay, it's not against the rules to hit one once in a while. It's okay to hit
one.  
But I don't say a word to shooters. I really just let that go. If they're
open, that's their shot. If it's a bad shot, that's different, but if it's a
good shot and that's their role on this basketball team, then shoot it.
Shooters are like anything else, they may miss five in a row, but you're
liable to hit five in a row, too, the next five, so you can't take that
confidence away.  
  
Q. You've said a few times that this team hasn't done too well in the NCAA
Tournament in the time you've been here and you continue to put that on
yourself. You say that's my fault. Are there things philosophically that
you've said I have to approach the NCAA Tournament a different way? Are there
changes that you make when it comes tournament time now?  
MIKE CAREY: No, not really. Not really. You know, I don't think you can
reinvent yourself tournament time. I mean, you are what you are. You play
20‑some games and you either won or lost those games in 20‑some games. Now,
you may make some adjustments and you may play your starters a little bit
longer or you may do certain things during the course of the game, but you're
really not going to reinvent what you've done all year long. I just believe
you go with what you've been successful with.  
I try to stay‑‑ even though I don't look like it on the sideline, I try to
stay calm. I really try to stay calm. I'm the type of person, I'll go
da‑da‑da‑da‑da, and then I'm calm and I'm over it, then we can really discuss
what we need to do. I think the biggest thing is keeping your players focused,
keeping them calm and don't get excited. We already talked about this: It's
going to be a 40‑minute game, and we need to be in the game going into the
last four minutes, and we've been very successful if we've been in the game
going into the last four minutes because these players have done a great job
of executing under four minutes. So that's where we want to be tomorrow night.
Just be close, be right there and have an opportunity to win the game the last
four minutes.  
  
Q. I asked the players about a hot LSU team. What did you see in that
Georgia Tech game that maybe differed from their last 10 games in the regular
season?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, I mean, they played with a lot of confidence. They were
hitting their shots. You know, when I looked at points in the paint, they
scored a lot of points in the paint, but then when I watched some film, a lot
of it was Georgia Tech was pressing, and they were getting a lot of two on
ones, lay‑ups, that type of stuff. They're very talented. They have all the
pieces. They have size. They have a 4 that can step out and hit the three but
also go inside and post you at 6'5". They have shooters on the perimeter and
they have people that can penetrate. So they have everything to be very
successful.  
We understand that, but our style is not Georgia Tech's style. We're not going
to stand out there and press and give you lay‑ups all day. We're not going to
do that. We're going to try to put a body on you, don't give you as many
offensive rebounds and that type of stuff.  
  
Q. When you played LSU in Austin in '07, can you talk about what you
remember about that game?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, the shot clock was running down and they were out past the
three‑point line. It was under five, the shot clock, and instead of us closing
up on the shooter because they couldn't put it on the floor, they had to throw
it up, they hit that three. From that point on they kind of took the lead and
was able to beat us. That was a good game.  
I also remember playing LSU last year. You all asked what stuck out in my
mind. What stuck out in my mind, they shot 40‑shot foul shots last year in
Miami, and I think they made 30‑some, whatever. That's pretty much what‑‑
because they penetrated and we didn't do a good job and we put them at the
foul line a lot. We can't do that tomorrow night. We've got to contest, make
them shoot over the top and then box out.

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Tyaunna Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26484)

### [Sydney Wallace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26928)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  98  
Georgia Tech  78

  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, first of all, I think we saw out there today why LSU
was ranked top 12 in the country early in the season. I really felt like today
they were clicking on all cylinders. When you have a guard like Danielle
Ballard step up and get 17 rebounds, 5'6", 5'7", that's a physical effort. I
just thought she was really difficult to guard on both ends of the floor
today. She did a tremendous job being disruptive. She had 10 defensive
rebounds, and so she showed a lot toughness and poise for a sophomore, I
thought. It was ‑‑ I think the experience those players have had in the Sweet
16 a year ago have paid off for them. On the other side we only had four
players who had played in an NCAA Tournament, and I think we figured out today
what it takes not only to play at this level but compete at this level in the
NCAA Tournament, especially on someone's home floor. I think that's a really
tall order and task, and I really feel like it will help our team and a
program grow as the years go on.  
  
Q. Tyaunna, I think you only had one shot attempt through the first eight
minutes when you guys fell behind there and really got back from the lead.
Looking back do you wish you had tried to establish yourself more offensively
to started the game?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: Yes, definitely. I mean, just being a leader, somebody who's
played in the NCAA Tournament before, I definitely needed to come out for my
team. Yes, of course I wanted to get more shots, but when shots aren't falling
you have to try to do more than just play offense. I like to play defense and
rebound, too, but I wish I could have been more of a threat for my team in the
opening minutes.  
  
Q. Sydney, just talk about how you felt today, your first game in several
games, and you really seemed like your shot was there. I know you're
disappointed with the loss, but talk about how you felt and how you were able
to help your team.  
SYDNEY WALLACE: I felt good a lot. I spent a few weeks just watching games and
just trying to come back mentally prepared and just tried to come back strong
for my team. I just wanted to come out with confidence and just try to do
everything I could, what my team needed me to do.  
  
Q. They have one person who handled the ball all the time. Does that make it
difficult to deal with their transition game?  
SYDNEY WALLACE: Yes, in a way. We couldn't get our press set, and I felt like
that's really why they got out in transition and they would quickly get it up,
so it was kind of hard for us to match up with them.  
  
Q. Coach, curious if you can comment on some of the foul trouble and if that
affected the rebounding spread in the game.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think what affected the rebounding was a little bit
we were standing watching the shots go up instead of pursuing the ball. And
one of the things I thought was a weakness of LSU was their offensive
rebounding. It's obvious they spent a lot of time on that the last couple
weeks because I thought the games they lost down the stretch were games they
lost on offensive rebounding, and teams just dominated them on the boards and
they were able to stay in the game, but they weren't able to finish out games
because of getting killed on the offensive glass. I thought that was obviously
one of the things they spent a lot of time working on because they did a
tremendous job today getting to the ball on the offensive end and the
defensive end. I don't know if it's so much I think our foul trouble‑‑ that
caused our foul trouble because‑‑ you foul on offensive rebounds. That's
usually where you foul. I thought today was no exception. When they were
getting offensive rebounds we were fouling them.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that they went to run with you like they did? They
haven't scored that many points, and it didn't seem like they were that great
in the half court.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: It was a totally different team today than I saw the last 10
games on film. Against the presses, anybody that pressed them when they played
in their SEC games, they were really slow in getting the ball up the floor and
seemed to struggle against presses and traps, and today it looked like their
game plan was just to throw it long and attack it and see what happens, and
they played a lot faster than I've seen them play in the 10 games I watched.  
  
Q. They also just made a lot of shots at a high rate. How much of that is
defensive effort and how much of that is sometimes just ‑‑ they made some
pretty crazy shots there along the way, too?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, when you get hit with a team that's clicking on all
cylinders, sometimes that's tough to defend, no matter what defense you're in.
Today they had players making shots that I didn't see them making shots on the
film, so I think that they had several experienced veteran players step up and
make plays for them.  
I think when you're playing at home and you played at home last year in the
NCAA Tournament, went to the Sweet 16, you get a lot of experience and you get
a lot of confidence from that, and I felt like they just made plays, and you
have to give a team credit. It feels like for us the last two games we played,
Duke and LSU have given us two of the best games all year, but that's
something we've come to expect. I think people know we play extremely hard and
you have to play that hard if you play against us, and I think they gave us
their best shot.  
  
Q. This game you guys played the tough schedule, this game compared to any
other this season? How tough was LSU compared to what you've seen this year?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think LSU is as good as any of the top teams in the
ACC, top‑five teams in the ACC. I thought today was a little bit more physical
than what we had seen throughout the course of our ACC season, but I think
that's postseason play. I think when you get to this time of the year it's
going to be a lot more physical, and I think veteran players, that's where
seniors and upperclassmen are so valuable because they've been here, done
that, and now I have a team full of underclassmen that have been here, done
that. That's what the experience gives you is an opportunity to see what it's
going to be like when you get on this stage, and I thought today that our
players learned a very valuable lesson that every level, regular season and
ACC Tournament and then now the NCAA Tournament is a different level of
intensity. I thought that LSU really came out and jumped on us, and I thought
it rocked us back on our heels a little bit.

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

West Virginia  76  
Albany  61

  
MIKE CAREY: First of all, congratulations to Albany. They had a great season,
didn't quit, played extremely hard. So give them all the congratulations you
can.  
I thought the first half we moved the ball extremely well, attacked, moved the
ball, swung the ball, found the open man, hit shots. In the second half we
kind of just stood around. We didn't attack anymore, and they started
attacking us, and we put them at the foul line.  
But in this type ‑‑ I always tell the players in all tournament settings that
we normally don't play well the first game. There's no doubt we'll play better
the next game and play harder for 40 minutes. We're looking forward to next
game. We know LSU, great basketball team, and we're playing on their home
court, so we know it's going to be a tough game.  
  
Q. Bria, talk about the run when their big girl goes out, you go on a 16 ‑2
run and you held them scoreless for almost six minutes. Was it more the
defense or was it more just the attacking with the middle opening up?   
BRIA HOLMES: I felt like it was more of our defense, and us just getting out
running and everybody looking for each other, just attacking the basket and
just scoring.  
  
Q. Bria, just when they rolled the press out in the second half, what about
just the nature of their press got you guys flustered? It seemed like they did
a good job forcing you guys to make some mistakes.  
BRIA HOLMES: Well, I think it was mostly us just not focused or just letting
them get us under pressure because we had worked on it in our scout. I think
it was more of us and just not attacking it as much.  
  
Q. What was the key to neutralizing Richards? You got her in foul trouble
pretty early and she could never get going.  
AVEREE FIELDS: We knew that she ran the floor well and I think that was kind
of our focus just to get back into playing our defense, so I think when we
play our defense we're a pretty good team, and that was our game plan for her,
as well.  
  
Q. You guys talked about different elements that were involved in guarding,
putting pressure on the guards and fronting and weak side help and all of
that. Where do you think that the biggest problem was in her getting the ball
and being able to be effective?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think we did a pretty good job having ball pressure and even
getting weak side but she had high over us, so sometimes the passes just got
there whether we were in position or not. Overall I think we had a good game
plan, but if the weak side wasn't there or if there was pressure on the ball,
sometimes we would get there, but I think we did pretty well.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just talk about what you have to go through
Tuesday and what you're up against playing the host team and playing ‑‑ you're
the 2 seed, they're the 7 seed. Just talk about that and having to play on the
road.   
BRIA HOLMES: Well, I think this team is used to playing away in front of big
crowds on someone else's home floor, and we usually tend to focus a lot more.
Coach Carey tells us that when we're away or playing in front of a big crowd,
we focus more than we do at home. If we just keep that pattern, I think we'll
be fine on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Christal, I know you guys have talked throughout the season about maybe
you enjoy the pressure of a closer game and certainly you let them back into
it in this one, but what was the discussion in team huddles and timeouts that
you made sure you came back and didn't let this get completely the other way
around?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, enjoying close games and this game I think is like
completely different, but we just stuck it out and we came together in huddles
and just said, listen, we can't let this one get away and they're not going to
give up, which they didn't, so we just had to come together as a team and come
out with a victory.  
  
Q. Christal and Averee, what was the mood like in the locker room afterward?
Coach carry mentioned he's confident you guys will play better Tuesday
night.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I think that we were excited we got the win and we took
care of business, but we definitely were like we won this game we've got to
move on to the next one, so we're focused and we have a goal ahead of us and
we can't let these teams stop us from getting there (that was Averee, all the
unidentified players were).  
  
Q. Christal, how much is this a confidence builder for you shooting wise?
You struggled a little bit in Oklahoma City with your shot.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: Well, I just tried not to think about it as much and just‑‑
if I hit the shot, okay, if I don't, then help my team in other ways. But it
always feels good to make shots and just to be able to help your team.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the run, their big girl goes to the bench. What were
you able to take advantage of when you thought the game was going to be out of
reach? What were the keys to that big run in the first half?  
MIKE CAREY: I thought we passed the ball extremely well, and we attacked. The
question was asked here of the players, their press, was it that much better
the second half than the first half, and absolutely it wasn't. We just started
passing back and forth instead of attacking it. We got the lead, and we
normally don't do that when we get a lead. We try to build on a lead. But we
just started getting a little bit lazy with our passes, instead of attacking,
throwing over the top and getting two on ones and that type of stuff. So I
thought that was the thing.  
And then I thought we were passing well, we were hitting in the middle and we
were passing the ball and we were hitting some shots. Defensively the second
half I thought the adjustment we made, instead of fronting and stuff, we just
tried to push their big girl off the block a little bit and stay in behind
her.  
  
Q. You talked about the respect factor and all that coming into this one.
Clearly any team can beat any team in the tournament. How do you use this one
and say you can't overlook anybody, there won't be any 15 seeds from this
point on?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, nothing against Albany, but we play like that, LSU will beat
us. Let's just face it. We're going to have to play for 40 minutes. It's going
to have to be a 40‑minute game and play hard for 40 minutes and concentrate
and attack for 40 minutes and play defense for 40 minutes. It's going to be a
tough game. We knew it was going to be. Give Albany, again, a lot of respect.
They didn't give. They come out the second half and took it right to us. We
can't let LSU do that to us. They have some big bodies, also, and have some
people that can score and drive it and that type of stuff. We're going to have
to play a lot better.  
  
Q. That said, do you think this team is okay playing ugly at times, if you
will? You will get the final numbers with Asya and her numbers and Bria
struggling like she normally does from outside shooting and you still found a
way to win.  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, for you that followed us throughout the year, we played a
lot of ugly games and still was able to win. You know, we really don't get
caught up in pretty. I'd rather win ugly than lose pretty. You know, I think
our team understands that. When we're not playing well, we still have to play
defense. We still have to rebound, and we've got to shut‑‑ if we're not
scoring, we can't let them score, so those things are big for us when we're
not playing well.  
  
Q. You got Lanay in early today and it seemed like she battled pretty well.
What did you think of her performance?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, she just felt she was our next best match‑up when Asya got
in foul trouble because of her height and long arms and that. She was the next
best match‑up. I thought until she got tired‑‑ when she was fresh in there, I
thought she did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Are you disappointed with the way you played today, or would you have
been surprised if you had come out here and won by ‑‑ gotten up by 22 in the
first half and won by 44?   
MIKE CAREY: I mean, I think you all know me, I'm never satisfied. Am I happy
with the way we played the second half? Absolutely not, because if we play
that way against LSU we're going to get beat. You know, again, we have not
played for two weeks. We got up by 20, 21, 22 points, and it just seems like
we got in a little bit of foul trouble, and then I told them after the game,
people coming off the bench, you've got to come in and give us a spark. We
can't come in and lose a lead because we have somebody in foul trouble. That's
something we've done a pretty good job of all year. We'll be fine. I'm not
worried about it. Did we play well, no, but Albany probably had a lot to do
with that. Do we have to play better against LSU, absolutely.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

LSU  98  
Georgia Tech  78

  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Today this team showed a lot of toughness, and they showed
that they can play this game for 40 minutes, and a lot of credit to Georgia
Tech. With their defensive pressure and their defensive scheme, I felt our
team handled that pressure very well, and again, this group has shown that
they cannot only score the basketball when they need to but they also can
defend it when they need to, and we did a nice job of getting on the boards.
We did a nice job of sharing the basketball and just playing together as a
team.  
  
Q. For Theresa and Danielle, based on how you guys finished the season,
struggling down the stretch, how important was it for you to come in here and
establish yourself how you guys played early in the year, dominance on both
ends, pushing the both, playing with a lot of confidence?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, coming off of that streak that we weren't very proud
of, they came into practice with the mindset that we had a lot of things we
had to work on, and at practice we really put an emphasis on the fundamentals
and a lot of things we really got away from, partner passing and as simple as
that, boxing out dribbles, things that we really took for granted and cost us
in the end. Just worried about those things in our off week really helped us
out, especially in this game going against a Georgia Tech team who averaging
about 20 offensive rebounds a game. They do a great job of getting on the
boards, and that was one of our things that we had to really buckle down on.  
But coming into a first‑round game we really wanted to put our all into it and
let people know that this isn't the same team you saw two weeks ago. We've
completely transformed ourselves into‑‑ I feel like we're a more mature team
now. We're just going to build off of this win and just let the momentum take
us.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: In the past we wasn't really getting rebounds, so every day
we come to practice working on our defense, trying to get our defense down
pat, especially getting rebounds so we do defensive drills, and each and every
day we improve, and it showed today on the court that we went hard and we was
aggressive on and off, offense and defense, and it just showed all the hard
work we had in practice. It showed in this game.  
  
Q. Danielle, it looked like you all were really pushing the pace early,
trying to set the tone. Is that something you've wanted to do before the game,
and how did that really set the tone and help you get off to that early
start?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We were just sticking to the game plan. On film we saw that
we could push down, push down, and after seeing in the game we kept going,
kept doing it, and they kept getting exhausted and we just kept trying to
doing what was best for us, and that was to push down on offense and keep
getting them tired because we was running each and every day of practice so we
was in better shape than they was. I felt like we had the upper hand on that.  
  
Q. Danielle, just how comfortable do you feel in transition, creating
offense, you were scoring both ways. How much does that play into the way you
like to play basketball, the way you played today?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, like I said before, if I get stops, I pass it back to
a shooter. If I don't get a stop, I just continue laying it up. This is my
job, just penetrating and getting my players open and getting them open shots,
being unselfish with the ball.  
  
Q. This question is for Shanece. I'm just wondering, are you surprised at
this effort today, what you guys did today?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Absolutely not. We went into this game thinking that it
wouldn't be (inaudible), so we had it in our heads that we'll be playing on
Tuesday, so the effort was definitely there today.  
  
Q. Theresa, there was that three ‑minute stretch in the first half after you
had that big lead that they started coming back and y'all couldn't find a
bucket and then DeShawn came in and got three quick baskets for you. How big
was that to get y'all back in the game and back really with your foot on the
pedal?   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, first of all, I want to say that coming into this
game our guards really set the tone for us. Danielle was doing a great job of
creating for herself, and after she started creating for herself, everyone
else started opening up, and that's when DaShawn started getting her shots.
Early on DaShawn was hitting, and Danielle and Day had the hot hands so we
knew we needed to get the ball to them. In that little segment where we really
couldn't get a stop, I saw a team that wasn't a team that you would normally
see. When stuff like that happens we used to crumble when adversity hit, and
today we pushed through it. Coming in, going back down on offense, DaShawn
hitting that three, that was a very momentum‑changing shot. That really got
our bench on their feet, and everybody else like springing back on defense
trying to get back into a stance, trying to get a stop so we could go on a
little run.  
But that really started with the push the tempo of Danielle Ballard. She did a
great job of pushing the tempo, and they really didn't have an answer for her.
She did a great job today.  
  
Q. Talk about this being a big goal for you to make sure you got that second
game.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, you know, coming into the P‑MAC it's always nice to
play in front of our crowd. I love these people here. They're a big part of
the reason why I came here, just the fan support and the support of everyone.
You can walk into a store and they'll be like, oh, you play on Sunday, good
luck, thanks. Just little things like that that really makes this place
special. Being able to have that second opportunity to play in our home is
unbelievable to us. It's something that we don't take for granted, and we
really look forward to playing in front of these people that care so much
about it, and in return we want to do the best we can so we keep them on their
feet and keep them excited but we're just a tumbleweed, and when they go, we
go, and it really helps us out.  
  
Q. Shanece or Theresa, can you talk about a point guard leading the
rebounds?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Well, I just feel like we can do the dirty work and let the
guards come in and get the rebounds. It's okay with me as long as we get the
rebound.  
I know that usually people think the bigs are the ones that should get the
rebounds, but we actually wanted to clear out the other big people so Danielle
could get 25.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Danielle just did a great job on boards like she always
does. That's another weapon of Danielle Ballard, the fact that she's such a
great rebounder. Danielle comes in out of absolutely nowhere and tries to tip
in. She's not scared of big bodies in the paint, she's not scared of contact.
Danielle is really fearless when it comes to rebounding. She did a great job
for us on the offensive end and the defensive end. 17 rebounds is outstanding
for anybody, much less a guard, but it was really not shocking coming from
Danielle. She's just a great athlete, and rebounding is one of her strengths.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask Danielle, Georgia Tech is such a guard ‑oriented team,
was it a challenge for yourself and the other guards to one‑up them a little
bit because there was so much of a focus on stopping their guards?   
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, Georgia Tech has some awesome guards. They can defend.
It was very hard going against them. We had to be really focused on what we
wanted to do, either take or pass out, but it was very difficult going against
these girls. There are some good players on their team. Again, my props to
them because they're good, too.  
  
Q. Danielle, the other coach said that the team that LSU was tonight was not
the team she saw on film the last 10 or 12 games. Would you agree with her?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Absolutely. This team is a different team. We had a
different mindset. We're going to come every game with a different mindset,
but it's just going to go‑‑ we're just going to look better each‑‑ we're just
going to go harder and harder. We just want to win. Going to take each game at
a time, just going to go hard and we're going to give our all. People are
going to continue seeing a different team. They're not going to see the same
team as they did today on Tuesday. We're going to be a different team every
day, and we'll continue going hard and staying together and just being one
family.  
  
Q. Coach, who was that LSU team out there today, and where has that team
been over the last 10 or 12 games?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: The team that you saw tonight has been there. We have been
there for 20 minutes here, 30 minutes. They just put together a 40‑minute
effort as a team.  
Georgia Tech really did a nice job of attacking offensively with their
different weapons with their guard play, and we did, we challenged our guards
from the time we left the SEC Tournament to try to be the best guard play,
because you go as far as your guards go, and I thought that was evident. I
thought Ballard set the tone for us, but she's been setting it in practice.
Jeanne Kenney, being able to play her off the ball allowed us to do a lot of
different things in that regard. I like the play of Shanece McKinney night
how. She's really being aggressive, not only offensively, but defensively
she's become that stopper for us.  
Players are becoming who they have always been. They're just realizing it now,
and better late than never. That's what I tell them. I'm proud of this group
for playing this game with high intensity for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, were you curious on how this team was going to respond to how they
finished the season? And also, all the players talked about how things were
different in practice. It was more intense, a lot of running. What changed
about practice that kind of turned the light on this team?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we had 11 days to practice, and we didn't have to worry
about a game the next day or have to taper or things like that. We were able
to stay with certain action, and the two things that we really stressed was
our defense and our board play. We wanted to control the boards, and tonight
we did that. If you can control the boards, you can control the tempo of the
game. We did a nice job of keeping a very offensive team off the glass and not
allowing them to score as much as we've done in the past.  
We've had a tough schedule. I think the one thing that I told this group is
having coached, played, won SEC championships, our last several games, that's
a tough stretch, and if you add the SEC Tournament play, a lot of teams would
have struggled with that schedule, too. When you look at playing at Kentucky,
at Texas A&M, at Georgia, Alabama, who's really come along with Coach Curry,
and then having to play two No.1 seeds, Tennessee twice and South Carolina.  
So I told our team, our record should not reflect who we are as competitors,
and I wanted to make sure that they understood that, that they are one of the
best teams in the country, and when they play for 40 minutes and they put
their mind to it and their heart that they can beat anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you could outrun them today? Was that the case?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We felt as though we conditioned and have been conditioned to
keep that pace. We talked about that at halftime, and I knew Ballard had
logged a lot of minutes, but she's playing at a different level of
competitiveness, so she was going to push through. And we pushed them these
last 11 days, and I think that is something that they were able to draw on,
and we talked about it and said, some of you guys ran track, and it's going to
be a track meet out there.  
The team that really pushes through that point of exhaustion can come up with
those easy baskets, make those lay‑ups, get some run‑outs, and we were able to
do that. Our strength and conditioning coach has done a great job of training
our team mentally and physically, and we continue to weight train through the
season, we try to go two, sometimes three times a week to maintain, but we
also have a little bit more depth this year than we did last year around this
time.  
When you've got 10, 11 bodies that can get out there, you're not as afraid, if
you will, as a coach to say, hey, let's run.  
  
Q. You've said all year this team is still looking for a complete 40 ‑minute
game. Was this either the closest you've seen to that or was this a complete
40‑minute game?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: I felt it was the closest that I've seen, although they made
some runs in the game. It's a game of runs, and Georgia Tech is a very good
basketball team. Watching them on film, their ability to score the basketball
with three go‑tos on the perimeter, that's a tough task for any team to
defend.  
Again, we talked about the board play. We said if we can just control the
boards, we'll have a shot. So our team did a very nice job of executing that
aspect of the game, and then this time of year you've got to make lay‑ups and
free throws. Our game plan wasn't to just settle and shoot jump shots. We
wanted to get to the basket and go score, and they did just that.  
  
Q. Two things: First, Moncrief, what's the best update you can give us on
her, and second, just your take on the all ‑cart game of Danielle today?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, Moncrief, we're going to have her‑‑ obviously we didn't
want to do anything because we don't know what's going on exactly right now,
but we're going to have her looked at tomorrow, so we'll know more about that
tomorrow. We're just going to stay hopeful, and obviously she's somebody who
is just a tremendous asset to our team. She's a player that is explosive to
watch. She's such a great athlete. But she's also a great teammate, and I know
that whatever the outcome, we're going to be behind her 100 percent, and she's
going to be that player that's going to be‑‑ if she's missing or if we don't
have her, she's going to be that player that's going to be jumping up,
cheering her teammates on.  
Ballard just played like a woman possessed. She played like somebody that
said, I can't be denied. And when you have your point guard playing with that
type of attitude, that mentality, it filters throughout our team, and so she
did set the tone for us that we can be aggressive against their pressure,
against their press, against their buzz defense, that she took it upon herself
to be that player that I'm going to get‑‑ go to the glass as hard as I can,
and obviously 17 rebounds, that's tremendous. She's just that player that is a
very special player.  
  
Q. When a point guard rebounds like that, does it ever worry you about
getting back on defense?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: That's where Jeanne Kenney comes in to play. We've made Jeanne
Kenney our safety, and we send her back. It's a game of numbers. If you're
going to crash and force the boards, you hope that you're going to come up
with it. Our goal was to come up with 50 percent of our missed shots. But if
you do crash the boards and they get the rebound, it is going to put a little
bit more pressure on our transition defense, but we were coming up with it,
and it worked.  
  
Q. Georgia Tech's coach said that over the last 10 games she's watched of
you guys, this was a totally different LSU team than what she saw on video.
How much is winning in this kind of environment as much about an element of
surprise as it is about fundamental basketball?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I'll tell you, you look at our last game before Georgia
Tech, and we were playing Tennessee in the second round of play at the
tournament, and the first 20 minutes of that game was similar to what we did
today. We were able to extend ourselves early, were able to set the tone. We
were attacking their pressure. We just didn't sustain it. That's what we did
today. We sustained it.  
So yes, she's right. She probably hadn't seen a team, our team, at its very
best for 40. But there's always been that turning point where we know, okay,
if we can get from 20 to 30 to 40‑minute game that we can pretty much play
with anybody.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  

West Virginia  76  
Albany  62

  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Well, obviously I'm very proud of them. I thought
they competed completely until the end. They came out fighters, and finished
as fighters, and I thought they represented the America East very proudly,
which I know all the coaches in the America East were very proud of us, and I
know our commissioner Amy is very proud of us, so we came out and we competed
and represented our team very well and the America East very well.  
I think that‑‑ and I told our team this, I think that we were a 15 seed
because we lost some games that we shouldn't have lost, and we should have
been a 15 seed. But talent‑wise and competitive‑wise, we weren't really a 15
seed. It really showed out there.  
I think West Virginia is a great team, but what it did for our team was prove
to each and every one of them that they can play against anybody at any time,
as long as you just fight and you play hard and stick to our system. I think
we did a great job. I mean, we out‑scored them in the second half 36‑34, and
that started with defense and obviously finished with offense. It hurt having
la Reese out. It hurt not having her out there, because that's 23 points a
game, but I thought everybody else stepped out and had each other's backs and
did a lot of great things out there for our team, so I'm very proud of them. I
know our athletic director Lee McElroy is very proud of them and his wife,
Karen, and just all the families that were there, and we're truly grateful for
all the support we had when we were here. There were some purple fans out
there cheering for us from LSU, too. I'm very proud of them, and they're
wonderful, empowered young women.  
  
Q. Megan, you get the second foul and you have to go to the bench and you
see them go on that run. What's going through your head when you're not out on
the court?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Obviously it sucks not being out there because I need to be out
there for my team. But what's going through my head is as soon as I get out
there I need to just play smart, stay poised, play smart and keep my hands up
because I knew if I got in foul trouble I could hurt my team. Knowing I could
be in as soon as I could, I was just waiting for that and waiting for that
moment to come.  
  
Q. Shereesha, you were playing with foul trouble all night and even before
that you couldn't get in an offensive rhythm. What was going through your
head?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: I just knew that I needed to play smarter, and I think I
just‑‑ I'm too aggressive sometimes. That's kind of my downfall, I think. I'm
so aggressive, I just want to make everything happen.  
Being in foul trouble was bad on my part because it was kind of selfish for my
teammates because I know they needed me out there. But at the same time it's
already done. All I had to do was go out wherever I'm in and do whatever I
could.  
  
Q. You look across the stat box and free ‑throw shooting tonight (inaudible)
how much do you think that affected the ballgame, not being able to hit free
throws to stop that run?   
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Free throws tonight, man, our free throws just wouldn't
fall tonight, and we worked on it. We did free throw, free throw, and we know
that that's where it was going to be, at the free‑throw line, but we just
couldn't make it. We just couldn't make our free throws tonight.  
SARAH ROYALS: We didn't step up and make the shots. I mean, me too, myself
included. But West Virginia is a very aggressive team, and we knew they were
going to foul a lot. All we did all week was work on free throws, and
sometimes when the moment comes, got to knock it down, and we didn't, but yes,
I think if we had made all our free throws we could have won the game, and we
missed almost 50 percent of them. So making those definitely would have had a
big impact.  
  
Q. What was the message in the huddles when you went down by so much in the
first half and at halftime? What was the message? Was it come out and keep
fighting the second half?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Obviously it was just to stay poised. We didn't play our game and
stay in control and not let anything affect us. Especially coming out at
halftime the score was 0‑0 for us. We had to stay poised, stay in control for
the pressure that was going to be coming our way, but we knew we had to be in
control of ourselves. We were trying to take the correct shots, play the great
defense that we could and just play the game that we could pull off.  
  
Q. Sarah and Shereesha, how much different was it when Megan was on the
bench defensively there?  
SARAH ROYALS: When Megan is not in the game it makes a world of difference,
even for scouting. Not many people can simulate the presence that Megan has.
You can pretend that, well, I can shoot over her or anything, but the reality
is when you're in the paint and you see someone that's 6'9", you're trying to
pass it out. I think we did a great job on No.20. She is their leading scorer,
and we held her to three points, and that's due in part a lot to Megan.
Everyone second‑guesses themselves every time they go in the point, and with
her in the paint that's how Reese and Imani and Tammy, that's how they go and
get those steals because they know that Megan has their back. If they get
beat, then Megan is there to clean it up and get the rebound, and when she's
not in there we are much smaller. We're very aggressive, we are still great
rebounders, but we are a lot smaller, and I think that changes the mentality
of the offense playing against us.  
  
Q. When they went on that long run did you consider putting Megan back in
earlier?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Yeah, I mean, it's a Catch 22 because I put Shereesha
back in and she got her third foul and she was diving for loose balls.
Obviously if coaches knew the magic answer, then we'd be millionaires and
everybody would want to do this.  
But yeah, I mean, I go back and forth. You go back and forth. I thought Tammy
really stepped up. Tammy is a 3 guard, she's 6 foot and she's playing the 4
and she's getting rebounds. What did she have, nine rebounds for us, so she
really stepped up. It's just you just never know how the game is going to go.
Shereesha is super aggressive, but she's right, that is her downfall, which is
a great downfall, but I knew once I put Megan back in, he's a great coach,
he's going to go at her and try to get her in foul trouble. I put Reese back
in, she got a foul, and I put Megan back in. Obviously they're the anchor of
our team, so a lot of games that we struggled they were out there on the
floor, so we've really had to teach them to try to not be so aggressive and
play straight up and try to‑‑ Megan is more moving your feet correctly and
getting in the right spots. Reese is just like calm down, calm down, because
she wants to win the game in five minutes. But I thought we adjusted well.
They weren't even out there and we were pressing great. It was great watching
our guards up there just pressing and getting steals. It makes the game
exciting to watch like that.  
  
Q. You get it to 56 ‑51, seven minutes left, but then they get it back to
double digits and it was basically almost done after that. How much of it was
just so much energy to get to that point? Was the team out of energy or was it
something that you saw or was it just all the energy getting it to that point?
  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Shereesha was on the bench, so the score was
different. But we were up and they were breaking it a little bit, you know
what I mean, but all of our plays we were having to go to Megan or to Sarah.
Most of our plays go to Reese, that's our No.1 option, and then it goes to
Megan and then it goes to Sarah. And so obviously down the stretch you saw I
was trying to get Sarah and Megan the ball as much as we could. You know, it
was tough having her out of there, but she's just super aggressive, and I
thought that our team did a great job, and their team did a great job. Their
go‑to player had 26 points and their second go‑to player had 20. So they did a
great job offensively.  
  
Q. Did you feel anything in particular was working well for you in the
second half when you were coming back, anything that you were doing to them
that was affecting them?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Our press. I didn't really think that we could press
them like that to be honest, but we were in a dog fight. We had to do
something different. We had to change the momentum of the game. We had to get
up and press them a little bit more. And obviously some of their players
played for 34, 35 minutes. Obviously their bench is a little bit deeper than
ours, but I was proud that we could get up and press like that. I actually
told my assistant coach, ha ha, I told you we could do that, but she was like,
I don't know if we're going to do that. But I thought we could get up and
press them a little bit. A lot of you haven't seen us play a lot, but that's
kind of our mojo. That's kind of what we do. We get up and we put a lot of
pressure because we really need to keep Megan out of foul trouble. A lot of
people try to go at her, so we try to play up and press and it's a lot of fun.
Our players like it. They get a lot of energy. Gosh, Megs and Margarita and
Sarah played 40 minutes of that, so they're tough. That's tough to do against
a Big 12 team. I'm so proud of them. And Tammy played 40 minutes. 40 minutes
of pressing like that is way different than sitting back and just playing zone
defense or sitting back and playing man. We were up pressing for 20 minutes
the second half, 20 minutes straight. They didn't fit, they were playing as
hard as they could, they were diving for loose balls. I told them I wanted
even more purple on the floor, get those loose balls. That's what we did in
halftime, I said get after it. We have nothing to lose, so let's go for it.  
  
Q. Last year you lost by five, right, to North Carolina?  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Do you feel after this game that you are closer maybe to breaking through
and getting the win even though the point differential was a little bit more?
Especially with the experience that you guys have now, like you said, you have
a lot of returning players next year.  
KATIE ABRAHAM‑HENDERSON: I feel like it's exactly the same to be honest, like
our free throws, again, and we were shooting free throws and free throws and
free throws. I said, maybe we shouldn't shoot this many free throws this week.
You've got to make 10 in a row before you leave, you've got to make 10 in a
row. I think it's kind of the same. It was a lot of the same, but we were
going into‑‑ we went into the post. Last year we could shoot some threes a
little bit more with Lindsey Lowrie and Ebony and Julie, but I thought we
could run our sets a little bit more this year. Last year it wasn't easy to
run our sets against North Carolina, so we learned from that. It had nothing
to do with West Virginia. I think they did great, but we were able to run our
normal sets this year, where last year it wasn't as good.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: BATON
ROUGE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BATON+ROUGE)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Kaela Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26929)

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Tyaunna Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26484)

### [Sydney Wallace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26928)

  
_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: First of all, we're just very excited to be back in the NCAA
Tournament after six straight trips and sitting out last year, to be back for
the seventh time in eight years is just very exciting for our program. We felt
like that year we had off made us more hungry, and I really give my players a
lot of credit because they did a lot of work in the off season to turn things
around and get us back in the NCAA Tournament. We've obviously had some very
good play down the stretch against Florida State. We lost our starting point
guard in Sydney Wallace and she wasn't able to play the last three games. I
think it showed a lot of poise and composure and strength of our team to go
ahead and win two games without her. Obviously we lost a game that was
disappointing to us against Duke in the ACC Tournament, but I think that loss
really turned things around for us the last couple weeks. We've had some very
good practices and feel like we're playing our best basketball at the right
time.  
  
Q. Sydney, can you just talk about how you feel now at this point coming
into the tournament?  
SYDNEY WALLACE: Well, I feel good. I've taken the right steps and everything
in getting back to where I need to be, just resting and making sure I'm doing
what I need to do and just gradually getting back to where I was before,
getting up shots, kind of just sitting down and learning and watching, also. I
feel like I'm ready, and I'm ready to play. I'm good.  
  
Q. MaChelle, talk about having to play on someone else's home court. It
usually happens every year in the women's tournament and it's something you
have to deal with. What do you tell your players?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: It's interesting, we've had a lot of experience at this in
our seven trips. We've probably played on a home court five of the seven
times. But we understand where women's basketball is at this point. We
understand it's not something that's ideal but it's something that's
necessary. We're trying to grow our game. We've got to do what's best for our
game at this point. And it's one of things where you would like to be on a
neutral floor, but you're not so you have to embrace the opportunity you've
been given. We've had success at this, so it's one of those things we don't
really talk about. It's just like for us it's another ACC game on the road.
It's a very good match‑up for us, and we're excited to be here and have a
great opportunity to play in front of some great fans. LSU does a great job
drawing attendance give and we're going to embrace this opportunity and go out
tomorrow and give them the best effort we have.  
  
Q. How do you feel about next year going back to the old format? Do you feel
like that's a positive move or do you think eventually ‑‑ do you see this
tournament being on all neutral sites at some point?   
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, to answer your first question, as far as going to the
top seeds hosting, I think I like that better because I do think that they've
earned those seeds. They've earned those rights to host if you're a top seed,
then you've earned that right.  
As far as the second, I would like to believe that long‑term that the women's
game will grow to the point where we won't have to be on home courts and we
can have neutral sites. That's what we're doing right now, is trying to grow
our game and get to that point where we can copy what the men have done and
draw enough fans that we can play on neutral floors.  
  
Q. Obviously they have experienced guards, they've got post play and then
you've got someone who can step outside and shoot from the perimeter. Just
talk about what you see and the challenges they present.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, LSU is a veteran team. They play a lot of seniors. They
have a lot of upperclassmen. Their go‑to players are both seniors that have
played together a long time. Obviously we have a lot of respect for the SEC
and the teams in that conference, so we understand that they're a very
competitive team with a lot of different weapons. It's just‑‑ I've watched
probably 10 games that they've played this year, and I feel that it's a very
good match‑up for us. I think that the strength of their team is their guard
play, and obviously they have the inside presence, but she is more of a
face‑up post player. I consider it a perimeter game mostly for LSU and for us.  
So we like that. I feel like in postseason, you get to postseason with inside
play, but you win in the postseason with guards, and I think I'd put our
guards up against anybody in the country at this point.  
  
Q. Ms.Marshall or Ms.Wallace, talking about guard play, there seems to be a
lot of intrigue in the match ‑up with LSU guards, and I wonder how you think
about how that's going to dictate what happens in the game?   
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: I think when you play anybody, you have to have respect for
whoever you're playing, but me and Syd being experienced, and we've been here
before, and then Kaela who's a hard‑working player that she is, we're going to
come in and play our game regardless of who we are going up against. We have
respect and we're going to give 100 percent regardless.  
  
Q. This question is for Ty. If you had a word or a phrase that you would use
to describe this year's Rambling Wreck, Georgia Tech, what would that be,
please?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: I think if I had a word, I guess I would choose resilient.
The things that we've been through over the past year, you think about this
year and the games that we played, just being resilient, getting back to where
we want to be, getting back to the postseason, that was our focus from the
jump to getting back to playing in the NCAA Tournament. So we were resilient
enough, to play games that we lost and we battled back from it. Coach always
said, it's not what happens, it's how you respond and we've responded well
over the past year.  
  
Q. This question is for Kaela. If you had to describe to someone who hadn't
seen your teammate Ty play yet, what would you say about what we are prepared
to see from her this weekend?  
KAELA DAVIS: I mean, Ty is amazing. She's just an amazingly hard worker. She's
just an example of how the game should be played at any level. Obviously
within our program specifically, but she plays hard, and she's all over the
place, and it's a show. It's an exciting show for sure. I'd be excited to see
it.  
  
Q. MaChelle, you've scored 90 points at least seven times this year,
averaged about 80 points a game, and this is an LSU team that's struggled with
rebounding, struggled with turnovers. Is that fast pace something you're going
to want to establish in a game like this?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, it's been an interesting year for us because we built
this program on defense and rebounding and we never really won games
outscoring people. Well, with Ty Marshall coming back being our all‑time
leading scorer in the history of our program and Kaela Davis coming in as a
freshman and being a prolific scorer for a freshman, she's scored the most
points of any freshman to ever play at Georgia Tech, and Ty is our all‑time
leading scorer and then Sydney Wallace, who is a prolific scorer as well,
we've been able to win games on the offensive end, and that's been exciting
for me, because obviously I love offense, but back when we started this
program we didn't have those types of players. So this year has been exciting
down the stretch like you mentioned, before Sydney had her injury, we were
scoring pretty well, amazingly well, and it's one of those things where we
feel very confident now on the offensive end. We've seen a lot of zones, a lot
of junk defense, a lot of the things we know that LSU are going to throw at
us. It won't be the first time we've seen them. That's what the ACC does for
us. It prepares us for games like this. There's nothing really at this point
in the season that somebody can do to us that we haven't seen all year long.
We're excited about the match‑up. We have tremendous respect for what LSU has
been able to accomplish this season, but we feel like we're playing our best
basketball, and we're ready for the match‑up.  
  
Q. Ty, if you could, I know we talked a little bit about LSU's guards, talk
about your impressions of Danielle Ballard?  
TYAUNNA MARSHALL: She's a very strong point guard, somebody we watched tape
on. We know we have to box out and she's a great rebounding guard. Like I say,
we're coming in strong. We're just going to play our game, regardless of who
we're going up against.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we're excited to be here. We know it's going to be a great
tournament. Our players did a great job this year, and hopefully we can come
in here and play well. But we're excited, and Albany, we know they're a great
team. They won their league, won their tournament. We give them a lot of
respect, and we know it's going to be a tough game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike and for any of the players, this Albany team doesn't seem like a
typical 15 seed. They've got the No.2 scorer in Division 1. What do you have
to do to stop Richards?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, she's very athletic, runs the floor extremely well, posts.
They're always looking to lob to her and the other post players. They do a
good job. I think they all know their roles and they know where the ball needs
to go and that type of stuff.  
We played against a lot of good athletes during the course of the season, so
we've seen players like her, and it's a tough match‑up, and we know‑‑ you're
exactly right, they have some very good basketball players.  
  
Q. Mike, I'm sure you've been asked variations of this question before, but
just given where the program is now, how much is this month about opening eyes
nationally? I know within the sport itself what you guys have done is pretty
well known.  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we really don't want to be like a Louisville‑‑ no, I'm just
kidding (laughter). That's not our goal, believe me.  
We feel like we've still got a lot to prove. We still don't get a lot of
respect throughout the country and that type of stuff. We are in our second
year in the Big 12, so you know, we had to go prove ourselves in that league,
coming from the Big East. Our girls are hungry. They understand that we have a
lot to prove, and we haven't proved anything yet. This tournament is very
important, but everybody starting out is going to play their best basketball
and play extremely hard, so we realize that.  
  
Q. Each of the players, do you guys feel the pressure for the most part is
something that's more self ‑inflicted than anything? How do you view that?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would think so, coming in as a higher seed, you
automatically think that people think you're supposed to win that game, but
you can't look at it that way. Like Coach Carey said they're a great team, and
it's tournament time now, so everyone is going to give you their best shot and
you can't put too much pressure on yourself thinking about it.  
  
Q. I'm sure you saw a lot of the upsets yesterday on the men's side. Does it
kind of drive home the point if you don't play your best basketball each time
‑out that you're going to be going home?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, definitely. I mean, like coach was saying, this is
a fresh start. Everybody is going to play their best basketball right now. It
doesn't really matter what you did the rest of the season. This is important.
It's a one‑and‑done now, so everybody wants to be a national champion, so
they're going to go and play like it.  
  
Q. This is for each of the players. If you could give me a word or a phrase
that you would use to describe this year's team and a little bit on why you
picked that. It could all be the same word, but I just like to throw it out,
especially to senior leaders.  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I'll go ahead and say fighters. I think there was so many
times where we could have given up but we didn't and came back and won the
game. Definitely this team knows how to fight and just stick it out for 40
minutes.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would say fearless. You put us up against some of the
top teams in our conference and in the country and we don't back down. It's
going to be, like Christal said, a fight the whole game, and we give our all,
and we're going to play until the end, so we're definitely fearless. We don't
really care about who we're playing. We're going to go out there and get it.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I would just say heart. I think we play with a lot of
heart, and this season we came in and we just knew that we had a great team
and we were just going to go out there and have goals that we just needed to
accomplish.  
  
Q. Asya, what have you seen from Richards on film? What have you seen that
gets her going and what can you do defensively to neutralize her?  
ASYA BUSSIE: I think it'll just be a team effort. Our guards have to get their
hands up and we have to play West Virginia defense. That's what we pride
ourselves on, so just helping each other out and just defending as a team.  
  
Q. For each of the players and also Asya, last year you obviously had to sit
and watch the transition to the Big 12 and that probably wasn't what you all
wanted in Year 1. What did you take away from last year's .500 start in the
Big 12 and carry forward to this year?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Just learning from last season. We knew what we did wrong, and
like some of the things that we needed to change and we had to play for
ourselves. The coaches, they can only do but so much. They're on the sideline
coaching. We have to play for ourselves and we have to be motivated. So I
think we realized how important each game was and just it's upon ourselves how
far we want to go.  
  
Q. Asya, I know you go against the 6'7 " girl from Texas, you go against a
6'9" girl tomorrow. Talk a little bit about the challenges that presents and
how maybe you have to hold to your game a little bit when you're playing
against somebody who's that much taller than you.   
ASYA BUSSIE: The challenge is definitely just the height challenge, but like I
said, the biggest thing will just be the guards helping, trying to get them to
have their hands up so they can't throw too many lobs. Just try to stay out of
foul trouble. That would be my biggest goal, and just being straight up and
make the shot difficult for her.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you get tired of hearing the question comparing the Big 12
to the Big East, but how did that change the program and what sort of an
opportunity did it give you?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, I really don't comment on Big East was a great league, Big
12 is a great league. Both of them are great leagues. We're more in the
Midwest now and that type of stuff. I think the first year, too, of the Big 12
you had all new scouts, new styles, new coaches, just going and picking
hotels. Some of them were‑‑ we thought was close to the arenas and they really
weren't. I think some people told us on that purpose to be honest (laughing),
but you never know your first year when you go around. I just think it was an
adjustment period for the whole team, the staff and administration.  
  
Q. For all the seniors, we talked before the season started about the goals
you have this year and knowing that you don't get another shot. Christal, can
we start with you, how much do you feel like the fact that you have five
seniors who all play a big role on this team has gotten you to where you are
can be the reason why you go further than you have in the past?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: I was actually talking about this earlier with Brooke in
the room. We were talking about how experience can play a big role, and we
were looking at some of the NCAA guides and they were talking about big names
and stuff like that, but it just seems like experience plays a big role.
You've been in certain situations before, so you kind of know what to expect.
I think that's helped us a lot this year, and it's going to help us in the
tournament, as well.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: Yeah, I agree. Experience is huge. Not only the
experience but the leadership out of the seniors, as well. You know, the
younger players, they listen, they're attentive, and like they understand what
we really want as a team. You know, it's more important, I guess, for the
seniors just because it's our last go around, but the whole team feels the
same way. We want this opportunity, and like you said, like Christal was
saying, we've been in these positions before, and it's going to be up to us to
lead the team and help them to get over some little humps that we see going
down the line.  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I think having five seniors is good for the leadership
and experience. We're able to lead by example. But just as a team, I feel like
our team came together, not just the five seniors. For example, Averee has hit
a couple big shots for us to win tight games. She's vocal, and I think
everybody knows their role, not just the seniors, and I think that's what
makes our team so special.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about I think how they're sort of similar to TCU
in some ways. TCU had that zone disguised as a man that gave you some trouble
throughout the year. Can you speak to what Albany does?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, they're going to do a 2‑2‑1, different pressures out of a
2‑2‑1 back into their two‑three. They bring their forwards extremely high.
They get a lot of steals out of their zone because they come up high in their
zone, try to steal the reverse pass, skip passes and that type of stuff. We're
going to have to do a good job of taking care of the basketball, and you're
right, TCU, thanks for bringing that up, but TCU gave us a hard time the three
times we played them. There's no doubt that we'll have to adjust to their zone
and style and stuff.  
  
Q. Christal and Taylor, you guys have rallied back in those games this year.
Which one of those sticks out to you and speaks to the identity you're talking
about? Which game where you had to fight back?  
CHRISTAL CALDWELL: For me definitely Oklahoma. It could have been so easy for
us to just stop and just give up. We got down by so much. A lot of people were
in foul trouble. Just somehow we found a way to move on through the entire
game and pulled out a win.  
TAYLOR PALMER: I would say Texas. That was a close game, and we went into
overtime, and it was on our home court, too. It was a tough game the whole
game. Our shots weren't really falling, but we stuck it out and went into
overtime and pulled out a huge win, so I'd say Texas.  
MIKE CAREY: What we're laughing about, we played Oklahoma at Oklahoma and they
got 1.2 seconds, whatever, and so we just decided, okay, we're going to switch
everything. Well, Taylor tackled the girl, and she went to the foul line and
ended up missing the second one, so we turned around and we're playing Baylor
at Baylor, and there's like 1.3 seconds, and so I look at Taylor, and I said,
now I'm telling you, don't tackle that girl with this last 1.3 seconds, so
that's what they're laughing about.  
  
Q. Coach, if this was next year, I know it's not, but hypothetically you'd
be playing at home. Your thoughts on that move, and how do you feel about the
fact that potentially you could play on someone's home court like a lot of the
higher seeds?  
MIKE CAREY: You know, I think maybe since I've been at West Virginia, I think
we've played on somebody's home court every year but once, so I mean, it's
something that we've done.  
We've had opportunities where we could have hosted and that, but I was
always‑‑ until we become very, very consistent, I didn't want to look at the
athletic director knowing that we didn't make it and we owe all these
thousands of dollars. So that was pretty much my fault.  
But I felt it's tough. Any time you go play on somebody's home court it's
tough. But I will give this group‑‑ I've said this for two years. This group
is for some reason more focused on the road than they are at home. Next year
that may not be the case, so that may be a little bit different. But this
group for some reason the last two years has been more focused on the road
than they have been at home.  
  
Q. Asya, I understand you have a brother who's in Louisiana right now?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yes.  
  
Q. They've been coming to a lot more of your games this year than we've seen
in the past. What's that meant to you your last season, to have them in the
stands?  
ASYA BUSSIE: It means a lot just because these are like the first games he's
been to since I've been at West Virginia, and he's been to quite a lot this
year. I appreciate him coming to these games, especially my senior year, and
just having him to give me feedback after games and him like motivating me
during the game.  
  
Q. Where is he right now?  
ASYA BUSSIE: New Orleans.  
  
Q. What's he do?  
ASYA BUSSIE: He's at GA at Xavier, in Louisiana.  
  
Q. Men's team?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yes.  
  
Q. Coach Carey, obviously you're at LSU now. Did you ever have any thoughts
about, hey, you might see her when you came down here?  
MIKE CAREY: We wish her the best. It's probably good she had to sit out this
year, so we're not going to be playing against her. I wish her all the best. I
hope she has great success down here at LSU.  
  
Q. Did that cross your mind?  
MIKE CAREY: Not really. Not really. I'm usually out of sight, out of mind to
be honest with you. But no, I wish her‑‑ she's a great young lady. She'll do a
good job down here at LSU, so I wish her only the best.  
  
Q. It was nine years ago when you played Southwest Missouri State there for
the WNIT title. What do you remember about that ‑‑  
MIKE CAREY: They beat us, didn't they? Do you have any good news?  
  
Q. Any type of stuff you may remember that she was doing then?  
MIKE CAREY: She does a great job. They're very organized. Like I said,
everybody knows their role on the team. They take good shots. They play
extremely hard. They put people in the right position. They're well coached.  
I understand that, and we're going to have to play extremely well. You know,
at times we're going to have to hit some shots from the perimeter. I just
think we've got to be in attack mode against it. We always tell the players
when we're playing against a zone for 40 minutes, we'll make some misses,
let's push, let's try to push it up and make things happen before the zone can
set up. That'll be something that will be very important. And then we've got
to take care of the basketball against their 2‑2‑1\.  
  
Q. For Coach, your program seems to sort of adopt the mantra of us against
the world, having to fight. You're kind of on the cusp of flipping that. How
does that change the mentality in terms of coming to play? When do you make
that switch?  
MIKE CAREY: Well, we still have a lot to prove. We haven't done anything in
the NCAAs, and that's been under me. We've got a lot to prove. Our young
ladies, they've played extremely well and hard and the whole thing, but we
have some goals going forward here. We've just got to come out and play. We've
got to come out and do what we've done all year, and they mentioned about
heart and all that. This team probably has more heart, and there's times we
were down during the game, and I'm just there, and they'll come out of there,
Coach, we've got this. I'm like, well, could you do it before long? People are
going to battle and that.  
I want to mention about Asya. Even though she's going to be fronted and we
front, there's got to be weak side and there's got to be ball pressure. If
they're getting a lot of lobs inside, it's because of three things: We're not
putting ball pressure, we're not fronting well or we're not getting weak side
well. There's a lot of things. That's what Asya was talking about is a team
thing.  
  
Q. We're in the Maravich Center. Mike, did you follow Pete Maravich at
all?  
MIKE CAREY: Absolutely. His dad, he used to coach at D & E and West Virginia
there, so yeah, absolutely.  
You know, it's amazing, we'll bring recruits and players to West Virginia and
we'll say do you know who the NBA logo is, and they have no idea, and then you
say Jerry West, and they still have no idea. That's at our place.  
But I can remember being down here working camps at LSU when Craig Carse was
the assistant coach here under Dale Brown, so I've been down here a few times.

_BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Extremely excited to be a participant in the NCAA Tournament.
This team has done a great job of positioning ourselves to compete. Very happy
for the other teams that are here in Baton Rouge, obviously West Virginia,
Albany and Georgia Tech. We wish them luck, as well. Again, when you think
about our team and you look at what this team has accomplished this year, for
the better part of the year, having the toughest schedule in the country,
playing in a very competitive conference in the SEC with the highest RPI
rating, it takes a tremendous athlete to be in this position, and we have a
tremendous team this year.  
  
Q. Theresa, they're such a good offensive rebounding team, and obviously
that's been a point of emphasis for you guys and a challenge for you this
season. Talk about what you tried to do in preparing for this game to be
better at that, and what do you think in terms of what makes them good at
being a rebounding team?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, our two points of emphasis for the past week have
been taking care of the ball and offensive rebounding especially. Coming from
their guard position, their guards do a great job of getting to the rim and
grabbing a lot of open boards for them. In practice we've been doing a lot of
drills that involved boxing out and also matching up out of the box‑out. Ty
does a great job of getting to the rim and so does 'Kilah, and we need to do a
better job of crashing defensively and snagging rebounds and finishing our
defense with a rebound because that ultimately will help us on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. Jeanne, can you draw on the experience of last year being at home and
going two for two and getting to the Sweet 16?  
JEANNE KENNEY: I love when people ask me that because I don't really remember
most of it. I do remember especially in the first game just the energy that
the crowd brought. It's like we have a sixth man on the court with us. I mean,
our fans have been with us for four years now for Theresa and I, and it's an
amazing feeling when you have that type of energy that they can bring, and it
gets me pumped up. I'm an emotional player, so I feed off that very easily?  
The second game Theresa might want to touch on that, but it was just an
amazing experience, and I'm really very honored that we got to leave here on
our home court.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, that second‑round match‑up against Penn State was a
tough one. We went in, one player less of the less players that we had, and
that game was all about determination and heart. We've been together, for our
seniors, and we just didn't want our seniors to go out on that note, and with
that crowd, with the fans, with the boosters, the people that stuck around
with us through our four years here, they really want the best for us, and
they really pulled us through that game. I honestly can't tell you how we won
that game. It was just a big blur. But I know we just scrapped until the
finish, and we definitely couldn't have done it without that crowd there. I
had the chills for like 20 minutes after that game just because I just
couldn't‑‑ that experience was just so unreal to me.  
But being able to come back and play on our home court is definitely a
blessing. We were unsure that we were going to be able to get this home court
in the tournament, and I was a little upset after hearing that last year
because it was such a great experience for our seniors to go out like that
last year. It was a blessing when we found out that we got the bid and we
could play on our home court again.  
  
Q. Jeanne, maybe for those who weren't here last year, remind them why you
may not remember much of the second game last year.  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, not to dwell in the past but I had a bit of a concussion.
That's the reason I don't really remember.  
  
Q. Danielle, obviously defense is important, but you're going to have to
score some points to win this game. They're a very good offensive team. You
stepped up your game in the SEC Tournament. How do you take it upon yourself
to produce offensively like you did in the SEC Tournament?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, you know, I'm going to come in ready to play. I know
that our post players are going to have some good shots, so I'm going to be a
play maker and I'm going to be a scorer, too. That's what my mindset is coming
into the game, giving my teammates different options. If I get a stop I kick
it out to the shooter, if not I lay‑up it up and/or I feed to the post players
because we try to get to the paint.  
  
Q. Knowing the injuries and everything that y'all went into the tournament
with last season and comparing it to this year, the health of this team,
obviously you've been fairly healthy throughout the season, does that give you
more confidence going into the tournament for you guys?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Going into the tournament this year with a full roster of
healthy bodies is a huge step in the right direction when it comes to where we
were last year. I just feel like with our roster we just have so many weapons,
and with everyone completely healthy, everyone is capable of playing to their
fullest potential. That's going to be hard for our opponents to guard because
we just have so many different things that are tough to guard. We have
shooters that can knock down shots, contested shots. We have guards that can
get to the basket by themselves. They don't really need any screens to get
them open. We have post players down low that clean up those shots and can put
those buckets in two feet in the paint real easy.  
Coming in I just feel like it's definitely a confidence booster that we're all
healthy, and it's definitely going to help us continue out the tournament.  
  
Q. Danielle, Tyaunna Marshall, she has a playing style that's similar to
yours. How exciting is it to go against a player like that who's a two ‑
first‑team All‑ACC and leading scorer in Georgia Tech history?   
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, she's a great player. I know it's going to be tough
defending her. In my mind I'm going to say I'm better than her, you know. I'm
just going to try my best to stop her and my teammates stop her. I know she is
a great player. She can score. She can get offensive rebounds, defensive
rebounds, and that's it.  
  
Q. Danielle, Jeanne and Theresa, they're seniors, you're a sophomore. What
have you learned going into the SEC season, now you're going into your second
NCAA Tournament. What do you take with you into that tournament, like how to
prepare and how you get ready? Is it different than the SEC season in your
mind or how do you approach the NCAA Tournament?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, I know the NCAA is like the end, like win or go home.
But I learned a lot just from the upperclassmen, like leadership and about
having heart and just fighting. I'd say, yeah, the NCAA is different than SEC,
but SEC is important, too.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Talk about the SEC.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: I learned a lot, though. I improved on leadership and my
game, my shots and my team.  
  
Q. Coach, you played the tough schedule to get you ready for this moment,
this part of the year. Shah niece said last week that there's no offensive
action you haven't seen, you play lots of different styles and lots of tough
teams. Elaborate what you will deal with with Georgia Tech.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we've had a tough schedule, and we had a tough
non‑conference schedule, as well, playing teams like Rutgers and obviously
Louisville and NC State. We schedule that to help prepare for the SEC, and
then obviously when you get into your SEC Conference play, playing two No.1
seeds with Tennessee three s and South Carolina, you can keep going with Texas
A&M and what Kentucky has been able to do, obviously Georgia has always been
solid, Vanderbilt. You look at the NIT play now with Auburn continuing
post‑season play as well as Mississippi State. There's a lot of great teams in
the SEC, and the teams that typically play that type of schedule, you hope
that it helps you for the NCAAs, and that's the rationale behind it.  
I think the one thing about this group is that they have stayed the course,
although our record may not reflect that, every game that we have competed in,
we've been in the game, and we know that there's some areas that have
challenged us, and we know there's areas that we can be better in. And
Plaisance touched on those areas earlier with us taking care of the basketball
is one, and if we can eliminate teams from getting those second and third
opportunities.  
So if we can focus in on that going into the tournament, which has been our
primary focus, then we're going to have a better shot, a better chance at
winning basketball games. Georgia Tech is a very relentless rebounding team.
We understand that their full‑court pressure, they will try to turn you over.
They want you to make the mistake, and they do a nice job out of their buzz
defense, as well. They've got phenomenal players that can create scoring
opportunities not only for themselves but for their teammates, so we're going
to have to really be cohesive in our defensive attack and making sure that we
don't enable teams like Georgia Tech to have those clear looks at the basket.
We want to make sure that we're guarding the basketball at all s with all five
people.  
This is a team sport, so it's going to require a tremendous amount of team
effort. We're going to win‑‑ if you're going to win this of the year, I do
believe and am a firm believer that you have to control the boards. If you
control the boards, you control the tempo of the game, and if we can master
that area, that will give us a lot better shot at coming away with a win.  
  
Q. Jeanne, you guys have had to earn it this year, a lot of ups, a lot of
downs. I guess people are wondering what kind of team is LSU at this point?
What kind of team do you think you guys can be leading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
JEANNE KENNEY: Well, it's a great slogan, and I feel that that phrase has just
been our motto for the past four years, really, if you really think about it.
I mean, we've had to earn everything that we've gotten. We had to dig deep
last year to get that in, and this year was kind of how I've seen it, last
year in reverse. But still, we earned the right to be here, and that's
something to be noted for. We earned the right to get that bid, and so did 63
other teams.  
So just coming away with that is a great accomplishment and a testament to
everyone involved in the LSU program. This program is so special to me
personally, and I just want to give everything I can to keep the name and keep
the program alive, and that's kind of how I've taken it this year. I think our
identity is that it's going to be a fight. Even if we're down, we're going to
come back, and we proved that and again. And if we're up, we have to maintain
that lead.  
But any you're going to play as if it's going to be a fight, and I firmly
believe that.  
  
Q. For both of the seniors, if you could give me a word or a phrase that you
think really appropriately describes this year's version of LSU basketball,
and whoever has got it first just go ahead and start.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: A phrase that could just put this year into one word?  
  
Q. It can be a couple.  
JEANNE KENNEY: I've got you. We got this quote, coach Tony Perotti found this
quote, and it was basically you have two types of players: One that's going to
try hard and practice and try hard and do what they can do, and then there's
the other one that said, over my dead body. And that's the mentality that we
have right now. Like it's all business right now. There's‑‑ I mean, it's March
Madness. Anything can happen, and we've seen that and again. But I mean, it's
literally win or go home, and it's that over my dead body mentality that I'm
sticking to.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I would say something like‑‑ maybe like a unified roller
coaster ride, okay. We've had our ups and our downs, and we've beaten a top 10
team and then we've had losses that we don't even really know how it happened,
but they ended up in the L column. Through it all, the team, the people on the
team, really stuck together as a family. We never bickered. We never
splintered. At the end of the day we all stuck together and we all love each
other and we all care about each other and we all want what's best for the
girl sitting next to us. That's what it all came down to. We care a lot about
every single person in that locker room, and we wouldn't want to see the
person next to us hurt in any way. So I think that's what keeps us fighting is
that we don't want to see the disappointment or like the upset on people's
faces after a loss.  
You know, that's really kept us in a lot of games, and just the will and the
determination from everybody is just going to raise in this tournament. I just
feel like we have great team camaraderie, and that's really going to help us
pull ourselves through this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, this is kind of an early start for you Sunday 11:30 in the
morning. What message could you send to your fans saying, hey, we need you out
here?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, you know, there's 8:00, 9:00 services, so after services
you can rush over here to the P‑MAC. We've got an 11:50 tip. So we're excited
about the fact that we have such a tremendous community here, and obviously
our student‑athletes have done a nice job of just being in the community and
giving back. We would appreciate our fans coming out and supporting all the
games that are here because the West Virginia game will follow against Albany,
and the other thing that they will see, they're going to see four teams that
have different styles of play, but it's going to be competitive, it's going
to‑‑ you're going to see a lot of what we call positive‑energy plays. You're
going to see teams diving on the floor. You're going to see great shooting.
You're going to see tremendous athletes. So it's going to be a great
environment to bring your family and friends out to, and then obviously I want
to say ticket prices are $27 for the entire tournament, so it's very
affordable, and obviously we would love for our community to come out and
support women's basketball.  
  
Q. You've proven before against Penn State last year and you've proven
before against Tennessee in January that you can beat strong teams. Does that
give you confidence coming into this tournament?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I have it. My playing career is over, been over, but
they have. No, this group has proven that they have a sense of urgency about
them late in the season, and obviously we caught fire last year, but this is a
new team, and this is a team that I think Theresa touched on, there's a lot of
different weapons, but more importantly this team has grown a lot. Since the
SEC Tournament, they have been in what I call boot camp, and it's been tough,
and we're in better shape, much better shape. But this group has‑‑ they have
what it takes. It's just a matter of can we put it out there for 40 minutes,
and they're very capable. When they put their mind to accomplishing a task,
they can do it, but they've got to be in sync with one another. So that's the
beauty of having so many different personalities on our team.  
But with that being said, the leadership is a major component of why we are
here and sitting here today, because we've had great leaders step up and take
the reins of this team, and we've had eager followers, so if you can have that
combination then you can pretty much accomplish anything.

Louisiana, excited to be at LSU. It's a great place, and we're really anxious
to get playing. We haven't played for two weeks because our conference
championship was a while back, so we're really hungry and humble right now. So
we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Sarah and Megan, you've been to two of them, Shereesha, you went last
year. How valuable is NCAA Tournament experience where you take the long
flight and it's not foreign to you.  
MEGAN CRAIG: I think it's very important. Obviously many of us were here last
year so we have great experience on our side. We've provided some great advice
to our freshmen so they know what to expect, they know what they're coming
into. I believe it's very beneficial, as well. We know coming into a space
where we're not confused, we're not nervous, but we're excited, and we're
ready to work hard. I'm excited to get back on the court again. It's been a
long time coming.  
I think I can speak for everyone else here and all the veterans that we've
provided some great advice for our younger ones.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Like Megan said, it's very important for our school that
we are here. A lot of teams don't get this opportunity to be here, so it's
very exciting for us to be here. Having this experience last year and coming
back, we know what to expect. We know what to go out and do and we've informed
our freshmen what to expect, as well. So they'll be prepared and be on the
same page with us, and just ready to go.  
SARAH ROYALS: Well, for me and Megan, this is actually our third NCAA trip,
which is a blessing. We've played these kind of games before. Our coaching
staff puts our schedule in the preseason, we play teams like Duke, we've
played Michigan State, we've played Iowa, a bunch of those teams just to
prepare us for these moments so when we do get to the NCAA Tournament that we
are prepared and we're not nervous and we don't feel the same pressure.
Obviously our team is led by our upperclassmen, and when we get in this
situation I think we're going to be fine.  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Yeah, I just‑‑ just with these three and the
upperclassmen, I always say to them just so they understand it, that there's
recall in their bodies, in their brains, and so they've been here before, and
that's huge. I mean, experience, it speaks for itself, but once you get out on
the floor, it happened in our conference tournament, their recall of
experience of winning a championship, a conference championship and now coming
back to the NCAA, I just think their recall is incredible, especially with
these three.  
  
Q. I know West Virginia or this coach has always been known for its defense
and playing pressure. What's stood out to you as you've looked at some tapes
of West Virginia as far as their defense?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Personally we watched a lot of film. We know they're a very
athletic team, very defensive team. But I truly believe that we can keep up
with them. We're a great team, as well. We have a lot of talent, and we can
use that to our advantage, and I truly believe that this will be a great game
tomorrow, great fight, and whoever comes out on top comes out on top.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: We're a great defensive team, as well, so we're ready to
handle their pressure. It's not pressure we haven't been used to, so whoever
they bring we're ready for, and we will bring our pressure, as well.  
  
Q. Coach Carey earlier said that they have to adjust to you guys' 2 ‑2‑1
zone. What do you think you have to do to take away some of their
opportunities?   
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I mean, West Virginia plays‑‑ obviously they're a very
high‑caliber team, but they have some of the same playing styles and some of
the techniques that we use against teams in our own league. Obviously, again,
it's more high caliber, but they're obviously all very athletic, very
aggressive, strong, physical. But if we can make them take outside shots or we
just need to make sure that we keep them on the paint and play the kind of
defense that we're capable of, we have very unique zone and hopefully it'll
give them a lot of trouble.  
  
Q. This is actually for the players, please. If you could just give me a
word or a phrase that you think really well described this year's team, I'd
appreciate it.  
MEGAN CRAIG: I truly believe it's talent. We're very talented.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: I would say a chip, playing with a chip.  
SARAH ROYALS: I think coach Abe said it best: Hungry and humble I think
describes us best.  
  
Q. Shereesha, can you elaborate on the chip, the chip that you play with on
your shoulders?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Well, coming into this, a lot of people won't expect us to
win. Hopefully a lot of people are rooting for us to win, but you know, we're
the underdog, so we really don't have anything to lose and we're just coming
out ready to just play hard and fight to the last minute. As I said, like
playing with a chip, that's what we want to do. We want to show West Virginia
that we're not just another team who's not going to come out and fight. We're
going to come out and fight for the win out there, play our game and play
hard.  
  
Q. This is for all three players: You guys have talked about the experience
or mentioned it. Where do you feel the cumulative effect of that shows up in a
game like tomorrow? Is it the ability to stay focused for 40 minutes or where
do you feel like that shows up the most in a game like this one?  
SARAH ROYALS: To be honest, I feel like it shows‑‑ you always look at the
first five minutes of a game, and it's very hectic, it's very aggressive, and
I always say that that's like the hurricane at the beginning of the game. But
once we settle down and we adjust to the game and we all know what to expect,
then I think that's where that experience comes in. It's just another game. We
can easily play with them and we can handle the pressure, as long as we play
our style and go and play our game plan and stick to it, then we'll be able to
execute and hopefully come out with a win.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Sarah said it best.  
MEGAN CRAIG: Just piggybacking off Sarah, I think the experience we have on
our hands, us upperclassmen have the ability to stay poised, especially in
high‑intensity situations, and that poise and control will help with the game
plan that Coach Abe provides us and the other coaches. As long as we keep in
control, stay poised, stay calm but play our game, play hard, I truly believe
it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Katie, you've coached against Mike Carey before in the WNIT Finals. Has
anything really changed?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Well, I remember us winning a national
championship in the WNIT, and he does, too, because he made a little comment
to me today about it.  
But he's a great coach, and he's been there for quite a while, so he's got a
lot of staying power, so obviously he's a great coach and they love him there.
It's the same style. We don't change much as coaches. We're kind of stubborn
in that sense.  
I just think that his team is a little bit more athletic. They've got a little
bit more height on them than they did back then, and the funny thing about
their team is they've got a lot of kids from New Jersey and New York on their
team and Connecticut, so it's kind of like a New York‑Connecticut final game
again, but great coach, great coaching staff. I know them all well and respect
them totally.  
  
Q. Coach, when people talk about West Virginia they talk about the balance
they have. You might be able to shut down one player but they can do it with
somebody else. What kind of challenges does that bring in trying to prepare
for a team like this that goes nine deep?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: Right. Well, I think that because we play a
match‑up zone that we don't have to necessarily worry so much about individual
style of play. We're just going to play the way we play in our zone, and we
don't have to worry about this one goes left, this one goes right, this one
shoots a three, this one does this, this one does that. They have one unique
player in No.20 that is their big, best post player and their biggest size
they have, and the rest, I always say they're all like Shereesha: Very
athletic, six foot and up. We all know they're deep, but we don't have to
match up with them man‑to‑man. That's kind of a blessing on our part.  
  
Q. I noticed half your roster is international players. Is that something by
design or just something that came to be that way?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: I couldn't find any more Sarah Royals up in
Connecticut. It's really just my coaching connections. I played professionally
in New Zealand. That's how I found Megan. I have a little bit of a Jamaican
connection because my husband is Jamaican, and a lot of people that the
international connection that we have, the only one that really came from a
different country is Megan. Everybody else was in the United States. But now
Shereesha is from Jamaica, and she is, and Tammy Phillip went to junior
college in Arizona. But it's just my connections of a lot of places I've been.  
I really want to recruit high‑caliber players, and sometimes when you come to
a new program and it's in a different league, some kids are like, I want to go
bigger time, and so I kind of steer away from those kind of kids. I want kids
that want to come to a family situation, are great academic students and are
great basketball players. So if I can't get them right away in any of the
States, I'm going to go look elsewhere because I want high‑caliber players on
our team.  
So we've been really fortunate, and I'm old so I have a lot of great
connections out there. It wasn't really by design, it was just kind of who I
knew, and I kind of went after those type of kids that want to be involved in
family, academics and basketball.  
  
Q. Shereesha, what do you remember about last year's NCAA Tournament, and
how is it different this year?  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Last year everything was definitely new because that's my
first time being in the NCAA Tournament, but it was a lot of excitement. I
wasn't nervous, I was ready to play, ready to go. At the same time I'm taking
what's going on around me and enjoying the moment while I'm there.  
And this year there's no nervous, no nothing, just ready to go from the start,
from the get‑go. It should be a lot of fun this year being this my second time
around. I'm just ready to go play hard, have fun, get my team ready to go.
That's about it.  
  
Q. Shereesha and Megan, talk a little bit about the net ball that you played
growing up and how that did or didn't help you going into basketball?  
MEGAN CRAIG: Well, obviously net ball is a sport played in our countries, and
it's a very disciplined style. I compare it to basketball a little bit. It
makes you be more accurate with your shooting, you hold your space with your
defenders to create space and get away from them. Your passing is more
accurate. It's a more accurate version of basketball. I played for over 10
years, 15 years, and so it was a big sport in my life. Pretty sure Shereesha
can say it was in hers, too.  
SHEREESHA RICHARDS: Yeah, I pretty much played net ball all my life until I
was 16. It's a lot of fun, definitely a lot different from basketball. But in
my opinion it helped me with my vertical jump. I have a great vertical jump I
like to say because we actually did a lot of jumping stuff and running, so for
me it helped on that part.  
But transition, mostly for me was learning to juggle because net ball you
pass, you move. Basketball you're dribbling and running and doing so much
stuff, so many different stuff. Yeah, it's just a whole different sport from
basketball, but at the same time it's like fun.  
  
Q. The height of the goal is different?  
MEGAN CRAIG: There's no backboard, you can't shoot with a backboard. It's just
straight in the hole. It makes you really think more about your shot and more
about accuracy and discipline. That's what I learned.  
  
Q. Were you guys inspired by the play of your men's team, and do you have
those exotic ‑looking uniforms that they had?   
KATIE ABRAHAMSON‑HENDERSON: No, obviously we're proud of them. They went out
there and they fought like‑‑ I love it because it's always the underdog, and
the whole time it was like what's wrong with the other team and not how good
our team was doing. We watched the game.  
No, we don't have those uniforms. We get to choose our style of uniforms and
stuff, but those are a little unique. But obviously you noticed them, so
that's a good thing. I see that as a positive thing. They went out there and
they played their hearts out. It was really neat to watch, and I know it
inspired our players a lot.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  83  
Iowa  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. We'll start with an opening
statement from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First, again, we'd just like to congratulate Iowa on a great
season. We definitely did not come into this game and expect this score to be
what it was. They're a very, very good offensive team. We knew we were going
to have to play extremely well at the defensive end. That's something that we
did tonight.  
I'm really proud of every single one of our players. Defensively that's one of
the best performances we've had this entire season. We followed a scouting
report. We did not help off of shooters. We forced them to finish shots. Just
really, really pleased with how we defended tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, it's kind of ironic you were up by 30 points, laughing and smiling
on the court. What went right early in the second half that allowed you to
make that big push?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We went into the halftime feeling good because we hit that
shot. All the momentum was in our favor. For us to continue that, keep going
with it, we did a great job of it.  
They had a turnover at the first possession they got. So we just took
advantage, you know, of what we could do.  
  
Q. Shoni, you guys hit some tough shots in the first half. It seemed like
you broke down their defense a little bit. Talk about how well you did that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Our coaches do a great job of getting us what we need‑‑
prepared for what we need to do on the court. We just took advantage of it.  
There's a couple shots were contested and whatnot. At the same time we're
focused on shooting those shots. We do them every day in practice.  
For us to have that flow, it helped us out there on the court.  
  
Q. Shoni, do you feel like you played better than that at any time this
season?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think this was a great game for us. For us to come together
at the right time, for us to peak, keep peaking, especially in the NCAA
tournament, I think this is a great group of people that understand what our
coaches want us to do.  
This was a great game for us. Hopefully it only goes up from here.  
  
Q. What did coach say to you when you came off the court? A little chest
pump.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: He just said, Good job. We all did a great job. He just said,
Good job.  
  
Q. Antonita, you've been through a lot this year. Tough things you've been
through physically, emotionally. Put into perspective, here you are, headed
back to the Sweet 16 and able to play.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: It's a blessing to be here, just to be able to be on the
court with my teammates. Our goal is to get to Nashville. We never lost sight
of that.  
Kudos to my teammates, the staff, my family for never letting me get down on
myself, fighting adversity and making the best of it.  
  
Q. Tia, can you talk about the intensity and focus that you seemed to have.
Didn't seem to ever let up at any time in the game. What do you think led to
that?  
TIA GIBBS: I think, like Shoni said, we're trying to peak at the right times.
We take every possession seriously. We don't really try to pay attention to
the score. It's the game. We're trying to prepare for Nashville, not
necessarily just this game.  
We stay focused no matter what. We've had a good weekend of preparation, a lot
of film. The team was focused, dialed in 100%. I think we're all just excited
to be playing right now, excited to get back home to our fans, do our job.  
We taught them to do theirs and get tickets early, so we had to do ours.  
  
Q. Tia, talk about what it was like to play so well on the road. Was that a
surprise at all?  
TIA GIBBS: We actually like big crowds, no matter if it's for us or against
us. The excitement, it kind of trickles over to us. The intensity was there.
We knew we had to not only play well on offense but defense we had to lock up.
I think that was our main focus. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Shoni, coach talked about playing with a chip on your shoulder, earning
respect. How much has that played into your intensity these past two games?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We're just excited to be here. For us to go each gameone at a
time, take it one at a time, that's what works for us. Whoever it may be,
we'll dial in and focus on whoever it is.  
We're excited to be here and keep playing. We're definitely excited to get
back and go home and play in front of our fans.  
  
Q. Antonita, talk about the two threes you hit back ‑to‑back putting you up
36 at that point. Did you feel like that was a culmination of everything? Talk
about that moment a little bit.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: My teammates were definitely looking for me, hitting
shots. We're not a selfish team. We were making extra passes out there,
getting the ball to the open person.  
  
Q. Shoni, last year you were considered an underdog. You knocked off the
overall No.1 seed. West Virginia is upset. You're going to be facing LSU. Do
you consider yourselves an underdog?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: We are a three seed.  
  
Q. You're playing a six seed. Is that energy you use as an underdog?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: To some degree, yes. But at the same time we're excited to
be here and we're excited to play. We're ready to get back on our home court
and take on whoever it may be.  
I think we're just ready and we're excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You shot 54% from the field, forced 19 turnovers, beat a team that almost
won the Big Ten tournament at home by 30. Is this exactly how you want to be
playing heading home?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah. We're really excited about things. Offensively, you know, we
felt that we could get shots that we wanted to get, it was just a matter of
being able to make them.  
I thought we passed the ball extremely well. We only ended up with 14 assists,
but we made the extra pass a lot tonight which led to some pull‑up jump shots
by Shoni that don't count as an assist because it's not directly off the pass.  
I thought our kids did a fantastic job on the offensive end. And defensively
our whole game plan was to try to keep the ball out of Logic's hands as much
as we possibly could. She ends up going 6‑11 from the field. I thought she
shot it well, but I thought we made her work the entire night. I'm not sure
there's been a game all year where she's had nine turnovers.  
We always had somebody there. I thought Jude Schimmel and Bria Smith did a
fantastic job of trying to harass her. I thought our four players did a great
job of not allowing her to get to the basket. She's as good as I've seen. I
was fortunate enough to coach Lindsay Whalen for one year, and that's exactly
who she reminds me of. I hope she'll take it as a compliment.  
Samantha I thought was the key to their team and I thought we did a great job
of making things hard for her.  
  
Q. What did you think about the 40 minutes of intensity that you had, focus?
Was that as happy as you've been?  
COACH WALZ: We competed. We played hard. That's exactly what we have to do. I
kept challenging them. I knew they weren't going to quit. Iowa's too well of a
coached team to think that they were just going to quit.  
Those kids play hard. So we could not let up. I told them that at halftime. I
said, We have to come out and execute perfect what we're trying to do at the
start of the second half, and we did. We executed back‑to‑back plays to
perfection, a 10‑2 run to start the second half. I think that was a dagger.  
I know they're coming out going, Hey, we have to chip it away, get it down to
15, to 10, then go from there. We didn't allow that to happen. I was really,
really pleased with our mental and physical effort the entire ballgame.  
  
Q. What did you think about Shoni setting the tone with her focus, whipping
passes around?  
COACH WALZ: She played well. She played exactly what we expect. In my opinion
the kid's an All‑American. She's performed that well all season long. I'd be
shocked if she's not.  
She made some big shots today. She made some tough shots. Then she made some
big‑time passes. The pass she makes to Tia when she draws two there at the end
of the half was a big‑time pass. You're up 15. We got a lot of momentum. Then
all of a sudden she makes that, Tia hits it, and now we're going into the half
with all of it. We're excited, plus it's our ball to start the second half.  
I thought she played extremely well.  
Bria and Jude played well. Bria and Jude defensively were fantastic for us.
I'm not sure Jude called bank on that 1‑3 in the second half, which was a big
shot, too. Shot clock is running out, you bank it in, that's when you know
things are going well for you.  
  
Q. What did you think about how well they responded, on the road, in front
of a pretty good crowd?  
COACH WALZ: We played well. Is there some room for improvement? Of course.
Honestly, if you were to tell me that we'd at one point be up 38, and Sara
Hammond does not score, she plays 16 minutes with four fouls, Asia Taylor
plays 12 minutes with four fouls, I never thought that would be possible.  
I still am a big believer that Sara and Asia are the two for us, that we're
going to go as far as they take us because that's our mismatch. That is our
big mismatch that we have 'cause we've got two four players. Sara goes to the
five at times. They can step out and shoot the basketball from 15 to 18 feet.
All of a sudden, how do you guard it?  
Asia started the game with a nice shot fake. They got Doolittle up in the air,
drives, finishes. She's knocking down the free‑throw line jump shot. When
she's doing things like that, it's really, really hard for teams to defend us.  
Sara got called for some early fouls that I'm looking forward to having the
chance to watch the film. She was just trying to post up on the one, setting
the screen on the other, which I'm not sure they're actually good fouls.  
Those are things that we'll talk with her about 'cause we're going to need her
from here on out.  
  
Q. You mentioned on Sunday how it blows your mind that you get to play at
home. What is it going to be like for your fans to be able to play on your
home floor in the regionals?  
COACH WALZ: It's a big advantage. Is it going to guarantee you a win? No. But
we're going to get the chance to go home. We'll get back tomorrow around
10:00, 11:00 or so. Our kids will be back in class on Thursday and Friday.  
It's going to be normal days. They'll sit there, they'll sleep in their own
beds. The familiarity that you get from being able to play at home, it's
great. Your fans are there. Your locker room. All of that.  
I hope we can take advantage of it and use it to our advantage. But you've got
four great teams that are going to be playing, and we know that we're going to
have to come prepared to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  83  
Iowa  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. We'll start with an opening statement
from Coach Bluder.  
COACH BLUDER: First of all, I congratulate Louisville. They came out and
played very, very well, especially defensively. They made us struggle
offensively.  
They only scored four points over their average, but it was their defense that
just took us out of our game.  
Thank the crowd for coming out here this late of a night on a weeknight. I
want to thank our administration for hosting this event. They did just a great
job again like they always do in hosting national events. They make Iowa
proud. Unfortunately our team didn't make Iowa proud tonight. That's something
we're probably going to think about for a long time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Samantha, tell us what the Louisville defense did that stopped you guys
from doing the things you wanted to do tonight.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: We knew they were going to have pressure. We knew they were
going to have some traps, different defenses. It wasn't anything we weren't
expecting. We just really didn't execute.  
We know how to break a team who do things like that. We've played teams like
that in the Big Ten, in our non‑conference. Our coaches prepared us for that.  
We just got out of our offense. We didn't execute. We did in the first four
minutes and after that we didn't score enough. We didn't shoot the ball very
well, I didn't think. I thought we had a lot of open threes that we just
didn't put down today.  
A lot of good shots. If you're turning the ball over and not shooting the ball
well, it's not going to be easy to win a game.  
  
Q. Sam, going into this game, what was the game plan defensively with
Schimmel?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: With a player like Schimmel, you're not going to stop her,
you're not going to hold her to zero points. You just got to try to limit her
touches, limit her shot attempts, make her take tough ones.  
I thought in the first half we did a little better job of that. Her team made
a couple tough shots. Had a three‑bank in at the end of the shot clock. Some
of those things you can't control. When they're tough shots, she's going to
make some tough shots.  
Second half she got to the line a lot, got her points there, but also again
hit some open threes.  
You have to try to contain, you're not going to control a player like that.
You just have to try to limit everything they do because she's a flat‑out
scorer and that's what she did for her team.  
  
Q. Theairra, how would you summarize this season?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Awesome. I played with a great group of girls, great coaching
staff. We didn't go out the way we wanted to. But coach said we can't remember
the season off of just this game.  
This is one of my favorite seasons being here as a Hawk‑Eye. It's something I
want to remember as a wonderful journey.  
  
Q. Theairra, what are you going to remember most about your career? Is it
overcoming adversity?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: No. It will be the connections with my teammates. It's a
great group of girls in that locker room. I've played with so many players.
They still contact me now. Just building those relationships that last longer
than those basketball memories, so...  
That's what I'll remember most.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations on a great season.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. It started well enough for you. It was 11 ‑11\. Things kind of dried up.
What kind of turned there?  
COACH BLUDER: We scored about one point in the seven minutes at that point. I
felt like for some reason we went away from things that were working for us in
the first few minutes of the game. I thought we had some great drives to the
basket. We got in a little bit of foul trouble, unfortunately. That hurts us.  
I thought they did a nice job of really, you know, keeping the ball out of
Sam's hands. They did a tremendous job with that.  
Louisville, they did a great job. They did a great job defensively. They hit
tough shots. Defensively, I don't think our defense was that bad the first
half. I think they hit some tough shots. Offensively, that's what is
disheartening.  
  
Q. Talk about Theairra, what she's meant to you and this program.  
COACH BLUDER: I really couldn't do that when she was in here but (tearing up).  
Team loves her. Just wanted this for her really badly.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. We'll take an opening statement
from coach.  
COACH WALZ: Just, again, honored to still be playing. We know we're going to
have a battle on our hands tomorrow night. Iowa's a fantastic basketball club.
Very well‑coached. They play extremely hard.  
Any time you can put five players in double figures, you're doing something
right. Just really, really impressed with watching them on film, and even more
impressed when I've had the opportunity to watch them in person.  
The crowd I thought was fantastic last night, very loud, knowledgeable fans.
They know when to cheer. They're not just here enjoying a ballgame.  
The one thing I did hear over and over, hopefully I'll get a chance to see it,
I was told the ice cream cones were fantastic here. I was told they were about
that big. Is that true out there (laughter)? I'm looking forward to hopefully
getting a chance to get one.  
But it's been a first‑class event. It's been run extremely well. Everybody has
been very professional. We're just excited to have the opportunity to play
tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sara, what did you think about the fact you are very highly ranked but
you have to come and play a road game essentially? What is y'all's mentality
going into that?  
SARA HAMMOND: It's NCAA tournament. It's win or go home. No matter where we're
placed, no matter who we're playing, we got to bring our A game every night.  
Coming into Iowa, playing on their home court, like coach said, a great
environment. I think it's going to be a great ballgame. They're a very good
ballclub. Their five starters are averaging double figures. They have many
weapons.  
I think our mentality is the same every game. We have to bring our A game.
Defensively we have to rebound, limit our turnovers, get our offense and kind
of do what we did last night, make a lot of shots.  
I think it's going to be a great game between two good teams and hopefully we
come out with a victory.  
  
Q. The way this is set up, do you feel this is the toughest hurdle on the
way back to the Final Four because you're on the road? What concerns you most
about Iowa? Is it their balance? Just the fact you're playing here?  
ASIA TAYLOR: I think they're definitely a great team. Like coach said, in the
tournament everybody's a good team. That's why they made it here.  
We're not taking this lightly at all. We're not looking past this game. We
just want to go out and play our game and we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Sara, how important do you feel like Jude's role is to the team, what she
brings off the bench?  
SARA HAMMOND: Same thing I said last night. Jude is the spark and energy we
need off the bench. When things aren't going our way offensively and
defensively, she sets the tone, kind of gets our run going.  
Obviously she made a big difference when she came out on the floor last night.
We went on a big run. I think you give credit to her defense. She pressured
their point guard, got her a little rattled and got her hands on some balls,
deflections, steals, got our transition going. I think that got everybody's
confidence going.  
Once we see Jude doing her thing, she's leading us on the court at the point
guard spot, tell us where we need to be, what we need to be doing. She's a big
key to this team going down the road. I'm glad she's doing great when we need
her to right now in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach.  
  
Q. Do you think the challenge of playing what is in essence a true road game
in the NCAA tournament, is it more that there's 7,000 people cheering against
you or because you're playing a team that's comfortable shooting in this
gym?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's a little bit of both. Again, I mean, it's something we
were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do last year as a five seed.
Purdue had to come to our place and play.  
It's nothing that you can sit here and worry about. The goals are 10 foot. We
had the opportunity to get a game under our belt last night. I think it's more
of an impact when it's your first game in someone's arena.  
At the same time you get the opportunity to come in here and practice the day
before. So we have a good feel for the arena. I thought we shot the ball well
yesterday. That's not much of a factor, I don't believe.  
The home crowd is always nice. If you're doing well, they're getting loud. If
you need a pick‑me‑up, they get behind you and get things going.  
Sure, I mean, would we like to be playing at home? Of course. But, you know,
you've got to go on the road and win games in your conference. You've got to
go on the road and win games in the NCAA tournament right now. So that's what
we have to do.  
Like I said in last night's press conference, I'm not sure it's ever going to
happen in my time. But our game is continuing to grow, it's continuing to
build fans, to get attendance up. Hopefully one day you'll see women's
basketball being able to go to neutral sites for the entire NCAA tournament.  
You never know what can happen. But until that time comes, there are going to
be some teams that are going to have to play games on home courts in order to
advance.  
  
Q. Correct me if I'm wrong, but next year are they going to a system where
the top four seeds get to host?  
COACH WALZ: That's what we're doing, yeah.  
  
Q. Do you consider that a more fair method?  
COACH WALZ: I'm not a big fan of any of that. I'd like to see us try to go
back to putting eight teams at a site. I sit here and try to fight. See if we
can't give it three or four years to see if we could build that.  
When you get back to the top four seeds hosting, then I think you're going to
see the top 16 teams probably in the Sweet 16 each year. When you're getting a
chance to play on a home court in the first two rounds, it's a big advantage,
especially when you're the higher seed.  
We're trying to do whatever we can in women's basketball to continue to grow
the game, continue to get the fan support.  
I'm glad this is a one‑year test for the regionals. I think you play your
first two games at home or you go to home sites, you have your advantages. I'm
glad it's just a one‑year deal where the regionals are going to be on a home
court.  
If we're fortunate enough to be able to advance after tomorrow night, it's
going to be a tall task in front of us, we're getting the opportunity to go
back home and play on our home court. Stanford, they get to play at home if
they win, Notre Dame. I'm not a fan of being able to play at home to get to a
Final Four. That's where you start getting concerned about, Golly, is this
what we want to do?  
I'm proud of our coaches, our coaching association. When this came out, I
think everybody just expressed their concern if we were to continue to do
this. I give a lot of credit to the NCAA, our women's basketball committee for
saying, Hey, okay, we hear y'all, now we'll go back to neutral sites for the
regionals from here on out.  
  
Q. The game last year against Purdue, do you think y'all would have won that
game had it been at Purdue?  
COACH WALZ: I don't know. That's a really good question. I thought we played
well. Part of it is, is it the fact you're playing at home in front of your
home crowd?  
I think we're 17‑1 at home with our one loss to UConn. We've had success
playing at home. Iowa's played extremely well here.  
Is it a benefit? Of course, it is. If it wasn't, teams wouldn't bid to host
the first and second round. We've been on the positive side of that, too. Now
we have to make sure we come out here and just play basketball and not worry
about where the game's being played.  
  
Q. What do you think about the balance that Iowa has, their starters? Logic
almost had a triple ‑double last night.   
COACH WALZ: They're a great basketball team. Their point guard, Samantha, is
just a very heady basketball player, understands the game, does a fantastic
job of getting her team organized. Very impressed with her at timeouts, free
throws, how she's constantly coaching. She's out there getting everyone
involved. I was really impressed with her.  
Their five player does a great job around the basket. She's able to step out
and shoot the ball from 10 to 15 feet.  
Then you've got the other three guards that are out there shooting the
basketball extremely well. Their freshman is playing with a lot of confidence.
Was really impressed with the fact that she struggled some in the first half
shooting the ball last night, but did not let that affect how she played at
both ends of the floor. Then she comes out and gets an open look to start the
second half and hits it. I watched her. She ran up the court. You could read
her lips, Finally! After that she played with a lot of confidence.  
It's a ballclub that presents a lot of problems for us. We're going to have to
defend extremely well. We're going to have to defend the three‑point line
well. When you shoot close to 50%, I think they were 12 of 25 from the
three‑point line, we definitely don't want to give them wide‑open looks.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you feel like the importance of Jude has been to
the team, playing as the other Schimmel sister.  
COACH WALZ: Jude has made a name for herself. She's no longer Shoni's sister.
Jude has performed well enough to pass two and a half years for everyone to
know, Hey, it's Jude Schimmel. Jude's basketball IQ is as high as anyone on
our team. She understands where the ball has to go, who needs the ball, who is
shooting it well.  
Defensively she just seems to be in the right spot at the right time. She has
come up with so many big steals for us throughout her career, some
game‑winning baskets, some game‑winning stops, things you can't teach. That's
because the kid loves the game. She's always asking me questions during
practice, what we're trying to get done, where should she be on defense, what
we're looking for.  
So Jude's a very, very vital part of this ballclub. I like having her come off
the bench. I like what she brings us. Just really looking forward to her
continuing to play as well as she has been.  
  
Q. This seems to be more an issue on the men's side of the tournament. You
have coaches publicly frustrated with the travel schedule, tight playing
schedules. Have you had any issues?  
COACH WALZ: No. We had four mini vans. It was a hell of a trip. A family
vacation.  
No, we chartered up here. Things went smooth as can be. They actually asked me
my opinion, Did we want to fly back tomorrow night or on Wednesday morning? So
we had the option of making trips either time.  
You know, I think a lot of it comes down to it, and I could be wrong, but
especially the first two days, when you have the men's tournament going and
the women's tournament going, the NCAA is trying to get a lot of teams a lot
of places.  
I know they don't own planes. They have to go out and find the inventory to
fly these teams back and forth. I think they've done a great job. Our travel
has been fantastic. Our hotel is great. We're very pleased with how our travel
has gone.  
  
Q. Can you think back to what it was like recruiting Jude. Were you looking
for her? When did you realize she was on your level, a player you wanted? Can
you also maybe contrast her with Shoni, Jude's game compared to that.  
COACH WALZ: Shoni's game is more flashy. She's going to make some plays that
you normally don't expect people to make. She's making the no‑look pass.  
Jude gets it done. Jude is not the flashy type of ball player. But at the end
of the day when you look at her stat line, you're like, Hey, that's a solid
ballgame. Last night 2‑4 at the three‑point line, comes up with some rebounds,
steals, four assists I believe. Just a solid game. There was nothing during
like that you were like, Wow! She just gets it done.  
Like I said, Shoni has more of the flair to her game. That's the thing that
separates those two. Shoni is a better scorer, that's what she does. Jude sets
people up. She can knock down shots when she needs to. She's got a nice
pull‑up jump shot. Jude is more of a pure point guard.  
In the recruitment of them, we had the opportunity to see them both play
because they played on the same AAU team. Again, if you just watch Shoni, you
may have missed Jude. But Jude held her own. Jude competes. That's one thing
you can't measure. You can't measure a kid's heart. That's what she did all
the summers I saw her play, the high school games I saw her play. Jude wants
to win.  
Every kid says they want to win, but it's the ones that are willing to go
above and beyond that really attract your eye. That's what Jude does.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH WALZ: Thanks, everybody.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. Coach, if you could start with some
opening comments.  
COACH BLUDER: Well, last night's game was enjoyable for us. I thought we
played well. I wish we could sit around and enjoy it a lot longer, but
unfortunately we got to enjoy it for about an hour and then all thoughts
shifted quickly to Louisville and being able to play them today.  
Obviously a tremendous team, a team that a lot of people around the country
questioned why they were a three seed. When you only lose four games, three of
them are to the number one team in America, it's pretty crazy to think of them
being a three seed when they've been ranked in the top all year long.  
We know we have a difficult challenge. We have a lot of respect for their
program, what they did last year, being national runner‑up.  
At the same time it's a new year. We have the opportunity to play at home.
We're going to give them our best effort.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Theairra, you've been through this. Do you feel this is your best chance
to get to the Sweet 16?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Yeah, I feel like this is the perfect team to do so. We've
been so close, gotten to this mark so many times. Frankly we're sick of doing
it. We're going to go out and give it our best shot.  
  
Q. Ally, what have you seen of Louisville so far? What do you think the
biggest challenge they present is?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: I mean, obviously having played just yesterday, we didn't
have a lot of time to look at them before yesterday's game. We just watched
scout now.  
They're a very talented team. Pretty balanced in scoring. Great on the boards.
But we're just going to have to focus on playing Iowa basketball, sticking to
our fundamentals, what we know how to do, hopefully coming out and just
execute.  
  
Q. Melissa, what do you think about the advantage or benefit that you get to
play them at home? How much can that help you?  
MELISSA DIXON: It's absolutely a benefit to us. We're used to playing in
Carver. We didn't have to travel anywhere. We've been sleeping in our own
beds. We're used to playing at Carver together, so it's definitely an
advantage to us.  
  
Q. Melissa, does it feel, even at home, like the NCAA?  
MELISSA DIXON: It feels a little different. Carver looks a little different
with all the NCAA stuff. It looks really cool in there.  
It's still Carver to us. We're used to playing here. We practice here every
day.  
  
Q. What kind of challenges do they present offensively?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Well, they're great in transition. They can shoot the ball
really well. Obviously they have Schimmel. She's been playing extremely well
for them. Top player in the country.  
We just have to go out, communicate, do what we did last night. Again, just
play Iowa basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. What kind of matchup does Shoni Schimmel provide for Sam?  
COACH BLUDER: She's a great player. I mean, she's been around. She's played in
the national championship game. She's incredibly experienced. She's physical.
She strong.  
Sometimes Sam can out‑physical or out‑muscle or out‑grit people. But this is a
pretty unbelievable matchup right here between these two guards because they
emulate each other quite a bit.  
  
Q. How much do you enjoy that you're getting to face Louisville at home, and
the benefit of playing the first two rounds at home?  
COACH BLUDER: I mean, everybody would tell you that it's an advantage to play
at home. It's more that you don't have to travel, that you might have a few
more fans cheering for you. It's a comfort level of playing at home.  
So it's important. I wish it was the most important thing in taking on
Louisville tomorrow, but it's not the most important thing.  
  
Q. What is the confidence level after the offensive performance last night
heading into Louisville?  
COACH BLUDER: It's pretty high. I mean, they're feeling good about themselves
right now, and you should when you perform that well in the first round of an
NCAA tournament. Again, this wasn't a 16‑1 type of game. We played against a
good Marist team, a team that's fared very well in past NCAA tournaments, is
very seasoned in the tournament.  
I think it's not even just last night that we feel good about. I think we feel
good about the way we've been playing the last six weeks to two months. I
think we've won seven of our last eight games. We've been playing well down
this entire stretch.  
  
Q. What would it mean to finally get over the hump and get to the Sweet 16,
to you and to the program?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it would mean a lot. It's something that has eluded me
personally, and our program has certainly been there. We've been in the Final
Four in 1993. But it's been a while. It's something that our team would
really, really like to have the opportunity to claim that they did.  
They've talked about it. But we know it's a very difficult task. It's a very
difficult thing to get to the final 16 teams in the country.  
But I feel like lots of times we've been up against the Notre Dames and
Connecticuts in this situation, and Louisville is certainly to be talked about
among that group. But at least we have it on our home court.  
  
Q. What is your evaluation of Shoni's sister Jude?  
COACH BLUDER: She had a really nice game, hit some good shots for them. I
think it's something she probably is very, very capable of doing but hasn't
done consistently all year long. But when they have that added dimension of
her coming in and hitting shots, it makes them a lot more difficult to guard
instead of being able to sag off of her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Idaho  42

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville. Coach, we'll start with an opening
comment.  
COACH WALZ: I'd like to congratulate Idaho on a fantastic season. We did some
very good things defensively that threw them out of rhythm. But the way they
shot the ball from the three‑point line tonight was not indicative of how
they've been shooting the ball the entire year.  
We're very fortunate to be able to do some things defensively to disrupt what
they like to do offensively. I was very proud of our kids. I thought we fought
through the first four or five minutes of the game that we did not play
extremely well, but we played hard, and finally got things under control,
relaxed, and thought we did some really good things offensively and
defensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk about the play of your sister.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: She did a great job of coming in for us. They were leaving her
open. She's been working on shooting the open shot. For her to kind of do what
she needs to do, play her role, she did a great job of coming in and taking
care of business.  
  
Q. Sara, I felt like you were very efficient in this game. Sometimes we've
seen that teams in their first game after a long layoff haven't been. Talk
about how sharp you were.  
SARA HAMMOND: I think the time off we had preparing for the tournament really
helped us. The coaches told us to get in the gym, get up as many shots as
possible.  
We have great shooters on our team, not just Shoni, Tia, Antonita from the
outside. I think we are pretty confident going into this tournament hitting 15
to 18‑foot jump shots. The coaches are confident in us hitting those, too.  
Once we get everybody moving, that opens up things. I think it's hard for
defenses to narrow down who they're going to pick to shoot because you can't
leave any of us open.  
I'm proud the way we shot the ball and didn't turn it over as much tonight.  
  
Q. Asia, was that as sharp and efficient as you felt like you have played in
a while?  
ASIA TAYLOR: I definitely think it's been a while since we played. I think the
biggest thing was coming out with a lot of energy. Like coach said, in the
first couple minutes, things were a little rough out there. But we were
playing hard. We knew if we kept doing that, defending, it all starts with
defense. That energy we played with on defense carried over to offense.  
We looked for each other, got the ball reversed, we all got good looks.  
  
Q. Shoni, 11 rebounds. Must be proud of that.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, Coach Walz always tells us you have to rebound,
especially in post‑season play. That's how you survive, rebounding, defending,
taking care of the ball. We did a great job of doing that tonight.  
I took it kind of personal because I want to win. To go out and rebound, I'm
going to continue doing that. If it's going to help our team, I'm going to do
it.  
  
Q. Sara, could you comment on what you thought of Jude's play, the intensity
she brought out there.  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, Jude is our spark coming off the bench. I think everybody
on our team knows that. At the beginning we were kind of a little flustered.
We were a little too excited to get out there and play. Jude came in and set
the tone on defense. I think that's what started our run. She got her hand on
deflections, stealing the ball. I think we trust Jude with hitting open shots.
Like Shoni said, she's been practicing in the gym, getting her confidence up,
knocking down shots.  
We like to keep Jude's confidence up because she's the spark and energy we
need off the bench. I'm glad she's stepping up in the right time, in the
post‑season tournament. She's a big key in us moving forward down the road.  
  
Q. Shoni, any thoughts on Tuesday night?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We're looking forward to it. We're excited to play every game.
Regardless of who we get, we're going to be prepared mentally and physically.
Today's game, we got it under our belt. We got the flow of everything. We're
ready to continue and keep playing.  
Whoever it is, we'll be ready.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What do you think was the turning point? Bringing Jude in?  
COACH WALZ: I thought defensively, we defended to start the game. I thought we
did a really good job of switching on ball screens up top. Then at times we
went and doubled the ball screen.  
I thought our kids did a really good job of putting ball pressure. A lot of
that led to turnovers. When you're able to get 32 points off of 18 turnovers,
that's normally going to lead to a good night for you.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the kids were going to play as sharp as they did?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, I did, to be honest with you. We figured out a way in the
past six or seven years to play well at the right time. Some coaches complain
about the two‑week layoff you have between your conference tournament and the
NCAA tournament.  
But we embrace it. It gives us time to get rested. We work on us for the
entire first week, trying to clean things up offensively, get our timing down.  
You have to be efficient this time of the year. There is no tomorrow if you
don't take care of business today. We take pride in that. So it did not
surprise me.  
Now, the first four minutes I thought offensively we just rushed. We never got
the ball reversed. We were just trying so hard to make things happen. Then we
finally slowed down, we worked the ball around. When you do that, you're going
to get the opportunity to get some open shots.  
As our kids said, anybody on our team taking an open shot I feel pretty
comfortable with 'cause they're all really good shooters.  
  
Q. How much is that a strength of your team, that you do have as many
weapons as you have?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's really important. You have to figure out a way to
defend, there's no question about it. But you also have to figure out a way to
score points.  
When we go 6‑14 from the three‑point line, and Shoni is 0 for 1, I think it
speaks volumes for our players. I don't think anybody would have thought we'd
go 6‑14 and Shoni isn't making one of them.  
It adds another element of who do you defend, who you guard. I thought Bria
Smith did a really nice job as she got into the flow of things and relaxed.  
If Bria can make that eight to ten‑foot jump shot, it changes everything for
her. She's so explosive off the dribble that teams are going to make her make
that. She looked really comfortable shooting it. Hopefully that will continue
for us.  
  
Q. How important was Shoni's rebounding and kind of starting the break, her
being able to push it?  
COACH WALZ: Well, it's really important 'cause a lot of times Shoni will be
guarding the point guard or someone who's getting back when the opposing team
shoots. You're on your own to try to get in there and clean things up. I
thought she did a great job of that.  
That's one thing that we have talked about, our guards have to rebound the
ball for us to be successful. We don't have 6'4", 6'5", but we do have good
size all the way across the line.  
Shoni is going to have to continue to rebound the ball for us. Bria is going
to have to. Antonita is. If we can get that from our guards, good things can
happen.  
  
Q. If Iowa wins, it's obviously playing on their home court. You have played
in so many tough environments, do you feel that isn't going to be much of a
factor because of the experience you've had?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we've had it in our favor, too. We played at home
last year in the first two rounds. We're going to have to show up and play,
there's no question about it.  
If it is Iowa on Tuesday night, they're going to have great fans, a loud
environment. But that's what you want. The last thing you want is to play in
front of nobody.  
I hope before I'm finished coaching that our game can grow to the point to
where they can all be on neutral sites. That's what's best for the game. But
unfortunately right now we can't do that. I mean, you can even look at some of
the games that have been played on home courts in our tournament, and the
attendance has not been great. When I'm looking at it on TV, it's sad that we
can't get more fans to come out and watch these young ladies play basketball.  
Anybody that's in this tournament is a talented team. Until we can get our
game to where hopefully we can get to neutral sites to start off and play
throughout, you're going to have games like this.  
If Iowa is fortunate enough to win tonight, we're going to have to play them
here Tuesday night on their home court. Same thing with us. If we're fortunate
enough to win, we're going back home to play in a regional, which blows me
away. I'm glad it's one year and we're only doing it for one year because
that's not what should happen.  
  
Q. On Monday you said with the seeds you would expect them to have a chip on
their shoulder because of having a three. Did you sense that tonight?  
COACH WALZ: What we're trying to do right now is prove that we belong. I think
a lot of that, with our seed, has to do with respect. We have to do our job to
earn respect, get our program to where year in and year out we're competing
for a one, two or three seed in the NCAA tournament.  
I think if we're a program that had been around for 20 years, we may have
gotten a better seed. Who knows. Our kids are playing for respect right now.
We understand that. No matter who we face on Tuesday night, it's going to be a
really good ballclub. So we're going to have to come out prepared to play. We
know we're not going to win by 46 on Tuesday night. I'd like to, but I don't
expect that to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Marist  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marist. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thought we played well early. They were just relentless. It's
the nightmare that you are afraid of when they have all five people that can
score, and four of them shoot the three and one of them is a stud inside. What
do you take away?  
Early we did a decent job, they didn't shoot the three well. In the second
half they showed us how they can shoot.  
When we cut it to five, we were feeling pretty good. I don't remember what
play happened after that, but we didn't get stops at that end and we started
settling for threes at our end. We were tired. I didn't sub enough.  
That's why they're a six seed. They're obviously pretty good on their home
court. No complaints, we lost to a better team. I thought we gave great
effort. Tough way for my seniors to go out. But they're still one of the most
decorated group of seniors we've ever had at Marist.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Emma, coach said about the stud in the middle, Doolittle. What kind of
defensive matchup was she?  
EMMA O'CONNOR: She was way bigger than me, kind of the same size as Tori. Once
I started guarding her, I thought we did better guarding her. Then she started
to play a lot better. The guards started to help. That's when they started to
kick out and get open looks.  
  
Q. Emma, the defensive rebounding that Iowa did really seemed to limit you
to one shot on many possessions. What was it like battling down on the
glass?  
EMMA O'CONNOR: They were strong. I don't think I did well personally
rebounding this game. I mean, they battled and we tried to battle. They were
just bigger and stronger in certain positions.  
  
Q. Is there a memory or an accomplishment that stands out for you during
your four fantastic years at Marist?  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: I think getting four rings for the MAC is nice. Other teams
in different conferences can't say they have four rings. To be able to come to
the NCAA tournament and play big BCS schools, incredible teams.  
  
Q. The way they were rebounding the ball defensively, did it really put a
premium on your offensive possessions, making it important to get the best
shot possible?  
CASEY DULIN: I think they scouted our motion pretty well. It was hard for us.
We started going to our sets because of that.  
Once we dribble penetrated, we started getting open looks.  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: Yeah, I mean, it was hard because we couldn't really crash
the boards offensively because they kept pushing in transition. I think a lot
of their points, like 22, she kept pushing the ball up the court, kicked out
to the shooters. I think that's what we struggled on.  
  
Q. For the players who are returning next year, what do you want them to
remember to this run up into the NCAA tournament?  
CASEY DULIN: That they definitely have to bring everything to the table the
first game because if you lose, you're out, just like the MAC tournament,
which I think we do every year for that. They have to know teams are bigger
and stronger and you have to play as capable as you can.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: I think I would kind of want them to remember this game because
we lost by 20, even though it wasn't a 20‑point loss, but just to keep this in
the back of their minds, keep it like a motivational‑type thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach at this time.  
  
Q. You won an awful lot of games with those three players. How will you
specifically remember them?  
COACH GIORGIS: As one of the greatest senior classes I've ever had, both from
a competitive standpoint and a personal standpoint. They were kids who were
extremely competitive, got the most out of their abilities. They weren't
highly recruited by a lot of people.  
If you knew their determination and fight, I mean, we were down 17 a couple
weeks ago, really could have packed it in, and they just refused to allow
anybody to pack it in. They took it on their shoulders, the three of them, did
a great job.  
I could go through different games throughout their four years, where even at
sophomores, Casey and Leanne were captains as juniors. You don't pick junior
captains unless you know that they're leaders that others will listen to. They
were just tremendous leaders. They weren't afraid to speak their piece both to
the players and to the coaching staff.  
I think that's what I'll miss about them most of all.  
I don't know what their four‑year record is, but it's got to be about as good
as anybody. I think they only lost three MAC games in their career, and two
undefeated seasons. That's not bad.  
  
Q. The first half seemed like contrasting styles. You were methodical,
looking for a shot.  
COACH GIORGIS: I mean, people forget they're a little bit more athletic than
we are. Again, the frustrating part is they've got three excellent three‑point
shooters and a first‑team all Big Ten stud in the middle.  
I think our kids got frustrated. Our real big kids just couldn't guard
Doolittle inside. I think that was the frustrating part because sometimes when
you get in those situations, you forget that she likes to go right a lot. We
kept getting beat right. She'd fake left and go right.  
Again, some of our bigs, especially Tori, has hardly played for four years.
She just doesn't have a lot of experience. People say, What about the
defensive rebounding? I think I've been last in the MAC for umpteen teen years
for offensive rebounding. We sacrifice offensive rebounding for the sake of
not getting beat in transition. We got beat in transition way too much.  
In the end when it started to fall apart, the eight or ten‑minute mark, when
the lead went up to 10 or 11, we started settling for threes instead of
attacking. When we started to attack, we got stuff.  
But hats off to Iowa because they shot the hell out of the ball, especially in
the second half. You could tell our kids are pretty frustrated. What do we do?
You tip your hat to them. That's one thing that stinks about playing on a home
court. One of the biggest differences in the tournament in the women's game
and the men's game. In the men's game, you don't have that. We still haven't
beaten anybody on their home court. This is the first time it was a
first‑round game. I don't think it's going to change any time soon.  
It's what you play with. It's what you live with. But I think if we played on
Mars, I think Iowa would have beaten us the way they shot the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it all year.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Louisville  88  
Idaho  42

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Idaho. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
COACH NEWLEE: It's a tough way to end what for us was a great season. We
talked about our goals of winning the regular season WAC title, winning the
tourney title and getting back‑to‑back in the NCAA tournament. The only goal
we didn't achieve was going further in the NCAA tournament that we wanted to
do.  
Like I said, it's a tough way to end your year on a loss, especially a loss
that's a little lopsided like this one was tonight. We certainly didn't play
our best basketball. Louisville had something to do with that. I think some of
that was our own doing. But they're a great basketball team. I said they
should be a number one seed. They didn't do anything out there to disprove
that. Good luck to them through the rest of the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In the very early going you had some things going on. What changed? What
did Louisville do to take control of the game?  
ALI FORDE: They put on a lot of pressure. We handled it really well at the
beginning of the game. Drifted away from that towards the middle.  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: I think also the fact that they were pushing the ball in
transition really well and we weren't stopping it, weren't getting stops we
needed. We weren't putting the ball in the basket on the offensive end.  
We were getting some good looks, and they just weren't dropping.  
  
Q. Alyssa, I know it's right after the fact, but can you sum up your career
at Idaho.  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: It's been the best decision I ever made. It's made me so
much stronger. Like coach said, this isn't the way we want to go out. But I've
become who I am through the coaches here, my teammates. They pushed me to
become a good leader.  
I mean, it's emotional. Any last game is going to be emotional. But, wow, what
a ride it's been. It's been incredible. I know that the girls behind me are
going to take this program even higher than when I came here. They've got a
powerful coaching staff to do it.  
I can't say anything bad about this school. Other teams looked away from me in
the recruiting process. These coaches saw the potential in me. Definitely I
surprised myself with the coaching, people believing in me. It's been
incredible and I'm excited to see what they do in the future.  
ALI FORDE: She's been one heck of a leader. We're really going to miss her,
so...  
  
Q. Ali, what are you going to take from being here and this experience into
your next year?  
ALI FORDE: This experience is a great experience to have. Next year hopefully
will be‑‑ like coach was saying earlier in the locker room, hopefully we'll
have a higher seed and be able to come out stronger.  
Playing a team like Louisville, they're obviously a great team. It makes us
better. It allows us to push farther. We know what we need to work on now,
so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You thought Louisville was a one seed. Did it get to the point that they
had so much that it overwhelmed your team?  
COACH NEWLEE: They're extremely talented, obviously. They're pretty deep. I
think they brought some people in. I thought they shot extremely, extremely
well today, too.  
I think if they're making those shots, those midrange shots, we wanted to run
them off the three‑point line if we could, make them take those contested jump
shots, they got on that roll and started making those shots.  
I think our turnovers led to a lot of fast‑break points for them. That was one
thing that we definitely needed to avoid if we were going to get in this game,
pull an upset. We had to play a lot better on the offensive end than we did
tonight.  
I will say ‑ not making excuses for Stacey Barr ‑ but she got hit in the face
with an elbow at the 13‑minute mark in the first half. At one point we thought
she had a concussion. I'm not sure how it's going now. Her symptoms got worse
as the game was going along. At one point I had to take her out because I'm
not sure she was aware where she was.  
Player of the Year in the WAC, you take her out that early in the contest, it
certainly didn't help our cause. Like I said, we don't want to make excuses.
That's basketball. That happens. It wasn't intentional.  
You could see her with the ice bags on every timeout. Sometimes she didn't
want to get up and put her hand in the huddle. I think that certainly was a
factor in the game getting away from us.  
  
Q. Can you give your thoughts on maybe the ball pressure that Louisville
presents, how difficult that is to deal with.  
COACH NEWLEE: The constant pressure in the game, we know that's a part of
their game, what they do. Like I said, we handled it pretty good for the first
six minutes. They just kept it going, kept it going. They're long and
athletic. They do a great job defensively of getting after you, getting after
ball‑handlers.  
It certainly hurt us to not have a backup point guard. She's been out since
December, so... Once Connie got tired, and Stacey was out of it, certainly the
ball pressure was going to be a bigger factor than it should have been I think
going in. It took its toll on us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

Iowa  87  
Marist  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Just a great feeling out on the floor tonight. I thought our
players executed very well. I thought they relaxed and had fun out there.
Enjoyed playing on their home court. Enjoyed executing. Shot the ball well.  
It was one of those games I thought offensively we just had so many weapons,
whether it was Bethany inside, Theairra has a career‑high three‑pointers,
Melissa gets going later in the game, Sam is one rebound short of a
triple‑double. In an NCAA game that doesn't happen very often.  
A lot of really good things for our team out there tonight. And I thought the
crowd was really great. I thought the crowd was loud. I think that was the
most excited I heard a gym for a jump‑ball victory in a long time, so it was
fun.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Theairra, you started 0 ‑5 from three, then hit 12 of your last 18. What
changed for you guys?   
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Well, the coach just tells us to keep shooting. Beth was
demanding so much attention, we were wide open. We don't want to drive in and
getting charged with fouls. We let it go and kept building our confidence as
we went on.  
  
Q. The center was open for you tonight, wasn't it?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think my teammates were doing well at finding me down
low. Trying to get in the best position I was. They found me and I was able to
put some shots down.  
  
Q. One of your best games?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I'd say as a team it was one of the best games this
season. Everyone did something to help us out.  
I think that gives us a lot of confidence going into the next one.  
  
Q. Theairra, can you tell me about the sense of urgency today knowing this
might be it?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: Yeah, I felt like there was a lot of anticipation building up
to the game. But when we got on the floor, we wanted to compete, win, get to
the Sweet 16. We want to cut down those nets.  
That's my motivation. That's all of our motivation. We just went out and
showed what we can do.  
  
Q. Sam, you had two weeks off since you lost in the Big Ten championship.
What was the mood of the team and how did that affect how you came out and
played today?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think any time you have two weeks off, you're antsy to
get back on the floor. After a loss like that, we were pretty focused. Last
two weeks we've been focusing on ourselves, especially the first week, week
and a half. Then when you find out who you're playing, you focus on them.  
We had great focus and energy I think for two weeks without having a game,
which is kind of tough to sustain, but we were definitely ready for tonight.  
  
Q. Bethany, you opened both halves with a field goal. Was that kind of the
game plan going in or just something that opened up?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, I think from the get‑go we had a little bit of a
height advantage down low. I think we were trying to take advantage of that a
little bit. That definitely helped us out later on get the people on the
perimeter open for their shots.  
  
Q. Sam, what do you need to take from tonight and carry over into Tuesday's
game?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: First off, we have to keep our defensive intensity like that.
Louisville is a great team, one of the top teams in the country. Excited to
have them on our home floor. Great opportunity for us.  
To get our offense going, to get our transition going, we have to play great
defense, just really focus on that so we can get our offense going.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll entertain questions for coach.  
  
Q. Claire is getting some more minutes. Talk about her performance.  
COACH BLUDER: I think Claire is playing the best basketball of her career
right now. Claire has found a role as far as we need rebounds, go get the
rebound. She had two beautiful offensive rebounds. One led to a Theairra three
for us. She battles in there. She's physical and she doesn't care. She just
battles in there.  
She had a nice three. She got pretty excited when she got that three. I just
feel like Claire has matured this year and is playing extremely well right
now.  
  
Q. One of the Marist players talked about how you guys were able to shut
down their motion offense so they had to move to more sets. What were you able
to do defensively that enabled that?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, we probably didn't shut it down because they still scored
quite a few points, 65 points.  
But we had four days to get ready for their offense. It is an offensive
juggernaut. It is so hard to get ready for because there are so many screens.
I said this earlier. Marist is one of the best teams I've ever seen at being
able to read screens and make you pay for what you're doing, whether you're
switching, they do a great job of reading it, whether you're chasing over top.  
We worked very hard on that in the last four days and we spent a lot of time
getting ready for those screens.  
  
Q. Sam went down with like 10 minutes left and you huddled the team up on
the court. What did you say to them?  
COACH BLUDER: I really thought at that point we were going to be shooting free
throws. I thought she took the elbow to the face, but they said it was
incidental contact instead of a player bringing it up intentionally.  
Melissa had been sitting on the bench, I was thinking about getting her ready
to get in and shoot the free throws, remembering what defense we were in.  
We also talked about, We've had a little break here, let's not let the
momentum shift. Let's have fun but stay focused.  
  
Q. You haven't been able to get over the hump and get to the Sweet 16 in
recent years. Is that something you've talked about with the players?  
COACH BLUDER: The players know it, definitely. It's something that we would
love to accomplish. I mean, who wouldn't want to be in the Sweet 16? It's
something we definitely would love to have the opportunity to do.  
  
Q. Talk about the improvement in rebounding.  
COACH BLUDER: We worked hard on it the last couple of weeks. I'm probably most
happy with our offensive rebounding. We got over a third of the offensive
rebounds. That's kind of the general norm. For us that's good, really good.
Happy with the rebounding tonight.  
I thought Marist didn't attack the boards that hard because they were trying
to get back in transition so much. But we'll take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Thank you.

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined here by Louisville. We have Tia Gibbs and Shoni
Schimmel. We'll have an opening statement from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First, just like to thank the University of Iowa. Everything has
been first class since we've arrived. We're excited to be a part of this group
of four teams that are playing here the next few days, looking forward to the
opportunity to competing again in the NCAA tournament.  
It's a fantastic event and one we're honored to be a part of.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll direct questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shoni, what does it mean to be starting now in your final tournament? How
determined do you feel you are?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It feels great to be able to know we're getting ready to play
soon. It has been a while. We've been anxious, but we're excited at the same
time.  
We're looking forward to getting out there and playing a game of basketball.
With it being my last one, you know, kind of the same thing. It's basketball,
so I'm excited to play, ready for anything.  
We're going to be prepared each and every single game to come out there and
win.  
  
Q. Tia, do you feel you're under ‑seeded for this tournament? And playing on
a visiting court?  
TIA GIBBS: I don't think we feel under‑seeded. I think we're just excited to
play. Tournament time is tournament time. At the end of the day, it's six
games to get the trophy, six opponents no matter what the seeding is.  
I think as we all can watch men's basketball, nobody cares about the seeding
but the fans and the media. To players, a game is a game.  
  
Q. Tia, can you talk about what it's like for you to play in your final
tournament, having to miss last year's, what your motivation is this year.  
TIA GIBBS: Well, you know, last year we got a taste of everything. We made it
to the Final Four. I think for all of us, whether it's our last year or not as
seniors, we want it back, we want to get there and actually win it this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Walz.  
  
Q. Could you address a little bit about your seed, if there's frustration
there being fourth in the country but having to be a three and come to a place
that's a pretty tough place to play.  
COACH WALZ: No, we're just honored to be in the tournament. We lost three
times to UConn. When the draw was about to be announced, we were just
concerned if we'd be in it. When you lose four times, it's tough sometimes.  
We're thrilled to be here. I mean, we hosted the first two rounds last year,
so we were a five seed. Purdue was the four. Purdue had to come to us and
play.  
It is what it is. We're not even concerned about our second‑round game yet. We
have to play a very talented Idaho team. They're coming in here tomorrow night
to win also. We don't look past anybody. We give the respect that's due to
each team.  
We'll focus all of our attention on them for tomorrow night. If we're
fortunate enough to advance, then we'll worry about whoever we're playing
next.  
It's what it's about. It's great to have the opportunity to play, if we do
advance, in front of a great crowd. We're expecting a great crowd tomorrow
night for both games from everything we've been told.  
You're going to have to win. It's just a matter of who you're going to have to
play, where you're going to have to play. So, like I said, we're honored to be
a part of it. I'm proud of our kids. We had a very good year at 30‑4\. I
thought we played a very good non‑conference schedule to prepare us for this.  
Even though we only received two bids from our league, you have very talented
teams that did not make it. South Florida is a team that was talented enough
to be in this tournament, for sure. Unfortunately for them, they did not
receive the bid.  
Rutgers is a very talented team, too. You have SMU. So we have enough teams in
our league that have prepared us for this.  
  
Q. Can you give your comments on Idaho, things that have stood out to you.  
COACH WALZ: They're, first off, a group of young ladies that play extremely
hard. They're a very well‑coached, disciplined team. They shoot the three
extremely well. You have two players on their team that have taken over 250
threes. One through four all have the ability to step up and knock it down.
Take 26 threes a game and make nine of them. We're going to have our hands
full. There's no question about it.  
We're going to have to be on our A game at the defensive end of the floor, for
sure. We're going to have to make sure we pick up players in transition and
make sure we're there early, try to do the best job we can to make sure they
take contested shots.  
  
Q. Give your comments on two of the players you did not have last year, Tia
and Asia, that you have for this run. What do you think is their mentality,
that they get to participate in one final tournament?  
COACH WALZ: I'm really excited for both these young ladies. Tia is a player
who missed the past two years with injuries. She was granted a sixth year by
the NCAA. So she's getting her final chance to play in an event like this. She
really does not have the aspiration to play after college. Her body probably
couldn't take it.  
She's just thrilled and excited to be out here. She brings the ability to
score the basketball for us. She shoots the three extremely well. She does
some really nice things on the defensive end of the floor, as well. So she's a
big plus for us.  
Asia Taylor has had a very solid year the entire season. She's really an X
factor for us. She's really a hard matchup for a lot of teams, especially when
she's making a 15‑foot jump shot. You have to guard her to shoot the ball
there. She drives it so well.  
She's been doing a nice job of rebounding for us at the offensive end for us.
We're going to need her to play like she has this entire season in order for
us to try and make a run in this tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the last six weeks have been like for Bria, how
much pain she's been in and how she's feeling now.  
COACH WALZ: She's feeling fine right now. She had some knee soreness for a
while. We shut her down for about three or four games. She had been playing
extremely well up to that point.  
You go about two weeks without playing, and it's taken her a little bit of
time to get back into the flow of things. I've been very pleased with how
she's been practicing the last two weeks. Looking forward to seeing how she
plays tomorrow. I'm expecting big things from her.  
She brings an element to our team that we need with her athleticism, her
ability to get to the basket, her ability to defend. She rebounds the ball
well.  
So we're going to need her to play at the top of her game if we're going to
get past the first game here tomorrow.  
  
Q. In the days preceding Selection Monday, was there a site you thought you
might be coming to?  
COACH WALZ: This is one we had actually picked out. There were two or three
that we had kind of done our homework on. We thought we'd be very possibly
coming to the state of Iowa. It was just a matter of if it was going to be
Iowa State or here.  
You look at some neutral sites, too, as a possibility. But then once you start
breaking down, you know, the host teams, where their seeding was going to fall
into place, it's not that difficult to kind of get things narrowed down to two
or three sites.  
So this was one that we had anticipated that could be a possibility. We're
excited to be here. I mean, they draw well. Very knowledgeable fans. And
that's what you want. You want the opportunity to come to play at a place
where it's going to be exciting.  
We're fortunate to draw close to 10,000 every night. There's nothing better
than when you go out to play and you have a great crowd in front of you, even
if it's on the road. We'd rather play in front of a loud, hostile crowd than
in front of nobody.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you, everybody.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Marist. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH GIORGIS: It's great to be in Iowa City, great to go up against an
opponent like Iowa who is scary similar to us in many ways. Very talented
team. Extremely well‑coached. What we call like a better version of ourselves.  
Hospitality has been great. But this is a time that we always look forward to.
With the three seniors to my right here, it's a time where we get to take the
target off our back that has been on during the whole conference season and
now we get to go out and try to slay one of the bigger schools or a couple
bigger schools.  
We're looking forward to tomorrow. We know we have a tremendous opponent in
front of us and I don't think we'd want it any other way.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Playing on the opposing team's home floor, is that a special challenge
for you?  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: I think it is. I mean, it's their home court. Usually teams
are better at playing at their home court.  
I can speak for the team. We like playing at away gyms, per se. This year we
played a lot better away. So it's going to be a challenge, but I think we're
ready for that.  
  
Q. Leanne, this game is going to feature 10 players averaging double ‑digit
scoring. What kind of defensive challenge is that going to be for both teams?
  
LEANNE OCKENDEN: It's going to be a challenge. Any person can step up during
the game, especially their five starters earning double‑digit points. The team
has been working on our defense. Hopefully I can step up for the team and they
can follow me.  
  
Q. It's been a few days since you learned you're going to play Iowa.
Scouting them, what are their tendencies you're going to try to stop
tomorrow?  
CASEY DULIN: We've learned they are a lot like us with the double‑digit
starting five. Their post player is a little bigger than ours. They have quick
guards. We have a good scout. So we just have to follow it.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: Yeah, basically what Casey said. They're a better version of
us. We're ranked in similar things in the national stats, or pretty close.  
We just have to keep playing the way we've been playing.  
  
Q. As much success as you've had in the NCAA tournament through the last 10
years, do you find it maybe a little bit of an insult to be considered a mid
‑major?   
CASEY DULIN: Honestly, I don't really think we even think about stuff like
that. We just go out there and play Marist basketball.  
  
Q. Is it easier to prepare for a team that is so similar to you or would it
be harder to prepare for a team that is totally unlike you?  
THE MODERATOR: Emma, would you take that one.  
EMMA O'CONNOR: I mean, I think it's a little better to prepare for them
because they are similar to us so we kind of know the type of tendencies
because we do some of the same things. I think I'd rather do that than playing
against some girls who are way bigger than me and Tori. I like this matchup a
little better.  
  
Q. If you consider Iowa a better version of yourselves, why do you consider
Iowa better?  
CASEY DULIN: Well, they play in a bigger conference than us. They played very
good opponents all year. Our non‑conference schedule is pretty hard. But I
think they just had more experience than us playing better teams, that's why
they can be considered a little better than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The offensive potential of both these teams, is this going to be a team
that you think might be in the 80s or 90s, or do you see some of your top
defenders stepping up?  
COACH GIORGIS: That's a good question.  
Again, they're very talented at all five positions. Stopping them is going to
be, you know, a heck of a chore. They're playing on their home court. Chances
are you usually shoot better on your home court.  
I'd like to hope that we can score, you know, up in that level and stuff. Can
we hold them down? I don't know. Again, they're playing in the Big Ten.
They're going up against Penn State and stuff.  
Even though this has been the best year of our conference with four people in
the top 100, it's not the same as the Big Ten.  
  
Q. How do you gauge the success of your program? You've been here nine
straight years. Is that the success level? Do you feel after having been here
so many times that you really need or want to win this first ‑round game for
it to be a successful season?  
COACH GIORGIS: Oh, it's been a successful season. We don't have to win a game
tomorrow to say this year's been successful or not. 27 wins is pretty good.
When you beat a team like Oklahoma, you've done a pretty good job. When you
lose to Ohio State by three at the end, you don't have your two best players
there, on their court, it's been a really, really good year. Like I say, I
think we're dangerous when we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Our
kids know they've had a great year.  
I know, especially with these seniors, I remember after last year when we lost
to Michigan State by five in the opening round, they were really hurting, and
more than usual, because they had won games in each of the two previous years
against Georgia and against Iowa State.  
They last year felt incomplete because they didn't win one. To win the
national championship, we don't look at things like that. We just try to knock
off, be as big a pain in the rear to everybody as we can, to show we can play
with the big boys. That's what they'll be trying to do tomorrow, and hopefully
we can take one down or two down or whatever.  
I know this group has always wanted to get to a Sweet 16 because it's been a
while. The toughest road to go through is going through somebody on their home
court, which we've never faced in the first round, then a team like
Louisville. I don't know what Idaho will do with them, but if we get our first
round...  
Two extremely tough opponents. But that's not going to determine our success,
how we do against them. We've had a great year.  
  
Q. In essence, what has to go right tomorrow night for you to pull off what
would be considered an upset?  
COACH GIORGIS: I always felt in a game like this if both people bring their A
game and play it, they just have a little bit more talent than we have. That's
what I mean by 'a better version.' A lot of our kids weren't recruited by BCS
schools. They're a little bit more athletic, a little bit bigger, a little bit
more physical. They get a lot better playing in that type of conference.  
But for us, if we can play well, somehow disrupt them in some of the things
that they do...  
With most of these teams, Ohio State in '07, Georgia two years ago, were we
the better team? Not many people would say so. Not always the better team
wins, you know.  
Some things do have to go right for us. We have to do the things we do well
tomorrow. We have to shoot the ball better, or as well as we have.
Defensively, that's a real hard group to guard because they've got so many
weapons. I had to finally stop practice and yell at our kids, You can't worry
that Dixon shoots all these threes and makes them, because if that kid goes by
you, that kid scores two.  
The thing that I like with the matchup is you don't have to do anything
special, per se, because you got to guard 'em all. You can't sit there and
say, You slough off that person, you slough off that person, we'll make this
kid be the hero. They got a lot of people that can step up and be the hero.
That's the tough part with this matchup.  
If they try to slough off somebody else and leave some of our people open,
they'll pay the price there. That's what makes it such an intriguing matchup
when you have five people in double‑digits on each team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH GIORGIS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Alyssa Charlston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26924)

### [Jon Newlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26923)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
COACH NEWLEE: Very excited to be here, second time around, second year in a
row of being in the NCAA tournament. Huge for our program, huge for the
University of Idaho.  
Like I said, we're excited to be here and ready to get after Louisville. The
14th seed going against the 3, we know the challenges ahead of us. We feel
like we're ready to go, ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions to the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. It's been a month since you have lost. What has gone right for you in
this recent winning streak?  
ALYSSA CHARLSTON: I think the constant competition in practice. Our coaches do
a good job of keeping us focused and ready to go at all times. We expect
ourselves to play at a high level every time we step on the court. I think we
have a lot of good leadership on the team. That gets us ready for each game
and competing every time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Newlee.  
  
Q. You seem to have found your stride here in the last month. What have you
seen?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think we've done a better job of rebounding the basketball
during our stretch, making better shot selection decisions. That was something
that we struggled with earlier in the year before we got into conference play.
I think our shot selection has been much better. Rebounding has been much
better.  
Defensively, my staff, Jordan and Christa, do the scouts. They got us ready,
prepared defensively. I think our team has done a great job of following the
defensive game plan and really sticking to it.  
As the conference season went along, I think our team got a lot of confidence
from getting win after win. We had the 10‑game winning streak, then we lost,
then got on another streak.  
Last year winning the league and going to the NCAA tournament gave our kids a
lot of confidence. Once we got into conference play, we had the success early,
I think it kind of built on itself. When games got tight, they really trust
each other. I think that really carried us through a couple of the tight games
we had in the league.  
  
Q. Coach, what is your biggest concern with Louisville?  
COACH NEWLEE: Where do I start (laughter)?  
You know, I think obviously they got a bunch of All‑Americans over there led
by Shoni Schimmel who is a fantastic player. They're not a one‑person team.
Their guys inside are big and strong. Hammond. Slaughter can shoot it. Gibbs
can shoot it.  
Defensively we're really going to have to play smart. Again, we're going to
have to rebound the basketball well. I think we're going to have to take care
of the basketball because I know they're going to come with a variety of
defenses and traps, things that Jeff likes to do.  
Taking care of the basketball and rebounding the basketball are going to be
two big keys for us.  
  
Q. At this time of year everybody sees Mercer, North Dakota State Stephen F.
Austin, thinking why hasn't that happened on the women's side yet. Do you
think a 14 or a 15 is getting closer to cracking through and getting that
win?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think so. I've been doing this a long time, I've seen the game
grown a lot, 30 years of doing this. I do believe the parity is coming. It's
not coming as quickly as the men's side did.  
It's getting there. Watching some of the games earlier today, the Florida Gulf
Coast and Oklahoma State going to overtime, seeing the scores of games
throughout the year even, not just in the NCAA tournament.  
I do think the talent gap is closing just because the club teams and the
recruiting is getting so much better. There's so much more talented kids
coming into programs now. They're not all stockpiled at UConn and Tennessee
like in the old days, though UConn is still stockpiled enough. We found that
out last year (laughter).  
I think it is getting closer, I do. I really believe that. I think in another
five years it's going to be like the men's side where anything goes, and
whatever seed you have, it's not going to matter when the ball gets thrown up.  
  
Q. When you are really playing well, what does your team look like? What are
the strengths of your team?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think when we're really playing well, we're doing a great job
of sharing the basketball. Our goal is to get at least 20 assists a game. When
we've cracked that barrier, we've done a great job. Offensively we have a lot
of different people that can score the basketball in different ways.  
We're rebounding the ball well when we're playing well. I think we're keeping
people off the foul line. We're not fouling people. Just doing a good job of
playing good fundamental defense when we're playing well.  
  
Q. There's controversy in Louisville that Louisville was a little bit under
‑seeded. Do you think they're a three or better than that?  
COACH NEWLEE: I would think they're better than that. Looking at their record,
30‑4, they lost three times to UConn. We found out firsthand what UConn is
like ourselves last year.  
For that to happen, I thought all along, if you look from afar, they would be
a number one seed or certainly a number two. I think without a doubt they
didn't get the best end of that deal coming in seeding‑wise, with all the
talent that Jeff has on his basketball team, the couple of years they've had
the last couple seasons. This year was a great year for them.  
Yeah, I think they were deserving of a number one seed in my mind. I was
shocked when I saw that they were a number three seed. Honestly, I couldn't
believe it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH NEWLEE: Yeah, I thought, man, we just played the number one seed last
year when we made our run through the tournament. It kind of feels like that a
little bit going into it again.  
We kept hearing that we're going to be playing Nebraska in Seattle. All the
ESPN that you see, you read, you think it's gospel, but really it's not. It's
one guy making his own opinion as far as the bracketology goes.  
We found out last year we can't really count on that. Last year we were
supposed to be playing Stanford somewhere else and then we got sent across the
country.  
Not surprised. When the names come up during the selection show, I found that
anything can happen and will happen, so...  
We're just ready to play whoever they tell us we're playing.  
  
Q. Can you compare and contrast last year's team to this season.  
COACH NEWLEE: I think last year was all brand‑new for us. We started three
freshmen last year and a sophomore and a junior. It's nice that everybody was
back and gained from that experience.  
Basically we have the same entire team back. Our freshmen are hurt, so they're
not playing. They're out. So basically with the same exact team coming back,
it's been nice because they had that experience and they could grow from last
year's experience as freshmen playing all those minutes, starting all those
games.  
They're a year older, wiser and better, which is the good news for us coming
into this year and into this tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned a little bit, because they are such a clear ‑cut favorite
for this tournament, do you think it's possible that anybody can beat UConn
this year? What would be the scenario that would lead to a UConn loss at some
point?  
COACH NEWLEE: I would feel like to beat UConn, who I think would probably be
in the top half if they played in the WNBA as a team, you'd have to play a
perfect game. Reminds me of that Villanova/Georgetown final. You would have to
shoot like 70%. You couldn't turn it over. You have to hope that Stewart is
missing, Dolson, all those guys are having the worst game of their life and
you're having your best. That's the only scenario I see of UConn losing.  
I've never seen a collection of talent in my life like UConn has put together
here in the last couple years.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH NEWLEE: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

### [Theairra Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24379)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa. Coach, if you'd like to make an opening
statement.  
COACH BLUDER: Just very excited to be here, as everybody is this time of year.
When you're playing this time of the year, it's an unbelievable feeling.
That's the way our locker room has been the last couple of weeks, just very
excited to be able to participate in the national tournament.  
Then it makes it more special to be on our home court. To be here in
Carver‑Hawkeye Arena is extra special for us. We know that Marist is a great
opponent. We're excited about playing them. We know they're kind of eerie
similar to us in statistical categories. There has to be only a handful of
teams in the United States that have five starters averaging double figures.
Two of them going against each other head‑to‑head the first round of the NCAA
tournament is quite unusual.  
A great opponent. They've obviously been seasoned in the NCAA, nine straight
years. This is nothing unusual to them.  
Obviously a mid‑major, I'm very familiar with mid‑major having spent 10 years
at Drake University. I know how special it is to make the NCAA tournament and
take down a BCS‑type school. I know we're going to get their best shot, I
understand that. I guess it's good we're not playing against Idaho first
because corn or potatoes, right? How many times do you get that mixed up. It's
really a good thing we're not playing against them first (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What has been the focal point? A couple weeks since you played your last
game.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, since we had that time off of games, took a lot of time
just to work on ourselves, fix up some things that were hurting us a little
bit before. Just trying to get a little bit better on ourselves before we
found out who our opponent was going to be. That's what we used last week and
early this week before scouting out Marist.  
  
Q. Marist has made their name in this tournament by scoring big upsets
against the bigger schools. Is that a dangerous opponent knowing they've got
nothing to lose tomorrow?  
THEAIRRA TAYLOR: I think any time you're in the tournament, the name nor the
number on the side of the name matters at this time. It's just who comes to
play their best basketball during that day. We know that, and I'm sure they
know that. We'll get up for the game just as much as they will.  
  
Q. Sam, you talked about the benefit of kind of a home ‑court advantage.
With the different court and different sights and everything, what is
different about playing in Carver for the tournament versus a home game?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I think just knowing it's win or go home. It's win or you're
not going to play anymore. Obviously that has a lot riding on every single
game we could possibly play here.  
You just have to be ready to play for 40 minutes, otherwise you're not going
to get another 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
At this time we'll take questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. Marist prides itself on its motion offense. What have you seen by the way
they run the motion and how do you defend something like that?  
COACH BLUDER: I'm extremely impressed with their motion offense. The way they
read screens, and Brian is able to get them to read screens, is amazing.
That's why I'm sure they're a lot better team in March than they are in
November because it has to take a lot of time and a lot of work in order to
get your players to understand the different reads and counters to how you
handle screens.  
They do as good a job as I've seen anybody do with that situation.  
  
Q. The different court and everything, does this feel like a home venue with
everything so different?  
COACH BLUDER: It still feels like home. I mean, I was just cleaning my kitchen
an hour ago so it definitely feels like home to me.  
Yeah, even though this is a different place than we usually hold our press
conferences, it's still our locker room, our court, our lighting. It's very
familiar.  
I think there's absolutely an advantage to being able to play at home. How
much, I don't know. But we didn't have to travel. We get the comfort of our
own beds. We hopefully will have a few more fans in the stands than the other
opponents.  
More than anything, it's a comfort level.  
  
Q. Going back to Marist having five players in double figures, at this time
in the year when it comes down to who makes tough shots, how difficult is that
challenge to know everybody they put on the floor can score?  
COACH BLUDER: It's very difficult. But I think we have the same threat. It
kind of counters each other or negates each other. They're in the same boat
with us. We have five players that average over 12 points a game. They have
five players that average over 10 points a game.  
I definitely think it's a difficult situation for both coaches, but it
probably negates each other.  
  
Q. Facing a Marist team that's used to upsetting teams or taking bigger
teams down to the wire, what kind of a challenge is that for you as a coach
and players?  
COACH BLUDER: I know my players are really smart and they watch a lot of
basketball. They have utmost respect for Marist, not just from this week or
knowing who they are. They've watched them play the last couple years, they
know about the upsets. Just watch the men's tournament the last couple days,
see all the upsets. If that doesn't get your attention, nothing will.  
They understand Marist is a good team. I have told them, but they don't need
me telling them that over and over again.  
  
Q. It's been quite some time since you've played a game. With this layover,
what are the challenges of having so much time off?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, it's been two weeks. It will be two weeks since we've
played a game. That's pretty unusual. We haven't waited this long since we
tipped off to begin the year.  
I've always believed the Big Ten tournament should be moved back farther so we
don't have this big gap. We're not going to do anything about that right now.  
We try to give the players a little bit of time off, let them heal up from
playing four games in four days in the Big Ten tournament, and like Sam said,
work on a couple things we need to work on as a team.  
This week has been business as usual, finding out our opponent, getting ready
for our game.  
Once we hit this week, it's pretty normal. Last week is pretty unusual.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Roshunda Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26959)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  73  
PURDUE - 66

  
COACH LITTELL: Just very, very proud of this team. I thought their unit and
chemistry on the floor tonight was just unbelievable. Everybody stepped up and
played. We said that we couldn't go into this game and have one or two people
play, and we just had great contributions out of everybody.  
The two young ladies here, my farthest left, Roshunda Johnson, a freshman, to
come into this environment and get 16 and hit big shot after big shot, is just
pretty remarkable. She shouldered the load when Tiffany Bias went down, and I
think that's a sign of an outstanding team when somebody else can step up and
make plays when you've lost your leader.  
The young lady closest to me here, Brittney Martin, 20 and 20, that's a
career. That is a career. Those are huge, huge numbers. She had 15 rebounds
the other night. She had 15 in the semifinals, the Big12 tournament, and 11
against Iowa State. Just been a rebounding machine, and she was a scorer
tonight. Kind of put us on her back and just carried us.  
But four people in double figures, very proud, a very tough environment to
play in and we beat a very good basketball team tonight.  
  
Q. For Brittney, when Coach Versyp came in just a few minutes ago, she
started talking about you and she said you appeared to be on what she called a
mission. Having heard that now, can you just kind of respond, and is that a
pretty accurate assessment from the other coach?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that's pretty accurate. We want to go to the next
level. We have things to get done. I was just‑‑ I just came in here with the
mind‑set of, we wanted to win, and so I was just trying to do everything I
could to get that win and help my team in any way possible.  
  
Q. If I would have told you this afternoon that you and Jones would have
combined for 36 points and 32 rebounds, would you have told me, our chances
will be pretty good?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. That sounds nice to me.  
  
Q. When you guys obviously buy as went down with about 14:03 to play and you
had a nice lead, I think it's easier to protect than it is to play from behind
when the star goes out, but what was the mind ‑set that you had, was it to
protect?   
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: My mindset was, you know, I'm the point guard now, and for
my team to get to the Sweet16, I had to step up and make big plays for my
team.  
  
Q. And you were shooting well, too. Sometimes it's difficult when you're
playing the point, to shoot well and direct the offense; sometimes one will go
well and one won't but both worked well. What were you doing correctly that
allowed you to score and run the team?  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I was just doing everything I did in practice and just so
happened came good to me, so I helped my team out a lot and I'm thankful for
it.  
  
Q. Brittney, you guys are a good rebounding team, but 20 rebounds, Coach
said that's kind of a career night, 20 and 20. You know, Purdue said you were
great; they could have done a better job boxing out and you were take
advantage of that. Would you agree, you slid into some holes?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. I was going as hard as I could tonight, just
running after everything. So I mean, they could have blocked me out, but I was
determined to get the ball. So I was going to get it‑‑ you can't say either
way, but I was going to get it any way I could, let's just say that.  
  
Q. How confident were you, when a star player like Bias goes out, it can be
an emotional roller coaster. What allowed you guys to hold on and especially
on a visitor's court?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I knew she was going to be okay. She's tough. She's
tough‑minded and she was going to be back. We have really good people off the
bench. I can't say I wasn't worried, but I mean, Ro stepped up and I knew she
could. She leads this team as well as tiff does, even being a freshman. I was
all right with that. I was glad Ro came in and stepped up.  
  
Q. Did it help ‑‑ this is a stupid question. Did it help that you were ten,
12, 13 points up when that happened, as opposed to, say, maybe the game being
tied?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Maybe. That would have been a little different situation. But
Ro, we really practiced just as much with Ro being the point guard, so I
wasn't really too concerned, but I think if I was in the situation, I'd have
been worried if she would have been out for the rest of the year and things
like that, but I wasn't too worried about it.  
  
Q. Did you talk about, first of all, what happened as you were told, because
it was at the other end but what happened to Tiffany and were you shocked that
she was able to come back? It was kind of like, you know, Bob or whoever ‑‑
walking out of the tunnel‑‑ what happened and were you shocked she was able to
come back?   
COACH LITTELL: Well, I know she was in a lot of pain, and I think she popped a
couple ligaments in her ankle. I don't know which one it was. But she popped‑‑
I think she popped a couple, and she just was bugging me to death at the end
of the bench; "Coach, I can go, I can go."  
I worked with the trainer and I don't want to do anything to hurt our kids and
jeopardize our future. She was like, "Coach, I think we can go, we have her
taped real tight." She came back in and was very helpful in breaking the press
and making some free throws. It was just nice to have your leader on the
board, but what a job Ro did while she was off.  
LaShawn Jones, to get 16 points and 12 rebounds tonight was pretty remarkable,
Liz Donohoe hit some big baskets for us. It took every one of our kids to play
well, and it was one of our better games of the year and we needed that to
escape from a very good team on their home court.  
  
Q. If someone said you were going to get 36 and 32 from those two, would you
have liked your chances of winning?  
COACH LITTELL: Oh, yeah, I would have. I was concerned about rebounding coming
into it. I told our kids that I didn't think that they would beat us off the
first shot but I knew she had the capabilities to give us put backs and second
and third shots.  
I think our coaches schemed very well. We changed defenses all night long. We
played man, we played a 20‑zone. We rolled into a 1‑3‑1, and we played a
triangle‑in‑two for a lot of minutes on Moses and April Wilson, and I thought
we did a great job of keeping them under control and I thought the triangle in
two was a big difference in the ballgame.

### [Whitney Bays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26934)

### [Courtney Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26876)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  73  
PURDUE - 66

  
COACH VERSYP: Oklahoma State early on, really set the tone on the boards, game
of their life, 20 boards and that obviously hurt us, and then 55 got some real
good offensive boards when we were trying to make a run back.  
So we really struggled there. Even though the numbers look good on paper, the
first half really set the tone, and then they shot 42 percent and we didn't
shoot as well at 37 percent, so that kind of is what happened and they
controlled the tempo.  
  
Q. How difficult were they to keep off the boards, especially early it
seemed like they set the tone there, like Sharon said, for the first ten or 15
minutes.  
WHITNEY BAYS: I think at first it seemed really difficult because everybody,
it seemed like everybody was crashing. Like we would box someone out and they
would get loose and they were getting long rebounds, too. It was difficult at
first.  
  
Q. Courtney, how were they able to limit you guys in transition for most of
the game?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We weren't rebounding their offensive rebounds, so when they
are scoring, they were able to push the ball but were obviously making
rebounds and scoring layups and it's hard to run on that and we weren't
knocking down shots today?  
  
Q. They got some second ‑chance points but you got it down to six points and
that came off the second chance, does that encapsulate a little of your
issues, you get on a run and made a bucket on you?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Every time we would fight back, they would come back with an
answer, and good teams do that at this point in the tournament. That's what
good teams do. So every time we got close, they hit a three or got a steal or
something would happen.  
  
Q. Anything different about the way they played defense or the zone that
they had, that made you guys think a little bit?  
WHITNEY BAYS: I have to watch the game because during the game you don't
really see anything, but basically it was the rebounding, we weren't able to
get on the run that we wanted to and it was really, really clogged up and
sometimes we drove and we weren't getting the looks that we really wanted.  
  
Q. Courtney, could you talk about the performance of Whitney, not only
today, but all weekend and sort of how she rose up during the tournament a
little?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Whitney has been ‑‑ (inaudible) all season. The procedure done
and the rehab and then the two games, the way she has, I'm very proud of her
and I can't wait to see what she can do next year.  
  
Q. How do you feel like you played tonight?  
WHITNEY BAYS: I'm never satisfied. I missed a couple crucial free throws. I
could have blocked out better, played better defense. But I'm not satisfied;
we didn't win.  
  
Q. Courtney, how proud are you of the team this season?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We've been talking in the locker room about all the adversity
we went through, and to hear from people (ph), the adversity to think that the
team, bawling their eyes out, that means more to me than winning tonight is
what we went through as a team.  
  
Q. Sort of what I asked Courtney, too, about the one sequence, you got it
down to six.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we just couldn't‑‑ we just couldn't get where we needed to
be. When that happened, that was a dagger and we had two turnovers in a row
and that stretched back to 11.  
Those were keys to the game. They played a great game, and I knew it was going
to be a great game going back and forth, but when you've got that lead, you
know, we just need to make sure that we secured the ball and boxed out better.
You know, they are a very good rebounding team, which they showed tonight.  
  
Q. Did the early rebounding edge for them just kind of take that off the
transition that you wanted to use tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, you know, very early when they were crashing, they were ‑‑
like 22, it just set the tone. It kind of sets the tone, rebounding, that
carries the bat. And trying, first of all, trying to get back, we've got to be
able to have a post player run the middle, and that's been a weakness of ours
all year.  
Whitney has been getting the rebounds but we don't have the post running down
the floor. So when you don't have that option, it's easier to defend on the
lanes.  
  
Q. How important was the tournament for Whitney?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's big. I think the whole year has been big. We didn't
know if she would finish the whole season. We didn't know where she would be.
She's above and beyond what everybody, doctors, everyone, didn't think she
could ever play again, and she's gone against the odds. She's just battled.
She's a kid that has so much passion and love for the game, and you know,
she's just been amazing.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to matchupwith Martin?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't know. Everybody is like, where's she coming from. I'm
like, well, if it's man‑to‑man, the person who is contesting should be boxing
her out. Zone is a little different; it could be a guard, it could be post,
and we are boxing out and she would find that just in time. She was on a
mission and she finished it, there's no question about it. She played great.  
  
Q. You stated you wanted to get to the Sweet16 and it was pretty important,
but this falls short of that goal; what is the thought in your mind as the
season comes to an end?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I normally say this every year, but I think this year
because we've dealt with so many issues, like five, heavy, like‑death
situations, I'm just so proud of them, AK (ph), what she brought us and has
been part of that senior class. So you fall short from the Sweet16 basketball
wise, but when you talk about everything else, they are top in the country, so
that's the best I can sum up.  
  
Q. The couple minutes, end of the first half and couples minutes to start
the second half, swing in their favor ‑‑ put you pretty far behind.   
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, it did. Just tried to come out and execute, and we turned
the ball over, that was never a good way to start your second half or with a
kick out‑of‑bounds or whatever. So it's always the first four minutes and then
the end of the halves and beginning of the half, we didn't do very well.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We're very excited to be here. We're very pleased that we
beat a very good team yesterday. I thought Florida Gulf Coast has a unique
style of play. A very difficult team to guard. I was pleased the way our team
responded in the last half of the game, last 10 minutes of the game when we
were down by 10.  
We told our team this morning that our change in attitude is from survive and
advance to thrive and advance. We're going to thrive on the opportunity of
being here, we're excited to be here, it's a big deal. After today we're going
to be in the final 32 and we have an opportunity to play ourselves into the
Sweet 16. So, we're very excited about it. We know we play a great team, on
their home floor, but we're going to thrive on the experience that we get.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, Tiffany and Brittney, you go from the Florida Gulf
Coast style that they play where they spread you out to Purdue style, which is
more traditional. Are there examples throughout the year where you've had to
go from game to game and change, face styles like that or change styles in a
quick fashion?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Our whole conference, we all use the switch defense and switch
up offenses because each team plays different. So, I think we have a good
scout and I think we have a good feel of how they play.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Just the same. We have to deal with different matchups and
things like that throughout our whole conference. So, this is just like we're
used to, just sticking to fundamentals and sticking to the game plans that the
coaches arrange for us.  
  
Q. Brittney, Tiffany had a rough shooting day a little bit yesterday. You
guys ‑‑ you've seen her play for awhile, she's pretty good at bouncing back
from those type of games?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so. She works hard and really hard work gets you
really far. It gets you really far in games. So I think that she will be fine.
I'm not worried about it. I don't think our team's worried about it.  
  
Q. Tiffany, you did a lot of the heavy lifting in the last game, is it safe
to say that you'll be the one on Courtney Moses?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think so. As of right now. I think that's the game plan. So,
it's just a good matchup between two good guards. So, it will be great to go
head to head with her and I can't wait to get on the floor.  
  
Q. Tiffany, talk about Courtney's game and what you see out of her if you've
watched enough film yet, and is it similar to some other players you faced
this year?  
TIFFANY BIAS: She's a great shooter. She gets it off quick and comes off
screens. I think a lot of plays are designed to get her through the staggered
screens and get her that shot. So, I think I got to be cognizant of that and
be defensively mentally sound and I think it will be fine. I just have to stay
down on defense.  
  
Q. For either of the players, can you talk about how much you talked about
the Sweet 16 this year and where that ranks in terms of goals.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that we're just taking it game by game, really. Of
course we want to get to the Sweet 16. We didn't do it last year, we should
have, and I think that's something that's always on our mind. But, I think we
just take it game by game and just really I guess, that's what we're working
towards, so we're just taking it step by step.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Pretty much what Brittany said. I think it's just game by game
and it's always a big goal of ours just to keep advancing, so I think that
we're all excited to play and excited to be here.  
  
Q. What can you make of the Big ‑10, Big‑12 matchup? Do you feel any, I
guess, pride in carrying the Big‑12 banner here?   
TIFFANY BIAS: We take a lot of pride coming from the Big‑12\. I think that the
Big‑12 and Big‑10 are different in a lot of ways, but also the same. I think
we both take pride in our conferences.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Good answer. I think we're both here for a reason, so I think
we just got to go play and, yeah, we just got to play, really.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you are in a similar situation last year where you
were at Duke on its home floor, you guys were up at halftime. What's to learn
out of that that can be applied to Monday night?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: We just got to be patient. We have to relax. We can't play
scared like we did last year. I thought we looked nervous and we looked like
we were in a panic. I think this year we, or last year really, taught us that
we need to be patient. We need to run our offense and when we get in different
situation that we're not familiar with, we need to learn how to come out of
those instead of coming out like we did last year. So I'm just‑‑ I hope we
don't, I hope we learned I guess from that situation. I know I did.  
  
Q. For Tiffany, I know you've probably been down 10 points with 10 minutes
to play in a game before, but maybe not in your last potential game as a
college player. What was going through your mind yesterday when you look up on
the board and you know you've got to rally to stay alive?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think we have been in that situation a lot this year. I think
that as long as we stay together as a team we're going to pull it out. I think
it's just point by point, you can't get it back all at one time. A lot of
players on our team yesterday stepped up and we just kept pushing away at the
lead and our coaches believed in us they never stopped coaching and we never
stopped playing.  
  
Q. Tiffany, you have a shooter's mentality, you're just going to keep firing
and figure you'll find the zone eventually?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Yeah, I hope one goes in.  
(Laughter.)  
But, no, my coach told me yesterday, you have to have a short‑term memory and
for me to lead, I can't dwell on that. So, as long as my teammates are getting
open and making the right reads and decision making, hopefully a few will fall
tomorrow.  
  
Q. To expand on being down by 10 points, through your season do you feel
that there's no reason to panic because you've been in that situation before,
especially in a league like the Big ‑12?   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I can't say there's no reason to not panic, because you have
to be really, really fundamentally sound. You have to run your offense, you
can't just give away possessions. So, I think even coming from the Big‑12 we‑‑
I would, in situations like that I do get worried. But I know that our team
can pull together and as long as we do what we're supposed to do, I think
anything can really happen. So, as long as we play hard.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think momentum changes a lot during a basketball game. So, you
just need that one spark, that one basket for the team just to get all into it
and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how did you end up at Oklahoma State?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think I committed really early. I loved the coaches, I loved
the facility, I just wanted to be what they were about and about family and
their program building and stepping in at a good time for me to just learn to
be a leader. It was helpful to have someone older than me teaching me along
the way, but I learned from my mistakes and I wouldn't have it any other way.
The coaches have been on my side ever since, so.  
  
Q. Considering everything this program has been through, just can you talk
about not overcoming just things on the court, but also things off the court
and how much a Sweet 16 advance would mean to you guys, considering everything
that this program has been through.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Every year this program has progressed. I think that every year
you can tell that we have gotten better, we have been more successful every
year, we have got better players, better teamwork, and just people that can
just be as one as a family.  
It would mean a lot to this program, I think everyone around it, our fans
believe in us, it really takes us a long way when have you that great support
behind you. So, it would mean great things for this program and just for the
future for Cowgirl basketball.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of the crowd yesterday for Purdue's game?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Yeah, Iowa State has the biggest fan base I've ever seen. You
can't hear anything in that gym. It's really loud. It scared me the first time
I went in there, to be honest. But, I think it's fun to play with crowds like
that, especially when they're against you. When you make baskets it's silent,
it's fun to be in that atmosphere, I think. But we have played in that
atmosphere. I've played in it at Iowa State, like I said, that's a hard place
to play, so I'm excited to have a crowd like that.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think we have all played in a lot of gyms like that where I
think we're accustomed to having not hearing plays. I think that we have
gotten better over the year and the season about relating back to each other.
So, I think it will be a test, but I think that we have dealt with it before,
so we'll be okay.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse you to the locker room and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. How much does Liz, having someone her size that can shoot the three as
well as she has, how does that open things for Tiffany and Brittney and some
of your other players?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Well, not only for other guards, but it opens up for our
inside game as well. Liz has the ability to stretch the defense both in a half
court setting and in transition, as well. You got to find her. She got off to
a great start and kept us in the game early and then struggled and missed some
shots that she normally hits.  
But, to have somebody with her size that has the ability to stretch the
defense is always been a big asset to us.  
  
Q. Roshunda really hit some big baskets for you that helped you out in the
second half. It's difficult to know who needs to be the unsung hero, but how
important is it to be beyond your big three, for someone else to step up?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Well this is a game, and we told our team that this
morning. This is a game that everyone has got to play well. We play a very
solid basketball team that has a lot of weapons, they're very physical, they
got great size, so we can't have one person on or two people on, we got to
have everybody at the top of their game. And a cliche, we got to bring our A
game against these people and our big three has been Bias, Donohoe, and
Martin. They didn't shoot the ball very well yesterday, and all three of them
are going to have to shoot better and we're going to have to get contribution
off the bench.  
You alluded to Roshunda Johnson, I thought she was exceptional yesterday,
especially since she is a Freshman. We had the confidence at the end of
regulation to go to her for the last shot. She came off of a high ball pick,
had a 15‑footer, had the courage to shoot it, missed it, but we went into
overtime. I thought Ro was a big difference in the ball game, yesterday. And
for a Freshman to do that is a very positive sign.  
  
Q. The physicality and height was used by Purdue yesterday. From watching
you, it looks like have you a little bit better personnel to deal with that,
but what do you think about the interior matchup tomorrow night?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: They just keep bringing size at you. Their post strength
and the versatility that they have to just run players in at the four, five
position is very impressive.  
The early films, it's going to be crucial that we keep them off the boards. I
think one of the best things that they do is offensive rebound. They're very
good in a high low game, we call it a Miami game, where they try to get the
ball in the high post and drop it down to the low post. Their fours and fives
are very good at dribble handoffs, taking the ball to the guards, and creating
a screen situation.  
So, I think they got a lot of versatility, they got a lot of size, they got
depth at the post position where they can keep coming at you and I was very
impressed with those kids. And 32 coming off the bench is a high, high energy
player that brings a lot to their program. And I don't know why she doesn't
start, but I feel like she's one of their better players.  
  
Q. I think you said after the game yesterday you weren't quite sure how you
won it. 24 hours later, have you figured that out?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We may have worn them out. They maybe drove by us so much
that at the end of the game that they were physically tired.  
(Laughter.)  
I don't know. You look at the numbers sometimes, and they aren't conducive to
winning. We were 7‑14 from the free throw line. But, we have won that way all
year long. We have told our team it's better to win ugly than lose pretty. And
we have won a lot of games in that fashion.  
After stepping back and reflecting on it, that's a good team. I guarantee you
there's a lot of people in America that didn't want to play that team. And
they're hard to guard, they're not a conventional style of play, and it was a
very good win for us. That's a team that was unique in the way they play and
very, very well coached. I told our team, I don't know if I said it here
yesterday, that Fran Fraschilla says a third of the time you play great, a
third of the time you play average and a third of the time you play poorly.
It's those teams, when they're having a bad night and things that aren't going
their way, finding away to win. Those are the teams that win 20 plus games and
those are the teams that advance. And that's been indicative of us, that when
we have been average to off in our play, we found a way to win. I think that's
a sign of maturity in your players.  
  
Q. I asked the players about going from one style to the next, you mentioned
the other day that Iowa State compared to Florida Gulf Coast, in that regard,
going from that style they play to Purdue's style, is that kind of an easier
transition for you guys based on the schedule you played this year?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Oh, I'm not going to say going to Purdue's an easier
transition by any stretch of the imagination. I think they're really good.  
Do we match with them better? Probably. Does our personnel fit their personnel
better? Probably. And I heard their assistant coach that did the scout after
the game said the same thing that I'm saying right now, that we probably match
better with Oklahoma State than we would with Florida Gulf Coast. So, in this
game a lot of times it comes down to matchups and I think it's two teams that
matchup pretty well. We have had some common opponents and the outcomes have
been very similar, so I'm not really excited about how, saying that we're
matching with them real well, but we're a better matchup than we were
yesterday. And I think they will feel the same way too.  
  
Q. Along those lines, is there anybody in the Big ‑12 or anybody that you
played in the non‑conference that would remind you of Purdue? Or vice versa?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: We play Michigan State in Puerto Rico. I think they're
similar to a certain extent. Baylor plays more of a traditional lineup with a
four and a five. I think they're that way a little bit.  
They will play a four and five lineup, but we saw a lot of four guard lineups
this year, so this will be a little stretch for us as well, but we have seen
some lineups ‑‑ probably Baylor is the closest to what we faced.  
  
Q. Has Tiffany done a pretty good job of bouncing back from off shooting
nights?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: She's a resilient young lady and she's got a lot of faith
in her own abilities and the abilities of her teammates. And in our league, as
I think the Big‑10 is, you got to be pretty resilient and we stressed to our
team all year long that we're in 18 individual battles. And she didn't play
well in the last battle, we got a new battle. It's a new individual battle
that we're facing here.  
I expect her to be fine. You're not going to play great every game and she's
carried us a lot this year. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her. And I
anticipate that she will play very well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You made steady progress over the last couple of years. I'm curious how
you've been able to keep things on track since the plane crash, and if you
think about it yet, as a coach, about the Sweet 16.  
COACH JIM LITTELL: It's not something that I really like talking about. We
lost some people that were very dear to our hearts. We made commitments right
then, and I'm not going to talk a lot about it, to be honest, but we made a
commitment that the best way for us to pay honor was to compete, play hard,
and try to push forward each day. I think that's what this team has done. They
have gone from 7th in the conference to 5th in the conference to 3rd in the
conference. So our kids have overcome a lot, our coaches have overcome a lot,
and I'm proud of what they have done.  
  
Q. What's the one thing you want your players to take out of last year's
second round game at Duke that you can apply tomorrow night?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: You got to be sound for 40 minutes. We led in that game, I
believe, for 35 minutes. But, we made some mistakes at the end of the game. We
made some mistakes with a double digit lead that came back to haunt us.  
So when you get to this level, you can't be really good for 30 minutes and
average to poor for 10 minutes or it will come up and bite you. I watched the
tape from that experience and you got to be solid for the entire 40 minutes.
You got to play with great effort, you got to play with great energy, but you
got to be very solid in how you play, value the basketball, don't take
possessions off defensively, and that pretty well describes our league too.  
You got to do that on every given night, so it's not a whole lot different
than what we have faced within the Big‑12\. But just to be more solid and play
the full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Your impressions of Courtney Moses?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: Love her. She's a great player, outstanding player. Plays
the game the right way. You can tell she has an outstanding respect for the
game, this is the way the game ought to be played. I would say the kid's
probably a dream to coach. You don't have many of those come along.
Outstanding shooter.  
I told our team that in film this morning that it may be the best shooter that
we have faced all year long. You look at her numbers, 49 percent overall and
almost 47 from the three and 91 from the line. She has the ability to score
the basketball and we're going to have to do a good job on her in their half
court set. They run a lot of things through her. She's very good at finding
the open seams in transition, as well. I just think she's an outstanding
player that really respects the game and knows how to play the game.  
  
Q. How do you keep your team engaged tomorrow with the late tip off at nine
o'clock local time?  
COACH JIM LITTELL: That may be the best time for us. Our kids night maybe
starts at nine o'clock, so that I may be the best time for us, I don't know. I
guarantee you it's probably a better time than 10 o'clock in the morning,
central standard time, for us.  
So, they play under the same ‑‑ I think it's an advantage that they're going
to be in their own apartments or their own rooms or whatever. But, it is what
it is and I'm not going to worry about things I can't control, we can't
control what time we play. We can control how we play and what our effort and
energy level is about. That's what I choose to focus on instead of the late
start. Now, coaches at my age, that's a little bit late to be out at night, so
I hope I'm okay. I'm a little more worried about me than I am our kids.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Looking at the matchup with Oklahoma State I think both
coaches see that it's similar matchup, fours and fives and shooting guard and
great point guards. So, it's going to be a very, very good matchup Big‑12,
Big‑10, both conferences are exceptionally tough. And we just have to continue
to do the little things and do what we need to do in order to be successful on
both ends of the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Speak to what Dee Dee has meant for you guys this year. Especially since
KK has gone down.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Dee Dee ‑‑ has been four years with Dee Dee, so all the way
back to freshman year until now. We put her on the other team's best defensive
player and she can guard anybody in the country. Just the positive energy that
she brings. She's always talking on the court, she's a great communicator,
always being positive and bringing energy both to the guards and the post. And
she's so versatile and can play any position and she is just a great teammate.  
WHITNEY BAYS: She covered all the bases of ‑‑ she's a great teammate, vocal
leader for us, always positive, can play the inside and outside and defensive
stopper, so she's contributed a lot this year. It's been great playing with
her.  
  
Q. What do you think about the interior matchup with Oklahoma State? You
guys had had your way a little bit with the Zip's but I would imagine that
facing a Big ‑12 opponent like them you expect it to be pretty physical
inside.   
WHITNEY BAYS: Definitely. We went over the scouting report and we're prepared
for them and what they have to offer and bring. But, they have two really good
bigs, so we're just trying to prepare and it will be a great matchup.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their outside game. They didn't shoot a lot of 3's,
they hit some big 3's down the stretch and Donohoe got off to a good start.
How concerned are you about their outside shooting and their ability to hit
big outside shots?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I feel like from watching film we're just going to have to
communicate. Donohoe, she's a great shooter from the three, especially. And
we're just going to have to not help off of her on ball side and everybody
else just has to contain. I feel like the biggest part will be number four,
but I feel like we're going to take care of that and be fine.  
  
Q. For Courtney and Dee Dee. Courtney, your impressions of Bias, the point
guard, remind you of anybody that maybe that you faced this year?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Nobody comes to mind. She's her own player and her own self.
She's a very quick player. She's crafty on offense and she's a very good
defender. She's a great leader for their team and keeps them going.  
WHITNEY BAYS: I agree with Courtney. She's a great leader, they run through
her. She likes to go right a lot but I feel like at the same time she can go
left if she needs to. She's very crafty and we're just going to have to do a
good job of communicating and playing her.  
  
Q. Whitney, you got your offense going a little bit more lately and from
some of the early misses yesterday, what did you feel like you did differently
to be more engaged and be able to take advantage of some of the things that
they were doing?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yesterday I was like maybe a little anxious. It was a long two
weeks. So, I was ready to get out there and I was really hyped, but I think
that focusing on where I'm trying to score, where I am scoring, if my jumper
is not falling then I can drive. If I can get my layup to go, then shoot some
jumpers. So, I'll look for my other teammates, also. When they give me the
ball, it's in a great position. So, being more smarter when I'm trying to
score, I guess.  
  
Q. Courtney and Dee Dee, you know that tomorrow is your last time down the
tunnel. Other than focusing on Oklahoma State, have you given that any
thought?  
COURTNEY MOSES: It's gone through our mind since yesterday and what better way
to go out than to be playing to go to the Sweet 16.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I agree. I thought about it plenty of times and I'm ready to
go out there and have my last game and just play hard for my teammates, for
the fans. But, it's exciting, but at the same time, it's kind of sad to know
that it could be our last game at home.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, is it Whitney's versatility offensively that makes her a pretty
good player on that end?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: Definitely. She's an awesome player. I love playing with
her. You can give her the ball on wing, she can shoot it, you can give it to
her at the three, she can do everything with it. Give it to her down low, she
can score from anywhere. And that's a huge part of Whitney's game. And for her
to be able to come back from her injury and still be able to do all the things
that she does, it's great for us.  
  
Q. Courtney, there's a lot of similarities, where do you see the
similarities between you and Oklahoma State?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I see it in every position. It's a Big‑10, Big‑12 matchup and
it's similar to playing a Big‑10 team where we matchup at every position. So,
every single position, I feel like it's a similarity and matches up.  
  
Q. Courtney, what do you plan on doing all day tomorrow before the nine
o'clock game?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Sleep in, eat some food. We're going to see if we're going to
go work on homework, watch a movie, maybe Frozen, I heard it's pretty good.
And take a nap. Eat some food and go play.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse you to the locker room and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Are they similar to you or are you similar to them?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: If you go through the lineup, the versatility at the four
spot when 31 is in, she can shoot the three or take it to the hole. So, they
got versatility there and they got the big down low which is like Camille.  
Number four, she's a great set shooter. So, we got to limit her and they may
compare that to someone else on our team, even though she's smaller. Martin's
very, very good and she's one of the really overall best players if you look
at rebounding, if you look at how she can score the basketball. They really go
to her and isolate her quite a bit.  
Their point guard is ‑‑ how your point guard goes is how you go. And that's
kind of the same with us.  
We just have to do what we do well, and they're going to try to do things that
they do well and we need to try to exploit any weaknesses from each side. But,
I know they mentioned that they're worried about our rebounding, we got to
crash, we got to do that exceptionally well, and we got to be able to run.  
  
Q. What strikes you about Whitney's offensive game? Her versatility, ability
to do it a bunch of different ways?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I knew she could really face the basket really well
when I recruited her during high school. She had great one‑on‑one, ball
handling skills, but being able to score down low is something that we have
continued to help develop. But she's better, she's gotten so much better in
that area. So, it is hard to guard her. Next year she will have a 3‑point
shot. She can take that, she just doesn't use it very much this year, but I
think when she adds that to her arsenal then she will be really, really tough.
But she's just very, very hard to defend.  
  
Q. You talked earlier in the season, you had a few rough stretches with like
two games in three days. Do you think that's really going to help you right
now?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: We have had games like this pretty much all year. You
play a game, you're prepared knowing who you're going to play, you have one
day to prepare, and we were very successful there. So, it's when you play
three games back to back, that we obviously didn't have that this year, but
we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Dee Dee has had games when she's been able to score for you and maybe
others that she's had the high assist total or rebound total. Do you think
yesterday was maybe the best game that she's put all of those things together
at one time?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I think so. Everything just came natural. Nothing
was forced, nobody was getting excited if you do this or this or people
playing off, she just played. She was open, she shot the three. If shot clock
was going down, two dribble jump shot. She just was really comfortable. And
when she can score, obviously that benefits us. When she can defend and
rebound exceptionally well ‑‑ and when you're defending their top player, you
got to be able to box that person out. So her stats are increasing, but again
she does all the intangibles.  
You got to have a kid that's on the court and in the locker room that's
willing to play that role to a T and be that glued to the team. And that's Dee
Dee.  
  
Q. Yesterday you played nine players and nine players scored at one point.
When you look at matching their depth, they had some players come off the
bench too, Oklahoma State did. Just getting that similar production tomorrow,
how far can that go in pushing you guys forward?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I think it's real important. If we can keep bringing
bodies in that keeps us fresh, that wears teams down, hopefully. Yesterday I
was just bringing two posts, two posts, two posts. And at the guard spot,
depending upon matchups, that type of thing, being able to get Hayden and
Bridget in quite a bit. That's what we have to do in order to be successful.  
You hope you don't get in foul trouble, but if you do, at least you have that
tournament experience, which is real important.  
  
Q. Do they remind you of anybody you played either in the conference or non
‑conference?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: No, they just have similarities. Each of the players
might be similar to somebody in the Big‑10, but I wouldn't say, boy, this team
is totally like X Y and Z, I wouldn't say that. We just know that one of their
post players can step out and shoot the three, so we have to be aware of that.
Another one is more a 15‑foot shooter. And the other ones are really back to
the basket. But at the guard spot, it's pretty similar in the Big‑10 to the
type of people we have to defend.  
  
Q. Impressions of Bias? She didn't have the greatest game on Saturday, but
you watched film on her. She has performed at a high level.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Oh, she's a very, very good player. There's no question
about that. Courtney alluded to it, it goes through her. It should go through
your point guard. And if she's ‑‑ because maybe she didn't do as well
yesterday, she's going to be ready to play. So ‑‑ and she was ready yesterday,
she just maybe didn't, things just didn't happen for her.  
She's the one that can come off on ball screens, she can fake to the hole,
does pull up jump shots, she find the role player exceptionally well. So we
just need to slow her down little bit and not allow her to really get going
and get her tempo going.  
  
Q. What do you think about the now nine o'clock tip?  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: I think it's great. I think it's great for us at Oklahoma
State. I think that nine p.m. it's prime time. They have talked this game up,
if we got to this, they have done it all on national papers as well as ESPNW,
that's all they talked about, so they moved it for a good reason.  
So we just want to encourage everybody to continue to come out. I think it
will be great. We had a great crowd here yesterday, so we want to continue to
show that people that women's basketball here in the Midwest.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH SHARON VERSYP: Thank you.

### [Jenna Cobb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26873)

### [Sarah Hansen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26872)

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Oklahoma State - 61  
Florida Gulf Coast - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: Lets ask can Coach Smesko to make an opening statement and then
to questions for Sarah and Jenna. Coach?  
COACH SMESKO: Obviously, this is a very frustrating way to go out. Marchcan be
very cruel sometimes. I'm really proud of our team and the way we played, and,
you know, we just didn't finish regulation, and then we needed to make one
more play in overtime to advance and give Oklahoma State credit they fought
and refused to lose.  
  
Q. To both of you, you guys had all the momentum you're up 55 ‑47 after
Whitney made a 3 and the last 11 or so minutes, 5 points. What happened to the
offense there? It seemed like everybody stood out in the perimeter and hoped
everybody would make shots. Sarah?   
SARAH HANSEN: We were playing a five out offense, we were getting complacent,
we weren't attacking it, we were looking to shoot, we passed up a couple shots
at the end we would have usually shot. We just tried not to lose, as opposed
to trying to win and finish the game off.  
JENNA COBB: I think also they pushed it really well in conversion and we
didn't get back and they were making good shots in conversion the second half
when we started to run they started to push it more so we stopped scoring and
they started corresponding more.  
  
Q. Jenna, you took a shot there, late, a shot that needed to be taken, with
the shot clock running down, take us through that play and what you saw.  
JENNA COBB: We knew there was going to be a shot open in the corner so if we
got it down in the corner you have to take that shot, you can't pass it up so
I was ready to shoot and to knock it down.  
  
Q. Sarah, can you compare this to 2012, it's almost the exact same outcome,
same game?  
SARAH HANSEN: That game we were up too and we let it get away, and we kinda
did the same thing today, give credit to the Oklahoma State they took it from
us in the end there. They made the plays down the stretch that they had to.
They're a great team, obviously and we kind of started to settle down and got
a little back on our heels and that's when they came at us hard and took it
away. Similar to St. Bonaventure, to answer your question.  
  
Q. Jenna, I know a big emphasis on the team late in the year was attack,
attack, attack. You did that at points this year. Do you think ‑‑ what
happened in the last 8 to 10 minutes?   
JENNA COBB: I think we did get a little bit tentative toward the end. But
there were times where we were still attacking, we were just not knocking down
the shots. They took too long. We had a few 30‑second shot clock calls on us,
but you gotta give credit to Oklahoma's defense of taking us out of that and
making us get tough shots at the end.  
  
Q. I know you had a 10 ‑point lead in the second half, but when it comes
down to 1 point I think you probably go back and look at everything. You
missed 12 layups in the second half. Was that nerves or the situation they
were coming down and forcing you to redirect layups? What was the deal there
early?   
SARAH HANSEN: I think that we were a little bit nervous coming into the game.
We missed wide‑open layups that we usually wouldn't miss. We focus on
finishing our layups and we try to shoot as efficient of a field goal
percentage as possible and we just didn't finish our layups. Usually when
we're in a situation like that and we can finish them, we do. Today we were
nervous going into the game and it came back to bite us.  
JENNA COBB: Basically the same as Hansen and when we were going in there we
were all turning our shots too, to the defense and just trying not to get
blocked and I think that has a lot to do with it too, instead of going
straight up.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season when you got down like you did today it would have
usually ended up in a loss. Today you rallied and hung in there. Is that kind
of Aprilsign of the growth of your team? Talk about what you talked about even
when you were having a tough time making shots.  
JENNA COBB: Yeah I think that definitely shows where‑‑ early in the season
when we were playing big teams we kind of struggled, and I think that does
show how much we have grown toward the end of the season and just coming
together, you know, we have been in overtime situations before.  
Obviously with Stephanie two times but when you are going against a strong
team like Oklahoma State you've got to be able to finish, especially in
situations like that because they're going to come at you.  
SARAH HANSEN: I don't remember the question.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season when you would get down like today.  
SARAH HANSEN: Oh, yeah, like Jenna was saying it showed the growth of our team
and we came together. In the beginning of the season we had a lot of people
coming in and we weren't 100% comfortable playing with each other. We liked
each other well enough, we just didn't have it on the court at that point.  
When we would start to‑‑ when they would‑‑ other teams would start to come
around we would crumble and we've come together and become a family now and
you can tell on the court. I think it speaks volumes for our growth over the
past couple of months.  
  
Q. Sarah, when you guys had that 10 ‑point lead and they started chipping
away at it, did 2012 creep into your mind?   
SARAH HANSEN: At that point no. I was kind of like into the game. But now
looking back, yeah. I mean, we have had games where we let teams get back into
it, even games in overtime we started to settle and let them get back into it.
We were up 7 less than a minute to go and it ended up being a 2‑point game and
things like that. I think just looking back, it hurts more because of that,
but in the moment, I mean, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations on a great season.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, how many times there late in the second half were you thinking,
okay, we get one more shot and we can really make it difficult for them?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, I mean, that never crossed my mind. I mean, obviously them
going to the zone late, you know, frustrated us a little bit. We were trying
to move the ball quick, and then penetrate into the middle lane and kick it
out. For whatever reason I think we got tense and everybody stood around and
passed the ball around and we didn't look for the‑‑ we thought we could get it
in the middle and then kick it out and have a shooter in the corner, be either
a shot or one pass for a shot and, you know, nobody actually made the
aggressive move to create the shot.  
When you're playing a team as good as Oklahoma State, you can't just hope the
time runs out. You gotta make a play to win the game and I just thought we got
real tentative, especially the last four or five minutes, maybe being too
afraid to make a mistake or be the one to do something wrong. We weren't as
aggressive and, you know, we probably could have run maybe some different
plays so that they had to be aggressive, like where it calls for their
aggressiveness.  
That's what I will have to think about when we review this game.  
  
Q. Coach, Whitney Knight had 11 rebounds and she really had some big
rebounds for you in the second half. Is that something that you were hopeful
thinking that you would be able to exploit in the game?  
COACH SMESKO: Well, we didn't think we could win rebounds against Oklahoma
State but we thought to win we would have to keep it close and everybody would
have to contribute on the boards and you can see Sarah had 9, Jenna 9, Haas 6
in 21 minutes so it was a team effort on the boards, Whitney blocked shots and
altered shots and second half especially she was all over the boards so that
we limited them to one shot. So defense actively I thought we executed our
game plan pretty well. Just didn't shoot well, we didn't finish layups well,
and then, you know, at the end of the game we got really tentative, and, you
know, that's disappointing. We wished we could have finished this off.  
  
Q. Whitney was assertive defensively and she has talked about how you wanted
her to be more assertive offensively. Would you have liked to have seen her be
more assertive in the last 5 minutes of regulation and overtime?  
COACH SMESKO: They were in a zone, we would have liked to get her the ball
more. We put her in a spot that we thought they were going to have a long
close‑out and they were going to have trouble getting it. But what we put in
there‑‑ we hadn't worked on it very much but we saw what was going to be open
and when we got the ball in that situation, for whatever reason we passed it
away from her when she was open in the corner so we were supposed to pass fake
away from her and get it to her, over to Cobb and we kept throwing it back up
top which was the opposite of what we talked about. The moment got to us and
we kind of froze a little bit and it's disappointing because our kids played
so hard to be in that position. You know, it would have been nice just to be
able to finish the game, but, you know, it definitely would have been nice to
get Whitney the ball more especially along the baseline where it was open. We
didn't do it and it makes for a tough ending.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday Tiffany Bias was priority number one for your
defense, she went 1 of 9 with 8 turnovers but made a shot in traffic, the game
winner. So overall you gotta be pleased but she had 8 assists and made it when
it mattered.  
COACH SMESKO: She is a great all‑around player. We wanted to limit her in
conversion and we didn't do a great job in transition, transition, early we
lose Donohoe a number of times and she was supposed to be a key in conversion
and Tiffany Bias found people in transition and with her assists, Kaneisha
Atwater did a great job on her when she was in, making it so she could get to
the basket, forcing her to take jump shots and we did a good job on the ball
screen defense when she came off them, but she made the big play at the end.  
  
Q. What do you think was the could I to your team hanging in there when you
were down double digits not being able to make a lot of shots and then turning
the game around in the second half where you built up a lead?  
COACH SMESKO: We started off really slow and didn't execute offensively well
and when we got layups we missed them. It was definitely frustrating first 10,
twelve minutes but because our defense was good enough we weren't out of the
game and I thought Stephanie Haas was huge, she wasn't afraid to get in there,
got fouled, made layups and I think she gave confidence to the whole team. We
saw Stephanie was being active and cutting on the catch and people picked up
momentum from her.  
  
Q. ‑‑ she didn't play much in the second.   
COACH SMESKO: No, the‑‑ Stephanie wasn't injured, that was a coach's decision.
We were going with probably our most defensive lineup at the end of the game.
You know, Atwater, I didn't want to take her off No. 3 to put Stephanie in,
she was doing such a great job on No. 3 and it was in zone if they were on man
I wouldn't have taken Haas out because they were in man and she was really
attacking them but we kept our defensive line in and unfortunately we had that
big turnover against the press where we didn't execute our screening to get it
in and they got the tip and then hit a big 3 on us. It would probably have
been a good time to get us organized because we didn't screen very well to get
the ball in bounds there. Unfortunately we got a little tentative at the end
of the game where we didn't want to just attack and take it to them, we were
just trying to‑‑ we were being too hesitant and trying to run out the clock
with the lead and as I said, you have to play this game to the buzzer, and
give Oklahoma State credit they did and they're moving on.  
  
Q. Coach talk about the experience of coaching Sarah Hansen for five
years.  
COACH SMESKO: It's been a real treat, she is the brightest young lady I have
ever coached. She is such a competitor. Would have been nice to see her get to
advance in this tournament and that's going to be another frustration about
this, as our two trips here, We've got two overtime losses in this 12‑5 game,
she is going to be greatly missed, she is the greatest kid, but that just
makes it all the more for her.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: WEST
LAFAYETTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WEST+LAFAYETTE)

  

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Kacie Cassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26879)

### [Jodi Kest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26878)

### [Rachel Tecca](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26881)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  84  
Akron  55

COACH KEST: You know, I know the outcome wasn't what we thought beforehand,
but I am so proud of these young ladies. I'm not going to allow one game to
define the body of work that we accomplished this year, especially with these
two seniors sitting next to me, and even as poorly as we played today, and
give credit to Purdue.  
And their defense, I guess I'm not used to playing against players that are a
little bit taller and stronger and at no time did our kids give up. I'm just
so proud to be their coach, and I know these young ladies, I will have a
relationship with them ten, 15 years from now, because they are great kids and
they are kids that you want to be associated with.  
  
Q. What did you feel like Purdue did so well defensively to keep you guys
from doing what you wanted to?  
KACIE CASSELL: Their length, they are really long and lengthy. They put their
biggest girl in front of Hanna. We shot the ball not very well. I mean, they
knew our offense. They stopped it and we just couldn't get rebounds and
couldn't get second chance opportunities, because they did a good job of
boxing out and getting on the boards.  
  
Q. You obviously like to get out and run, and to do that, you have to
rebound; how much did that limit your transition game today in?  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, we didn't rebound too well today, which did limit us
offensively running the floor. We did have a few opportunities, but yeah, they
rebounded a lot better than us today. They are more physical, taller, and I
just think we struggled with that.  
  
Q. How much was the tough matchup for you guyswith 32?  
RACHEL TECCA: Again, strong, physical post. Very hard to push off the block.
She did a great job feeling inside, and I mean, I definitely struggled with
that today. Wish I could have done a better job. But yeah, commend her for
being physical in there and just stealing really well.  
  
Q. The way Purdue started this game, leading 20 ‑2, how much did that sort
of put you behind the 8‑ball in the first five minutes?  
KACIE CASSELL: We've been there and we played them in the MAC Tournament, so
we didn't get down in ourselves. It didn't hurt us at the end of the game
because that deficit, we could never really get past 11. We never got down on
ourselves, we kept fighting to the end, even down by 20, we just kept fighting
and keep working. So proud of our players because they never give up. I think
the younger kids will feed off that next year so I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. I saw you grab your leg in the second half, did that hinder you
throughout the game?  
RACHEL TECCA: I got hit with a knee brace pretty hard and it was bleeding but
it was just really painful at first, kind of a Shock. I got taped up and went
back out. It was fine.  
  
Q. What do you both take from this season and its totality?  
KACIE CASSELL: I mean, one game doesn't define our season. We've set the
records. Most wins in the season, we won the MAC for the first time ever. We
came in with goals to get a banner up there and that's what we've done, and
I'm so proud of them, and this girl right here.  
RACHEL TECCA: I'm just so proud of what this team has done all season. We have
been together for four years now and we've developed friendships that's going
to last us a lifetime. I'm so happy to be part of it, and like Kacie says,
this doesn't define what we've accomplished this season and the four years
we've been here.  
  
Q. What was it that Purdue was doing so well defensively to take you out of
what you wanted to be able to accomplish?  
COACH KEST: Well, they were a little bit longer and stronger than we've seen
all year. They made it difficult for us to get the extra passes into hands the
way they played and we weren't getting too many offensive rebounds, and we
weren't getting too many stops where we could run and that put us in the hole.
But I was really proud of our kids because they did fight really hard to get
it down to 11 going into halftime and the second half, unfortunately, that's
been one of our struggles is coming out of the second half flat and we did it
again today with not a very good three‑point shot and it cost us two and
another wide‑open three so we are down by five.  
  
Q. Hanna struggled today shooting the ball, how was Purdue able to contain
her from ‑‑ to get going on offense?  
COACH KEST: Again, give them credit. That's the worst shooting she had had all
year, not just her, but first time I think we were under 40 percent all year.
She's not used to going against kids that long and that tall. She's normally
able to jump over everybody and then when she finally did have a lot of good
looks, I think she got a little frustrated at times and started to fadeaway.  
But we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Hanna and the rest of those
kids. I mean, she's fought all year and unfortunately today she struggled.
Again, give Purdue credit. They did a phenomenal job with that, applying a lot
of pressure, she always had someone guarding her, they kept switching up
different players on her and we don't see that very often.  
  
Q. You mentioned slow second ‑half starts; knowing that, what did you do to
try to jump start them and get them coming out of the locker room, and then
did you call that real quick time‑out; anything there?   
COACH KEST: No, we just talked about what we needed to do better and come out
strong and execute that first play which we didn't do a very good job. We took
a quick three which is something we really didn't want to do. Just happened, I
don't know what to say.  
  
Q. Why was Purdue a tough guard? We heard about your offense coming in, and
they weren't able to put up 80 points on you guys ‑‑  
COACH KEST: They are known for their defense and all the research we did on
them, they are a very good offensive team but she does a fantastic job with
them defensively. They face guarded her a lot and that gave us a lot of
problems.  
  
Q. How much of a problem was it, your matchup with 32?  
COACH KEST: We have a lot of respect for her, very strong kid. We tried to
double as much as possible, and a couple times and we didn't do a very good
job of rotation and it hurt us. She was someone that we talked about a lot.

## March 22, 2014

  

### [Tiffany Bias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22720)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Oklahoma State: 61  
Florida Gulf Coast: 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach to make an opening statement and go to
questions for Tiffany and Brittney. Coach?  
COACH LITTELL: I've got about 50 texts on my phone saying "survive and
advance" and that's exactly what we did tonight. Very, very good Florida Gulf
Coast team. Extremely well coached. That guy can coach with anybody in the
country, I promise you that. He has his team well prepared. We knew going into
the game that it was a very tough guard for us, and the fact that they spread
you out and drive so much, they shoot so many three's. We may have been a
little too locked in on guarding the three's, and we really got beat a lot off
the dribble drive. I'm just‑‑ I'm happy right now that we advanced. It's one
of those games in 36, 37 years of coaching that you kind of look at and go,
how did we win that game? But these kids didn't quit.  
When we were down 10 or 12 in the second half they continued to make plays and
just found a way to win at the end and I'm very proud of 'em.  
  
Q. Tiffany, I guess they say sometimes you save your best for last. You
hadn't made a field goal all day and you had 8 turnovers, but tell me about
that ‑‑ the game‑winning basket. I think there was 41 seconds to play. Talk me
through that play. Did it finally feel good to make one?   
TIFFANY BIAS: Thank you. Sometimes you have those games you can't do anything
about it, you have to keep pushing for your team and 8 turnovers is bad for a
point guard. I was playing too fast, I should have played more under control
but we won and we're moving to the next game. I think it's one of the things
you can't dwell on and you have to look to the next one.  
  
Q. I'm talking about the last play ‑‑  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: The one you went all the way through the middle and made that
last bucket?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Oh! See, I‑‑  
COACH LITTELL: You only made one basket! (Chuckles.)  
TIFFANY BIAS: I know! Um no, I just think its one of those things where you
have to attack and get to the free throw line. I think it was more in our
minds to go through and get the foul and it was one of those things, it's
determination just knowing you're going to make it.  
  
Q. Both of you, you went to the line with a chance top kind of ‑‑ if the
final 5 seconds and missed and Brittney comes away with two steals in two
seconds. Talk about the inbounds plays. You know they're going to throw the
ball the end of the court and Brittney was able to get the steals and kind of
the relief of getting away with a game that you trailed in double digits in
second half.   
BRITTNEY MARTIN: The free throws are something we work on every day. That
shouldn't happen. All of us missed a lot of free throws and I should have made
the ones at the ending, which would have helped us a lot.  
We just pulled it out and we wanted to win and we knew what they were going to
do at the end, and they were trying to get the ball to 14 and she had the hot
hand so I guess we had to just really, I guess, stick to the game plan.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I agree with Brittney, I think Coach put us in a good position
where to guard and to switch on everything and so I think we were in good
position for that.  
  
Q. Offensively or defensively where do you think FGCU caused you the most
trouble?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think offensively it was drives. I think we weren't moving our
feet and they were getting us off the dribble and I think that's what hurt the
most.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think so, too, I think we focused so much on them not
shooting 3‑pointers and I think we played too far up on there them and didn't
move our feet so I think our defense really hurt us today.  
  
Q. They put a lot of bodies in the paint trying to prevent you guys from
throwing the ball in the middle. When you got it in the middle it seemed like
you were successful, but can you talk about the struggle it was getting the
ball in the middle and Tiffany, how difficult it was to get the ball into
Jones and Martin.  
TIFFANY BIAS: They played great side help defense so that's one of the things
we need to adjust to, see the skip. That was their game plan, to closing up
the middle. You just kind of have to get it in there any way you can and that
opened up our outside shot.  
  
Q. Tiffany was there anything they did defensively that led you to getting
the 8 turnovers?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think I forced it on my own. I think I was moving a little too
fast and trying to make things happen that wasn't there. I mean, I blame that
more on myself than I do their defense messing me up.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the stats? Okay, thank you, ladies. Questions
for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, was there a point in regulation where you were thinking if they
get one more bucket this could get sticky?  
COACH LITTELL: I was thinking that from the fifteen minute mark on in the
second half. They play such good defense if get behind them 10 to 12 points
like we did, they're kind of a ball control offense. They're so well coached
in the fact that they'll run the clock all the way down to wait for you to
make a mistake. So by falling double digits behind it was really tough coming
back because they don't shoot the ball in a hurry. They don't make mistakes.
They're going to get a good shot at the basket, so it was touch and go for a
lot of minutes and it was more than the last four or five minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at the first half and you're up 20 ‑9, they missed a
bunch of layups, now looking back with a 1‑point win how fortunate is it that
is the way the ball drops? They missed 12 layups in the first half.   
COACH LITTELL: I told their coach, I said, you had the shots to win the game
and some of their kids just missed wide‑open layups and we're fortunate, we're
very fortunate and we realize‑‑ I've been in the game long enough to realize
the shots that we gave up and how many shots, and the shots they had and when
you do that, I think on top of that, our top scorers, Donna goes 3 for 12,
bias 1 for 9 and Martin 4 for 11, those kids go 8 for 32, our top‑three
players go 8 for 32, I feel very fortunate to get a win.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how you thought he could coach at any level. Will
that style of play translate to the Big 12 or the other power conferences?  
COACH LITTELL: I think it will. You know, the one thing that may make a
difference in our league on that is you may have trouble rebounding, playing
the four guards at times but a lot of the Big 12 has gone to that but where
they're different is Whitney Knight is more of a true post, she is a point
guard off‑guard than a true post and where they're different is they've got
five guards on the floor that can lower their head and put the ball down on
the ground and get to the rim and shoot threes. And that's why I saw them on
film and said it was a difficult guard for us.  
  
Q. Coach, LaShawn went 5 for 5, Kendra 4 for 5, granted they put a lot of
bodies in the paint. Were you a little disappointed that you weren't able to
take advantage of some of those match ‑ups in the middle a little more?   
COACH LITTELL: Well, they know what they have. They know the size that they
have. They've spent all year making sure that the ball doesn't go in the
middle. There is a reason they won 26 games. They do the things that they do
very well. We tried to go inside. We had some turnovers doing it. I think
where we got hurt more is we skipped the ball across to the corner and we
missed five, six, seven wide‑open looks. To get 'em out of the paint you've
got to skip the ball and make shots to get them out of the paint and we didn't
do that so they were able to secure the paint all night long.  
  
Q. You mentioned Whitney Knight. Did you do anything defensively either in
the last 5 minutes of regulation or overtime?  
COACH LITTELL: What we did is we told‑‑ when we spread the zone we said for
someone to always stay close to her on that and we were going to make some of
their other guards hit shots. When she went to the dead corner we brought our
5 all the way out of the hole and matched up to have a fifth person on the
perimeter. We got to the corner and a forward replaces the post down low so
that was the adjustment that we tried to make. We lost her twice in transition
and she hit two quick three's and I think that took the game close to say a
10‑point lead right then and we were just determined not to give her anymore
open looks.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  84  
Akron  55

Q. Can you reenact the flex you did after the blocked shot there? What kind
of moment was that for you to go long with the whole game, the way you started
and to have that kind of play and feed off the energy of the crowd?  
COURTNEY MOSES: We started off really well. Coach always talks about getting a
great start, and collectively as a team we did just that and it was just a
play within that run to keep the energy going.  
  
Q. What was it defensively you felt like you did so well, not only the 20 ‑2
stretch to start things but to hold the team to 55?   
WHITNEY BAYS: We really paid attention and I thought that. Dee Dee Williams
did a great job on one of their best players and we rebounded 50‑28, so that
was a key stat.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, just feeding off what she said, rebounding and I think
we communicated really well like on screens we were talking and switching and
we really had each other's back and we really came out with a good win today.  
  
Q. Whitney, just to be able to control the boards the way you did, how much
do you think that limited their transition opportunities?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Well, rebounding is always an emphasis for us. I just tried to
crash all the time and I think it helped us in transition, getting out and
getting some shots. It was able to slow them down sometimes, too.  
  
Q. For both players, just playing here in the NCAA Tournament, how does that
help you guys move forward year ‑in and year‑out?   
WHITNEY BAYS: Definitely with our fans it helps us and we practice here, we
played here all year so I think it does have our benefit, its benefit, but
yeah, it's our home court so there's pressure to get the win obviously, too.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Our fans were awesome today. They were very, very loud and
hope to see them again on Monday.  
  
Q. You got off to a slow start but you overcame that and what got you going
there and do you feel like you had a pretty big advantage inside what maybe
was a difficult match up?  
COURTNEY MOSES: I think all of our post collectively did a great job. It's
been a long two weeks, that's not an excuse by any means but definitely we
need to knock‑down those shots if we try to get further into the tournament.
Going off of them and they still kept going into me and that gave me some
confidence and I was able to get some looks and actually finish.  
  
Q. Did you see the first game at all, Oklahoma State, any opinions on them
in the impending Big Ten, Big12 matchup?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, we saw a little bit of the end of the first half, three
minute, and Oklahoma State is a very good team, they are solid, every position
will be a tough match up for us.  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yeah, we saw what they had to offer and everything and they are
a good team and we just want to, we are not satisfied with today. We want to
keep moving forward and obviously get as far as we can.  
  
Q. How nice is it to see Coach get win 300?  
COURTNEY MOSES: It's awesome. She's had one great coaching career at Purdue
and that's going to continue on this year, and to get 300 and be a part of
that is special.  
WHITNEY BAYS: Knowing Coach, there's many more to come. She's a great coach
and she prepares us for everything. We are going to go over Oklahoma and
really prepare for them and she covers all the bases.  
  
Q. How big of an emphasis was it to get the ball inside, not only to Whitney
but just feeling like you had a pretty big advantage there on offense?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yeah, we knew Akron's players‑‑ our post players have been good
and we could go high, low, so that was the emphasis the last two weeks was
working on the high‑low game and getting inside.  
  
Q. Dee Dee has been on this run of being able to take out one of the other
team's best player; where would you rank this one as far as the last month or
so, what she's been able to do?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I mean, Dee Dee is just enjoying the moment as a
senior. She's embracing everything. She doesn't want everything to be her last
game. She's just Dee Dee and she's just really doing great. She's knocking
people down and she did a fantastic job.  
Bridget came in and played some of the minutes to give her a rest and you
know, when they listen to the scouting report, we really work on a lot of
tendencies, a lot of coaches don't do that, they just say this is a good
player. But we really work on their individual tendencies and Dee Dee has been
like this since she was a freshman. So she's a tough one to replace just
because of that mind‑set, so she's one in a million.  
  
Q. How were you able to slow them down, and in particular, Hanna, one of
their leading scorers, probably shot one of the worst she's ever shot before,
how were you able to contain her?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, we knew their best game is transition offense, so we did a
lot of transition defense all week. We knew we needed to crash the boards. We
sent four to the boards to put pressure on them that way, and then on a made
basket we tried to jam them; meaning that we tried to find somebody three and
slow her down a little bit so we could have time for our players to get back,
and then, you know, Luburgh is a fantastic player. Die de's length at 6‑1, her
athleticism and then we had other post players if Dee Dee got caught and they
were switching out and then bridge it is 6‑3\. So she was taking the same
shots she normally would have but I don't think in their league they have 6‑1
and 6‑3 and I think that was the difference.  
  
Q. Just the combination of defense and rebounding in this game, just really
was the answer; doing anything they wanted to do pretty much offensively?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, that was a big key for us. I just felt we always give our
kids a challenge. They are the ninth‑best scoring team in the country and we
wanted to keep them under 60 and we did that today.  
You know, so when we set out goals, that's the big thing, and when they know
someone can score like they can and run up‑and‑down, they all can shoot the
ball well and do some great things, we just have to make sure we keep doing
what we're doing.  
Defense, our players know defense is where you get it done and on the board.  
  
Q. I know you'll start preparing right away for your next game, but will you
spend my time celebrating your career milestone?  
COACH VERSYP: I won't, because it's not about me. You know, our fans, some of
our family and our groups getting together, but it's for the NCAA. It's not
about the wins. Again, it's just about all the coaches and all the players
that have been a part, I guess, of the program all through the years and I'm
just very fortunate that I've had some great ones for us to continue to
achieve milestones.  
  
Q. You probably knew you had an advantage with Whitney, after she got off to
a slow start, did you have to tell her to keep going at it or did she just
pick it up eventually and start hitting some?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, she‑‑ I just knew she would be fine. You know, when she
had the three offensive boards to pad her stats, to finally make the basket, I
think I was on the sideline jumping up with her every time, but you know,
she's just a workhorse.  
She'll figure it out. She's one of the craftiest offensive players that we
have and that I've ever coached and then we get to have her for another year.
But she's fun. She's just fun to watch. She has to work it out. Players have
to work it out.  
  
Q. What was your view of Courtney's block and her celebration?  
COACH VERSYP: I was right there. I was right in front of her. I saw these big
eyes and this little body coming up. You know, when you have someone like that
that can have a block from the weak side, it's pretty exciting.  
  
Q. How important was the big start to shake off any of the rust or nerves?  
COACH VERSYP: It was huge. For us to get off to a 16‑2 start, that was big.
You know, that's what we have to do, and that's what we talked about and the
kids have been hungry and they are tired of practice and they wanted to go get
somebody else. It's just really trying to set that tone early.  
And I thought our fan base was incredible. It sounded a lot more than what the
attendance says. It was amazing, and that's what we have to continue to
hopefully forge forward on Monday.  
  
Q. Oklahoma State, what do you know about them?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, there's a lot of similarity. They have got a great
shooter on the outside that's got great size. They have got a good low‑post
player, like Camile for us, they have a great point guard and scorer in
Martin. They have all the pieces to the puzzle so we have to play a game like
we did today. We have got to have a lot of bodies in there. I thought today we
wore people down because we rotated a lot of players. You know, but it will be
a fun matchup. If you have a four and five match up in Big12, Big Ten, it's
just a different style, so you know, obviously we'll embrace it.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
COACH VERSYP: Just very excited for the NCAA Tournament. It's been a while
since we've played, and to be one of the Top‑64 teams is obviously‑‑ we feel
honored and we worked exceptionally hard to get where we are and we are just
excited to get back out on the court and do something tomorrow.  
  
Q. From the Iowa game and the turnover problems, I guess when you look back
at that, what was the root of the problems and how do you go about fixing
those?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Iowa's two weeks ago, so we are putting that behind. But the
big thing in that game was communication, and it was a little thing. So taking
care of communication in defense will help settle us down on offense.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I agree wholeheartedly with Courtney. Communication is going
to be a big key for us. It's not necessarily why we turned the ball over but
it's a huge key as to why we turned the ball over. I feel like these last
weeks of practice we really worked on that and we got it together.  
  
Q. From what you've scouted of Akron, what do they do so well offensively
that you guys are going to have to try to slow down a little bit?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: They run really well in transition. From the games that we
watched, that's really all that they did. They run plays but mainly transition
and transition our defense is going to be key tomorrow. We are just going to
have to communicate and get to it.  
  
Q. You guys have done a good job all season long, and really over your
career, of slowing down individual players. How difficult is that with them
because they have two players who are pretty good scorers. Do you try and take
one away or look at both? What kind of problems do they present?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just like just going out there and just locking down and
playing defense. Not necessarily want to take one away; if we take both away
that would be awesome and if we do just take one away that would be awesome,
too. But I do feel like if we can go down with the attitude of lock down
defense, I know that we can take everybody away, and I know that's what we're
going to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. The defensive mind ‑set that you guys had probably the last month or so,
how important is it to get back to that as you start this tournament?   
COURTNEY MOSS: Coach always says that defense wins championships, wins games,
and offense sells tickets. So it's all about defense and we have really
focused on that the last two weeks that we've had off here and really the
whole entire season. That's what Coach has preached to us our four years here.
It's her philosophy that it all starts with defense?  
  
Q. Most of your players, teammates, have NCAA experience but a few don't. Do
you have to give any advice to some of the new comers to what this is like?  
COURTNEY MOSS: We just have to lead by example, just bringing energy and I
think sometimes when you don't know what to expect, it's better than knowing
what to expect. So just let them figure it out and lead by example.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just feel like leading by example and also just telling
them to go out there and play hard and I know they will. They are girls who
came in and will do anything for their upperclassmen, so I have no‑‑ I feel
like, yes, it's going to be probably a little scary for them but at the same
time, I know if they just go out and play hard, they will be fine?  
  
Q. I know it's simple but just talk about the advantages of being at home
for this and how that is able to help you, especially now having a couple of
weeks of rest.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: It's always a nice advantage to be able to play at home and
have your fans here cheering for you. I love it. I feel like the girls love
it, and I think the Purdue who‑‑ the administration who paid for us to host
the tournament here; but I'm really excited about it. I know it's a huge
advantage for us and I'm just ready to get out there and play.  
COURTNEY MOSS: It's awesome be to at home again on our senior day. We knew
that it wasn't our last time playing, so that's always nice when you're
seniors. Just thankful to the administration for letting us be able to get
this opportunity and we hope to see lots of fans out tomorrow.  
  
Q. This whole field that's here can really get up ‑and‑down the court and
score pretty well. Is there anything specific that you felt like you were
doing in the six‑game winning streak that was missing in the Iowa game?  
COACH VERSYP: Communication. I feel like in Iowa, I feel like it was dead
silent out there for us. Of course, you had the fans out there, but on the
court we were dead silent. I feel like communication is huge for us and the
six games we did win, we were out there talking and we were out there moving.
I felt like the Iowa game, it's kind of like we were shellshocked, but at the
same time we just weren't communicating.  
  
Q. Curious if in the time that you've been here, if you've seen Coach Versyp
change as a coach and if so, how?  
COURTNEY MOSS: Through the four years we've been through a lot together with
Coach. We went through a lot of adversity together. I would say just the
biggest change I've seen is just having fun. She told us earlier in the season
it's been a fun year to coach.  
It's kind of teaching us life lessons. It's something she's done her whole
entire coaching career but when you go through adversity, it makes you even
teach those lessons more and enjoy each day.  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I just feel like through the four years and all the
adversity we've been through, she's become more of a mother to us. Granted we
are here for four years and freshman year, she's always going to be your
mother away from home but with everything we have been through the past couple
months, the past couple years, she's really become a mother to us and helped
us and willed us to gut seasons in. Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. For both of the players, just the last game against Iowa, it's been a
while, how excited are you to finally stop answering all these questions and
just get out and play?  
DEE DEE WILLIAMS: I was just telling coach on the way down here I'm just ready
to get out here and play. Practice is always good, but to play is a whole
different story; and then to have‑‑ be at home and have the fan base behind
you is just going to be awesome tomorrow. I'm just ready to get out there and
play.  
COURTNEY MOSS: I think as a whole entire unit, as a family we are ready to get
back and play. The coaches are ready to stop watching so much film and the
players are ready to stop practicing and actually put our game plan into
action tomorrow so everybody is just really excited.  
  
Q. Was it as simple as communication in the Iowa game that got you away from
what you had done so well during those last six games defensively?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, Iowa is a good basketball team. They won six in a row. And
we did communicate. There was nothing‑‑ there was no unity out there at all.
You could sense it; you could feel it. But we've just got to get back to
Purdue basketball and can't win them all.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you played this year that you can compare Luburgh
and Tecca?  
COACH VERSYP: I think the guard, Rachel Banham; inside post player, Jordan
Hooper. You know, so I mean, we've had to face and try to take and limit two
to three players in the Big Ten every single game. In the Big Ten, there's
always two or three players that you've got to do that to.  
So you know, I compare them to an Iowa, Nebraska type of feel, and if you want
to compare the kids heights‑‑ she rebounds a lot better than Rachel. Rachel
Banham is one of the best players in the country just flat‑out. Just some of
her tendencies skill‑set wise, but we have to keep both of them off the
boards.  
  
Q. Did communication problems lead to the turnovers in the last game?  
COACH VERSYP: No.  
  
Q. Was that just poor decisions ‑‑  
COACH VERSYP: Just not‑‑ over. Over. Nothing else to talk about. That's two
weeks ago.  
  
Q. What does 300 wins mean to you?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't keep track of stats. Everybody tells me things. I'm
like, oh, that's nice.  
It's all the players; it's all the coaches that have coached with me, and
everybody in the process. I'm only as good as the people that surround me and
if we can get another win, that's fantastic and then hopefully it will be
another milestone. If I can stay in coaching a long time‑‑ I won't be here to
get 900 wins, that's a long time.  
But again, it's about everybody else. It's just a number but again I
appreciate all those that have allowed the success that has occurred here.  
  
Q. You have slowed down individual players this season, and over the years,
Banham this year and Hooper, and Lucas the first game; what do you attribute
that to, just following and executing scouting reports, good defense of
players? What sort of goes into that?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's a combination. Players have to perform. We put in a
game plan and if they are stepping up and performing‑‑ if one individual has
an assignment, that means everybody else has to be just add attuned because
it's a team defense. And it's that belief that defense wins.  
I mean, everybody in the country, it's all about offense; that's all that was
poured into these kids heads for nine straight months. But I think when‑‑ but
the officiating has changed so we have been able to play some more defense.
It's a combination but it's been a struggle this year at the defensive end.
I'm just pleased where we are at right now.  
  
Q. How appreciative are you of the administration to bring an NCAA
Tournament first and second round back here, and is that an advantage going
into the tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's big. I compliment this administration every single
second. You don't have student athletes usually verbally say that from a
camera, it's usually coming from a coach, so you know I instill that in our
student athletes.  
That's one of the big reasons why Purdue women's basketball has been one of
the top programs in the country because they started way before I got here.
They were hosting way before and that's when they were able to hopefully get
to the Sweet16 and March on from there.  
So it has not been around just since I've been here. It's been over the last
20 years, and that's huge. It's a big advantage with women's basketball.  
  
Q. I would guess you've looked at a lot of film from Akron throughout the
season. Could you tell the difference, they started 7 ‑8, finished 16‑1, where
did that finish?   
COACH VERSYP: For them their offense is what gets them going. Just really
pushing the ball and making misses and they are just really playing great
basketball together. When a couple kids knock down shots, things just continue
to get better as it goes. If you miss free throws, it kind of goes the other
way.  
But they are just really gelling, and when you win a couple games and you keep
going‑‑ and she rotates a lot of people, and they do their job, and they share
the ball. There's two key players that score a lot of points but they are very
good at sharing the basketball and not taking bad shots.  
  
Q. Other than the two Iowa games last month ‑‑ you've been moving the ball
really well, why do you think that's been the case?  
COACH VERSYP: We are not forcing the ball, we are just moving. We are sharing
the ball, and we are just going to let them play. I think when you have a stat
that's negativeyou try to not talk about it and it becomes a positive and
that's kind of what we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their point guard, Cassell? Her assist ‑to‑turnover
ratio is outstanding. What does she do well?  
COACH VERSYP: She doesn't force anything and she has four kids scoring 22
points a game almost, so going to give them the ball. I think she has two
players that can flat‑out score for her and she's setting those players up.  
She's fun to watch, there is no question, and she leads that team. We have to
frustrate her a little bit if we can, but she's just real solid and that's the
key. She doesn't care if she scores. She needs to score. She's just setting up
for that three‑point shot in transition but she's that point guard that gets
everybody involved and everything goes from her.  
  
Q. I asked you about Akron's turning point. You finished the season well.
Was there a game or a time that got you playing good basketball?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, we had moments. When we won at Penn State; that was a
moment. When we won at Nebraska, that was a moment; those were two, early.
After AK went down, every game was a moment. Everybody in the country didn't
think we would do anything. It's stated all over the national news, they
didn't expect anything from us after that happened.  
So each game has been very important for us, so it's not one game in
particular. I think it's the moments and advertises that has allowed us to
rise to the occasion.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
KARL SMESKO: We're really excited to be here. Our goal all season long was to
make it to the NCAA Tournament, and we had to win a couple last‑second games
or overtime games to put us in this position. But we're excited about the
opportunity and we're trying to be as prepared as we can to be competitive and
give our best opportunity to win.  
  
Q. Who gets the challenge of guarding Tiffany Bias tomorrow?  
SARAH HANSEN: Probably one of our guards. I mean, we have a guard rotation
where when somebody gets tired they can sub out and put somebody else on her.
It's mainly just going to be whichever guard happens to be the one that picks
her up in conversion, I guess.  
  
Q. She never comes off the floor. Is that kind of how you have to approach
it, that we're going to have to go with multiple players and hope that we can
kind of wear her down a little bit as the game goes on?  
JENNA COBB: Yeah, definitely. It's just going to be a group effort all around
tomorrow, but definitely with our group rotation, obviously she's an amazing
player, so we're all just going to have to work together to stop her, or do
what we can.  
  
Q. Coach, Oklahoma State talked about your unique offense as everybody does
and shooting the threes, five girls that can hit threes, but does that put a
lot of pressure on your shooting? What happens if you guys aren't hitting
those threes? Does that put pressure on you to make those?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I don't think there's any pressure. We're just trying to make
sure we do what we're supposed to do, what we've been doing all year, working
on what we're supposed to do in our offense, screening and cutting and those
type of things. I don't think there's any pressure on making shots. We know we
can knock down shots when we need to.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about rebounding? Oklahoma State has come out
of the Big 12, which is kind of a meat grinder, with a plus average against
their opponents in rebounding. How important do you think that will be to kind
of negate that?  
SARAH HANSEN: We know that second shots are a big deal. Whoever has the most
opportunities to score is obviously going to have the greatest opportunity of
scoring the most points. We just know we have to be able to keep them off the
boards. We want to try to take them out of what they are going to do. And if
they happen to miss a shot, we have to be able to take it from them. We have
to be able to get their rebounds so they can't get second shots. Put‑backs are
about the easiest shot to make. You're right at the basket, there's not very
many people in front of you. We just know we need to try and eliminate that.
And then offensively obviously we want to be able to try to get as many second
shots as possible.  
  
Q. Jenna, you played here in Indiana. Are you and the two Indiana natives on
your roster sort of serving as tour guides here for the weekend?  
JENNA COBB: Well, one of the weird things, I've actually never been to West
Lafayette or Purdue. I've been to IU, Butler, obviously, and a few other
Indiana schools, so this is kind of a new Indiana experience for me. But we
were all pretty excited coming back here to Indiana since we have so many
Midwest girls, and three of us have been pretty familiar with the Indiana
area.  
  
Q. Sarah, I was wondering if you could tell me about your five ‑year career
here at FGCU. I'm not sure you knew about the school originally, and now
you're in the Hall of Fame. Can you just kind of take us through what the last
five years has been like?   
SARAH HANSEN: It's definitely been something special. When Coach called me up
and he brought me down here, I couldn't have asked for a better experience on
that trip and I knew it was where I wanted to be. My first year was a little
bit rough, but then it got better and obviously I couldn't be more happy with
the decision I made. FGCU has been so good to me, the people, from the
students to the community to everybody involved with the administration. It's
just been an amazing experience, so I couldn't be more happy with the decision
I made.  
  
Q. Sarah, can you talk about the second time around being in the NCAA
Tournament and how does this feel the same and how is it different?  
SARAH HANSEN: I mean, it's the same because it's where we wanted to be and we
know it's where we wanted to be and we know that we belong here. We're excited
to be here and excited to make some noise and play to the best of our
abilities, get our team out. But it's a little bit different because we have
such a different group of girls. Before we were playing with a group who knew
each other so well and played together for so many years, and now it's more of
we have played together and we've built that team chemistry that we've been
working on all season, but it's a little bit‑‑ we have a little bit more
athleticism than we did, whereas in the past we were athletic but we were
smaller, we weren't as quick, and we had to rely a lot on intelligence, and
now we're still trying to play a smart game of basketball, but we have a
little more athleticism and a little more quickness.  
  
Q. Whitney, first of all, you sent out a couple of Tweets a couple of days
ago in regards to your health. How are you feeling?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I feel fine. I'm great.  
  
Q. Did that come from Coach?  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: No. No.  
  
Q. Sarah and Whitney, after watching the men do what they did last year, how
much when that was going on did that motivate you for this season, and now
that you're in the tournament do you look to them for inspiration?  
SARAH HANSEN: We just knew that we wanted to get back, and seeing them be able
to make the runs they made and upset teams that they upset just showed us that
you can do it. I mean, it's absolutely possible. You've seen it with the games
already in the men's tournament yesterday and everything. There's been upsets
and everything. So that just goes to show you that just because we have a
lower seed or we're not the highest seed where we're at, we're in a good
situation and we're in a position where we can if we play to the best of our
abilities make some noise.  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: Yeah, I mean, I agree with Sarah. Anything can happen. We're
coming in prepared. We're focused and we're ready to play our game. We think
if we play together as a team and have fun out there then we can compete with
any other teams‑‑ well, Oklahoma State.  
  
Q. Jen and Whitney, one of coach's concerns has been about their speed and
just the level of that play. Is there anything you've tried to do to
approximate that speed in practice?  
JENNA COBB: I mean, not really because you can't really make anybody, like, as
fast as them, if we don't have somebody who's as fast as them in practice. I
think the biggest thing is just helping each other out with that speed, going
one‑on‑one is kind of difficult at times, so just making sure our defense
we're playing together and helping out and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Sarah and Whitney, the best part of playing in this offense is what?  
SARAH HANSEN: Probably that we can score in so many different ways that it's
not just‑‑ we rely on one person for isolations or we rely on somebody getting
the ball and blocking and posting out big. Everybody can contribute and
everybody can contribute in so many different ways.  
WHITNEY KNIGHT: There's a lot of different opportunities for different things,
like we can screen, we can cut, we can drive, we can shoot the three. There's
a lot of different things we can do. We're not just sticking to one particular
thing all the time.  
  
Q. You guys have had two common opponents, particularly TCU. Have you been
able to glean anything off of that that may help you tomorrow?  
JENNA COBB: I mean, that was pretty early in the year, and I would say the
biggest thing we ran against with TCU was boxing out. I mean, we struggled
with their height a little bit. They played a pretty good zone and everything.
I don't know if that would be the same as Oklahoma State so much. But I think
we can learn from that. They have quick guards, they have a quick point guard
who could shoot the ball, who could drive, and that's pretty much the same
situation with Oklahoma State.  
I think the biggest thing is that we can take from that is just rebounding,
getting on the boards, everybody in there, five people working together.  
  
Q. Whitney, do you like being known as a three ‑point shooting team, or as
you mentioned, do you have different areas that you can attack teams with
besides the three‑point?   
WHITNEY KNIGHT: I wouldn't say necessarily we like being known, but it's
definitely good that we are able to shoot the three because it makes the
defense stretch out, which allows us to do other things in our offense like
attack or create space for other people to drive and things like that. I think
it's definitely a great asset to our team.  
  
Q. Coach, about Tiffany, their point guard, she seems to be kind of a
special player. When you watch her on film, what's priority No.1 as far as
trying to slow her down? I don't know that you necessarily, completely shut
her down, but how do you slow her down a little bit?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, that is priority No.1 is you have to get back and you have
to get the ball under control. She gets it out, and she's about as fast as
anybody we've seen in the open floor. You have to give yourself a pretty good
head start and get yourself organized defensively, and you can't rely on one
person to stop the ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it's like for you to come back to Indiana? Did
you ever try and get Purdue on the schedule when you were at IPFW?  
KARL SMESKO: When I was at IPFW we were just moving to Division I. I scheduled
the first year of Division I and to be honest I don't remember if Purdue was
on the schedule or if we contacted them to schedule or not. But when we've
been at Florida Gulf Coast we've been close to playing Purdue a couple times.
We were supposed to play them one trip in Cancún and they had an unfortunate
incident with one of their players and they couldn't make it, and then we were
in the same tournament with them this year in México, and we didn't match up
with one another. It was set up so we didn't play each other. We're familiar
with Purdue and how good they are and how good they've been.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on your team's health, particularly with
Bethany and Anthi?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, Bethany and Anthi aren't playing. They won't be dressing.
They're still out with their injuries. Everybody else is healthy and ready to
go.  
  
Q. Why shoot all these three ‑pointers, not just this year but throughout
your career?   
KARL SMESKO: Well, we want to be efficient offensively, so we try to take the
most‑efficient shot we can get. We try to stretch people out with shooters,
have a lot of movement. We think it opens things up for cuts to the basket and
drives to the basket.  
When we take a shot, we're trying to get the highest return for that shot that
we can possibly get, and a lot of times through a possession that's shooting a
three‑point shot.  
  
Q. You mentioned priorities. Could a second or third priority be boxing out,
because I read somewhere that one of your big concerns was them being able to
chase down misses.  
KARL SMESKO: Well, yeah, they're a big team. They're an athletic team. They're
a very physical team. That's one of the reasons why they are so good. We have
to have our players‑‑ I mean, we don't match up in terms of size or
athleticism. We have to be willing to be physical, and we've basically got to
scrap out some rebounds. I'm not saying we need to win rebounds because that
would be a lofty expectation, but we have to be competitive on the boards so
we're not giving up a lot of put‑backs that are just two feet from the basket,
make them have to at least get long rebounds and work to get another shot
rather than just get a miss and put it right back in.  
  
Q. I was wondering if ‑‑ I understand that one of your recruits, Taylor
Goodall just was named all‑state Indiana. If you could just talk a little bit
about her and if this is going to be an area that you'll continue to recruit
in?  
KARL SMESKO: We've recruited the Midwest pretty heavily since I've been at
Florida Gulf Coast. There's a lot of Midwest kids that enjoy coming to
Florida, so you have to find out early whether there's somebody who's willing
to go away from home or if there's somebody that if they tell you they're
wanting to stay close to home, you've got to move on and go with the people
that the idea of Florida sounds good to them.  
We're proud of what Taylor was able to accomplish this year. We're excited
about having her next year. She's a point guard that can shoot, but she's a
very smart player, and then she's a very physically tough player. I mean,
she's going to add to the toughness of our team. She doesn't mind throwing her
body around.  
  
Q. Does that give you any advantage, so many Midwest girls, probably
bringing a little bit of fan support? Do you feel that's any advantage?  
KARL SMESKO: Well, I think the fact that they are excited about‑‑ one, it's
hard to be more excited than being in an NCAA Tournament, but if there is a
way to be more excited, it was to come back to the Midwest where their family
is going to see them, and not just their family, their families probably would
have traveled anywhere, but their friends and coaches, and there's going to be
a lot of people that normally don't get to see them play in a college game. It
does add a little bit of extra excitement to our players, if that's really
even possible.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
COACH KEST: We worked hard the last two years, and to win that MAC
Championship, especially what we went through last year, losing to Central
Michigan in the finals and seeing all the chairs that they had in the locker
room. And after that loss, they really got committed to putting in more work
and wanted to get back and feel the joy of winning that championship game, so
I'm really happy about being here.  
  
Q. Casey, Hanna, Rachel, after winning the MAC Tournament for the first time
in program history, how were you able to regain that focus to get back to
basketball and get back and get ready for this game?  
KACIE CASSELL: You know, we just came to practice ready to go. You know, we
won the MAC Championship and we were really excited about that and we came
back to practice on Tuesday and ready to get focused about that. We weren't
thinking about that. We were just looking forward to the next game we played.  
HANNA LUBURGH: We had a couple days off, so we just enjoyed the win for a few
days and then when we got back in the gym on Tuesday, we were just focused and
just ready to listen to what we were going to do against Purdue.  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, also, we're playing great as a team right now, and I think
we're having a lot of fun as a group, so we're just excited to be here and
play tomorrow versus Purdue.  
  
Q. Rachel, why is your team so good offensively?  
RACHEL TECCA: Well, thanks to Coach Kest, she put in a fast break offense a
few seasons ago, and we've had a lot of practice at it. We have the personnel
for it, too, as well. We are finesse players. We get out and run and Casey
pushes the ball up the court and looks to get us all the ball. So I think it
just works out great for our personnel.  
  
Q. What's the difference between your team before January 15 when you were 7
‑8 and after when you went 16‑1?   
RACHEL TECCA: I think the biggest difference is that we are playing together
as a team. Everybody knows their role now. I think at the beginning of the
season, we were playing more like individuals. Now I just think we are
clicking as a team and we have a lot of team chemistry out there.  
HANNA LUBURGH: One of the big things is our bench play has improved
tremendously. We have a lot of contributions from everywhere now. Before it
was just a couple of people. So now we have, you know, really, just a lot of
contributions. So it's really helping us, and the confident level of our bench
is really high right now, as well.  
KACIE CASSELL: I would agree. Our bench has stepped up tremendously. I
couldn't be more proud of those girls. And I think we really looked in the
mirror; January 15, we looked in the mirror, what had we been doing wrong, and
we made improvements in practice and so we stepped it up.  
  
Q. At the MAC Tournament, some of you state that had Coach Kest gave you a
chance. Bigger schools looked over you, possibly for being too small, not
strong enough. Does that motivate you going up against a Big Ten school like
Purdue?  
HANNA LUBURGH: I mean, I think we all want to prove ourselves. So I think that
we are just going to go out there and play our game. I'm not really focused on
whether they recruited me or not because I'm happy with where I'm at with
Akron. So we just want to go out and represent the university the best way we
can.  
KACIE CASSELL: I agree with Hanna 100 percent on that one.  
RACHEL TECCA: Yeah, same. I think all three of us are just happy to represent
the university for the first time in the NCAA Tournament and we're just happy
to be here.  
  
Q. You guys are playing pretty good right now and the fact that your
championship game was on Saturday and there's a quick turnaround, no long
layoff, do you feel like that will help you keep your momentum?  
HANNA LUBURGH: Absolutely. We like to play. We like to play basketball games,
as everybody else does. So I think that being able to play right now, in a
week, we're ready. We're in rhythm. We feel good about ourselves. So, yeah, we
are excited to play already on Saturday.  
  
Q. The President of the United States picked you guys to win. What is your
reaction to that?  
KACIE CASSELL: I love it. Thanks, Obama. That's awesome.  
  
Q. First time coaching, getting this team to the NCAA Tournament, is there
any change in your preparation from the MAC Tournament to the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH KEST: No. We keep things very simple. You know, like they said, it's all
about us. Our preparation is going to be the exact same. It's never been a
concern for us who the opponent is. We've just got to take care of us.  
  
Q. Was there a particular game or moment that you thought was a turning
point in the middle of the season?  
COACH KEST: They talked about it a little bit. After we lost to Miami, we were
1‑3 in the conference and that hurt us, because we lost to Central, wasn't a
big deal. We didn't play well, we lost to BG, but losing to Miami at Miami
really hurt.  
The coaching staff, we came back, and we self‑evaluated on what could we do
differently. Sometimes you always want to point the fingers at your players
and blame them, and we needed to look at ourselves and what we can do to get
better, and then, as well, look at the players and what they can do to get
getter.  
So we made a change in the starting lineup and we sat them down and said: We
are good enough to win the rest of the games, 14 in a row, or we are bad
enough that we can lose 14.  
The change really helped in the starting lineup, Carly came off the bench and
did a fantastic job, especially a senior, that's a tough role; you've been
starting for the last year and now all of a sudden you're coming off the
bench.  
Like the players said, I think our bench has played unbelievable over the last
month: Anita Brown, Katie Nunan, Carly off the bench, Megan Barilla; and even
though Rachel and Hanna both scored 22 points, those other kids knew that they
had capabilities of scoring but were not looking for that early on, and they
were open.  
I think Casey offensively has gotten so much better. Early on they were not
guarding her at all. They were double‑teaming Rachel or Hanna; and I think the
last month, she had a lot of confidence right now in her offensive ability and
that's helped out. We have five players on the floor right now that can score
at any time and that makes it very difficult at times to stop us.  
  
Q. Courtney Moses, their leading scorer, what does she do so well and
defensively how are you going to be able to stop her?  
COACH KEST: I don't really know if anybody can stop her. I think we want to
try to contain her. She's phenomenal. I see her playing the WNBA next year.
She can score so many different ways. She can score in transition. She scores
with all the different sets that they have. She scores in the two‑man game
that they have.  
She's just phenomenal. And to be honest, and I've seen Purdue play on the Big
Ten network as a fan, just watching basketball, but not really evaluating it,
and what I've watched the last six, seven games and watched their team play
how impressed I am with their team and their coaching staff. They do so many
good things. We are going to have to play a great basketball game in order to
beat them.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you've played this year that has a similar style to
Purdue or that remind you of Purdue?  
COACH KEST: A little bit size‑wise, maybe Dayton. Dayton was a very big team
and they like to score in transition. And you look at Purdue, they score so
many different ways n transition and halfcourt set. They don't set as many
ball screens as Dayton does but size‑wise I would rank them as close.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
JIM LITTELL: We're very excited to be here for the NCAA Tournament. We know
that we play a quality team in Florida Gulf Coast that is very well coached.
They play a very unique style of play. 972 of their 19‑hundred shot attempts
have been three‑pointers, so it's going to be a little different guard than
we've had in the Big 12, but we're excited to be here. We've had a tremendous
year, placing third in the Big 12, and very proud of what our team
accomplished, and we're excited to play.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of talk about the NCAA Tournament experience last year
and how much better that prepares you going into this year's tournament?  
TIFFANY BIAS: No, we're excited to be here. Last year we made a good run. We
had that second game at Duke, and we were up, and I think we learned from that
just knowing to keep our lead and keep our composure and keep the momentum on
our side and slow things down and execute our sets.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I feel the same. I think that we learned a lot from the Duke
game. We just had to‑‑ we learned to be patient, and I guess work together
when we get in situations like that.  
  
Q. How much does that play a factor in the NCAA Tournament, this experience,
because there's very few girls on Florida Gulf Coast that have that
experience. Does that give you guys an edge come tomorrow?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think a little bit. I mean, I can't say we're familiar with
it because it's something different every year, we play someone different
every year, but I think it does because we know how it feels to be here.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I agree. I think we have a lot of experience on our team. A lot
of the girls know in tough situations what to do and who to count on, and we
all count on each other, so I think we'll be ready just for any tough
atmosphere.  
  
Q. Because they shoot so many threes, can you talk about the difficulty and
just kind of preparing for that?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, we have great rebounders on our team, so I don't think
that I'm worried about us that much. I think that if we just do our job and
box out our players, I think that we'll be able to get the rebounds.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: And I think blocking out is a different situation when
shooting three‑pointers because rebounds go behind you. We emphasize so much
blocking out and getting close rebounds, and I think it's a lot harder to get
the rebounds that go out to the three‑point line, so we have to kind of adjust
our block‑out situations and things like that.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when I look at the stats, I think the one that sticks out the
most is how many minutes you play. How do you kind of condition yourself
outside of basketball to embrace playing basically 40 minutes every single
game?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, a lot of conditioning. I think in the off season we
condition a lot, and I just kind of always had that motor growing up. It's
just something I do. I've always just run, run, run. I think whatever I can do
for my team, if I can stay out there 40 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever I can do
for the team.  
  
Q. Brittney, why are you such a good rebounder and how much pride do you
take in that?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I take a lot of pride in it. I think that I could get better
at it because I don't know how to block out, but I think that a lot of
rebounds just kind of‑‑ I don't know, I think just hustle really gets you far
in this league and in the game, so I think just running for them and I guess
trying to push people out of the way.  
  
Q. As a guard?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Yeah, I'm a pretty big guard, so I'm pretty lucky on that.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Sarah Hansen? She's a two ‑time league
player of the year. How conscious do you feel you have to be of her and where
she is at all times?   
TIFFANY BIAS: I mean, she's a great player, so I think that's one of the keys
of the game is to kind of show down and keep her contained and make sure we
don't let her go off. I think we have a good scout on her, and I think that
we'll be ready.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: We just have to know where she's at in all possessions of the
game really is what it is.  
  
Q. Had you heard of Florida Gulf Coast before Monday? They're kind of an
obscure team. I know a lot of people heard of their men's team after last
year, but what did you know about them before they announced the pairings?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Sadly I have not heard of it. I don't want to be rude, but
I've never heard of that school. I mean, it's cool, though. It's good that
we're playing something new and seeing new people.  
TIFFANY BIAS: Yeah, I agree. I think that they're a very athletic team, and
it's always great playing someone else besides the league and seeing how other
conferences play, so it'll be interesting and fun.  
  
Q. Is that good or bad, playing a team you've never heard of?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think it's good. I think that they haven't seen us play
really, so I think it's a surprise on both ends. So I think that our staff
prepares us well for every game, and the scout is always good, so I think
we'll be well‑prepared and we'll be ready for whatever they have.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think it could go both ways. They don't know us, we don't
know them, so we have to stick to fundamentals and things like that during the
game. So I think it's going to be‑‑ I think it's a lot of fun playing people
we don't know.  
  
Q. Kind of piggybacking on that, you guys have been through the Big 12,
which is one of the big meat grinders in women's college basketball, and to
play someone like Florida Gulf Coast you may not know as well, how do you find
the tendency of having a letdown?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think just play our game. I don't think you can really worry
about letdowns. I think if we come out like how we know we can play, we'll be
just fine.  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think that we just have to play. We just have to play hard
and I guess want it more than the other team. Really anybody can beat anybody
if they want it more and if they try harder and work for it, I guess.  
  
Q. Tiffany, the last month ‑and‑a‑half you guys have been on the win one,
lose one type of thing. How do you explain, I guess, the inconsistencies there
or maybe it is consistency where you haven't been able to get on a winning
streak but also avoid a losing streak?   
TIFFANY BIAS: Well, like our coaches tell us, it's one or done, you've got to
give it all you've got and leave it all out on the floor. It's been a little
bit of a roller coaster for us, but we fought through it as a team. That's how
we get through everything. As long as we stick together as a team, we'll be
okay.  
  
Q. Brittney, Tiffany was talking about her motor that never goes off. When
you're looking up to a senior leader, how much does that kind of inspire the
rest of the players on the team to see probably the best player on the team is
the one out there doing that and playing 40 minutes every single night and
making sure this team is doing everything it can to get victories?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I mean, everybody wishes they had a motor like Tiffany. I
think everybody in the world wishes that. I think she grew up like that, and
of course we all want it and we can't all get it. I'm happy that I have
somebody to look up to that goes hard in practice every day, that goes hard in
the games. She never stops, but I think she really helps our team a lot with
even just that, even if she didn't score points. She just tries really hard,
and I think that really picks us up and helps us out a lot.  
  
Q. We talked about the last month, I think 6 ‑7\. Is momentum a big factor
when it comes to the NCAA Tournament, and how do you overcome that because
maybe you don't have as much momentum?   
JIM LITTELL: It's called the Big 12 is the answer to that. You know, you could
look at it in another fashion; we won one, we lost one. We were one of three
teams in the Big 12 that didn't have back‑to‑back losses, so that gives you an
indication of how tough it is. Iowa State started conference play 3‑0, and
they dropped four in a row. Texas late in the year finished third, tied for
third with us, they lost three in a row. Baylor lost two in a row against
UConn and Kansas, but they didn't lose two in a row in the conference. West
Virginia didn't lose two in a row in the conference, and we didn't lose two in
a row in the conference.  
It depends what perspective you look at it. It just tells you the strength of
the Big 12 from top to bottom that we beat up on each other within that
conference. I think it's probably more crucial to look at the big picture,
that we finished third in the No.1 RPI conference in the country. Yes, we
would like to have avoided win one, lose one, but I think that's kind of the
nature of our league and where we're at as a basketball team.  
  
Q. Why haven't you dropped back ‑to‑back games? What about your team has
allowed you to bounce back?   
JIM LITTELL: I think our group has been pretty resilient. Some of those games
that we lost were very tight games we played well. We got blown out a couple
games. But five of our eight losses are to the conference champion. Five of
our eight losses came to Baylor and West Virginia. We led West Virginia at
home with two minutes to go. We missed a lay‑up at the buzzer to beat Baylor
in overtime. We lost to Baylor by four in the semifinals of the Big 12
Tournament. We've had a nice year, and it sometimes doesn't give that
perception when you win one and lose one, but when you look at the big picture
of things, our kids have been pretty resilient and bounced back to always play
the next game.  
We've approached it from the standpoint that it's 18 individual battles, and
you've got to turn the page and let the last one go and get on to the next
game. I think our team has done a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. One of the things I noticed when I was looking at your stats is you don't
have 20 ‑point‑per‑game scorer, but you've got like 14, 11, 11, 9, 7.
Obviously every coach would love to have that. How dangerous does that make
you when you have eight players deep that are capable of going out and being
scorers on any given night?   
JIM LITTELL: It's helped us from the standpoint that a few years ago we had a
young lady named Andrea Riley who was all‑time leading scorer in Big 12
history until Griner broke her record late last year. We were in a situation
if Andrea didn't get 35, we were probably going to get beat, and if she had a
bad night, we were probably going to get beat.  
What's been good about the balance that we have on this team is somebody can
have a bad night and you still have a chance to win the game. There's been a
lot of games that we've had four people in double figures, some games we've
had five in double figures. So I just think when you have balance, and the
opportunity for different people to score the basketball gives you a better
chance to win games.  
  
Q. Obviously Tiffany is a great player and looks like she can score. She can
set up her teammates and everything. How special of a player is she when you
put the total package together?  
JIM LITTELL: Well, she's been the face of our program for four years. She came
in and started from day one. Probably 80 percent of our games when the score
is tight and in conference games, she's playing 40 minutes a night. Leader,
best worker that we have on the team, tremendous heart. We've used the word
motor before. It's a young lady that in four years has never lost a sprint in
practice, never lost an agility drill, never lost any competitive thing during
offseason workouts. She's just a special young lady that respects the game and
approaches the game the right way every day.  
  
Q. You alluded to this before: Did you have to do anything special to
prepare for their three ‑point shooting, and is there an opponent that's
similar to them as far as the amount of three‑point shots they take?  
JIM LITTELL: Yeah, it's different for us. It's a different guard for us than
we've had a lot of times. You know what people don't realize is they not only
shoot the three extremely well as a team, but they put five people out there
that are capable of doing that. You get conscious of that, and you get up too
tight, you lose a stance, and they're beating you on a direct drive to the
basket. It isn't just one‑dimensional in the fact that they shoot all threes.
They're very good at direct drives to the basket and getting themselves to the
free‑throw line.  
The Knight, the young lady is a special talent, when you're 6'3" and shoot
that many threes and have the ability to put the ball on the floor and then
two‑time conference player of the year, they've got some really good players.
They have good balance, as well, and it presents a lot of challenges for our
team, as I'm sure it does teams within their conference and around the country
because they play such a unique style of play.  
  
Q. Sounds like you want Brittney to rebound a little bit better or at least
put a body on someone when she's going after it, but that aspect of her game
and having a guard of that size, being able to rebound that well, what has she
meant to the team?  
JIM LITTELL: She had 15 rebounds against Baylor, she had 11 in the semifinals
against Iowa State, and to finish your question on that, Iowa State is as
close to them in our league, as many threes as they shoot.  
I'm just old school; I like to have somebody block them out, and she has the
idea I can go get it better just flying around.  
I said, you know, Krzyzewski, Knight, John Wooden, they wanted you to block
out, but what the heck do those guys know. She hasn't convinced me, and I'm
not sure I've convinced her yet, either.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

## April 8, 2014

  

### [Michaela Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26562)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  79  
Notre Dame - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from head coach Muffet McGraw, then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's hard right now to remember what a great season this was.
But I think that's what we need to reflect back and think about, getting here.  
Tonight's game was incredibly disappointing for all of us, in particular the
seniors. I know how much they wanted it. And I wanted it for them.  
But Connecticut was‑‑ they just overpowered us. They killed us inside. Their
bigs were just too much for us.  
I thought Stewart was phenomenal. Dolson, 16 and 17 is pretty amazing. I
thought we were overmatched in the post. And I thought if they could‑‑ if we
could have made them go to their bench a little earlier in the second half, we
might have had a chance.  
I thought that's when we made a run in the first half, and unfortunately they
didn't have to go to their bench in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: We have Kayla McBride and Michaela Mabrey. Questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about the dominance that UConn had
inside? And would Natalie have made somewhat of a difference in that regard
tonight, do you think?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: You know, I think that we just came out undermatched. I don't
think anything could have changed to change that. They just came out and they
went directly in the post, and our help side wasn't there from the get‑go.
They got comfortable. They got into a rhythm, and it went downhill from there.  
  
Q. For either of you, how much is UConn affecting your shooting? You had
stretches where you couldn't get shots to fall. How much was it the ball just
not going in, or how much was UConn affecting that?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think a lot of it was ourselves. I think we were kind of
being ourselves, we weren't in the rhythm in the offense, we weren't making
the extra pass, we weren't playing the normal way we've been playing the past
37 games. I think that's what made it look so bad.  
  
Q. Again for Kayla. As the coach was talking about, is it difficult right
now to look back and think about how good a season it is when it ends in this
manner?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: No, I'm proud of these girls regardless. We've been through so
much this year, so much adversity. If you look at what our bench has done this
year, I couldn't have been more proud of them. I wouldn't want to be anywhere
else or playing with anyone else.  
  
Q. Michaela, you held your own with them on the boards for a half, I believe
it was 20 ‑18 at halftime, and they came out and just completely overpowered
you in the first five minutes of the second half. What happened that allowed
them to just completely do that?  
MICHAELA MABREY: You know, we really weren't boxing out at all. We weren't
getting a body on them. To begin with, they're bigger than us, and I think we
tried to make that a point at halftime to box it out and get a body on it.  
We came out. We really didn't do that. So I think they got mostly their
offensive rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further for the student‑athletes? Okay. Thank you,
ladies.  
Questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. When you shook hands there with Geno after the game, what did you all say
to each other?  
COACH MCGRAW: I said something like I thought we were playing the Miami Heat
for a while; you guys are just that good. What a great season. Things like
that. I thought they were just missing LeBron was the only thing they were
missing.  
  
Q. The shooting, you guys have been shooting the ball so well all season
long beyond the 3 ‑point line, et cetera. What did you see that was not
working tonight, and how disappointing when you've been that good all year?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, their defense was very good. When you have somebody like
Stewart on the perimeter, she's such a good shot blocker, I think that that
made it a little bit more difficult.  
They were looking to double, I thought, a little bit more. The post was
stepping out and trying to take the guard, and they had had a lot more size
with that.  
And a little bit of it, I think, was just the bad start, then we were
pressing. We were really‑‑ we were just trying so hard, and we went one‑on‑one
instead of ‑‑ our game has been team and assists and working the ball
together. And I thought we tried to go a little bit too much off the dribble.  
  
Q. Geno said before the game you couldn't match up against both Kayla and
Jewell. Looked like they just concentrated on taking Jewell out of the game,
and they did. Were you surprised by how effectively they were able to do
that?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, no, I don't think they get enough credit for their
defense. They're a good defensive team. And Jefferson is kind of like a gnat.
She was really feisty. K‑Mac was able to get her shots, but Jewell struggled a
little bit to find her rhythm tonight. And I think you have to credit their
defense for that.  
  
Q. You battled back late in the first half and I imagine felt decent where
you were at halftime. What changed right at the start of the second half when
they went on their run?  
COACH MCGRAW: We made our run when they went to bench. We went to the triangle
and two. It was very effective. We made some shots. I think we got into a
little bit of a rhythm on our own.  
And then the second half they didn't sub. And that was the difference. We
couldn't go to the triangle with their starters. We couldn't play them man to
man and we couldn't play them zone.  
So they went off and running. We couldn't rebound. We had no answer, really,
for anything they did.  
  
Q. Muffet, what does this senior class for you mean to the culture of what
basketball is at Notre Dame?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they changed the culture, the expectation level. I think
they set the bar really high. They've achieved so much in four years, and all
of them have contributed a great deal to it in so many ways, on and off the
court, with leadership and the basketball part as well.  
But it's going to be a really hard class to let go of. This was a real
emotional one for me. And this group has really meant a lot to me personally,
too.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  79  
Notre Dame - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut is head coach Geno Auriemma,
Stefanie Dolson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, and Breanna Stewart. We'll open with
a quick statement from Coach Auriemma, and then we'll take questions from the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, there really isn't much that you can say when we have a
performance like that where your players are just really locked into what we
wanted to do and how we wanted to do it.  
There's just an incredible effort by the entire team, especially these three.  
And there's been a lot of great moments at Connecticut and a lot of great
moments in our NCAA history. But especially for our two seniors and the way
these guys played, I couldn't be prouder of a group of players than I am right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Stewy, you said you wanted to win four titles. You're halfway there, two
Final Four MVPs. What does it mean for you to have two titles in two years and
a chance to win a couple more?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think to be able to have two National Championships under
my belt, I think it means a lot. And I think that each team has been
different.  
And I'm really happy that we could send Stef and Bri off on this note, and
they deserve it.  
And when it's time to get back to work we'll do that, but right now we're
enjoying this moment.  
  
Q. Stefanie, the points in the paint tonight were, I mean, huge. Probably as
huge as we've seen in a title game. What is it like being in the post, knowing
that you could pretty much do what you want on that night?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's pretty nice, I gotta say. Right from the beginning of
the game we went in, took advantage of the size we had against them.  
And right when we realized what an advantage we had, we just kept kind of
pushing it at them, and we never really backed down.  
Give a lot of credit to my guards. They got me the ball. Stewy, we got her the
ball a lot in the post, too. When we got it, we just did what we wanted and
finished it.  
  
Q. Kaleena, can you just put in perspective, I mean, with all the stuff
you've been through this season, to play as well as you did tonight and kind
of just put that in perspective for us?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's a great way to end my season especially the way,
like you said, it started out. And I just can't say how happy I am to be able
to win it for Stefanie and Bria and for all of us to play the way we did
tonight. I think this is one of the best team wins we've had all season.  
  
Q. Stefanie, when I was out on the court, I talked to Breanna. She said you
and her had a conversation last night, and she said: We've got you; we've got
your back. Did you feel like your teammates had your back tonight?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Absolutely. I knew from the beginning of the season that we
were going to have a great team and that we had a lot of talent and a lot of
potential. And coming to this tournament I knew this team had both mine and
Bria's back. Coach really emphasized with them kind of sending their seniors
off with the right note.  
And I couldn't have asked for better teammates my senior year. We had a ton of
fun this year. I'm proud to be with these girls, and I thank them every minute
of that game that they helped me get the National Championship my senior year.  
  
Q. Kaleena, there was so much attention towards Breanna and Stefanie leading
into the game. At any point did you feel like you were the forgotten piece and
you couldn't make a mark tonight?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: No, I didn't know that. I was just still on the team.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: We never forget her.  
BREANNA STEWART: She's an essential.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: There's 11 essentials on this team. So I think all of
us just went into the game trying to contribute as much as we could.  
  
Q. Stefanie, can you talk about what it is with this program when it's a
National Championship game, this program plays its best?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I mean, there's not much to explain about it. I think it's
just you come into every year knowing you have one ultimate goal, which is to
win the National Championship. So you know when you get there you're so
prepared that there's no other‑‑ there's no other ending than winning. So you
just go into it and you prepare all year.  
I think a lot of people said we had a lot of pressure going into this game.
But when you're prepared, we didn't feel the pressure at all. We went into it
knowing we had this game. We had a lot of confidence, and right from the
beginning we just never backed down. And I think it's something that every
year every team does when you're at Connecticut.  
  
Q. This is for Stefanie. You guys now have nine titles, and I wonder if you
could talk about what it means to be one of the people who gives this to Coach
Auriemma? He's now the all ‑time leading winner in terms of titles in women's
basketball. What that means to you? And also to have it be a perfect season,
kind of the cherry on top?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, he's not bad. He's all right. I don't know if he'll say
it or whatever. But we're proud of him, and having nine national championships
is such an amazing accomplishment, and for us to have kind of that two out of
the nine seems like a small little piece, but it's a piece of history and a
piece of a legacy that he has created here at UConn.  
And seeing all the old players here back to kind of cheer us on in this game
was something that I'll never forget. It's just a family, whether you're here
10 years ago, three years ago, or now. You're just connected.  
You bleed blue. But literally you're all connected as a family. And it's
something that not a lot of people can say they're a part of. And obviously
it's pretty solid, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. You probably couldn't write a better script than for women's basketball
and for you guys, 40 ‑0, perfect season. When your ninth title break record
with Pat in Tennessee, what does it mean‑‑ you said you weren't a numbers guy
yesterday, but what does it mean to have No. 9, to cap off another season
against another unbeaten team here in Tennessee?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I honestly believe this: That where it happened, whether it's
here or some other city, really doesn't have any significance for me. That's
never entered my mind. When you get reminded of it all the time about what it
means, you start to think about what it means.  
And it means we've done something that no one else has ever done. So you're
flattered and you're grateful and you're all the things that come with this
kind of accomplishment. Of course. That's not the driving force. That's not
what motivates us at Connecticut.  
As Stefanie said, we try to do the right thing for the people that are there.
If it means winning a National Championship, great. If you come up short,
there were a bunch of ex‑players in the locker room after the game, and there
were six players in there and four of them had played on undefeated National
Championship teams.  
As you start to look back, you see them sitting there, you're just more proud
of the legacy that exists of what is Connecticut basketball as opposed to the
number of championships.  
  
Q. Looked like you were a little emotional when you brought Bria and
Stefanie off the court. Can you talk about them and what this night meant to
you in relation to them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I probably haven't felt that except a few times. But there's
always a moment that kind of brings you‑‑ kind of brings you to your knees
sometimes.  
When Bria Hartley and Stefanie Dolson played their first game at Connecticut,
it was win No. 79 in a row. That's a lot to be thrown into as a freshman. And
the second game of the year was Baylor. And then we went on to win that record
90 in a row.  
And ever since that day, ever since that day they played their very first
game, I can't think of two people that have given every ounce of their energy
and everything that they possibly have to give for the basketball program and
the people at the University of Connecticut.  
That just doesn't happen very often. So when they came off the floor, I think
we all knew exactly what was coming to an end. And even when it's as great as
the ending was tonight, it's still coming to an end. And it really hit me. Hit
me really hard.  
  
Q. In terms of game planning, it was very clear that you made a point of
emphasis to go into the post. And you knew Achonwa wasn't there, but I imagine
even in your wildest dreams you could not have thought it was as effective as
it was. But specifically heading into the game, was that the point of
emphasis, was to attack them low?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it was. We thought that there was some advantages that
we had that whoever was guarding Stewy was going to have a tough matchup in
the lane. And Stefanie, the same thing.  
They then changed up a little bit defensively and played the triangle and 2
where they were guarding Stewy hard and Stefanie hard‑‑ I mean Kaleena hard.
And as we spread those guys out all over the floor, then it just left a lot of
openings in the lane. And we took advantage of it.  
But you don't go into the game thinking that you're going to outscore another
team by 30 points in the paint. You have an idea what you want to do, but kind
of went back to some things that were working earlier this season, tried to
get real comfortable.  
We hadn't been shooting the ball great coming in, so the last thing we wanted
was to come out here start firing jump shots. And we knew we had to score. We
knew we had to get a good possession every time down, because they're so hard
to defend.  
Our defense today was unbelievable. It was incredible. I mean, to hold that
team to 20 points in the second half, that's incredible.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could also address with Kaleena sort of the, I guess,
emotional, mental, physical hurdle she's had all this season to play as well
in the tournament and to cap it off tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Earlier Rebecca asked me: There's always themes that run
through a season, and what was this one? And I really think that K's season
represented exactly what this was all about. It started with the injury in the
Stanford game and then all of a sudden we're down. Now we've got to play
without one of our best players. And then she comes back and it's another
injury. And then it's mono then one thing after another.  
I'm most proud how she handled that whole adversity; that for her to play her
best basketball‑‑ we talked about it before the NCAA Tournament started. I
said if we're fortunate enough to play six games, these six games could wipe
out how frustrating the other four months were.  
That's exactly what happened. She was unbelievable the entire tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, on Sunday night, Markisha Wright was the person who probably more
than anybody, other than Kayla McBride, stepped up to fill some of the void
left by Achonwa. Tonight you held her virtually scoreless and I think two
rebounds. How much did that factor into your game plan containing her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There wasn't any particular big guy that we were focused on. I
think it was more what were we going to do with their shooters, how we were
going to guard Kayla McBride and how we were going to guard Jewell Lloyd and
how were we going to guard when Mikaela Mabrey came into the game.  
In the first half we did an okay job, then did a terrible job towards the end
of the half.  
We just knew we had to rebound the ball. We knew we had to outrebound them by
a lot. Not by a little. And because we scored so many points, I think Muffet
had to go to offensive players on the floor.  
So she probably played those other guys to try to get points on the board more
often than the way they played the other night. When points were just coming
so easily, you can afford to have someone in there that maybe isn't an
offensive player but is just going to crash the boards.  
But Stefanie Dolson played the game of her life and got every rebound. And
that was the key.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked yesterday about how probably there are more eyeballs on
this game because of the two undefeateds and perfect season the casual fan
would watch it. The last time I remember something like that might have been
the Stanford game a couple years ago when it was 20 ‑12 at the half. It seems
tonight the first half was really entertaining, both teams scoring. Big
picture, do you think this may help what you guys are looking at maybe that
could transcend the game and get more people interested?   
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the final score probably maybe, if that had been
different, it could have been maybe even more. But anybody who watched that
first half had to really admire both teams, the way we played, how hard we
played, both teams, how hard we competed.  
I said this the other day: Notre Dame's the best team we played all year. No
one else is even close. And I knew it was going to take an unbelievable effort
for us to beat them.  
I told Muffet after the game, I don't think she got enough credit. She won
Coach of the Year. But I don't think she even got enough credit for how her
team performed all year long.  
That was an unbelievable team we played tonight. And we played about as well
as we played at any other time in the season for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, this is Nashville's first time to host the Final Four. How did the
city do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it won't be the last time. It won't be the last time. We
were talking earlier. I know there were some circumstances that why they
haven't been able to have one here earlier, but now that you've got the
building, you've got the hotels, you've got‑‑ I could probably count 50 people
that traveled down here with us that don't want to go home. They said that
they want to move down here.  
And I think it's just perfect. It's not overwhelming. It's not a place you're
going to get lost in. You don't have to travel around for half an hour, 40
minutes in a car to go find stuff. It's all right there. And the people have
been absolutely amazing.  
As you knew they would. This town has a great reputation. I'm sure they host
great events. They're used to it. And I hope this becomes a regular
destination, and I hope we come back here. I hope we're back here the next
time they have it here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. That's all the time we have. Thanks.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thanks everybody.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Taya Reimer, Lindsay Allen, Kayla McBride Jewell Loyd, and
Ariel Braker.  
  
Q. Kayla, now that it's here, what does it mean to be playing in this game
tomorrow night for the championship in this historic battle of unbeaten
teams?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Yeah, we're excited. It's been a long season. So to be playing
in the final game, I know as a senior it's a great opportunity for us and this
team.  
We've been through a lot this year. We're just excited to be able to play on
the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Taya, can you talk a little bit about the challenge inside, the
difference between playing without Natalie against Maryland and now having to
play without Natalie against Connecticut?  
TAYA REIMER: It's been a challenge. She's been our leader all year and
obviously one of our best players in general and obviously a great presence
for us inside.  
But we're going to work as hard as we can, be physical with them down low. And
we did a pretty good job against Maryland, and we're going to try to keep that
up tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kayla, could you just talk about what does the rivalry with UConn mean to
you over the years? And if there's any two undefeated teams that should be
playing for a National Championship, does it seem fitting that UConn and Notre
Dame are those two teams?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: We always have a great game. I think it's great for basketball
in general. I think the fan base increases a lot during this game.  
Yeah, we have history. Especially the last couple of years we had some great
games. It's definitely exciting. I know we're excited. Two great programs
going at it. So I can't wait.  
  
Q. Kayla, how nice is it for you to be here at this stage after what you've
gone through in your career?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Oh, wow, it's kind of surreal that this is going to be my last
game in a uniform. This program has meant so much to me over the years.  
This season is something special, being undefeated and with this team. It's
definitely a little different than my past years.  
To be in the National Championship game and to be able to play for Coach
McGraw and with these girls, it means more than you know.  
  
Q. Ariel, having played Connecticut so many times in the past, what kind of
advantage is that for you?  
ARIEL BRAKER: I think it's a little bit of an advantage, except this year, I
mean, we haven't played them at all. So you kind of have to X out those past
games, especially because we're a different team and they're a different team.  
So I think at the same time it's kind of an advantage but not really, just
because we're a different team than we were the past years that we played
them.  
  
Q. Kayla, what specifically is different about playing UConn, whether it's
the intensity, whether it's schemes, compared to every other team that you
play or have played?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think there's an intensity factor. I think a lot of people go
in playing UConn, they see their jerseys and they've already lost the game.  
I don't think we're like that. I think we have a certain swag to us, and I
think it's like that with any team. And I don't know, I think we already don't
like each other, so that adds to it, too.  
But it's just a good game, and we get up for these types of games. We know
it's going to be competitive. We know it's going to go down to the wire. We
know it's going to be intense, and that's something that we like to do and go
against.  
  
Q. Question for you, Coach. I know you said you were confident in your
team's ability to bounce back even without Natalie, and it really seemed like
they didn't skip a beat. Seeing that as a coach, what was that like and how
confident are you in this next game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't think I've ever been prouder of my team than I was in
that game last night, to see everybody, every single person who went in the
game stepped up to help us win, whether it showed up on the stat sheet or not.  
This is a team that's completely united. We have now more of a cause. We're
playing for Natalie. We want to win this for her. We want to win it for the
seniors. This group has tremendous chemistry. And it's been a really great
ride this year.  
  
Q. Jewell, after playing those four intense games last year against UConn,
was there anything in the ACC, was there any rivalry, any game that rivalled
the emotion of what Notre Dame went through last year in all those games
against Connecticut?  
JEWELL LLOYD: I think we had some really good games against Duke. This team,
we play with a lot of passion, so whenever we step on the court, we bring in
that fire and we bring in emotion on the court. It doesn't matter who we are
playing; we play together and we play hard.  
  
Q. Taya, could you talk about maybe you getting a little bit of a crash
course in playing UConn the last couple of days. Obviously you've never played
them before, but what have you found this rivalry means to some of your
teammates?  
TAYA REIMER: Well, obviously just before I even got here, watching the games
and being at some of the games, I'm definitely very aware of the rivalry. But
the past few days, I mean, we were focused on Maryland and we weren't looking
ahead to playing either UConn or Stanford.  
But I'm very aware of the rivalry, and now that that's who our opponent is
going to be, I mean, obviously I'm aware of it and definitely ready to play. I
know it's going to be a battle.  
  
Q. Coach, what has Lindsay Allen's contribution been during this run and
also just fitting into your back court that you have?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she's playing with the poise of a veteran. Her assist to
turnover ratio has been 5 to 1. It's phenomenal, playing with such poise and
such maturity way beyond her years.  
She's getting the ball to people. She's doing so many great things, both ends
of the floor. I'm just so happy for her. And she's exceeded all of our
expectations this year.  
  
Q. Kayla, you mentioned the intense rivalry with UConn and I guess the
feelings that both teams share, but what part of you as you're watching them
play Stanford was secretly hoping that they would be there at the end so you
could face them?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think Stanford and UConn are both great teams. I wasn't
looking for either one of them. I know I was going to the National
Championship and that's the only thing that mattered to me.  
  
Q. Geno last night was talking about how you and UConn have both separated
yourselves. And one of the things he mentioned was passing for both teams. Do
you see that as well in terms of your team in particular? And what makes you
two teams good passing teams?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we recruit to our Princeton offense. We want players,
especially post players, that are really good passers. On the guard side, we
like unselfish players. So I think we have those as well.  
Our assist to turnover ratio is among the best in the country because we look
for each other. We don't care who scores; we just want to win. So we're always
willing to make that extra pass. I think that can separate you from other
teams.  
Our efficiency, I think, in passing has been really good, too. So our posts,
really we work a lot on our passing, and that was something that Natalie
Achonwa was in particular really good at.  
  
Q. Muffet, two things. One, they're a very physical team. How important is
it that you get some foul calls down low? And, secondly, when Kiah Stokes was
in the game, it gives them that big, big lineup. What extra challenge does
that put on you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think it's amazing. They committed the fewest fouls in
the nation. So they can be a really physical team and yet not manage to foul.  
So we don't really worry about the refs, how they're going to call the game.
We're going to react accordingly. That's not a huge issue for us.  
But they have such great size. Kiah Stokes is playing really well this year.
Gives them nice lift off the bench. They have the big lineup that they play
frequently with the three big posts, and that creates a lot of matchup
problems for us.  
  
Q. Kayla, did you get the sense as the year was going on that the nation was
waiting for this game? I mean, you're still preoccupied in trying to win the
ACC and everything, but in Connecticut, the reverberation was pretty strong
and we're waiting for this. Did Notre Dame feel the same way, or did you sense
it?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: Yeah, I feel like it was something that was always being talked
about. Like as a team we always talk about the noise surrounding everything
else. And that was a big thing is the UConn/Notre Dame matchup and all that.  
But I just think this team has a certain mental toughness to them. And I think
we've just been able to take it one game at a time, and now we're here and now
we're focusing on UConn.  
  
Q. Muffet, could you talk about the ruthlessness with which Kayla plays? And
where do you see your advantages in this game tomorrow?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure that's a word that I would ever ascribe to Kayla.
She is like an assassin. I think that she's willing to throw the dagger. She
wants to give you the knockout punch. She's going to compete and battle on
every single possession.  
I think it's what makes her great, and it's been fun to watch her enjoying
playing the game and she plays with such passion.  
I think our guard play has been spectacular all year long, and we gotta make
shots in the game tomorrow. That's going to be key.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at the matchups with Connecticut, is there any area
that jumps out at you? Can you take advantage of your transition, or is it
something else?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think Stewart's a real matchup problem for us. She's somebody
that's hard to guard because of her inside/outside ability. Their size creates
some matchup problems for us.  
They have a great transition game. They really like to get out there to that
long outlet and get down the floor in a hurry. So transition defense will be a
big factor too.  
  
Q. Is beating UConn sweeter than beating another opponent?  
COACH MCGRAW: Not having beaten them this year, I can say it was fun going
through the ACC and beating a lot of teams we beat this year. Last year we
were able to beat them three times, and that was fun. Would have liked to have
won the last one, though.  
  
Q. Muffet, do you think tomorrow night's going to be a historic night for
women's college basketball? You've been in the game so long, coached so many
great games. Do you sense the moment in terms of what this is going to mean
for the game and the history of the game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a historic moment right now because we've never had
two undefeated teams head into the National Championship. So I definitely
think we've made history already.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you compare the vibe? The last couple of years you play UConn
seems like every other week before the NCAA Tournament; this year you haven't
played them once in the year. Is there a different feel to it because there's
been so much time between these games?  
COACH MCGRAW: No, I don't think so. I think we still have that same rivalry.
We were focused on the ACC this year. And it was a nice distraction to not
have to watch Connecticut all year. So I think now that it's here I think
we've got a pretty short memory for last year.  
  
Q. Muffet, I don't know if better team is the exact correct word, but you're
certainly an undefeated team since Skylar left. How are you ‑‑ maybe you are
better without her. And how are you sort of different or compensated for not
having her? Can you sort of explain how that worked this year.   
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're different because of our balance. I think we have
more people that are doing more things instead of relying on one person to
handle the ball 90 percent of the time. Now we share the ball in different
ways.  
So I think we're harder to guard, because you don't know who is going to be on
the attack when we outlet to so many different people that you have to prepare
for.  
I think our post game is so much better with the addition of Taya Reimer. I
think that our bench has played extremely well with Madison Cable and Michaela
Mabrey really giving us great minutes all year long.  
I think we're a much deeper team, and I think we're the type of team we can
sub one person out and still have a pretty good balance on the floor.  
  
Q. Muffet, next December6th you guys renew your non ‑conference association
in South Bend with UConn in the Jimmy V game. Do you want Connecticut to be a
staple on your non‑conference schedule?  
COACH MCGRAW: Unlike football, we don't schedule 10 years out. We just try to
do the next year. And so we were happy that we were able to get them back on
the schedule for next year. I think we have a two‑year deal right now home and
away.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. At this time we're going to let our student‑athletes
head up to their breakout areas.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of advantage is it that you have? Your players have
played Connecticut so many times in the past. And then how different are they
this year from what they've seen?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think there's a familiarity. And I think that always helps,
because sometimes when you play a team for the first time like we did so many
times this year, you really can't get enough off the film to see them in
person and see what they're actually like.  
So I think we have that that we can at least fall back on while we're watching
the film.  
They're very different this year. I think they're just bigger, they're
stronger, they're in the post more. Jefferson, I think, has kind of come into
that role that they hoped she would come into last year.  
And Hartley's playing better. So I think they have six really good players
that they're playing right now. And there's just a lot of matchup problems out
there.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about becoming a program that's a perennial in the
Final Four and now you guys have done it for a long stretch here as opposed to
a program that's trying to get to that level or has gone there and then has
that stretch where they don't go? What does it take to ‑‑ is it a superstar
player that gets you there? Is it a combination of things to become that type
of program?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's really hard. I think the challenge of staying there is as
hard as it was getting here. I think we've looked and found the difference in
the players. We've got WNBA players graduating every year. We've got first
round draft picks that are playing‑‑ that are going every year.  
So I think when you have that kind of talent, that's what it takes. I think
it's the recruiting. Niele Ivey does a great job for us in the recruiting end
as well as all the rest of our coaches.  
But you have to have the great players in order to sustain it.  
  
Q. Muffet, is it fair to say you might miss Natalie more acutely against
UConn because of their size?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think so. We're not using it as an excuse, though. I
mean, we're going to play with the players that we have and hope that they
give the great effort they gave us last night.  
  
Q. I'll pose the question to you that I posed to Kayla. When you're watching
a semifinal between UConn and Stanford, what part of you really wanted to see
UConn pull through so that you could have this historic matchup in the
final?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it was kind of inevitable, wasn't it? I think you guys
probably had that one on your calendars probably by February1st. I think the
whole country was so distracted with that and enamored with the matchup that
it's kind of nice to be in that moment. Because we really tried to block it
all out and I thought did a really good job of that during the year.  
But now it's great to have the two best teams in the country playing each
other for a National Championship.  
  
Q. You guys might be the only team in the country who walks out on the floor
with them and is not intimidated. How important is that kind of confidence in
a game like this?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's huge. I think that's what it takes to beat a good
team. I think you saw that with Tennessee over the years, just you play the
name on their jersey instead of playing the game; you're intimidated before
you start. And I think that that that's an attitude that we're bringing into
the game, one of confidence.  
  
Q. Breanna Stewart, you mentioned her before. How do you kind of try to stop
her and how much has she improved since you last saw her last year?  
COACH MCGRAW: She was pretty darned good last year. MVP of the Final Four. I
don't know that you can stop her. I don't think you can. I think she's just a
great player who‑‑ she can score in so many different ways. She has so many
more ways she can beat you at different times during the game.  
So I think we have to hope that she doesn't go off for her career high, but as
far as stopping her I'm not sure that's possible.  
  
Q. Coach, people always look back on that Magic ‑Bird final in'79 as a,
quote/unquote, tipping point, even though we didn't have that term then but we
look at it now that way. Is it fair to say that women's basketball could have
a similar tipping point with two iconic‑type teams or two players? Is that
something you could see happening and could this game possibly be that?   
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I think this game is going to give a lot more attention to
the women's game. I think the fans like the rivalry. I think the media likes
the rivalry. In some ways I think it would be great for women's basketball if
we got some new teams in the Final Four. But I think in order to showcase the
best in women's basketball, I think this is it.  
  
Q. Another one on Stewart. Because it is, like you said, impossible to stop
her, do you have to put different people on her throughout the game because it
may be so demoralizing to try to stop her for an entire game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think that you have to try different things for sure. I don't
think you'll have one person for 40 minutes that's able to stay in the game
and guard her that long. I think we're going to have to try a couple of
different plans.  
  
Q. Muffet, I just wanted to talk a little bit about your execution
offensively and Taya's role in that. It seemed like as a freshman some people
expected she might be a little bit discombobulated with all the moving parts
and pieces of your offense. But could you speak how she assimilated to this
offense and how she grasped it so readily?  
COACH MCGRAW: She's a really smart basketball player with a really high
basketball IQ, so that part is easy. I think what we encouraged her to do is
follow her instincts because they're always right on point. She thinks, oh,
that would be a great idea to cut to the basket right now, and sometimes she
would stop herself early in the season, not sure if that's what we wanted in
the offense.  
I think gradually she got to understand that the offense revolves around
creativity and freedom of movement. I think she's perfect for the Princeton
offense because she can pass, she can shoot, she can handle the ball. So she
really, I think, felt very comfortable in the offense pretty early in the
season.  
  
Q. Muffet, you sort of answered it, but this is sort of the perfect storm.
You guys have played every year since the last 20 years. First time you're not
playing so there could be two undefeated teams. What does it mean that didn't
play first time ever in the season and now you're playing for the biggest
prize and what it could do for women's basketball down the road?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's something that everybody looked forward to all year
long because we didn't play during the regular season. I think everybody was
hoping that we would end up here. I think it's great.  
I think it's great for the game. I think it's great that we are both
undefeated coming into it. And it should be just a great matchup for women's
basketball.  
  
Q. Muffet, for a long time at the top of women's basketball the coaching
duality with Pat and Geno and how different they were, you and Geno both being
sully people, maybe more alike. Could you talk about that, because people
sometimes do look at this as a head coach versus head coach, how you guys are
alike and different, both personality ‑wise and then also philosophy‑wise in
basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're very different. I think basketball‑wise, maybe
philosophically we have some things in common. Sharing those Philly roots is a
commonality in our personalities. I think we both like to play the same kind
of game. I think they're running a lot of the Princeton offense now. They're
running a lot of the same kind of things.  
So I think that type of game I think appeals to both of us. I think we both
take pride in our defense as well as our offense, and we're probably sort of
perfectionists in that we want the team to be great on every given day.  
I'm a little bit more of an introvert. He's quite the extrovert.  
  
Q. Muffet, you said how the fans like the rivalry, the media likes the
rivalry. How do you feel about it? Do you enjoy there's this rivalry between
the two teams?  
COACH MCGRAW: I do. I do. I love the rivalry. I think it's the one that gets
your competitive juices flowing. I think it's something that you look forward
to. I mean, you want to be coaching for this kind of game and this kind of
moment.  
  
Q. You mentioned your coaching staff and you've got Beth, obviously was a
head coach for a long time; Niele, who I think a lot of people think could
easily be a head coach; and Angie; and Carol obviously has been with you a
long time. How has that helped? Because Coach Auriemma has a similar
continuity in staff. How big of a deal is that in terms of recruiting and
philosophy?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a huge deal. It's definitely the reason that we've
been successful as the staff. They do all of the work, really. They do all the
scouting. They do so many things off the court with the team. They get the
players ready, the individual workouts.  
I'm so blessed to have the staff that I have. Two head coaches. We've got tons
of years of experience on our staff, and then you have somebody like Niele who
is the brightest young star in the game.  
And we just have great chemistry. We have fun together. We work hard together.
But the loyalty and the trust that we have, I think, is critical because in a
game situation, in those moments in the game where things are tense, you gotta
be able to trust the people you're with. And I think that's a big reason that
we've been able to be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the excitement of the rivalry between you guys and
UConn and looking forward to the game tomorrow night. But what would be your
final message to your team heading into a game of this magnitude?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the same it's been all year: This is what we've been
working for. We got ourselves to this point. We've been here before. And we
just want to go out and play our game, but we want to have fun when we're
doing it. We want to be relaxed.  
The pressure is on them. We have to come out, feel loose and play our game.  
  
Q. Coach, Geno says that the shots don't come off the fingers the same in
January and February as they do in March, except for with Kayla McBride here
in the Elite Eight and the Final Four. Do you agree with that, and why do you
think she's so unaffected by the lights?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't agree with that. I think‑‑ I agree with the
Kayla part. I think she's the kind of player that enjoys the big stage and the
competitiveness of it. She enjoys going head to head with good players. And I
think she just has that passion and she has fun while she's playing.  
And I think that's the biggest key for her. When you see her smiling, then you
know she's going to be on her game.  
  
Q. Coach, one thing that I think is sort of different about these programs,
and you've alluded to it before, you have been an underdog, in fact a big
underdog in the NCAA Tournament. You've won as an 11 seed, upset teams on
their home court. Can you talk about that mentality? It seems like you've
maintained that mentality even when you've become more of an overdog; you
still have that underdog kind of feistiness.  
COACH MCGRAW: I do. I think I've just always loved the underdog. It's really
only been the past couple of years when people ask me who do I want to win the
men's tournament, I want Wichita State to win, I want these top seeds to win
now.  
I think that's the role I've grown up with. I think we've always had that role
coming in. It was Tennessee, it was Connecticut.  
We just took that role and we enjoyed it and we worked hard at it and we got
some wins early on, and I think that kind of fed into it.  
And we don't talk about people don't respect us, don't know our name. We just
care about the people in our locker room. That's the only people whose opinion
that really matters.  
  
Q. You speak to the intensity of the rivalry and how it's kind of welcomed
by both sides. But Saturday when you accepted Coach of the Year ‑‑
congratulations, by the way‑‑ and Breanna Stewart was there for Player of the
Year, both teams were assembled in that room, could you sense the palpable
tension in the room? Was there like a stick of dynamite that was getting ready
to go off there?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think there was definitely tension in the room. I think
for us we wanted Kayla McBride to win the Player of the Year award. So I think
it was a little bit of that. And certainly the rivalry has gone a little away
from the civility it was when we were in the league together.  
  
Q. Muffet, when you were first recruiting Lindsay, what caught your eye
about her that made her special, and was it as much about her being a winner
as her physical ability, too?  
COACH MCGRAW: It was a lot of things. Of course for us she was a great
student. That was big for us. But her IQ, important for the point guard. I'm
really, really tough on point guards. I always have a really short list
because I just‑‑ there's a lot of people that I don't want to coach. So she
was somebody that caught my eye initially because of her intelligence, her
decision‑making on the floor.  
She did not turn the ball over. That was just probably the first thing I
recognized. She was a good defender. She got the ball to the right people. She
threw it ahead. She had that kind of steady demeanor that I think is
important. And she was such a team player and a winner.  
  
Q. Muffet, you've always had really good support at Notre Dame from the fan
base and such. Has this run this past couple of years, this year with the
undefeated season, moved the needle at all or gotten more attention on campus,
anything of that nature? Obviously Notre Dame is a huge football school. What
you've done in the last four years, and the last 20 years there have been
pretty special?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, you know, it has been. I think everybody on campus is
here, our president was here. He's been here through all of our games. And he
is somebody that we really are blessed to have on us. The Board of Trustees,
those guys are always around.  
I think on campus, Brian Kelly‑‑ probably the first voicemail I got after we
beat Baylor was from Brian Kelly. Mike Brey. We really do feel like we have
the support of everybody on campus, all the other teams. I think there's great
camaraderie among the players on other teams.  
And it is, it's great to walk around campus, know that everybody's talking
about you.  
  
Q. What do you think it would take to bring the civility back to the
rivalry?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're past that point.  
  
Q. Is there ‑‑ you talked about the level of recruit that you need to get,
but there's also I would think a personality type. And I'm wondering if you
could talk about that, the type of kid, not just her ability, but the type of
kid that you look for recruiting‑wise to be able to compete at this level.   
COACH MCGRAW: You know, there's a lot of good players out there. Some of them
are really good students. So our pool gets a little bit‑‑ makes it a little
bit smaller.  
But I think for me, I don't offer scholarships to kids that I've never spoken
to or have spoken to only once. I know a lot of coaches see a player, they
think she's good, they offer a scholarship when they're in eighth, ninth,
tenth grade. We did it with Skylar, but she's the only one.  
But I like to get to know a player, because I want to know about the
relationship we're going to have; I like to see the relationship with their
parents, because that's the relationship I'm going to have with them.  
When they come on campus, I want to make sure they're somebody that fits in
and wants to be a team player and not somebody that's all about themselves. So
I think the unselfish part is really, really important to me and how they get
along with the team.  
And after they visit the campus, I always ask the players: What did you think?
How did you think she would fit in? And it's great with all the friendships
they make early because they have a really good feel for that. And somebody
like Brianna Turner, Kathryn Westbeld and Mychal Johnson, they knew a lot of
our other players, a lot of them know Taya. That's been a big draw because we
love her personality. If they fit in, she's going to let us know about that.  
  
Q. Coach, I know Jonathan is here supporting you. He's meant a lot to your
program. What makes him a good coach and what do you see him being able to
take to the GW program?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they did a great job with them this year. He has Megan
Duffy on his staff, one of our former point guards. He's so full of passion. I
think his energy level is extremely high. He knows the game and knows the
scouting reports and very thorough and organized and has good relationships
with his players.  
I think he knows how important that is. So I expect him to do really well
there.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach McGraw? Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut, head coach Geno
Auriemma and student‑athletes Moriah Jefferson, Bria Hartley, Kaleena
Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart, and Stefanie Dolson. Any questions?  
  
Q. Stefanie, so much is made all season long about you guys potentially
meeting for this historic game. Now that it's here, what does it mean to be
playing in this game tomorrow night?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Obviously historically it's pretty cool. It's not something
that happens all the time, having two undefeated teams play each other in the
National Championship game.  
For us, we're not really thinking about that. You can't focus on all that
stuff, all the hype that's around the game. We know it's going to be a tough
game with Notre Dame. It always is. We have to focus on ourselves and make
sure our game plan is on point for the game on Tuesday.  
  
Q. For both Coach and maybe Kaleena, can you talk about last year, the
difference between the first three games and maybe Breanna's emergence in the
Final Four and getting over the hump against Notre Dame in that matchup?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The difference between the semifinal game? Yeah, I mean, I
think every team goes through growing pains, you know. I think for us asking
so much out of our freshmen last year, I think that's hard to do.  
There aren't a whole lot of teams that get to the Final Four that are relying
on a lot of freshmen. It's not easy.  
And funny stuff happened in those three games. And I think in the Big East
championship games, Bria had a pretty good game. I think she played really,
really well in the Big East championship game. We just came up short. In all
three of those games had the ball or had the lead in the last minute of the
game and we didn't get the job done.  
And when we got to the semifinals last year, Stewy played great, the rest of
the team played great, and we handled them pretty easily.  
So I guess that goes to show you that through the course of the season things
change and you hope you get better. And we got better as the season went on.  
  
Q. Geno, would it be one of your goals tomorrow night to make Notre Dame
miss Natalie Achonwa more than they did last night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. When players get hurt, sometimes that just opens
up opportunities for other players. I remember when we played Notre Dame in
the 2001 semifinal, we were missing Svetlana Abrosimova and Shae Ralph. People
thought it was going to be hard for us to get to that point, to get to the
Final Four. But we had players step up and played better than they had their
whole regular season.  
So they're more than just one player. They're more than any one individual.
And if they can continue to get contributions from their other three post
players like they got yesterday, they won't miss Natalie at all.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at Notre Dame, the point guard spot, how, if at all, has
going from Skylar to Lindsay changed their team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, the biggest notable difference is that both Kayla
McBride and Jewell Loyd have gotten a lot more shots, a lot more
opportunities, have been more involved in handling the ball. So in one sense
it's made them even more dangerous.  
You can just see how hard it is to defend those two. They're not always
necessarily waiting to get the ball. They have the ball in their hands a lot
right from the beginning of the possession. And that's one big difference that
I've seen in watching them play this year.  
  
Q. For Breanna. Hi, Breanna. Quick question. Speaking to the intense rivalry
between these two teams, could you ‑‑ did you have a sense of appreciation for
that when you sat Saturday at that table when you were named Player of the
Year and you looked around, and was the tension in that room pretty
appreciable and was it such that if someone had rolled a ball into the room it
would have been game on?   
BREANNA STEWART: I think there were two teams in the room and they were both
supporting‑‑ can you hear me? I think that there was two teams in the room and
they were both supporting their respective player and coaches. And I don't
think that we are very fond of each other. I think everyone knows that. But at
the same time we still respect each other and know that tomorrow night it's
going to be a huge battle.  
  
Q. Bria, you obviously had a chance to play in those great Tennessee games,
but probably that legacy was part of what drew you to Connecticut. I'm
wondering if you could tell us what playing Notre Dame for the three years and
now in your career, what it's been like, both in terms of the games themselves
and the intensity that Breanna just referred to?  
BRIA HARTLEY: Yeah, throughout my career we all know we played Notre Dame a
number of times, and I think every time we played them the game was played at
a really high level. It was always really competitive, and I think those are
the games we kind of live for. Those games we were playing a really good team
and you know it comes down to who is going to make the plays, who is going to
step up and win, whether we came out on the losing end on the win.  
It's always been a great rivalry, great thing for women's basketball. I think
the fans enjoy watching games like that. Just in my career, I think it's just
great that we're able to play them in a National Championship in my senior
year, because it's been such a competitive game throughout all the years, and
I know we've all enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Breanna, when you come to Connecticut, how do you get introduced to the
notion that you're not very fond of Notre Dame, or did you know that before
you came in? How does that kind of atmosphere seep into your consciousness?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I don't think it was anything when I was in high
school. I didn't have any sense of rivalry between college teams. But I think
that last year when they beat us three times in a row, that created a sense of
rivalry just because they were all so close, the games were all so close, came
down to the last minute. And we eventually were able to get them back in the
semifinals last year.  
  
Q. Stefanie, I know how beloved you guys are in your region of the world.
But outside that, women's basketball fans are always like anybody but
Connecticut. They want to see you guys lose. Geno has always sort of embraced
that. He likes to be the one with the target on his back. How as a player have
you embraced that? Do you like being the heavy, so to speak, that maybe the
rest of the country is kind of rooting against because you guys are so good?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It was something that Breanna and I stepped into when we were
freshmen coming off as they had just won. So when we initially came here to
Connecticut, we already had a target on our backs. It's something that Coach
has done, definitely embraced. It's something you get used to.  
We know every game we play the other team is going to give us their best game
and knock down shots they don't usually make. We're always prepared for that.
We're always expecting it.  
And it's something that you get used to and you definitely embrace because you
just have to go out on the court with that confidence that we knowno one wants
to see us win, so we're going to win anyway.  
  
Q. Stefanie and Bria, anyone else who wants to take it, all the games last
year were so intense. This rivalry is so intense. Have you missed not playing
Notre Dame this year? National title aside, are you looking forward to getting
back on a court to test yourselves again against Notre Dame?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: We always know when we play Notre Dame it's going to be a
good game. They're a tough team. We're a tough team. I mean, we played some
great teams this year. We're not going to take any credit away from them,
obviously. We had some tough games this year and in the tournament.  
And we're definitely looking forward to playing the best in order to win,
obviously. It's going to be a fun game tomorrow. I think we're all looking
forward to it. I'm sure they are too, so...  
BRIA HARTLEY: Yeah, I don't know if we necessarily missed it this year,
because playing a team 12 times in three years is a lot. But I know we enjoyed
the games and playing them and they were always competitive.  
But like Stefanie said, we're going to go out there go over our game plan, and
we want to go out there really confident. And I think this run in the
tournament we've been playing pretty well, and we're excited to go out there
just play on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Stefanie, one of the other major differences between the programs is in
terms of social media, like the Notre Dame kids can do what they want during
the season with Twitter and whatnot and you guys can't. And they also ‑‑
strangely enough, they're told to wear green fingernail polish and you guys
can't do that stuff. As ladies, as social media mavens, do you miss being able
to participate in any of that and being blacked out of that during the season,
and will you be happy when you can go back on? Does it have a factor at all?
  
STEFANIE DOLSON: No, it's not a factor at all. First of all, as seniors you
get used to it. You just don't really care. And for us, I think it's a
benefit. I mean, it takes away from the distractions. I think social media is
such a narcissistic thing. I think people do it for themselves and to kind of
get themselves out there.  
And I think for us it just takes away that attraction and makes us focus on
what we're doing and why we're here in college, is to play basketball, not to
go on social media and boast about ourselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. Geno, Muffet McGraw, in the locker room just shortly, a while ago, talked
about the lack of civility that now exists in your relationship with her and
the relationship between the two programs. I wanted to know if you sort of
wanted to comment on where you see or how you view your relationship with her
and how you view Connecticut's relationship with Notre Dame.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I mean, I think when you play as often as we
havein a short period of time, I think a lot of things happen that wouldn't
happen if you didn't play that often.  
I think you guys alluded to what's it like being us. Nobody knows what it's
like being us. Nobody knows what we go through every day, what our players go
through every time they win award, they get pissed off. Worst off, they act
pissed off because our guys won an award because it's Connecticut all the
time, all Connecticut all the time. People are sick of it. It's just natural.
We live with it 365days a year. If you come in with that air, then you have to
live to deal with it.  
  
Q. Geno, I'm wondering if Muffet ‑‑ given where you're both from,
tranquility is not what's expected of people in Philadelphia, is she taking a
page from your play book, trying to get under your skin? Is it like a‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I don't know. You'd have to ask her that. I
don't know. I don't think anything about me has changed. People who know me
know I haven't changed, and the program hasn't changed and the respect we have
for everybody else hasn't changed.  
We think we're the best basketball program in America, but we don't flaunt it,
we don't go around talking about it all the time. We're not out there all the
time.  
So I haven't changed. But a funny thing happens once they start beating us.
Everything changes. It's just the world we live in. I've learned to deal with
it. I don't put too much stock into what anybody says. For me, I'm at an age
now where if it's not happening between the lines, I really don't care. I
don't care what anybody says. I don't care what anybody does. I don't care
what conference you're in or what school you're at. I don't care about
anything.  
I'm at an age where I spend whatever time I need to spend worrying about those
40 minutes we're going to be playing. The rest of the stuff, I could care
less.  
  
Q. Kayla McBride, who's experienced both of you, at least you briefly at
that camp and Muffet now for four years, said in many ways you're actually the
same coach and that's why the demand for excellence, the demand for precision
is why your two teams have separated themselves from the country. Do you see
that that is the one similarity left between you two?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I think I said this either yesterday or the day before,
when you are able to recruit really good players, which Notre Dame can and we
can, and you know how to coach them, which they do and we do, you tend to have
happen what's happening.  
If we were to stop getting good players or they were to stop getting good
players, doesn't matter what kind of coaches we are, we wouldn't be here. So
we have‑‑ the only thing similar in our background, we grew up in the same
area. But there's a lot of similarity in terms of how her team plays and how
my team plays. I think that's very similar in what's demanded and what's
expected and how we share the ball, the intensity level we play at, and I
think that's probably why the games are the way they are.  
We've got two really, really good teams. Forget the other stuff. The other
stuff is such nonsense. Really, that's nonsense. I could sit here and list
10,000 coaches that don't interact with each other whose rivalries are
intense. This is a function of women's basketball. Sometimes we act like
girls, like we're supposed to go to dinner every night.  
We're supposed to play each other, try to beat each other's brains in, try to
win a National Championship and compete like hell, Muffet and Geno, and then
we're supposed to get together afterwards and go have a bottle of wine. That's
just not going to happen. So stop asking us why it doesn't happen.  
  
Q. Geno, like with boxers when you have two heavyweights in the press
conferences before they fight, they often go back and forth to try to get
under each other's skin. Is there any element of that in this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know.  
  
Q. Is there any advantage?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Not on me, not on my end. Because I don't think it means
anything. I don't think it means anything at all. This isn't Muhammad Ali
taunting Joe Frazier. That's not what this is about.  
I think deep down that's not who Muffet is, and that's not who I am. We don't
sit up here and taunt each other because we're trying to get under each
other's skin. I don't think that's got any part of it.  
It's superfluous. We use big words, too.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the undefeatedness and all the other
stuff. But the sort of under ‑angle is this would be No. 9 if you win and
doing it here in Tennessee and just what would it mean to win that ninth title
and become the all‑time winningest coach as far as championships go as far as
in women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I think if you win a National Championship, that
doesn't really‑‑ I don't think it really matters where you win it, who you're
playing against.  
Anytime you win a National Championship, it's pretty special. When Pat won No.
8, there may have been a perception out there nobody's ever going to catch
Pat.  
So if Connecticut or anybody else were to win eight or nine, somebody's going
to come around someday and win ten. I'm really not a numbers guy. I don't
really get caught up in that stuff. I've said this 100,000 times. Wednesday
morning, when I wake up, win or lose, my life doesn't change one iota.  
Now, Stewy said she came to Connecticut to win four national championships. So
that's what I think is more significant for Bria and Stefanie Dolson, to win a
National Championship their senior year. That's pretty significant, because
they only get X amount of chances to do it.  
God willing, I'll get more chances down the road. So that's kind of been my
focus. Ever since maybe like the second or third one, you know, after a while
it's just like, yeah, it's great, but it's not, not because it's going to
change my life.  
At one time I did want to win championships because it was going to change my
life, because I thought I wasn't getting paid enough. But now that I am, I
really don't care.  
  
Q. Coach, I have a two ‑parter here. A, was it uncomfortable for you to be
in that room with them the other day? And, B, I wonder if you would comment on
what Muffet said earlier about how, quote, it's amazing how they've committed
the fewest fouls in the country, unquote.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Actually it was not uncomfortable for me at all to be in that
room. I thought Stewy deserved to be Player of the Year and I'm glad I was
there to be a part of it, and I thought Muffet deserved to be Coach of the
Year and I'm glad I was a part of it.  
It wasn't uncomfortable for me at all. Not at all. Maybe because I've been in
those situations so many times, it doesn't bother me.  
When you won as much as we won you get to appreciate when other people win. So
it's not all about Connecticut all the time. So it wasn't uncomfortable for me
at all.  
As far as the foul part, the only thing more amazing than that, than how we've
committed so few fouls, is how many free throws they've shot against us in the
last three years; that only one team in America gets to shoot free throws
against us. You want to talk about amazing, that's amazing.  
  
Q. It's following up on what Doug was asking you about, winning the ninth
one. Would it be meaningful, though, to do it in this state? I know you said
it doesn't matter, but where Pat Summitt made her name, where you guys have
enjoyed an intense rivalry, too, over the years.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Honest to God, I may have said this when I first got here.
When I found out that the‑‑ when I found out that the Final Four was going to
be in Nashville, I just assumed that if we got this far, if we were fortunate
enough to get this far, that we would have to play Tennessee at some point.  
And I know how disappointed their fans are and their coaches and their
players, obviously. And I'm sure if that had happened, then it would all be
brought out and it would‑‑ all those memories would come back, you know.  
But not now. Not now. It's‑‑ I think Connecticut, Tennessee, Geno, Pat, all
that stuff, that's history. It's great while it lasted, but that's history.  
  
Q. Coach McGraw said playing in the ACC helped make them tournament ‑ready.
Did you get that from the American, and if not, how do you grow‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, we didn't. We got it by beating all those ACC teams.  
  
Q. How do you grow a conference, or do you focus on the nonconference?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Like what I said was we really can't focus on any of that. In
1995‑‑ I don't remember when Notre Dame joined the Big East, but in 1995 we
were undefeated going into the NCAA Tournament. Exactly two teams from the Big
East went to the NCAA Tournament that year. And everybody, all they kept
talking about was you're not tournament ready, not like the SEC teams are, not
like the Pac‑12 teams are. You're not tournament ready.  
I wish I could say there's some truth to that, but I don't know. I don't know
because I've had teams play in the best conference in the country in the Big
East and not get to the Final Four and I've had teams play in the old Big East
where we won every game by 40 and win the National Championship.  
So I don't know. I don't know. If Muffet thinks that helped them, I would
venture to say Muffet played a lot better teams last year in the old Big East
than she did this year. Guarantee it.  
  
Q. Your success has given her a bit of a chip on her shoulder. You just made
two remarks, one about Moriah getting a good education and not a Notre Dame
education, and another, superfluous ‑‑ we use big words too ‑‑ is there some
chip on your shoulder about Connecticut education against the Notre Dame
education?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. No, but you have to understand in recruiting, when we
recruit somebody and the kind of kids that we recruit, it always comes down to
us, Stanford, Duke, Notre Dame. I would say 90 percent of the kids we recruit,
it always comes down to that, and the refrain that we always hear in
recruiting is how could you pass up a world‑class education to go to UConn.  
So I just kind of like to laugh about it. Last time I checked our library, we
have lots of books. And they're all pretty good.  
  
Q. Geno, seems like you've played a role in just about every significant
historical moment this sport's had in the last 20 years. You're going to have
another one tomorrow. And I'm wondering, is there a parallel to be drawn
between what we'll see tomorrow and what happened that night at Gampel against
Tennessee, and do you think this might help in some way take the game another
step?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think whenever you have‑‑ whenever you have the two best
teams in America playing against each other, obviously there's going to be a
lot more interest than their normally would be.  
The fact that it's Notre Dame and Connecticut, I think the women's basketball
fan obviously has an interest in tomorrow night's game; the almost women's
basketball fan will have an interest in the game; those that have not had any
interest may tune in to see what's going on.  
So I think all that is important. All that is good on the way to, I think,
where we want the game to go. There needs to be more rivalries like
Connecticut and Notre Dame. There needs to be more games like Connecticut and
Notre Dame where the intensity level is that high, where you have so many good
players on the floor playing at a real high level.  
And there are more than there have been in the past, but I think people out
there need to see it. And I think it's good that an awful lot of people on a
really big stage are going to get to see it tomorrow night.  
So whether Connecticut wins tomorrow or Notre Dame wins tomorrow, the actual
game itself will‑‑ the actual game of women's basketball come Wednesday
morning will be better off for what happens tomorrow than if it had never
happened. I truly believe that.  
  
Q. Geno, along those lines, was this sort of the perfect storm this year
because you guys didn't play and if you had there wouldn't be two undefeateds
and there is this rivalry? Was it sort of everything came together here for
this potential historic game that could grow the sport and make it more along
the lines of what people are hoping it becomes?  
  
Q. COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think sometimes the women's NCAA Tournament is
kind of predictable, but predictable is not always good. Like tonight our men
are playing Kentucky and it's a No. 7 versus No. 8. The chances of that
happening in women's basketball are probably zero. It's just not going to
happen.  
So the predictable part of it is you know which teams are going to win pretty
much all the time. There's a reason for that. All of our players stay pretty
much four years. I understand that Connecticut wouldn't be here if our players
were able to leave early. Kayla McBride wouldn't be there, Jewell Loyd
wouldn't be there, Stewy wouldn't be here, Bria and Stefanie probably wouldn't
be here.  
The fact that all these guys get to stay for four years allows the absolute
best teams in the country to play each other on the final night. That's what's
best for women's basketball.  
There's a lot of bad games on television. There's a lot of bad men's games on
television, too, don't get me wrong. But I think whenever it is a game on
national television between two great teams and it's going to be played at a
high level, there's nothing that could be better for the sport.  
  
Q. Could you talk about matchups and what are key areas, key player matchups
as you look at this game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, there's absolutely‑‑ I don't think‑‑ there's no matchup
for Kayla McBride and Jewell Loyd. I don't think anybody in the country has
figured out how to guard those two. And I'm not sure we're going to be able to
guard them either. I think we've got to come up with a game plan where we've
got some things they're going to struggle with trying to defend.  
But the two teams are so similar. If somebody were to ask me what's the
biggest downside to playing these guys tomorrow is that we're just too
similar. We do a lot of the same things. That's always not good. I'd rather
play somebody that's completely different than us that looks at what we're
doing and goes: What? What is that?  
But they know exactly what they're doing. We know exactly what they're doing.
So it's really going to come down to if one team shoots 55 percent from the
floor, there's no way the other team is going to win tomorrow unless the other
team gets every offensive rebound like Notre Dame did last night.  
So it's going to come down to just making shots, because I think each team is
going to struggle defensively to stop the other team.  
  
Q. I just sat down, Geno. I don't know if anyone approached you, but do you
feel it's kind of surreal that Immaculata a few minutes ago ‑‑ that whole era,
you were associated with the camps, kids named in the Hall of Fame, and now
you and Muffet, who also was involved, are playing for a championship?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Philadelphia has been at the center of women's basketball
since Immaculata. And I don't know that the city or its products have ever
been away from that. It's been a constant from as long as I can remember.  
And rightly so. I mean, that area of the country produced some of the best
players ever, some of the best coaches ever, some of the best teams ever.  
And finally I'm thrilled that Immaculata is in there. We tend to forget just
the impact that they had. Had they been doing today what they were doing back
then, they would be off the charts.  
So they did it in an era when not too many people are paying attention, but I
think it's important for our history that we go back and celebrate that. And
I'm proud to be from that era and I'm proud to know all those people that were
part of it. I think Muffet and I are part of that.  
  
Q. Geno, Lindsay Allen in this tournament has 24 assists with just four
turnovers. Is there anything you can do to throw her off her game tomorrow
night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. She's had a great year all around. Somebody
asked me recently how come we have so many assists, and I said because every
time you pass the ball, you're passing it to a pretty good player.  
And I wish I could have been Lindsay Allen this year and just come down the
floor and make a decision, should I pass it to Kayla McBride or should I pass
it to Jewell Loyd. I think players that understand their roles and players
that play their roles really, really well are a huge key to having a
championship team.  
And the outside world probably doesn't appreciate it. But I'm sure her
teammates and her coaching staff understand the impact she's had on their
team.  
And we've got a pretty good point guard, pretty good defensively. So we'll
see.  
  
Q. Geno, if they send their guards to the board the way they did last night,
how vulnerable do they become to your fastbreak?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Only if we rebound it. I mean, there's a lot of‑‑ there's a
lot of things you can do to stop a team in transition. The two best are send
everybody back on defense or send everybody to the offensive boards. But those
are both really good.  
Now, one of the things‑‑ it's not bad strategy to do either one. I don't know
which is the best strategy. But one strategy that I know you have to have, and
that's defensive rebounding. If you can't defensive rebound, then you can't
beat Notre Dame in a million years. And that's going to be a huge challenge
for us tomorrow night.  
Everybody's so serious here today. What's going on?  
  
Q. We'll try to make it loose then?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Loosen it up a little, would you?  
  
Q. Two ‑part question. First, could you talk about'95 when you played
Tennessee during the regular season and beating them. What do you remember
about that day? Also, the second part, can you talk about just now from that
day to now what your kids have accomplished here to go from a losing program
to one that can set a record tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That day was one of the‑‑ that day was one of the most amazing
days that I've ever experienced. We had come so close to playing them in the
NCAA Tournament and we always seemed to lose before we got to them early
on,'88,'89. I know ESPN was working really, really hard to try to put together
a Martin Luther King Day game, and they approached us and I was really excited
that somebody would want to do that.  
When we found out that Tennessee was going to be the opponent, it was just
exactly what we needed at that time. We needed to be in that game on national
television, to be tested like that. And for us to win that game and the fan
reaction the way it was and the aftermath of that game, we went ten straight
years until 2004 where we sold out every single game at Gampel Pavilion and XL
Center.  
That's what that game did. And what it also did was give us a platform to go
out and recruit the best players in the country. I think without that
happening, without us winning the National Championship in Minneapolis, we
probably wouldn't have been able to do that.  
At that time, you know, when we won that game and when we won in Minneapolis,
I never imagined that it would come to this. That's a little farfetched to
think that this was in the cards. So to look back now, whenever I see the
numbers and the things that we've done, I kind of just shake my head. I would
hate us, too.  
  
Q. If Muffet is talking, have you succeeded in getting in her head? Isn't
that when people generally talk? Two, isn't there some side of you that kind
of appreciates that when other people are talking trash a little bit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think Muffet's going to win the game tomorrow night. I
don't think I'm going to win it. I don't think I'm going to lose it. I don't
think Muffet's going to lose it. So all that other stuff I think it would be
much more interesting if Kayla McBride and Stewy were going at it, like they
do in the NBA. You don't see in the NBA the coaches saying this, that, the
other thing. It's all the players talking trash.  
And I don't think it's anything like that. I don't think it's anything like
that. I think it's just natural. Like I don't know why everybody thinks it's
like a big deal or that it's like a wow moment, I can't believe that. I just
think it's natural.  
Like when we came along and started beating Tennessee, you know at some point
it was going to get a little chippy. And it did. So you know at some point
when you play Notre Dame enough times and it's not one‑sided anymore. For the
longest time, from 2001 to I don't know when, it was all one‑sided. So, of
course, it was civil. Because it just doesn't have that intensity level yet.
But then once you start playing each other two, three times, four times a
year, it gets pretty intense for lots of reasons. It's only natural. It's only
natural. It will probably‑‑ it will probably die down, now that we're not in
the same conference, now that we probably are only going to play each other
once a year. If you get to the tournament, maybe two.  
But what was happening before, that's just not realistic. That's not normal.
It's not healthy, to be honest with you. I don't think it's healthy. Play
teams four times a year. I don't think they want to do it. We certainly didn't
want to do it. It's just too much.  
  
Q. Coach, just curious, some coaches who have coached men and women will say
I don't ever want to coach that side anymore, I'd rather coach this side. What
has kept you with women's basketball as opposed to dabbling, say, in men's
basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, probably two reasons. One, for the longest time no one
even in women's basketball wanted me. So I got the Connecticut job and I
thought four years from now I want to go to a really good school and win a
National Championship. And nobody wanted me so I'm stuck.  
And then when we got to be really good, there weren't any men's programs
knocking on my door saying I have a great idea, let's hire the women's coach
from Connecticut. That wasn't going to happen.  
I coached my son's AAU team, and we had five DivisionI players on that team,
and I said now I know why I'm not coaching men.  
A lot of things have happened to make me think I've got a pretty good job
where I am.  
What did coaching my son's team tell me about men? They're uncoachable. Don't
get me wrong. It was fun. You don't have to throw nine passes to get a shot.
You just screw up a play, throw it up at the rim, guy catches and dunks and
you go like this. I love that about coaching guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Lili Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26521)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  75  
Stanford - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Stanford we have head coach
VanDerveer and student‑athletes Chiney Ogwumike and Lili Thompson. We'll take
an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer and then questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our team is, I think, really disappointed with how we played
especially in the second half. And I think we really struggled. We turned the
ball over too much in the second half. And we did not do a good enough job
defensively.  
And I credit Connecticut and they played a really good game. And I'm proud to
have coached Chiney for four years and our future great player in Lili
Thompson tonight.  
But, overall, we did say our teammates are very disappointed but we're really
proud of being at the Final Four and representing the Pac‑12\.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about the defensive change that Connecticut made?
You guys obviously were hitting some shots early and then you probably needed
to hit more. Did they do something defensively that was a big change?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: At what point, first half, second half? I think that we just
needed to be aggressive. Anytime Amber penetrated, she found good things. I
think they were giving us penetration and being aggressive as like guards and
spotting up. Obviously there were people in the paint.  
But I don't know if there were many defensive changes besides maybe their
personnel, like having their big lineup with Stokes, Dolson and Stewart. And
that changed things, because it was bigger on our 3s. So it would affect
shots. That was the biggest change. I'm proud how the team was aggressive for
40 minutes tonight.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you just ‑‑ like the North Carolina game, two games in a row,
you had a whole team all over you, from front to back. Could you talk about
how difficult it was to operate?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it's always an honor for a team to focus so much on
me on the inside, and I trusted my teammates. I think like they were the
reason we were competitive in the first half.  
They were aggressive. They were knocking down shots. It's tough for a player
to have one, two, three people, and it's hard for me not to force things. But
Coach reminds me to let the game come to me. I have full trust in my team. I
think we did a great job the first half managing the game and taking timely
shots, and people were aggressive in finishing.  
Things got a little away from us in the second half. Maybe if two things went
our way we could have swayed the momentum. But that's just the way the game
goes sometimes.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you address the impact that Kiah Stokes had in that first
half when she came in? That's when they made their run on you guys.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In the first half? I think she changed things maybe
defensively so they could go big and guard the 3 with the bigger person. I
think that changed our vision offensively, harder to get passes inside and
your shot up if you're being guarded by the 3 in Stewart. I think that
affected the game.  
  
Q. Chiney, I know it's just ended, but can you put your time at Stanford in
perspective?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it's been an amazing run. I'm not even that emotional
about it because I was just trying to have fun today, just have fun, enjoy the
moment, play hard. And that's easy to do when you have a great coach and you
have great teammates that support you every possession. No matter the outcome.  
So my experience at Stanford has been a blessing. I've met so many great
people. I've been pushed. Days like these will make me a better player and
person. Just to have the support in the fan base and family and friends and
teammates, it's been an amazing remarkable experience and I'm just fortunate
to be able to have Stanford on the front of my jersey this one last time.  
  
Q. Lili, you scored ten points right out of the blocks. Stanford was really
playing well with a lot of enthusiasm and adrenalin. Could you describe what
it felt like at that point to have that lead on Connecticut and be playing so
well at that point in the game?  
LILI THOMPSON: We came out very well. And I was just trying to stay focused on
the game and try to continue that. I don't know if so much we kind of‑‑ we
kind of just tried to stick with our game plan and make adjustments as we
went, but it was a very good start. So I'm proud of my team for the way we
played.  
  
Q. Lili, this was your debut at a Final Four. What was it like to have to go
against Connecticut's 40 minutes of ferocious defense?  
LILI THOMPSON: They're a very good team. And defensively they made some very
nice plays. They made it difficult for us. We played against other teams with
very tough defense. So we kind of just tried to stay calm and focus on our
game plan and try to run our offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about, obviously things were working well early. Could
you talk about how difficult it got to run offense, maybe from the point where
they went into that run in the first half and into the second?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think it was‑‑ we knew that probably the biggest
challenge for us would be to score. I thought we worked hard defensively. We
had a lot of good stops.  
But their size, when they went big, their size is really disruptive. But
probably more than anything, I mean they have very skilled players that play
very well together. And they really pass and move the ball and they screen.  
And one of the biggest problems was we didn't get a single free throw the
first half. We did not get to the free‑throw line. And in the first half I
think we made more field goals than they did. But that's a problem.  
Second half I thought we really turned the ball over too much. We really
struggled. Just they got in passing lanes and our pace was not fast enough. We
weren't attacking and being aggressive. And we would have spurts of things,
then they'd come back and we could not sustain any runs.  
  
Q. Tara, now as a fan and great supporter all these years, now that we've
arrived at this dream final with two unbeaten teams, can you talk about the
impact that could have to get the casual fan to tune into the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I hope it's going to be a great game. And maybe that's what
‑‑ there's been a buildup all along through the whole tournament. Maybe that
will get the attention of some people. And I think the tournament here was
great support. There was a great turnout. That won't change, but if that does,
as you say, attract some more of the casual fan, more power to.  
  
Q. The free throws you didn't get, your lack of aggressiveness I suppose,
what was the biggest disappointment from your perspective on your team's
play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think really the inability to run offense. And we knew it
would be challenging, and we had seen other teams. Just some of the unforced
errors and also on defense, total breakdowns where we gave layups and then the
turnovers to Moriah Jefferson. Just things that I thought that we could have
been better at that I thought we could run some offense and get better shots.
I thought we could take care of the ball better.  
I thought we did a good job of getting back in transition, not allowing them
runnout baskets and in the beginning we didn't box out well. We gave them two
offensive boards the first two possessions. As the game went on I thought we
rebounded better.  
But just our pace, their pace was really good. I thought our pace was too
slow. We're not moving, we're not moving the ball. We weren't screening, and
they wouldn't run our offense the way we needed to.  
  
Q. Can you describe ‑‑ in the outset you had ‑‑ seemed like Breanna Stewart
was a little bit out of her sync. What did you do to disrupt her rhythm? And
again Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis was held scoreless. How was it to see her get hot
in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: They're very talented players, and I think different people
on our team worked hard defensively on them. But like you said, like maybe the
first half Kaleena struggled a little bit. She got her rhythm going, and maybe
just took Stokes coming in and helping them relax a little bit.  
But I think their big lineup was disruptive when they went with Stokes and
they moved Stewart to the 3 a little bit. But Dolson was pretty steady in
there. She was very physical. And I just think that one of the things I see
with our team and kind of knew this, but in some ways it takes one thing to
get here, but then to beat Connecticut when you're here, we needed something
else. And we needed to be bigger. We needed to play a bigger lineup. But we
didn't. We weren't able to play people together when we needed to. We tried it
and it didn't look very good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Notre Dame  87  
Maryland - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Notre Dame, Coach Muffet McGraw and Kayla
McBride and Jewell Loyd. We'll start with a comment from Coach McGraw and then
the questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: We thought the game would be won on the boards. I think it was.
To hold them to four offensive rebounds for the game is an amazing
accomplishment.  
When you look at our rebounds everybody had a few. That was our game plan,
everybody had to do their job. Everybody had to do one or two more than they
usually do. We did a great job boxing out, limited their rebounds.  
I thought Kayla McBride got us off to a phenomenal start; put the team on
their back, made shots early and loosened everybody up and everybody else
contributed throughout the rest of the game.  
I was happy with the bench. I thought Markisha Wright, in particular, was
amazing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Did you feel like this was your night; things were going off the
offensive end, you were in the zone that would carry this team to the
championship game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I was trying‑‑ in past games I was pressed a little bit. As a
senior, I felt I had to do too much. But I let this game come to me.  
But it was a team effort all around. I think if you look at what she did,
Jewell, Taya and Maddie. It was everybody. I think I got us out and gave us
that confidence but they took care of the rest.  
  
Q. Kayla, could you talk about what you did to Alyssa offensively and
defensively to take her out of the game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: It was more of an awareness. I think in the first game, we let
her be loose be too comfortable with the things she wanted to do. We kept her
off the glass.  
I think it was a team effort. I think we threw a lot of different things out
her. Jewell was guarding her. Markisha. Different people. And we were trying
to keep her out of her comfort zone.  
  
Q. Kayla, given your history with UConn, isn't there a part of you that
really wants to see them beat Stanford and you guys end up playing the final
game?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I just want to play. I'm just going to take it as being in the
National Championship game, two great teams out there, it's going to be a
battle. And it doesn't matter who it is. It's about this team right here.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Right here.  
  
Q. Jewell, Coach talked about how you stepped up in the rebounding end. You
destroyed them on the board. Never seen a game like that. Offensive rebounds
and overall. Just talk about the effort on the glass on both ends of the
floor?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think it's just our mentality. We wanted the ball. We wanted to
box out. We've been working on that for a while. Great to see that we actually
dug deep and boxed out and a lot of different people stepped up. Our point
guard. Rebounding. It was great to see.  
  
Q. Kayla, you said you would cut somebody else's heart out to win. Was that
the attitude you went into tonight with knowing that you were going to be
ruthless and relentless out there?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think I'm just competitive in general. I love playing for
this team. I love playing for Coach McGraw. And it means so much to me.  
I just want to go out there, play as hard as I can as long as I'm out there.
And I just take it as that.  
I'm just really competitive. I don't think I would necessarily cut anybody.
But I would definitely do a lot of things to win.  
  
Q. All season long it's been one game at a time, one game at a time. Well,
there's only one left. What does it mean to be in the National Championship
again and being undefeated at this point?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: It means a lot. Especially as a senior. I'm just so proud of
this team. I think we've been through a lot of adversity especially after
losing Ace in the Elite Eight. But I think it's this team's mentality.  
I think we're very fearless we have a certain toughness about us, and, I don't
know, I think we're ready for anything. I think we have a great coach who is
more competitive than us. It trickles down. We're going to go in look at the
film and we're going to be ready for the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Okay. We'll take
questions for Coach McGraw. We'll start back with Richard.  
  
Q. When you headed into this game, did you make it an intentional point to
try to get Kayla off early, because clearly, as you said, that really seemed
to impact not only your team but really sort of the flow of the game?  
COACH MCGRAW: Without Ace in the game, we probably ran a few more sets than we
would and tried to get the ball to her early on. When she was playing well, we
continued to give it to her.  
She can create a lot of shots out of our entire offense. I thought she did a
great job on transition, but she was great on ball screen today, too.  
  
Q. What does it mean to get back to the championship game, three times in
four years now. What does it mean to be back here again one win away from
something special?  
COACH MCGRAW: We put ourselves in a great position. I think this team had some
goals early on and it's an amazing accomplishment that we're sitting here
undefeated right now.  
I don't think any of us really thought about that or expected that to happen.
I think we kind of wanted to be here, maybe expected that we could get here.
But the reality of being undefeated and being in the championship game is,
it's quite an accomplishment.  
  
Q. I know as a coach you always find stuff to nitpick, but how close was
tonight's effort to maximizing what you guys can do as a team?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really was pretty close. I don't think we painted our
masterpiece yet. Every game we want to go out and play well.  
We look at the players individually and say if everybody played well on the
same night, imagine how good we would be. We were pretty darned close tonight.  
I thought the turnovers were probably the only exception. We had quite a few
unforced errors. And if you take that away, I think we're getting there.  
  
Q. Coach, wonder if you could talk about the keys to a couple things, the
big rebounding edge and also a shutting down Alyssa for the most part, what
were some of the keys in both those?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, the biggest keys and the thing we've worked on all
week against our practice guys was boxing out, really getting a body on
someone, not worrying about who was going to go get the rebound, just putting
a body, especially on Thomas and making sure she didn't get the rebound.  
Whoever was guarding her, that was their job, to keep her off not to get any
rebounds. And I thought it was such a great team effort. We really worked hard
at that. You could see them. And I think our confidence grew when we saw how
it was working.  
  
Q. Teams go different ways when an impactful player goes out. Was there a
point either before the game, or maybe it's in the first couple of minutes,
when did you know that this team was going to respond the right way to
Natalie's injury?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think I saw it at practice. I saw it the day after,
when we came back Wednesday for practice, I think you could see it in their
eyes. They were determined this was not going to slow them down.  
  
Q. Late in the first half, Taya Reimer had a pass to Kayla on the UCLA cut
after an offensive rebound. Then the next possession she goes to the basket on
a fake screen roll. Seems as if Taya has really acclimated to all the seniors
and playing well. Talk about Taya's development in really playing with the
seniors and with the other players; it seems to have been pretty fast.  
COACH MCGRAW: She really fits well in the Princeton offense. She's perfect for
this offense, because she can read screens. She can move about the ball. She
can read the defense. She sets great screens and she's strong and physical and
she's fast.  
So everything she does, we had worked on the slipping the screen. We worked on
that a couple of days this week and thought we could get her on some of those.  
But she really read it perfectly today. I think she showed a lot today coming
in as a freshman in this big role and played extremely well.  
  
Q. She got off to a little bit of a rocky start; you sat her down for a
second and then all of a sudden looked like she had her feet under her. What
did you tell her at that moment?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think she just needed to breathe. It's a big moment for you,
come into the game, big stage, everybody's watching you. And I think she just
needed to kind of catch her breath, sit down for a minute.  
We thought, after she got one foul we might take her off, because we wanted
her on the floor, didn't want her to get the second one.  
When you get the adrenalin going, you get winded a little bit earlier. I think
it was good for her to just relax a minute, talk again about how we're going
to front, what we're looking for defensively, and keep focusing on the defense
and rebounding.  
  
Q. Did you have any idea that Markisha Wright had a 12 and 9 game within
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: What a great day to bring it out. She really was great. I think
she's been ready all year long. I think for her, this is the moment she's been
looking forward to, the opportunity to get out there and play a little bit
more than she has been. And she really took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Obviously the second game could go either way, but you've been around
this team for a while. What would it mean to have the two undefeated
essentially playing on Tuesday night for a National Championship?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, better than us meeting in the semifinal. That would be
much better.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Notre Dame  87  
Maryland - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Maryland, head coach Brenda Frese and
student‑athletes Lexie Brown and Alyssa Thomas.  
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Frese and then go to the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Obviously the better team won tonight. And I thought Notre
Dame just did a terrific job, really took advantage, especially I thought they
set the tone from the first possession with the offensive rebounding, being
dominant on the glass.  
Obviously we really struggled to be able to have an answer for Loyd and
McBride. And they showed their experience, I thought, throughout this game.  
But like I told the kids in the locker room, you know, we're one of the last
four teams to be able to play. When this tournament started, nobody counted on
us being able to make it to the Final Four, and really when the season ends,
only one team gets to end with a win.  
So couldn't be more proud of the ride that this team took us on to be able to
go to the Final Four. And anything and everything that Alyssa has meant to our
team and our program and to be able to bring her to the Final Four was a dream
come true.  
Obviously we're sad because we wanted to continue on playing for her, but you
couldn't coach a better person with everything that she's meant to our team
and our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the student‑athletes now.  
  
Q. Alyssa, your thoughts on playing your final game. I know it's not the
outcome you wanted, but you accomplished so much in your career up to this
point.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Sad to see it's the last game, it ended like that. I can't be
disappointed. We made it to a Final Four, and I had so much fun this year. I
know we'll get started from this game and we'll be better next year.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what did they do differently in this game to defend you that they
didn't do in that first game that gave you trouble early?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think early foul trouble hindered me a lot. But nothing‑‑
they didn't do anything that they didn't do in the first game.  
  
Q. Lexie, your thoughts to be able to play with Alyssa and with all she's
meant to the program? You've been a point guard most of the year. How has that
been?  
LEXIE BROWN: She made my job really easy playing with a player like Alyssa.
I've never had a teammate who could do it all. And it's been an incredible
season. I'm going to miss her so much. She's one of the most dependable
teammates I've ever played with, and I'm just sad that we couldn't win our
championship. But how far she brought us has been amazing.  
  
Q. Alyssa, the rebounding coming in was a big factor and they were a monster
on the floor, just they were being aggressive. What was the difference out
there with the rebounding factor?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: They just wanted it more. They beat us at our own game and we
just never seemed to get on the boards.  
  
Q. Lexie, when you were facing a 22 ‑point deficit, you guys were able to
come back. You guys were facing a similar situation tonight. What's the
difference between that game and this game that hindered you from getting back
in this game?  
LEXIE BROWN: Like Alyssa said, they just wanted it more. They clearly
remembered what we did to them last time. So they weren't going to take us
lightly the second half. I mean, we were our second half team, and they knew
that.  
They just played harder than us.  
THE MODERATOR: Continue now with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. If you went into the game and knew that you would be outrebounded by the
margin it was, I mean, shock, what's the thought on what happens on that
end?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: You know, it's something that we talked about at length
even with our team. That was something when we played them back in '09, they
set the tone from the beginning with their rebounding.  
So disappointed, obviously, in terms of our lack of response to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Brionna Jones's performance tonight. She had a great
game.  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: She was huge. I thought she was really poised and she
didn't play like a freshman. She played like she's been to the Final Four.
Gave us a tremendous inside post presence.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they might have done differently defensively on
Alyssa?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: I thought they were key really in terms of every time she
got by a line of help there was another layer. So they were constantly sending
waves of people. When she would get through one, there would be another one
there waiting for her.  
  
Q. Brenda, did Alyssa's foul trouble impede not only her minutes but do you
think it impeded her style of play and her aggressiveness a little bit as
well?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know when that happened to Alyssa, at times she
has to pull back because she knows she wants to be on the floor. So definitely
it was difficult.  
But I thought that the chess match going on from rotations on their end and
our end we were never able quite able to make that difference. When they went
small, we weren't able to make that small from the rebounding end.  
  
Q. Brenda, what makes Kayla McBride such a difficult matchup?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Her IQ. Obviously she can score the basketball. Her
ability‑‑ she gets a clean look; it's going in. But in game, watching her
attack our guards, every time she knew when A.T. had two fouls and she went
right at A.T., when another guard got two fouls she went right at that guard.  
So just watching her in‑game IQ. I probably didn't appreciate it as much as I
saw it in games in terms of she's got a high level in terms of understanding
the game.  
  
Q. Brenda, you mentioned this team has Final Four potential from the
beginning of the season. It took a little bit longer to kind of get to the
level you wanted this team to play. But seeing that they kind of got to that
level, that finally got to the level you wanted them to play at and they got
this experience, how do you think that kind of ‑‑ how do you carry that into
the next season?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Well, obviously when you get to have that kind of
experience, when you make the run that we did, Sweet 16, Elite Eight and to be
able to play on the biggest stage, it can do nothing but help your returners.  
And so when you look at the nucleus of who we have returning and our three
freshmen and the presence they've been able to have and the depth we've been
able to have this season, definitely that experience factor is key.  
Just like Notre Dame's been to the Final Four four times, you can't substitute
for that kind of experience.  
  
Q. Did you say anything special to A.T. in the locker room in postgame? And
I know you didn't want to think about life without A.T., but obviously that's
the next step. When does that phase kind of start moving forward?  
COACH BRENDA FRESE: Geez, can't you just give me a couple minutes? You know,
both taking her off the court and in the locker room with her and our five
seniors, I thanked her. She was a dream come true to be able to coach.  
And she left every single thing that she possibly could on the floor. So,
yeah, it's too early to be able to think about life after her. But I am
encouraged by the great minutes that our team was able to get this year. When
you talk about our underclassmen and the depth that we were able to develop.  
So you become different. You become different in terms of you're encouraged by
the presence that we got from Bri tonight, Lexie, Laurin, Shatori, there's a
lot of great things for us as a team to be able to look forward to and it will
just be a different style of play in terms of how we move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach Frese? Okay. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

### [Breanna Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25344)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

UConn  75  
Stanford - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut head is coach Geno
Auriemma and student‑athletes Breanna Stewart and Bria Hartley.  
We'll take a brief statement from Coach Auriemma and then go to questions for
the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. I think the game played out at least in the first
half how I thought it would play out. We knew it would be a little bit of a
struggle. It's hard to make shots‑‑ unless you're Kayla McBride‑‑ it's hard to
make shots at the Final Four.  
Once we got settled in and got our rhythm, I thought we played one of the best
games that we played all year, given the fact that we beat a really, really
good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Breanna, talk about the first ten minutes of the first half and did you
guys feel like you needed to settle in?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think at times we were a little jumpy, getting too excited.
And we had to settle down and get into the right rhythm of the game. Once we
did that, it seemed like we went on a run to end the first half and shots
started falling.  
  
Q. Bria, what does it say about the state of basketball and the state of
Connecticut that your men's team will be playing for the title tomorrow night
and you'll be playing for it Tuesday night? And what does it say to see Team
Kevin and Team Geno playing for it all?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it's awesome. I know our men are really excited for us
and rooting us on. We're doing the same thing for them. I think all the fans
in Connecticut are really proud right now and both teams have worked really
hard all year and through the preseason preparing for this moment. So it's now
the time has come when we make sure we finish on a good note.  
  
Q. Bria, did something change defensively at any point in the first half
when you went on your run but you suddenly were making it really hard for them
to score?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think we just picked up the pressure on our defense, really
getting into passing lanes. I thought Moriah did a good job, got a few steals
out there. One steal that Stewy got was awesome. It changed the momentum of
the game.  
That's what our defense does when we go out there and we make it tough for
them to score and we're able to create offense off of that. It really helps
our offense and we're able to play a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Geno, how big of a difference did bringing Kiah into the game make in
your defense in particular?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When we went with the bigger lineup, we have a few more
options defensively that we can do. It allowed us to move Stewy onto a shooter
and get some length out there. Kiah has been a real good defensive player and
a shot blocker, and we trust her now. We didn't in the past. But we do and
we're not afraid to put her out there in big moments. That's the best game
she's ever played, I think, since she came to Connecticut.  
  
Q. Wanted to get you to respond to the question about seeing your men and
seeing your team get to it undefeated, and was Bria or Breanna a Team Geno
draft pick?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, unfortunately when we did that, that Midnight Madness
thing, we didn't get to pick our teams. So I was just assigned a team. And I
thought I had it made. I had Shabazz, DeAndre Daniels. So I thought there's no
way we could lose. And we're down like 20 at halftime. Finally told them, I
said that's one reason why I don't coach guys, you guys just don't listen. And
then Shabazz scored like 30 straight. We won at the end.  
So you could see these guys that are playing for Kevin, you can just feel it,
the energy that they play with, that they get from Kevin.  
They just have so much confidence in each other. It's quite remarkable. I
don't even know what words you could use to describe that. For the second time
in 10 years we've got two of our teams playing for the National Championship.  
It really is‑‑ you don't want to say it like it's incredible, because we've
done it before. But just the fact that it's happening for a guy that's been a
head coach for two years, that's pretty remarkable. That's pretty remarkable.  
Somebody told me that no one who has never won at least a regional has ever
won a National Championship.  
But they're coached by a guy who played 13 years in the NBA all on one‑year
contracts. I would bet on Kevin. Not that I'm allowed to bet, because this is
the NCAA.  
  
Q. Thanks for clearing that up.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Absolutely.  
  
Q. You've seen a lot of things in women's basketball, including with your
own team, but 39 ‑0 versus 37‑0 is a unique place for this sport. Can you step
away obviously from the fact that you're coaching one of the teams and sort
of, do you recognize that this is a pretty historic thing coming up on
Tuesday?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it was almost‑‑ it looked to me like, as the season went
on, it almost looked like it was inevitable, you know. Like it was supposed to
happen.  
And our sport probably doesn't have enough significant moments, you know. I
don't know that we have the kind of moments that happen last night at the
men's Final Four where you get a 7 and 8 seed playing for the National
Championship. I don't think we have enough of those moments in our game.  
So to have the spotlight on Tuesday on two teams that one of them is going to
lose for the first time this year, and it's pretty remarkable when you think
about how hard that is to do for one team, much less two.  
And they're far and away the best team that I've seen this year. Far and away.
No one else is even close of any team that we've played or that I've seen play
on film. No one else is even close.  
  
Q. Geno, can you talk a little bit about Bonnie Samuelson? She was 1 from 7
from the field. I believe they were all from beyond the arc. And she was
shooting 46.7 percent through the first four tournament games. And they're a
team that typically tends to shoot a lot of 3s. Can you talk about what
emphasis you placed on defending the 3 ‑point line and how you went about
doing that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We knew that. We knew they were going to shoot a lot of them.
They took 25 of them. Our goal was not to let them take 25. They made 10
against North Carolina, I think. They made 10.  
That's 30 of their points. And tonight they made six. They banked two of them
in. That's the kind of stuff that happens at the Final Four. But we can do
things that other teams can't do. We can play Chiney one‑on‑one. We don't have
to worry about doubling down there leaving 3‑point shooters open.  
We can switch some screens that maybe other teams can't because they don't
have our size or our versatility.  
So Bonnie's a great shooter. I've seen her make that one shot she made when
Stewy got up in the air she went by her. That's the kind of stuff she can do.  
Their whole team can make seven, eight, nine, ten in a row. So that was part
of the game plan. Doesn't matter how many 2s they get. But we gotta limit the
3s and the free throws. I thought we did a great job of both of those things.  
  
Q. Geno, speaking of 3 ‑point shooting, for about the last week or so you
guys haven't shot at the clip that you're accustomed to. How have you guys had
to adjust and modify what you're doing to account for the fact you're not
hitting as many shots from the outside as you normally do?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's not a lot of adjustments you can make when you're not
making shots. At one point I think Stanford had all five of their players
inside the lane and just daring us to make a shot.  
As I said, it's contagious. You're not going to believe this but yesterday at
practice here and today at shootaround, we made every shot to the point where
I'm like, yeah, I like this. And then couldn't make anything in the first
half.  
I've always said if you play great defense, you put yourself in a position to
win a game. And then however good your offense is, that will depend on what
the spread is.  
If your offense is great that night, you can win by a lot. But if your offense
isn't great that night, you can still win if you play great defense. And we
managed to do that this entire season.  
  
Q. Geno, although it's led to this dream Final, both you and Notre Dame have
not only gone undefeated, you've overwhelmed virtually everybody you've
played. Is it good that two teams have separated themselves so thoroughly from
the rest of the country to make it seem like it's really been a two ‑team
season all along?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's good once in a while. I think it's good. I don't
know that I would want a steady diet of that every year. But I think once in a
while it's good. Draws a lot of attention to the game. An awful lot of people
might tune in Tuesday night that wouldn't normally maybe tune in.  
I think it's okay. I know that there was more‑‑ it was much more competitive
beyond those two.  
Like if you took those two off the boards, everything else was really, really
competitive this year. It's a work in progress. I don't think we're there yet.  
  
Q. Why have you two separated yourselves so thoroughly from ‑‑ what do you
think it is about these two teams that has allowed each of you to separate,
this season, to separate you so thoroughly from everybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we had everybody coming back from last year's team
except Kelly Faris and Caroline Doty, two kids that played a lot. And Kelly
was the backbone of our defense and was unbelievable.  
But the core of our team was back. So that obviously was a huge benefit.  
And the same for Notre Dame. They lost a great player in Skylar Diggins. But
what they had coming back was a great team. The way both teams have managed to
make the necessary adjustments throughout the season.  
I'm not surprised. We are the two best passing teams in the country. I think
we pass it great, and I think they pass it great. I think we're the two best
passing teams in America. And that's something that a lot of teams can't do,
they can't pass.  
So when you pass the ball really well and you have a lot of really good
players on the floor, you end up kind of having a dominant team.  
  
Q. You hit on this a little bit, but you mentioned that they were far and
away the best team when you looked at them on film. Can you be specific? Is it
when you look at them on film, is it just a question of talent? Or is it the
execution that the talent that you see performed is at a higher level than
anybody else?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think talent is always the answer. Except they have
two First‑Team All‑Americans that are as good as any two players in the
country, individually and collectively. There's not too many players better
than those two. And they're so aggressive, and they have such a scoring
mentality.  
And when they run their stuff, they really run it. They execute as well as
anybody in the country. They probably attack the basket as well if not better
than anybody I've seen.  
When Kayla McBride gets the ball, when she gets to half court, you better put
three people around the basket and hope because at some point she's going to
get there and she's going to score or get fouled. And Jewell Loyd is the same
way. So when you play with that kind of aggressive mentality and you're that
talented, you look like a great team, which is what they are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Stanford student‑athletes Chiney
Ogwumike, Mikaela Ruef, and Lili Thompson and head coach Tara Van Derveer.
We'll take an opening statement from Coach Van Derveer and then questions for
the student‑athletes.  
COACH VAN DERVEER: We're excited to be here. We've worked hard. I think our
team has really improved throughout the season, and we're looking forward to
playing UConn tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. Start with Michel.  
  
Q. Chiney, what has to be different against Connecticut this time than in
November?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think since November we're a different team. We know our
offense better. We know each other better. So, honestly, I'm just looking at
it like we just have to play Stanford basketball, the basketball we've been
playing throughout the NCAA Tournament and just being confident. Just going in
there and just playing a game.  
You're just playing the next opponent. Don't think of anything bigger. It's a
basketball game. Just take it smart. Know our game plan and just be confident
and play together. That's all I'm thinking about right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right over here, the aisle.  
  
Q. Mikaela, I would assume that your team is probably pretty loose at this
point. And is that exemplified by the fact that you folks did a line dance at
the end of practice today?  
MIKAELA RUEF: Yeah. Our team, we're loose coming into the Final Four. I think
that's the best way for us to play. We came out a little tight against North
Carolina, and that didn't go so well at first.  
But once we loosened up and started having fun, we started to play better. So
that's what we're trying to do on this trip.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. We'll come up here first.  
  
Q. Chiney, if you would just talk about the way teams have tried to defend
you this year. You've been able to back them down when they played behind you,
you've been able to field them when they come in front. I'm sure you'll see
double team zones. What do you expect UConn to play and talk about the
defenses that you've faced?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Coach Tara did a good job of reminding me every game that I'm
probably going to have two or three people on me, so I should just trust my
teammates, which I always do. And I've seen a lot of defenses. We've seen
zones that try to take away the paint and then we can double team.  
It's not necessarily what they do. It's just making sure I make‑‑ lead the
defense and make the right play. If they double team me, that means someone on
the outside is open and we just have to find a shooter and get a good shot on
the play. So we're just trying to take it as it comes.  
And it's a 40‑minute game. If I can get down the court early, I'll be
one‑on‑one for a while and take advantage of that. Other little things like
that are what I try to stick to.  
THE MODERATOR: Question down on the front.  
  
Q. Any of the three athletes, can you talk about this chance of getting
UConn again? They're undefeated and for them to talk of you all being extras,
the JV team. But when you think about this chance and how different you are as
a team, what's the confidence level like right now for you all?  
THE MODERATOR: Chiney you want to take that?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Surely. I think we're just trying to focus on this game.
We've done it all season long, one game at a time. We're not intimidated.
We're excited.  
We just want to play our game. I think no matter the outcome, if we play
Stanford basketball, we'll be happy. But, granted, we'll be happier if we win,
obviously, and that's what we're working towards.  
So I think we just‑‑ we're different. We're improved, and we're confident and
we're going to play together and play tough. That's why I think we're loose
right now because we know what we can do and we're confident in each other's
abilities.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Chiney, having played UConn a number of times during your career,
specifically what is different about them as an opponent versus other
opponents?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Do you mean by this year or what's different about‑‑ in
general? They're very well‑coached. They play together. They're very
unselfish. Usually the person with the open‑‑ the open person gets the shot.
That's the way Coach Tara teaches us. The open person gets the shot.  
They're very dangerous because they're a very talented team. So I think this
year in particular they've really weathered the storm. I know they've had a
short bench, and it's very impressive to have their run. But at the end of the
day, whoever sides out there for us, whoever sides out for them, we're not
going to hold anything back.  
  
Q. Chiney, this is kind of an offshoot of that question, but do you see any
weaknesses in UConn?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Maybe Coach does. I think that will be a better question for
Coach. I just listen to what her game plan is and we try to go and execute it.
They're a very great team, and we just try to do what we're supposed to do out
there based on Coach's game plan.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Lili, your development has been one of the big reasons that this team got
this far this year. What was that like for you the first, second games of the
season when you played at UConn? I don't even know how much you played them
that game. But could you describe a little bit about what your emotions were
playing such a lauded team so early in your career?  
LILI THOMPSON: It was the second game. And I think for all the freshmen, we're
just coming into the team and haven't played in front of a crowd that large.
And so of course there were some jitters and nerves and just overall not
having the experience.  
But in the 30 games or so since then, we've all improved as a team and settled
into what we do. So it's a completely different atmosphere.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over here on the right.  
  
Q. For both Lili and Mikaela, for both of you guys. How important is it to
not be intimidated by UConn? They get so much hype, and you guys have had
success against them as a program. How important is it to go in believing you
can beat a team like UConn?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I think obviously the most important thing is to believe that
you can win. We wouldn't be here if we didn't believe we could win. We would
have just stayed home. We're confident going into the game. You have to be
confident, otherwise you don't have a chance.  
LILI THOMPSON: I feel the same way. I think that it's the same with any
opponent. You get a game plan and you get your confidence going and you go
play the game. The opponent matters for the Xs and Os, but not for your
confidence level.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Mikaela, I'm going to sneak in two here real quick. Talk about your 3
‑point shooting the other night against North Carolina and where that came
from. Is that now a part of your arsenal? And then secondly, if you could talk
about Chiney in terms of the way she steals opponents down on the block and
how well she receives those passes coming in.   
MIKAELA RUEF: I have to say that my 3‑point shooting, it was thanks a lot in
part to Chiney because my person was guarding her as I had the ball. So I
figured why not shoot it. And it went in. When it goes in, I feel like I could
shoot it again and Coach won't be so mad.  
At this point in the season, any game could be our last. So why not have it in
my arsenal now?  
And then with Chiney catching my passes inside, or any of our passes inside,
you can literally just throw it in her vicinity and she'll jump up and catch
it. If she can't catch it, she'll try her hardest to catch it.  
And then on top of that, after she catches the ball, she goes out of her way
to try and go up right away so she can give you an assist, which I think is
something special in a person, that she's trying to help you out with your
stats. You're like just score, it's fine. She's like, no, you made a great
pass; I want you to get something good for it.  
THE MODERATOR: Question in the back.  
  
Q. First for Mikaela and Lili and Chiney can chime in. Coming up short
within the Pac ‑12 Tournament for the first time in eight years, how much did
that motivate you guys even more? Or was it already built in once this
tournament started. How did Pac‑12 semifinals kind of lead you towards this
run to Nashville?   
MIKAELA RUEF: I think the number one thing it did was it kind of just woke us
up. Like we were kind of playing in a daze a little bit, and we were getting
by in games, but we weren't playing the way we should be playing. And I think
losing there really like gave us a sense that our next loss is our last game
of the season. And I think it really put a sense of urgency into everyone on
the team to improve on what we could improve on in the two weeks we had from
the loss to the beginning of the NCAA Tournament.  
And I think our team took great advantage of the time that we had and we
really did improve in what we could.  
THE MODERATOR: One last question down here for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chiney, looking at some of the recent teams, not just you guys, but
overall Stanford has done well. When you think of Andrew Luck, people like
that, is it a cliche or is there something cute, kind of likable, nerdy,
articulate thing? Is that a forced reference or do you think there's something
there? Also being all these teams lately kicking butt on the court, too?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I love that aspect. I think that Stanford overall grooms you
to be ready for life after. And I think I'm experiencing that right now. And
when people ask us what's the great thing about Stanford, it's the people,
people like Coach Tara, people like Bernard Muir, the AD, people like
President Hennessey. We just have great support staff that really give you the
confidence to be who you are and discover who you are. And you feel more
confident as a person so when you're confident as a person, you can go out
there and you know football or basketball comes easy.  
I think just being able to go to Stanford University has been a huge blessing
for all of us. We all have different stories, but at the end of the day, we
all love each other, as people come first. So we're willing to do anything on
the court. That's like the easy part.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Thank you, ladies. You can go back to your locker
room. They'll be available until 4:30.  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Good job, Lili. That was your best press conference.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start taking questions for Coach. In the back there.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Chiney. What weaknesses, if any, do you see in
UConn?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Well, they aren't as deep as they were when we first played
them. They've had‑‑ they lost a player. They hurt us actually when we played.  
I think that they have four All‑Americans on their front line and they have an
excellent point guard. So I wouldn't say that there's any glaring weaknesses.
Have a Hall of Fame coach who does a great job for his team.  
And I think obviously they're a confident team. They're defending national
champions, and we'll have to play very well to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right here.  
  
Q. Tara, I know that a lot of times you love to game plan in X and O's, and
that's your thing. With this particular team that you just mentioned, without
any glaring weaknesses, has it been more of a nightmare to try to figure
something out, or has there been any pleasure in it?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, I like the challenge of kind of thinking about
what we want to do and being here and having the opportunity to play
Connecticut and actually having played so many great teams to get here
throughout the whole season. Really, it's so exciting to think, well, these
are the shots we're trying to get, these are the shots we have to limit that
they get. And then to come out and see, can we do it.  
And we will have to really execute a game plan for 40 minutes to be
successful, because they are that good.  
THE MODERATOR: Question from Richard.  
  
Q. Tara, along the same lines of game planning. Breanna Stewart is such a
unique player with her size and length and ability to score inside and
outside. When you look at her on film, how do you try to attack her
effectively?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: I think that she does have what you said. But it's who all
she plays with. By herself out there, she would be another 6'4" kid with some
versatility. But we played against some of that. But she plays with Dolson who
allows her to play 4. She plays with Lewis who forces you to spread the floor.
Or she plays with Jefferson who gets steals and creates for her.  
So she's a very talented player. But the story of Connecticut is not just one
player. That was evidenced by four All‑Americans. They have the most talented
team in the country. When you're playing with other really talented players as
LeBron James wanted to, as Michael Jordan did, when you're around other
players, in some ways there's less pressure on you and there's this synergy,
and it makes life easier.  
So she's very, very good. And she brings a great dimension to their team. But
they are clearly not a one‑person team. That's why they repeatedly win.  
  
Q. Tara, you and Coach Auriemma both have been around the women's game for a
long time. You're both very blunt spoken in some ways. You have gone up
against him numerous times in recruiting battles, I suppose. How would you
describe your relationship with him? Has it always been ‑‑ I mean, just
personally, has it been rocky at times, or as just mutual respect? Have you
really butted heads with him?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Not that I can remember at all. I totally respect the job
that he‑‑ he went to Connecticut the same year I went to Stanford. And so we
have been at the Final Four. Sometimes we didn't play each other going to the
Final Four. But Geno's done just a great job. We've kind of walked the same
path with coaching the Olympic team.  
He's just done a fabulous team with his teams. I respect the job. I learn from
him. I think he's very funny. And I won't say‑‑ I'm on the West Coast, he's on
the East Coast, but I feel very confident. I have him in my cell phone, his
number, and I can call him at any time or text with him.  
I consider him a friend. We don't really recruit that much against each other
just because of the different‑‑ maybe the different kids that we're looking
at, but everything that I know about it has been always professional.  
  
Q. Have you discussed Chiney's evolution as a player? Is this the first year
she's had an reliable mid range jumper, coming in earlier?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Chiney as a player, it's fun to actually think about her
journey. And I might get in trouble for this little story, but I am the oldest
of four girls and one boy. But Chiney‑‑ and Neka is oldest, and basically I
bonded Neka and recruited Neka. Then Chiney came to Stanford, and I was closer
to Neka. And my assistant coach Amy Tucker was close to Chiney. And Amy would
say, Chiney is pretty good, too.  
But Amy at first said to Chiney, wow, how hard of a life would that be to
follow Neka? And obviously Chiney has done pretty well. But Chiney, when she
started at Stanford, she was to rebound and play defense and keep Neka out of
foul trouble and rebound Neka's shots.  
When Neka graduated, basically we ran plays for Chiney that went into Cheney.
It was Chiney. She was working on her outside shot all that time. She has a
3‑point shot. She might bust that out here. But she really has a great
perimeter shot. We need her to play closer to the basket, but if we need to
move her out, we'll see that.  
I think she's had it, really since her sophomore year. She was working on it.
She works in the off season. She had it last year but we wouldn't let her take
it. Now it's more if we play against some better rebounders, then she can move
outside a little bit more.  
THE MODERATOR: Question on the right.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the evolution of the other players on the team
around Chiney this year and how far they've come from way back at the
beginning of the season to get you to this point?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: I think this might be the most improved team, one of the
most improved teams I've ever coached, in that when we went to Italy early, we
had five freshmen. And a lot of it was kind of kind of looking at people,
putting people in the mix. We start a whole different lineup than we did in
November.  
We're playing different people. Lili has pretty much‑‑ she owns the 2‑guard
spot. Amber owns the 1‑guard spot. Our 3 is in flux a lot. We start with Sara
James, but we play Bonnie, we play Taylor. We could actually play Chiney at
our 3.  
Mikaela Ruef has improved tremendously. For the players that have followed us
as she was a freshman, she would go into the game and turn the ball over so
many times and so fast, it would be like we could only play her one minute.  
She has been one of the most improved players that we've ever had at Stanford.
And she came back to Stanford this year without a scholarship, and she has
made just incredible strides this year, her shooting, her passing, her
defense. And I mean, just even her ability to sit up here and do such a great
job at the press conference, she's improved in that too.  
THE MODERATOR: Couple of questions down here.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Chiney in her ability to defend the post. Is she one
of the best maybe that you've seen at that? And what defense do you think
UConn will play against her based on that first meeting?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: Well, we've had some great, great post player's. Jayne
Appel, fabulous low block player. And Neka. I don't know that comparing would
be good.  
But Chiney can score one‑on‑one pretty much against anybody. If they're really
big, then she'll bring them away and hit her high post shot.  
I think she'll do what she said. She'll read the defense and just kind of get
what the defense‑‑ take what the defense gives her.  
  
Q. Seems like every Final Four team, especially on the women's side, always
has a big star, and you're no exception. But I'm wondering, the relative value
of the supporting cast, when you get to this level as opposed to the regular
season, maybe, does it change in how ‑‑ how do they compare in the Final Four
to the regular season, maybe?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, like you said, to get here, you've gotta have
probably a great leader. We do with Chiney. But we cannot be Chiney and the
Chiney‑ettes. We know that we have to have a great play from all of our four
other people that are out there on the court with her.  
What I'm excited about is the fact that we have five people in double figures
through the NCAA Tournament. Amber has really stepped up her game and is
really doing a great job at the point. Lili, Mikaela Ruef. Bonnie Samuelson.
We can probably play seven or eight people, bring in Karlie Samuelson, Erica
McCall, and Taylor Greenfield.  
  
Q. When players read that most people are picking UConn or that UConn is
locked to win, is that just outside noise, or can you and your coaching staff
actually use that as motivation? How does that sort of work really inside the
locker room?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, I think that there's‑‑ Connecticut and Notre Dame
have earned the right to be No. 1 seeds. I think the media has kind of put
them in the championship game to make it some Cinderella ball, wouldn't it be
great to see these two undefeated teams?  
But myself and Brenda Frese, us and Maryland, we're here. If we're going to be
someone's hors d'oeuvres, we're not going to get swallowed easily. We are
going to work really hard to play the best game that we can. We definitely
talk about it.  
And for us, you might think sometimes it's good because there's a lot of times
where we are clearly the top dog, and we're supposed to win.  
We didn't win the Pac‑12 tournament. And I remind our team that. I said, you
know, No. 1 seed didn't do us any good there. So I'm definitely kind of a
little bit of a smack talker in the locker room with our team. And I just kind
of‑‑ I think if our team has had a little bit of a chip on our shoulder, then
I've carried it, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Question right there.  
  
Q. When you beat Connecticut in the semifinals in 2008, I think you shot
about 100 percent from the free ‑throw line. That was a big upset. Would this
be an infinitely bigger upset given how overpowering they've been all
season?  
COACH VAN DERVEER: You know, they had a great team in 2008. Think of the
players that were on that team. Tina Charles. Maya Moore. Charde Houston. Just
to name a couple that are pros. I think that that kind of game, I remind our
team of that game.  
They have a very talented team this year. But we just have to play well. So
we're not‑‑ I don't think we're‑‑ we're not caught up in‑‑ our kids haven't
paid attention to what UConn's done since we played them.  
We're out there. They don't watch them on television. They're not shaking in
their boots. They're excited. And I want them to be excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach Van Derveer? Okay. Thank you very
much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2014

  

### [Jewell Lloyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25261)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Notre Dame, Head Coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Jewell Lloyd and Kayla McBride. Questions for the
student‑athletes, raise your hand for a mic and state your name and
affiliation and address the student‑athlete. And we'll begin with questions
now. Start right here.  
  
Q. Kayla, what's your team's mindset right now that you're at the Final
Four?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think right now, we kind of took it all in after the game,
but it was right back to business the next day. We knew we had a great team in
Maryland and we're just trying to focus on how we're going to win those 40
minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to take questions for the student‑athletes first.  
  
Q. Kayla, then. Wonder if you could talk about the experience of making four
consecutive Final Fours and then how much would it mean to kind of break
through and win it here if you get that chance in the last one?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think it says a lot about this program, Coach McGraw and the
coaching staff and being able to get to four Final Fours. I know me and the
seniors are excited to be here. Your senior year you want to take it all in
and have a lot of fun and that's my mindset, is just taking it all in and
trying to win the whole thing. Obviously I want to win the national
championship. I am just trying to focus on playing 40 minutes of basketball.  
  
Q. Kayla, that first game against Maryland, what did you do that you liked,
what do you think you need to change, and how do you do that?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I think Maryland's a great physical rebounding team. I think
that that's their biggest strength, how they crash the glass. Alyssa Thomas is
a great player, All‑American. So how we're going to contain her and be able to
contain their transition game and their rebounding game.  
I liked how we moved the ball. I think we kind of got open looks, got easy
layups, especially in the first half, which got us in a big lead, then we
started to settle down and closed the gap. I think it's just it's running our
offense and executing our game plan and also defense and rebounding.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about, now that you've been to one Final Four
already, what's more helpful to you and is it more of a help on the court or
off the court dealing with ‑‑ knowing what the Final Four experience is
like?  
JEWELL LLOYD: It's definitely easy to get distracted with everything here with
the media, different town. But I think as a team, we do a good job making sure
our mindset's focused on the game. That's what we're worried about is the
game. Coming into practice I'm worried about the details, stuff like that.  
I think our team does a really good job making sure we're focused for the game
ahead.  
  
Q. Jewell, they came back on you, made a pretty exciting game when you
played at their place. Do you think that helps you guys that it wasn't an easy
20 ‑point win, that you had to battle and have shots at the end to sort of win
the game?  
JEWELL LLOYD: Definitely. I think it helps us. I think we came together at
times and we kept our poise and it helps because down the stretch, Final Four
is crucial games, crucial moments. You need to stay together and use this as
something in our back pockets for this game coming up.  
  
Q. Jewell, I wonder if you could talk about the challenge, of course, of
Natalie going down just a few days ago and kind of changing the lineup and the
chemistry and how you guys think you'll adjust to that in the Final Four.  
JEWELL LLOYD: I don't think it's necessarily a challenge. It's time for other
people to step up. We have all the confidence in them they will. And how we
prepare for games and we don't depend on one person; it's a whole team effort.
And Coach has done a great job of making sure we're prepared for that.  
  
Q. Kayla, what words of advice could you maybe give Taya Reimer this weeks
as she prepares to take on a larger role?  
KAYLA MCBRIDE: I don't want Taya to put too much pressure on herself. I don't
want her to come in until she has to. We talked about it being a collective
effort. I think everybody has to do more, myself included, Jewell. We have to
do one more thing to assure that everybody is going to get Ace. I don't want
to put a lot of pressure on her. I just want her to play the game and have fun
like she has been all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes. We'll dismiss the
student‑athletes. They'll be in the locker room. Before they go I wanted to
introduce the Notre Dame sports information director Chris Masters. If you had
anything further that you need, this is Chris. Thank you. And we'll take
questions now for Coach McGraw and we'll start right here.  
  
Q. You said on the teleconference that Jewell had even exceeded your
expectations. Given how remarkable a player she was coming out of high school,
what a freshman year she had, expectations would have been pretty high anyway.
In what ways did she exceed your expectations?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think how she played in the big moments. She got her career
high against Baylor as a freshman. It ws the number one team in the nation.
She was very consistent for a freshman. I think you expect that a freshman's
going to be a little up and down, they're going to have a learning curve. At
some point in the season, maybe question some of their own ability.  
She just never did that. I think she was just so steady all season long. And
then this year to come in and really elevate her game, she's playing like a
seasoned veteran.  
She's aggressive, looking for her shot. She knows how important she is to the
team and she's really stepped her game up.  
  
Q. Her demeanor, she was the most professional college freshman I've ever
seen. Her demeanor is so unflappable. Do you think that's where the
consistency comes from?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it does. I think she has a deep faith and I think that
keeps her going and it keeps her steady.  
And she has really, really gained a lot of confidence this year, too.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could, could you talk about what the
rebounding will ‑‑ in the specific matchup against Maryland?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's our biggest challenge. I think it's the key to the game for
us is rebounding. They're a great rebounding team. They've got so much size
inside. They're physical. They're skilled. And for us losing our leading
rebounder creates a little bit of a problem in that area.  
So we're really hoping that everybody does a little bit more. If everybody
just gets one or two more rebounds, we're trying to make up for what Natalie
would have given us.  
  
Q. As you consider how to replace Natalie in the lineup with which person,
what were some of the considerations that you took into effect in making that
decision?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's a pretty easy decision. Taya started for us at the
beginning of the year when Natalie was out. Natalie missed our first three
games. Taya was a starter. She played very well. She's similar to Ace in what
she can do at both ends of the floor. She helps us in the press. She handles
the ball. She's a good passer. She does so many things that we really need in
our offense. She's very good in the Princeton offense. So I think it was a
pretty easy decision to go with Tay.  
  
Q. Coach, when you had that stretch early in the season without Ace how did
that help you and did that prepare you for Natalie's fate?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really did. It was so early in the year, but to see a
freshman come in immediately in the starting role, at that point we're
starting two freshmen. So to see their maturity at that stage, I thought, was
really, really beneficial to them for the rest of the year.  
Tay has been in every big game. She comes in pretty quickly off the bench. So
she's had a lot of minutes. We've had some times with Natalie in foul trouble
that she's had to go a little bit longer. So I think we definitely have played
a lot of minutes with Taya in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, how much does experience play in a role here? You've been here
four straight years. Maryland, the first time sincethey won the title in '06.
None of the players have been here. You've been through this. Is it going to
make a difference that you guys have been here before and if it is, what's the
biggest thing that is outside of the basketball game that Maryland has to deal
with?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the distractions. I think that's the biggest thing you
have to deal with is so many distractions, so many people, the fans. You
really can't get out of the hotel without running into people.  
And I think for us, you know, it's more of a business trip. And we're enjoying
it and I think we've enjoyed all the moments that we've had this year, but I
think there's so many distractions today especially with the open practice,
autograph signings and all those things, that you need to make sure you're
focused on the task at hand.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of experience with replacing players and continuing to
have success with Skylar last year being the most recent one. Natalie is the
big story now. Anytime you go through that transitioning process, what's the
key to continuing to have a good program as opposed to just relying on one
specific player?  
COACH MCGRAW: We have really good players. Tay Reimer is McDonald's
All‑American, so it's a role she's comfortable being thrown into. And I think
giving them confidence, I think that's the coaching staff's job to give them
the confidence they need to go out and do it on the floor.  
We believe in them. And their teammates believe in them. And hopefully that
will kind of get rid of the jitters for them.  
  
Q. Coach, same thing I asked Kayla before. That first game I remember at
Maryland you were really upset with ‑‑ they were able to come back and such.
Does that sort of help you in a sense now that you've beat them by 20, a tight
game, you had to sort of pull it out, playing them again?  
COACH MCGRAW: It really does. Watching film, you get to see them at their
best. That's what you need. Going into a game like this, you want to see what
they do well. Alyssa Thomas was unstoppable. She was phenomenal in the second
half. She rebounded, she scored, she did everything she wanted to do. She
played like the All‑American that she is. We watched that and were able to see
a lot of things we did wrong.  
And I don't know that you can guard her. I think she's really, really
difficult to match up with. But at least we saw some of the problems that we
had and tried to fix them the last couple of days.  
  
Q. You sort of answered it just there, but seems like if possible Alyssa
Thomas has even taken her game to another level in this tournament. How
difficult is she to defend? What type of problems does her athleticism
bring?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think anytime you have somebody with her size and mobility‑‑
and she can have it in the open floor. She's great in the press offense. She
gets the ball and brings it up. She's just so hard to guard, because she plays
so hard. She's relentless. She just is diving for loose balls, attacking the
glass. She's doing everything that a coach could want a player to do.  
So it makes the matchup really hard. I think it has to be a team defense. I
mean, you really have to try to have an awareness where she is all the time.
And they're good enough you can't forget about anybody else, which makes it
even more difficult.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions?  
  
Q. How do you keep them focused on this being one game at a time instead of
the bigger picture? All season long it's one game, it's one game, but you're
sitting here 36 ‑0, two games away from a historical year?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's been easy. That's probably the easiest thing we've been
able to do this year is take it one game at a time. The seniors have done a
great job. The captains, the leaders they've done a great job making sure
nobody's looking ahead. They set the tone.  
I mean, we're in the Final Four. We've been here before. But we still know we
have a lot of work to do. So I think for us we know we can't get to a National
Championship until you win the first game. So I think it's really easy to stay
focused. I don't think there's any distraction there at all.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to take a question from our junior journalism group
in the back.  
  
Q. What is your mindset for the game today?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, our mindset is really pretty similar to what it is
every game. We've got to take care of a certain amount of things, keys to the
game, rebounding, gotta find Thomas, get a blockout on her. Transition
defense. We're working on what we're going to do and how we're going to attack
them. We're trying not to get too involved in anything else outside of that
and really focusing on how we stop them.  
THE MODERATOR: One more from the journalism group.  
  
Q. How do your players maintain school and basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: Being a student‑athlete is a difficult challenge. I think the
thing that you sacrifice is your social life. You have to put a lot of time
into studying when your friends are out doing some fun things because you've
been at practice all day.  
So it's difficult. I think it's definitely worth it. But you have to put a lot
of time in it and certainly being a student is the more important of the two.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over here on the side.  
  
Q. How do you plan on defending freshman Lexie Brown, does she pose any type
of problem for you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Lexie has improved since we played them last. In fact, I thought
our game was her coming out party. She really played well down the stretch in
that game and since then has played extremely well. So much poise in the
Louisville game, making big free throws and shots down the stretch.  
She's a very, very talented player. All rookie team in the ACC, which is
difficult to do in our league when we have so many talented freshmen. And she
presents a lot of problems for us. She's somebody that we really have to be
aware of.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Thank you, Coach.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Maryland, head coach Brenda Frese and
student‑athletes Alyssa Thomas, Lexie Brown, and Katie Rutan. Opening with a
brief statement from Coach Frese then questions for student‑athletes.  
COACH FRESE: Obviously it feels really, really good to be back here in the
Final Four. This is something that everyone aspires to achieve, and personally
it's been such a phenomenal year when you talk about our son Tyler receiving
his last dose of chemotherapy and then being able to reach the Final Four with
our team. So it's a special year for all of us.  
I love the fact that we're the underdog. The team really flying under the
radar. I feel like it's been a solid year for us. We missed a few chances to
be able to get some big wins, and I think that's kind of when people forgot
about us as a team.  
But it's okay, obviously, for us. I felt like it was time for us to be able to
grow and develop as a team. When you talk about bringing 14 players, three
freshmen into a pretty large roster with five seniors, but now we get to share
some of our stories in terms of who we are.  
When the bracket came out, I thought we had a chance. I didn't really feel
like there was anybody that we were overmatched against. But that being said,
to be able to beat Texas, the No. 1 seed in Tennessee and Louisville, in front
of 15,000 fans on their home court, is something for us to be really, really
proud about.  
To some extent, I feel like Maryland and Stanford are the extras at the Miss
U.S.A. pageant. Everybody's rooting for the other two. Our job is to be able
to crash the party.  
I have all the respect, obviously, for Muffet McGraw and her staff and Notre
Dame. About two or three years ago Muffet and I were out on the recruiting
trail and she asked me to sit down and we had dinner together at the Cracker
Barrel. She also had my mentor. Bill Finley from Ohio State is somebody who
worked for her. So some great ties and relationships being together.  
Notre Dame has the best 1‑2 punch in the country when you talk about Loyd and
McBride. They've been devastating all season. No one's been able to stop them,
including us. Loyd and McBride had really big games against us. McBride hit
some really big shots in crunch time, very similar reminder in terms of what
Kristi Toliver used to be able to do for us.  
We're going to try to do what nobody else has been able to do this year. We
want to try to slow Notre Dame's attack down. Lastly, it feels great to be
here with our team and it feels amazing to be able to bring a team to the
Final Four. I like if we wouldn't have been able to do that, I think
personally I would have felt regrets as a coach not being able to get her
here. She's a phenomenal person, even a better family when you talk about her
parents, and she deserves every single moment of this.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes. Address your questions to
specific athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssa, so you heard what your coach said about sort of feeling like
extras. Is that actually motivation for you knowing that the way that the
season is set up, that so many people are imagining the possibility of two
undefeated teams playing in the National Championship?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It is. I mean, that's what everybody expects, is for them to be
undefeated and to meet up with each other.  
But I mean, we're here to crash the party. And I know Stanford is too. I
talked to Chiney, and we're here to crash the party.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you remember about the first meeting with Notre Dame? I
know it was way back at the end of January, but what do you remember about
that game?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We did not come out to a good start. Spotted them 22 points.
Once we settled down, we were able to get back into the game. But they had
already gotten hot. So it was hard to slow their big 2 down.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what does it mean that you're finally here now and you've been
before for WBCS stuff, but what's it like playing in the game tomorrow?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think the biggest thing is to experience this for my
teammates. I've been saying it for the longest time. I just want them to be
here with me. I'm really excited that finally get to be on the playing side of
the Final Four.  
  
Q. Katie, as a senior, now that you're finally here in Nashville, is it
still surreal for you, or are you letting it settle in now that you're going
to be playing the Final Four tomorrow?  
KATIE RUTAN: The opening days are really surreal, after the win. But you can't
think like that now. It's time to get down to business. And so the happiness
is over and it's time to lock in.  
  
Q. Lexie, I just wanted to ask you, your confidence level. I know that
freshmen season and all that, compared to the first time that you played these
guys and the challenge of their guards.  
LEXIE BROWN: Our confidence, and my personal confidence, is sky high right
now. We've come off two great wins as a team. I just think all together as a
team, we're stronger, we're mentally stronger, we're physically stronger, and
we have a lot of confidence going into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Alyssa, they said that no team ‑‑ no player in the country means more to
their team than you do. Is that a lot of pressure for you? Or talk a little
bit about that.   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Not at all. I think I'm just a player on the team. We have
plenty of people that can score on our team. I think we've proved it
throughout this tournament that it's not just all about me.  
We have a ton of other players. Lexie can score for us. Shatori. We're a
well‑rounded team.  
  
Q. Alyssa, how is this team better today than it was after the ACC
tournament?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Well, we had the two weeks to refocus ourselves and get
ourselves back on track. And we're peaking at the right time. We're playing
our best basketball when it matters, and this is what people are going to
remember.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student‑athletes? One more here.  
  
Q. Lexie, what's been the biggest challenge being a freshman point guard and
acclimating yourself to a team and heading to the Final Four?  
LEXIE BROWN: I would definitely have to say the mental part of the game. As a
point guard, you have to keep your poise the entire game. And at the beginning
that was very tough for me to do. But as the season progressed, I met a lot
with Coach B, and my teammates have really helped me with that. And I think
when you have your poise, really nothing can go wrong in the game because
you're there mentally.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? Okay. We'll dismiss the student‑athletes
back to the locker room. I do want to take the time to introduce the Maryland
SID Rose De Paula, if there's anything more you need from Maryland. And we'll
begin with questions for Head Coach Brenda Frese. Start right back here.  
  
Q. Brenda, when you go to a Final Four and you win a National Championship,
does any part of your delude yourself into thinking it's not as hard as you
thought and you don't come back and you realize it's much harder to get back
here than you thought it would be?  
COACH FRESE: No question. You know, I mean, when you think about it, I was so
young your first time going through it. And you march through in six games and
win the title.  
And then you realize, you know, after the fact in terms of just how much more
difficult it is, being able to be lined up at the right time, have the right
bracket, have the right possessions go your way, being completely healthy
throughout the run.  
  
Q. Brenda, who picked up the check between you and Muffet at the Cracker
Barrel?  
COACH FRESE: Funny you asked, because I was trying to remember that when I had
the memory. We might have each picked up our own. But it was one of those
moments that, when I walked into the Cracker Barrel, she was in front of me,
asked if I wanted to dine with her, at her request first. So I just remember
at that time just appreciating that's what it's about in women's basketball
and as coaches in terms of our bond with each other in the profession. It was
in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and it was a break in between the AAU games, so we
both decided to go get something to eat at the Cracker Barrel.  
  
Q. Coach, you know, you talk about their big 2. When they have a shooter
like Michaela Mabrey, how do you defend those two and still keep Mabrey from
hurting you badly on the perimeter like that?  
COACH FRESE: You know, it's difficult. Mabrey, you know, was phenomenal the
first time that we played. So now you have to keep in check. I really feel
like all their guards, all their guards are extremely talented.  
So there's not many teams like Notre Dame that can score the first time they
look at the basket. Oftentimes, in women's basketball, you need to get a
couple more chances, maybe an offensive rebound putback, but Notre Dame is so
efficient in terms of their first look, it normally goes in.  
  
Q. That game against Notre Dame was sandwiched in between two road losses,
Virginia, NC State. I wonder if you can speak to the evolution of the team
particularly on the road and how you've been able to handle hostile
environments a lot better.  
COACH FRESE: It was a difficult stretch for us when you talk about the
conference play and two road games and then undefeated Notre Dame coming in
and really finding ourselves as a unit, when you talk about your second, third
and fourth leading scorers being freshmen and really kind of introducing them
to those elements, road games, and then an undefeated team coming in.  
So we were really green. We were really raw. We were going through
experiences. So I think it was critical for us as a coaching staff not to get
too low in that moment to have kind of perspective that we were going to grow
from those experiences, which now, to be able to go into Louisville, again
probably ranks up as my all‑time top two favorite games to coach in.  
We wouldn't have been able to win that game in January as a team. And you can
see how far the physical and mental toughness has really come.  
  
Q. You said you're really happy to play that underdog role. But after
Natalie Achonwa got hurt, was out for the season, Notre Dame says, we're the
underdog. Almost like hot potato. Why does everybody ‑‑  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, yeah, Notre Dame can't play that card. They've been to four
straight Final Fours. You're not an underdog. You still have a roster that‑‑
it's unfortunate, we all go through injuries. We did especially last year.
It's a terrible part of the game.  
But when you have the best 1‑2 punch in the country, two of the best
All‑Americans, the top 10, the depth in the roster, the All‑Americans that
they have, they by far still had the experience. Everyone's still picking
them, so there's no way they can be the underdog. They can try.  
  
Q. Brenda, two questions. First one is, when you played them the first time,
I think Achonwa was in foul trouble, so she didn't play as much. Did that help
you prepare, not knowing what they were going to do without her, that you sort
of saw that, at least on film a little bit? The second one is, can you
compare, if there's any comparison, this year's run to the one in 2006?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah. Yes and no in terms of, yes, it allows you to kind of see
what they went to, Notre Dame, when Natalie was in foul trouble. But we still
didn't win that game. So we have to be better in terms of who we are as a
team, because she didn't play a lot in that game.  
So it does make it extremely difficult in terms of getting the preparation.
The comparison between the two teams, you know, I think one of the big ones is
we're being led by freshman point guard when you talk about between Lexie and
Katie.  
But the teams were definitely different. They were built differently when you
talk about the'06 team having five players averaging double figures. This team
had AT, Lexie and Shatori at times. And on any given night, nobody knows who
consistently or where we're going to get our scoring from.  
This team is by far probably a better defensive team than'06. But both teams
are probably consistently really dominant rebounding teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Question down here.  
  
Q. You just mentioned rebounding physically. Wondering, especially with
Natalie out for them, is that an area that you'd like to try to take advantage
of on the boards?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, we‑‑ absolutely. That's something that we've been really,
really strong at. But I really think our defense is going to be more critical
than our rebounding because like I said earlier, Notre Dame doesn't need
second‑chance opportunities. When they get clean looks at the basket, they're
able to put it down. So then rebounding really doesn't matter.  
It really comes down to us defensively being‑‑ having to make them have to
take difficult shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. You talked a lot about the development of your team over the course of
the season, some of the young players. I'm wondering if you can address
specifically how Lexie's progress has gotten you to where you are now as a
team.  
COACH FRESE: Well, first, I can remember the conversation I had with her in
the summertime. She was having a hard time adjusting, and when we started the
fall semester really talking about where things were going to need to go in
terms of to be ready to lead this team to a Final Four.  
And so for Lexie, and you talk about our other two freshmen, there's so much
thrown at you your freshman year, and then for Lexie to be the starting point
guard on a team that has three senior starters, five seniors on the team, that
takes time for a freshman to get comfortable. And Lexie's somebody that has to
be comfortable to be confident.  
So it took a while obviously for her to get that comfort for us, to grow with
the team and really understand one another. But Lexie's playing some of her
best basketball right now and couldn't have come at a better time.  
THE MODERATOR: Question back here.  
  
Q. Brenda, good to see you. Sorry if people already answered this question,
but have you talked to the girls about what the experience is like back in
2006 to sort of prepare them, and do they sort of get it?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I have. Anytime I can lend experience on situations to
protect our team, I'm going to. And so, yes, throughout this entire
tournament, you know, I've been able to be able to do that.  
What's the second part of your question?  
  
Q. That was it. Just if you shared any experience with them and do they get
it.  
COACH FRESE: They really do get it in the fact that when you have five seniors
on a roster, you know, they get it and then they're able to pass it down to
your younger players.  
  
Q. Is there any one thing that you tell them that they just can't imagine
until they get here? Is it all the media? Is it the fans? Is it the different
location? Is there one thing?  
COACH FRESE: The big thing is the distractions and being able to lock in.
Because everyone wants a piece of you. Everyone wants tickets. And there's a
lot of media requests.  
So just really trying to find that balance and being able to eliminate those
distractions.  
Q. First meeting with Notre Dame, the middle of the game when you overcame
the 22 ‑point deficit, what did you do well during that stretch?  
COACH FRESE: We defended. We went to our press. We were able to get stops that
led to our transition.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions? We'll take one right here.  
  
Q. Brenda, philosophically, how do you look at matching up with a team that
you played before as opposed to a team that hasn't seen you? I imagine there
are advantages and disadvantages, but both teams obviously know each other.
You have film on each other. How do you look at that philosophy?  
COACH FRESE: I love it. One, I liken it to'06 when we got to play in North
Carolina and Duke and opponents we played over and over. I think it gives your
team a great comfort level so you don't spend the first 10 or 15 minutes
feeling out a team you've never played.  
But I'm sure both teams feel that way. So now you have to kind of figure out
what's going to be the difference in a game that could come down to
possessions, you know, it's critical in terms of your play calls, your
defenses, your strategy. How can you kind of separate yourself within some
possessions.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach Frese?  
Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Connecticut student‑athletes
Stefanie Dolson Bria Hartley and head coach Geno Auriemma. We'll begin with a
brief statement from Coach Auriemma and then we'll take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's one of those things that you try to figure out something
different to say every time you come up here, and it always comes back to the
same things.  
Just two games left in the season. There's four teams left. Trying to play on
Sunday and Tuesday and for us to be one of those four teams is obviously the
goal every year.  
And Bria and Stefanie fortunate enough to be here four years in a row and
that's pretty special for the two of them and I want to make sure that we, as
coaches and players, do everything that we can to make sure that this weekend
goes the way it deserves to go for these two. So that's kind of my focus this
weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll take questions for the student‑athletes,
first, please. Raise your hands and state your name and affiliation and
address the specific student‑athlete. Anything for the student‑athletes? We'll
take one right here.  
  
Q. Stefanie, I'm curious, after watching film what do you think the best way
to defend Chiney on the interior?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think for us, we don't ever look at how to defend a certain
person. We're really looking at the whole team. We're making sure we're
concentrating on making everything they do difficult, making sure every shot
they take is a tough shot. We rebound the ball because obviously Chiney is an
extremely good rebounder. We have to take away her strengths and their team's
strength and worry about executing on offense and defense.  
  
Q. For both of you, does it ever get old? This is your fourth trip. Is it
more anticipation, excitement, or pressure to finish this off sort the UConn
way?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think anytime you're able to compete for a National
Championship or make it to the last four teams, it's a lot of excitement. I
think we've worked hard all year. And we want to get to this moment. So I
think we're all excited. We're eager to go out there and play. So we're going
to make sure we have lots of energy and lots of intensity when we step on that
court.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, it definitely doesn't get old. Like Coach said, we're
fortunate to be able to be here four years in a row. It's something that we
have never taken for granted. And like Bria said, we're excited to be here and
excited to get out and play. The first two days of being here is kind of all
the media stuff, the fun stuff.  
But we've gotta get down to business, and we're just excited for the game
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student‑athletes? Down here.  
  
Q. Stefanie, everybody probably in this audience and basketball fans are
talking about UConn/Notre Dame battle of the blah, blah, blah. How do you tune
that out when you've done so much, won by 35 points a game?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: It's pretty easy. We just don't pay attention to it.
Obviously like you said, there's a lot of hype between the whole two
undefeated teams going into the Final Four and the National Championship game,
but for us, we don't think about that. We take it game by game. We always
have. It's something we emphasize during the season. And we go into the
tournament the same way. We're just looking forward to the Stanford game right
now, preparing for that, and not really focusing on what's going on around us.  
  
Q. For both Bria and Stefanie. How would you say that Stanford has improved
since the last time you saw them? And how do you think your team has improved
since that second game of the season?  
THE MODERATOR: Do you want to take it first, Bria?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think both teams have improved a lot. When we played them, it
was so early in the season. So there's a bunch of things that the team really
needs to improve on. And you look at their 3‑point shooters, they have really
good guards. They're really good at attacking and getting in the paint. I
mean, you have All‑American post player in Chiney, and she's able to create
for her team. They've improved in running their offense and everyone's a lot
more in sync. For us, it's the same thing.  
We've been running around offensively playing together for a few months now,
so everything's a lot more crisp. And when we go out there, we have to make
sure it's going to be who comes out there, executes each play better. And at
this point in the season everyone has to step up. And this is when great
players make great plays. So it's going to be really tough competition out
there.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: She said it all. Both teams have definitely gotten better. I
think at the beginning of the season, you're finding your identity as a team.
I think both teams are at that point. I think just each team has had
individuals who have just gotten better as the year's gone on.  
Like Bri said, it's going to come down to executing offense and defense better
and then just outworking the other team. Obviously it's Final Four game. No
one wants to lose.  
I think both teams are going to go in there ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Question over on this side.  
  
Q. Stefanie, what was it about last year's run in the tournament that maybe
springboarded this team to how good you guys have done this year?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I'd say Breanna Stewart was a big part of that, obviously.
She had a tough year last year, then just made an incredible run for the NCAA
Tournament last year. And I think with her and Bria kind of gaining more
confidence, just getting better throughout this summer. Having the two of them
coming into this year just started us off better, and I don't know. Just set
the tone for the year.  
From there on out everybody got better individually. We picked each other up
as the year went on. Our chemistry grew stronger and stronger as we played
more together. And we're at the point that we are now where I think we just
play extremely well together.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one more question for the student‑athletes. Back here.
Sorry. Over here.  
  
Q. Bria, I want to give you a chance to brag on Stef a little bit here. Can
you tell me, as you look at Notre Dame, what they're going through right now,
missing Achonwa, is it unfathomable to think about what it would be like to be
here without Stefanie and what she's meant to this team and this run?  
BRIA HARTLEY: Absolutely. Stef does so much for our team. Our offense runs a
lot better when she's out there on the floor for us. When we're in the offense
and she's in the middle, she sees a lot of things. She's a great playmaker,
and I think sometimes people always pay attention to her posting up and her
presence in the post, but the way she's able to pass the ball and screen
really creates offense for other players.  
I mean, it's hard to find that. And I think we always say how Stef's the best
screener on the team. People don't always pay attention to that, but that's a
big part of your team and that helps get a lot of your teammates open. And
there's so many things she does that go unnoticed. She knows that we notice it
and we really appreciate everything she's done for us.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: They definitely notice it. They tell me. They're great
teammates.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll dismiss them back to the locker room.
They'll be available until 3:20. Continue with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. I think you talked during the teleconference about being able to win
games in a number of different ways. Curious, where does the team defense for
this team rank in those factors?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought last year we had one of the best defenders in
the country in Kelly Faris, and we were able to do a lot of things with her.
We don't have anybody like that this year. So it's had to be more of a
team‑oriented thing.  
And everyone‑‑ everyone on our team knows that we can't afford to make a lot
of mistakes on the defensive end. We can't get ourselves in foul trouble. We
can't give up easy buckets. So I think Kelly graduating and the fact that we
know we don't have anybody like that has made us a really, really good
defensive team.  
People have a hard time scoring against us, generally speaking. We block a lot
of shots. The best way to keep people from scoring is don't let the ball ever
get to the rim. If the ball gets to the rim, it's got a 50/50 shot going in.
Right? If it never gets to the rim, that's pretty good defense. That's been a
big part of our defense this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Question from Michel.  
  
Q. Geno, you and Stanford have played a lot over the past three years. What
are the two or three things that you know are either going to happen or you
are going to have to do when you go up against Tara and their staff?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they're going to be really well prepared. They're going
to have a game plan. And you'll be able to tell right away what their plan is.
And you've got to be able to make the adjustments if you can. If you can't,
then you're going to be in big trouble.  
You also know that, same as it was when they had Neka, that Chiney is going to
be a huge factor around the basket on both ends of the floor, offense and
defense. And I don't know that there's anybody in the country individually
that can guard her.  
So you know you're going to have to deal with that somehow or another. And
they're going to take a ton of 3s. That's always been the case and that will
be the case on Sunday. And how well we're able to defend that is going to go a
long way towards who wins the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Question here from Richard.  
  
Q. Geno, understanding that it's very hard to compare teams of different
years and players, Kelly has obviously graduated, but where is this team at
this point of the year heading into the semifinal game versus where last
year's team was heading into the same point, the semifinal game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think mentally for whatever reason, we didn't have any
reason to be, but we came in last year mentally in a pretty good place. We
didn't win the regular season, the Big East. We didn't win the Big East
championship tournament. And yet I think we came into the Final Four expecting
to win, even though I don't think anybody else expected us to win.  
This year, there's been so much hype surrounding the team because of what
happened in last year's tournament and we're undefeated. I don't know that
we're in the same place, because you can't be, you know. But I think this
team, for whatever it's worth, I don't know what it's going to be tomorrow,
but the team's a lot more confident and sure of itself than last year's team,
last year I think we were determined but there was still a little bit of
doubt. And I get the feeling from this particular team that there isn't any
doubt in their mind that we're the best team here.  
Whether or not that plays out, I don't know. But right now, that's the mindset
that I see.  
THE MODERATOR: Question back there.  
  
Q. After two slow starts in Lincoln last week, have you placed any extra
emphasis on starting strong tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I'm probably going to have to mention that in the
pregame speech. Let's start strong. I guess last week saying let's start
[Bleep] didn't work too well.  
I don't think we, coaches, fans, everybody, I don't think we realized how hard
it is to make shots in the Sweet 16 and the Final Four. Every time the ball
leaves your hand, it's not the same as playing in January and February. And if
you don't make the first couple, it gets even harder to make them.  
And especially when you're used to making them and all of a sudden you shoot
the ball poorly like we did, both of those games in the beginning, it starts
to become contagious.  
I'm a huge baseball fan. And guy throws a no‑hitter for three or four innings,
going to be hard to get any hits the next four or five innings. And shooting's
the same way. Start the game. Couple guys knock in a couple of 3s right away,
get up 10‑0 and everybody thinks the basket is as big as the ocean.  
So last time we played Stanford in November, I think the score was 2‑2 the
first seven minutes of the game. So I'm going to tell them before the game
starts.  
  
Q. Geno, after the beginning of the season, your conference is a little bit
down. The only really tough team you had was Louisville several times. Next
year it's going to be Louisville and Rutgers going. It could be an even easier
conference. Are you at all concerned that ‑‑ obviously this team has gained a
lot of confidence from it, but is there an opposite side of that that they
don't really know what it's like to be challenged when they come to a
situation like this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't believe that that's the case this year. I can't speak
for what might happen next year. But the three teams that are here besides us,
we beat Maryland at Maryland and we beat Stanford at home. And we beat Texas
A&M. And we won at Duke. And we beat Louisville three times. And we won at
Baylor. And we won at Penn State.  
I think this team thinks they can win anywhere, anytime against anybody. Next
year, I don't know. But we've been in this situation before. Remember in 1995,
before the Big East really became the best basketball conference in the
country, that year, two teams from the Big East went to the NCAA Tournament.
Two out of, I want to say, nine or ten, maybe 12. I'm not sure how many were
in the league back then. 12. So I think we had two teams go in 1995. That's
how bad the league was.  
And we were undefeated, won the National Championship. All we heard was we
were the bet. Stanford played in the Pac‑12\. Tennessee was there. Georgia was
there. And how tough the Southeast Conference was and how tough the Pac‑12 was
and how every league in the country's great and we played in the Big East,
that's what they called it. We beat Stanford by 30 in the semifinals and then
we beat Tennessee for a National Championship.  
So if you have the right kind of players and you prepare properly, I don't
know. I have a lot of respect for everybody. But I respect certain teams. I
don't respect conferences. A lot of teams playing in big time conferences that
haven't won a damn thing in their careers. So I'd rather be in our conference
and win them all instead of being in another conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for a couple more. We'll take one right here. Michel.  
  
Q. Geno, Brenda said that Stanford and Maryland might be like extras in the
Miss America competition. Tara at one point this week I think said maybe they
feel they're a little bit like the JV team. If they're feeling that way, does
that ‑‑ and they're motivated by that, do you think that that ends up being
relevant at all in anything that happens tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No. I really don't. At this time of year, the teams that play
the best basketball are the teams that are going to win. And whatever
motivation you want to use only works if the other team doesn't play well. So
if we play poorly against Stanford and Stanford plays well and they win, it
won't be because they were motivated by being a JV team. It will be just
because they played better. And the same goes for Maryland.  
There's an awful lot of emotion on every team going into the weekend. But
after about five, six, seven minutes, maybe, all those things go away and it's
just play basketball. All four teams are capable of winning a National
Championship. That's the beauty of the Final Four. You don't have to win three
out of five. You don't have to win four out of seven. Not best out of three.
All you gotta do is play really well two nights and you can win a National
Championship. And all four teams that are here are capable of doing that
because they've already done that.  
So I don't think they should feel like they're a JV team. I don't think they
should‑‑ anybody should feel like they're the extras at the Miss America
pageant. I've never won any pageants.  
  
Q. Coach, somebody just looked at the box scores and your team seems
automatic this year, but I know you guys aren't robots. From your close
vantage point to the team, could you explain the humanity of you guys or
something like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We have five starters that are really good offensive players.
But they all have their weaknesses. All five of them. They're not superhuman.
They're not infallible.  
If we had enough time and I was inclined to do that, I would list five things
about each five starters that I hate that I wish I could fix between now and
tomorrow night.  
The key is you're not going to know what they are and neither is the other
team because we're going to try to hide it as best we can. But we all have
them. We all have them.  
What we're good at, we're really good at. Really, really good at it. What
we're not good at is we try to pretend like we are because we don't want you
to see it. And that's kind of our philosophy. Let's just be really great at
what we're really good at and hope they don't find out what we're bad at.  
THE MODERATOR: Question in the back.  
  
Q. Coach, when you get to UConn, no tradition. Haven't been winning. Not
exactly in a metropolis. How did you sell ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: It is now. We have more stores than just one store. It used to
be called store. Lou Holtz's great line. Used to be called store. Then they
opened another one. Now it's called Storrs.  
  
Q. How did you sell the kids on you and the belief that you can do something
great here with this program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: In the beginning, greatness had nothing to do with it. There
was no such thing as talking about being great back in the early
years,'85,'86,'87. So what we did was we identified who were the next level
players that the schools that we were trying to beat down the road were not
going to recruit. So from an area of let's say Boston to Pittsburgh to
Washington DC, we had tried to identify in that area who were the best players
that are not going to be recruited by the best schools in basketball, who are
the next level down. Maybe two levels down.  
Let's go recruit those guys. Let's convince them that they can come here and
be part of something, and a bunch of them bought it. And then when they got
there, you know, we coached them pretty good.  
They got a little bit better. We started winning a couple of games. And then
we started getting a little bit better player. And then when we won a National
Championship in 1995, I thought, you know, we only have two kids on our team
that were recruited by everybody. Rebecca Lobo and Nykesha Sales. Everybody
else was like, those other kids we could go undefeated, win a National
Championship with two players on our team that a lot of schools wanted. We
start getting a bunch of those guys, we're going to be really good. That's
when we started talking about being great.  
But by that time we had already built a pretty good program so it wasn't hard
to convince them to play there.  
But in the beginning we could never get great players to come play at
Connecticut. That would have just been impossible. As a matter of fact, when I
got the job at Connecticut. There was a kid playing in Boston called Tonya
Kardoza, and she was one of the best players in the country. I was recruiting
her when I was at Virginia. But when I took the Connecticut job, I didn't
recruit her, because why waste my time recruiting her? She's not going to come
to Connecticut. Eventually she came, ten years later, as an assistant coach,
but we didn't waste time recruiting kids we knew we couldn't get.  
Now, we haven't changed that much. We still don't waste time trying to recruit
kids we know we can't get. So a little bit has changed but not a whole lot.
And Storrs has changed. The university has changed. It's 1985, there's
absolutely no comparison between the school, the basketball program,
everything. It's like night and day. It's like night and day.  
THE MODERATOR: That's all the time we have. Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Stanford Cardinal, Tara
VanDerveer. Stanford is playing in its 12th Women's Final Four and pursuing a
third championship. At this time I'll ask Tara to provide an opening
statement, and then we'll give you directions on how to get into cue.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good afternoon. We're very excited to be invited to the
Final Four and playing in Nashville. Our team had, I think, one of our best
weekends beating Penn State, and NorthCarolina we're playing very well.
Everyone's healthy and ready to go.  
  
Q. Last night you kind of mentioned a bit about this seemingly inevitability
that everyone seems to be expecting UCONN and Notre Dame in the final. But are
you looking forward to the chance of the rematch of the game? It was your
third game back in November, when you went to stores and had a chance to do
what so many people thought was unexpected and advance yourself instead of
UCONN?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, we're very excited to be going to the
Final Four, and you know that you can play great competition, and Connecticut
has a great team. I'm really glad that we did play them early in the season,
and I feel like our team is playing with a lot of confidence. We're looking
forward to the rematch. You know, just I think people, players in the
tournament just kind of resent a little bit of the inevitability. Like why
have the tournament if it's inevitable? So we're just‑‑ we definitely want to
be party crashers.  
  
Q. What do you think the mindset of your seniors will be going into this
tournament? Do you think it's different for them? Obviously, Mikaela's been on
the roster for a couple of these, and Chiney for a couple. Is it different for
them when they come in for the last time?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it is. I think that seniors definitely feel a
different sense of urgency. You know, I think you saw that last night with how
much it meant to Mikaela and how well she played. Obviously, Chiney's been
playing just incredibly well all season long. But between Sara James and
Chiney and Mikaela, I think that we have great leadership with our seniors.
They're going into it, I think, with like really two good things in their
mind. First of all, they've been there before, so they know what to expect.
And we didn't go last year I think people are very hungry.  
  
Q. I was wondering, I'm curious as to what your philosophy is about getting
your players to give you optimal performance during a game and to fight for
every loose ball and do what you need them to do to battle through games? What
is the secret in convincing your team to give you what you need?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I don't feel like it's them giving me anything. I feel
that we kind of try to set up practices and conditioning to make the games in
some ways easier and fun. So during the game, because they have trained hard
and practiced hard and been drilled in situations, the games are almost like
taking a final that you're really ready for. You're excited to do well. So
they're not doing it for me, they're proving things for themselves.  
  
Q. We suspect here in Connecticut that Chiney will be moving east in a
couple of weeks when the WNBA draft commences. Just a quick evaluation of her
professional readiness?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that the pro fans are in for a really special treat.
She's an outstanding‑‑ you know, Connecticut has obviously with the teams that
are in Connecticut, they have a great appreciation for quality basketball, and
they know the real thing when they see it, and Chiney is the real deal.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much Chiney has grown through the years and in
particular this season how much she's come along?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that really the biggest change kind of
happened last year when without Nneka, Chiney became our go‑to player. And I
think Chiney is just an exceptional young lady. She plays on a team that
without Chiney we're maybe, I'm going to say, an average team; with Chiney,
we're in the Final Four. She is a builder, an encourager, a leader. You know,
sometimes you might have a great player who almost looks down on their
teammates or in some ways she is by far the best player on our team. And she
is so humble. Her leadership, just her demeanor is something that's really a
joy to be around and a joy to coach.  
  
Q. All teams celebrate differently. Three of the four teams that won in the
regionals cut down the nets, and UCONN didn't. I just wonder what went into
your reasoning to cut it down? You just wanted the kids to celebrate that
moment?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's really special going to the Final Four. You
know, in a tournament whether it's a regional tournament or even your
conference tournament, it's a really special thing. I do think we were
celebrating. Different teams choose how they're going to do it. We definitely
were net cutters, and we were excited about it last night.  
  
Q. The game that you played against UCONN was back in November, and so much
about both teams has obviously changed. That was a home game for them, but the
19 ‑point loss for you. So when you're looking at the tape or even evaluating
and thinking about this upcoming match‑up, where can you find those 19 points?
  
COACH VANDERVEER: Like you said, it was so early. At that point we didn't
have‑‑ Bonnie was just back. We didn't have our quote "three spot" the way we
do now. We played Kailee who was totally playing out of position there. Lili
wasn't a starter at that point. So I think the biggest thing is our freshmen
have really developed a lot since then.  
We didn't really know who was going to be in our rotation. We were looking at
a lot of players at that point and I feel like I understand our personnel a
lot better. It's a tough way to start. Our team knew that, and I think that
coming back from‑‑ it was a great way to start for us to kind of be able to
benefit from playing again. Connecticut, they were clearly better than we were
then. Our goal from then on was to put ourselves in position where we would
improve a lot, and I think that we have. We've lost some games and we've
improved because of our losses, including that loss.  
  
Q. Just one follow ‑up just looking at the box score and seeing Bria
Hartley's efficiency, 9 of 13 for that game. Lot of rebounds for a guard, a
lot of assists. I didn't see the game, but from the box score you could tell
that she had an incredibly efficient game. What was it that you remember from
her play that allowed her to have the kind of game she did against you?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, our transition defense was horrible, and that is
something that I think when you play Connecticut. And Bria Hartley is an
open‑court player, and she's an outstanding player. She got the ball in
transition, and I was going to the basket like hot knife through butter. I
mean, she really took it right at us. That is something that in order to have
any chance, we have to do a better job with our transition defense.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask, yesterday there was a lot of buzz with Tyler Summitt
being named head coach of Louisiana Tech at 23. I know you became a head coach
at a very young age also. So what was it like for you coaching at such a young
age? I believe you were 25, correct?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right. Honestly, I think times were very different then.
There were a lot of people kind of my generation whether it was Theresa
Grentz, Marianne Stanley, Rene Portland, women's basketball was in its
infancy. So who do you turn to for coaches and you're not going to pay
anything?  
So at that point I really had minimal experience, but I was an assistant coach
for two years. I had been at Indiana. I had really, I think, been working hard
to become a coach. But I can't even look back at it. I can't even believe I
was a head coach when I was that young. It's just so many kind of things that
I guess you just don't know when you're that young. Kind of the opportunity to
get experience of working in a great program is what young people have now for
the most part. It's very different.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches' media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have an
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish,
Muffet McGraw. Notre Dame will be playing in its sixth Women's Final Four in
2014 competing for its second NCAA national championship. At this time I'll
bring in Coach McGraw to provide an opening statement.  
MUFFET McGRAW: We're really excited to be heading back to the Final Four. At
the beginning of the season, losing Skylar Diggins, I don't think anybody had
us advancing this far, and certainly there were a lot question marks for us,
but Kayla McBride, Jewell Loyd, Natalie Achonwa have had fantastic seasons,
and we're just excited now about continuing on our journey and really thrilled
that the ACC has two teams, and would have been great to have three, but nice
to have two.  
  
Q. I'm curious, how do you approach this week with Taya Reimer, and also how
do you kind of assess her play up to this point, her freshman season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think Taya has had a very good year. I think that she would
be a starter for most other programs in the country, and she was able to come
off the bench and learn a lot through Natalie Achonwa and Ariel Braker and she
is ready for this opportunity. I think she's been waiting for this opportunity
all season long to break into the starting lineup, and she certainly is
talented enough and has a great skill set.  
  
Q. Does it provide you any solace that when you played Maryland the last
time because Natalie had a lot of foul trouble that she had a relatively for
her had an unproductive game and yet you were still able to beat them, and
without Natalie out there, what bigger challenges does Alyssa Thomas
present?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we did look at that. We looked at the stats. We
watched the game film and we noticed that Natalie's minutes in the game, I
mean, she played about half the game, and so we were able to get a good look
at what the team is like without her in there, and that helped us a little
bit.  
But it does present some problems when you lose your best rebounder against a
team like Maryland, who is just big and terrific on the boards, and a player
like Alyssa Thomas, it creates a little bit of‑‑ a couple more problems for
us.  
  
Q. I was wondering whether you thought the key was to motivating your team
to perform at its highest level for as long as you need them to? What does a
coach need to do? What do they need to say? What's been your method to success
in getting your players to give you maximum effort?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think our players are very self‑motivated. Our seniors
and our captains have done a great job in the locker room getting them ready
for practice every day, getting them to look at the next game, and never
looking ahead. I think we've trained them in that way over the years. I think
it's been passed down from leader to leader. But we really don't have to do
anything to motivate this group. They're competitive. They want to win, and
they've been a very easy group to lead.  
  
Q. Just to follow that up, what was the ‑‑ I imagine it was very difficult
for them in the locker room after Natalie got hurt, just the camaraderie that
they build among teammates and what she's contributed to the team. Was there a
mourning period and how long did it last?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Natalie Achonwa sets the tone for our team in everything that
we do. She's been the vocal leader for our team. When she went down on the
floor and before she even left for the locker room, she bounced back up and
went after the team and really gave them a very spirited talk and
encouragement to finish that game. I think she set the tone right then. She
came back onto the bench, she got up and cut down the nets, and she proved to
them it's not about her, it's about the team. We talked about it in the locker
room yesterday. There were no tears, there was no mourning. We are ready to
move on, and Natalie is going to be on the sidelines doing everything she can
do to help us win.  
  
Q. With this being a rematch, the fact that Maryland was able to kind of
come back after you all had such a big lead and made it so close at the end,
does that maybe help you as you get your team refocused on the challenges of
this game on Sunday?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would rather they didn't come back at all. You know, I think
that they're a really good team, and they've gotten a lot better since that
game. In fact, I would say that may have been the turning point of the season
for Lexie Brown. I think she's really come into her own since that game. I
think that really was kind of a catalyst for her to continue to improve.  
It's great to be able to watch the film and see how good they look because
they looked really good, and Alyssa Thomas in particular looked really good in
the second half of that game.  
  
Q. When did you specifically find out Natalie was lost for the postseason,
and what do you remember about the exact moment you were told, and I imagine
you were told by a trainer or a doctor?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, right after the game. We were still out on the court
celebrating, and they said it looks like it could have been the ACL. So I
think we knew almost immediately. The MRI wasn't until the next day we got the
official word probably around noon the next day, and I think we were prepared
for it. I think it really‑‑ it kind of took the wind out of our sails during
the celebration, but we still continued to celebrate our success, and I don't
think it had as big an impact the next day when we got the official word. I
think we pretty much already knew by then.  
  
Q. Would that have been you or a member of the coaching staff who told
Natalie directly or a medical person who told her directly?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I don't know what happened in the locker room when
she left the floor. I don't know if they told her. I don't think they did.
They told me not to say anything to her. So I think in her own mind she knew
that something was wrong because obviously she's had a couple of knee injuries
and she knew this one was a little worse. It really wasn't until the next day
that she got the official word. Right after the MRI I think she got the
official word.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Ariel Braker? She's been very successful in the
lineup and people don't talk about her but what a great role player for you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: She is kind of the unsung hero of our team, and what a great
game against Baylor, ten points, six rebounds, four steals, some big plays.
She's kind of a blue collar worker. She makes her way around the basket, sets
screens, does the dirty work, doesn't really care if she gets any credit at
all. Like you said, she doesn't get a lot because nobody talks about her, but
she's so important to our team, just that experience of having her on the
floor. She's great on the scouting report. She knows exactly what she's
supposed to do and what everyone else is supposed to do, and I look for her to
take a bigger role in the vocal leadership. I think she is somebody that is
very smart and will be able to help the rest of the team really get to the
right spots.  
  
Q. Coach Ivey has gone through what Natalie has gone through, and having
somebody like that on the bench for Natalie and for the rest of the team to
say push forward, does that help?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it does. It always helps to have somebody in the same
situation. We've gotten texts from other people who have gone through the same
thing this year, and it's been really nice for her. Her boyfriend at Drexel
tore his ACL earlier in the season, so they had a lot to talk about.  
It's really been great, and she's really, really doing well.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask you, yesterday with all the buzz about Tyler Summitt
being hired as Louisiana Tech's new coach at 23, I wanted to see if you could
recall what you would have been like as a head coach of a Division I school at
age 23.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I was coaching high school at age 23, and when I looked
back on it years later, I thought, I don't know how I did it because I didn't
know anything.  
When you're in that position as a young coach, there's so many things that you
don't know in terms of running a program. I mean, the Xs and Os are probably
the smallest part of the job sometimes. Recruiting is important, the
community, the alumni. There's so many things, handling budgets and just
taking care of managing a staff and doing so many things that I don't know how
you do it at that age. I think that most people have been assistant coaches
for a long time when they get the head coaching job. It's a very difficult
transition, and I don't think I would have been prepared for that at 23. I was
fortunate back then in the '80s‑‑ you know, women's basketball wasn't nearly
as big as it is now, so you could start jobs a little bit earlier back then.  
  
Q. In some ways Alyssa Thomas is a taller version of Jewell Loyd. She's an
unbelievable passer, she doesn't take threes as much but she's what they call
a point forward, I guess. Does that mean that anybody would be inclined to try
to defend her with a smaller player, or does Ariel Braker get a lot more work
trying to do that? Without giving away your game plan, do you have thoughts of
going smaller even though they're very big and trying to beat them with
quickness?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know that you can match up with a Alyssa Thomas with a
guard because she's so good around the basket. I think her strength is really
rebounding. That girl is relentless. She plays so hard, it's really, really
hard to guard her because she's so active going after the ball. I think you
need somebody strong to try to guard her, and we really did a poor job last
time. But she's a tough match‑up because you've got to be physical and keep
her off the glass, and that is not an easy task.  
  
Q. I didn't see the last game. When you started that game in the man ‑to‑man
situations you were in, who was guarding her?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Ariel Braker did guard her for a pretty good stretch with
Natalie in foul trouble. Markisha Wright came in and guarded her some. I don't
recall putting a guard on her. I just watched the game, but I don't remember
if a guard‑‑ a little bit in transition or on a switch or something, but not
for any stretches.  
  
Q. What does it take to be a good post passer in your system? Where does
Reimer kind of fit in that whole paradigm?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, when we recruited Taya, I thought she was going to be
great in the Princeton offense, and she is. She's very similar to Natalie in
that she can put the ball on the floor, she can pass and she can shoot.  
I think we kind of recruit kids that can do that when we see them. We feel
like she is somebody that can play well in that system. We don't have a lot of
back‑to‑the‑basket players. We like the high post player who can do a lot of
things from there. We do a lot of breakdown work to improve our passing. A lot
of it is decision making, and that's even more important, I think, than
actually making the passes, the ability to read when it's there and when it's
not, and that's something that we do spend quite a bit of time on that.  
  
Q. I wonder if you have any plans to utilize a four ‑guard front against
Maryland, and I know you talked about Alyssa Thomas, but if you do how would
you match up with the rest of their team?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, they're pretty big. It's a tough match‑up. It's going to
depend how the game goes, whether or not we can stay out of foul trouble, how
a lot of things go. We've played the four‑guard lineup before with foul
trouble. It's been very successful for us last year. We haven't played it as
much this year because we have so many post players. But we're kind of looking
at all the options right now.  
  
Q. When you're evaluating the previous Maryland game and you said you had
taken a look at that game this morning on January 27th, how do you and the
coaching staff evaluate a game where such a key player played in the previous
game but won't be playing in this game? That's kind of fascinating to me how
you would sort of visualize what you can do while the video in front of you
has such a key player in Natalie. How do you approach that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we really looked at so many different things. Was the
zone effective? Was the man‑to‑man effective? How did we like how we guarded
the ball screens? How were the match‑ups? What did we do in transition?
There's so many things that are just general philosophical issues of how are
we going to guard it this time and what do we want to look at; what hurt us,
what didn't. There's a lot of things that I think would be the same whether
Natalie was in the game or not.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could speak to the player development of Jewell Loyd. She
came in as a fairly well ‑ranked individual a couple years ago but seems like
she might have exceeded your expectations, and to become the leading scorer
this year, was that something you expected from her?   
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she continues to exceed our expectations. Last year
National Player of the Year was a phenomenal achievement for her, and she had
a great freshman year, and then to come in this year and be so much better.
She was so much more aggressive. I think her mindset has changed. She is no
longer the freshman who was deferring to the upperclassmen or waiting to be
given the green light. She has just taken charge and knows this is my
opportunity, and not in a selfish way but just in an aggressive way of here's
how I can help the team if I can score in these particular areas.  
I think her work ethic has always been terrific. She never takes a day off.
She's in the gym every day. Whether we're practicing or not, she's in there at
8:00 a.m. getting shots up. She's in watching film. She just always wants to
learn and always wants to know how she can get better. I think when you have a
player like that who the team loves to have around, and with the athletic
ability she has, it's great, but it's her skill set with that athletic ability
that makes her such a great player.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, you all and Stanford got to play on your home courts
in your regional finals. You look at what Maryland did not only as a 4 seed
but to have to go into Louisville, beat a No. 1 seed, then face Louisville on
their home court. When you look at that team, you mentioned how well they kind
of came back in the game against you, but right now when you look at them, how
potentially dangerous could they be?  
MUFFET McGRAW: They're very dangerous. I think they're a great team. They're a
team that has really, really kind of hit their stride lately. I think they're
playing great basketball, and when you have a great player like Alyssa Thomas
who just really continues to lead them in so many areas, they're a tough
match‑up. To go in there in front of 10,000 or whatever the crowd was and to
come away with that win, that was really something. I think that it was great
to see that. To win on an opponent's home court is not an easy thing to do,
and especially at that point in the season. But they were the better team
yesterday.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask, Taya Reimer, because Natalie was injured and missed
the first three games earlier this year, she scored 19 and had 13 rebounds
against Michigan State, also had a double ‑double against some very good
teams. I think maybe the expectations soared off the charts for her. Can you
talk about her progress as she goes into the NCAA Tournament?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think she's so ready for this moment. I think she's
been waiting all season for us to have to count on her. I think when you're a
freshman you're learning the ropes, you're playing well in some games. It's a
little bit inconsistent with your playing time and how things are going.  
I think for her she's kind of looking forward to just getting out on the court
and showing us what she can do.  
  
Q. Obviously when a team is undefeated, I'm not sure how many moments there
are going to be when you look back at the season, you find that there was a
key moment or a moment in the season which sort of changed everything, but
when you look at the season up to this point, there are a couple of key
moments during your year where you really think things clicked or maybe where
you really thought that this team had Final Four national championship
potential?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think when we looked ahead back in October at the
schedule and we saw that stretch where we had at Tennessee, big Monday, at
Maryland, big Monday, at Duke, three in a row, and I thought that's going to
determine our season right there in terms of how far can we go, how good can
we be, and I think when we won those three games, I think that's when we
started to think, you know, I think we can be pretty good. But we're not there
yet, and we certainly have a lot of work to do.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's Women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Maryland Terrapins, Brenda
Frese. Maryland is playing in its fourth Women's Final Four, and pursuing its
second National Championship. At this time I'll ask Coach Frese for some
opening comments and we'll give you instructions on how to get in the cue.  
COACH FRESE: First and foremost, thank you for having us. We feel very honored
and humbled. We still haven't come down from last night's high. Just an
incredible resiliency, toughness from our team to be able to go into
Louisville's home court and be able to get a win and just an incredible
environment.  
The game for me personally ranks right up there all time as probably one of my
favorite to be able to coach in in my career. Just really to be able to see
our team, how we've grown, the paths in this NCAA Tournament and the games
that we've gotten to play, Texas, Tennessee, and Louisville, we've really seen
our team grow into a special young team.  
Obviously, our next opponent is a very common opponent in Notre Dame who is
extremely talented, led by their two All‑American guards in Kayla McBride and
Jewell Lloyd. It's a team that's extremely well‑coached, has a ton of depth,
and is undefeated for a reason. But I know from our end, we're really excited
about going to the Final Four and getting there and getting to Nashville.  
  
Q. When you played Notre Dame back in January, as it turned out because of
foul trouble they didn't have Natalie Achonwa most of that game either. Just
what do you expect from them without her? Does this look like a classic match
‑up, but you've got one spectacular bigger player and three big people doing a
lot of work for you. Does this look like a classic guards versus big people
match‑up?   
COACH FRESE: You know, I think it's really hard to be able to answer that
question. It's a great question. I don't think anybody knows how it's going to
play out, us or Notre Dame, given that it just happened. I do know that Notre
Dame is a tremendous team, and, obviously, guard‑oriented. But their bigs are
very talented as well. They have a phenomenal team. They have a ton of depth.  
You know, for us, I really like where our team is headed. Yes, we really like
our inside game, but our guard play is much different than what it was in
January, and I feel like we've really grown as a team.  
  
Q. If I might follow that up, Alyssa has been described as a point forward,
a forward guard, a whatever, how would you describe her?  
COACH FRESE: A winner. She can play any position. Her true position probably
at the next level would be in that guard, that wing position, but for us she's
played every single position on the floor.  
  
Q. At this point it seems like all eyes are expecting Notre Dame and UCONN
to be playing on Tuesday night for the national title, but the way you've all
come through this tournament with the win especially against Tennessee and
Louisville last night, do you like your chances of maybe getting in and
spoiling this party and moving on yourself?  
COACH FRESE: You know, no question. I think for any of the four teams that are
left remaining you have to have that mentality. But the expectations are high
with Notre Dame and UCONN for a reason. They've backed it up all season long
with their undefeated record. But we just want to be true to who we are and
continue to keep fighting and battling and scrapping and see where it takes
us.  
  
Q. If I can follow up on that, you talked about how different your team
feels right now. Muffet said she noticed you guys maybe making a bit of a turn
in that game against them. Even though you all fell short, maybe to help your
team understand just what it was capable of?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, your schedule, absolutely. Our non‑conference game with
UCONN, our game at home with Notre Dame and being able to come back and being
within two possessions of that game really gave us the confidence that we felt
like we could play with anyone. But it is a process. We've had a very young
team. We've had to add into the lineup with our three freshmen, so it's been a
process for us to get comfortable and be able to work together.  
  
Q. You kind of continued along with this line of questioning. Can you
identify what changed for you all during the course of the season, because,
obviously, you've come on very strong here. Maybe if there are any people that
are responsible for the change or maybe it was just a collective thing with
the team, because I've noticed you have a lot of team unity? I saw a
Washington Post story yesterday about the dancing and all the fun you guys
have. Is there maybe one ‑‑ can you identify what about your game has changed
since January or December, and then what might have instigated that change?   
COACH FRESE: I actually, you know, and you never know when a team is going to
fully get it, but for us it was pretty late. It was after the ACC Tournament
was when we changed having two weeks to be able to get our minds in the right
direction for each other. That humbling loss to NorthCarolina I think really
grounded and rooted our team. From that moment forward we committed to one
another.  
Sometimes when you're watching a team grow and unfold in a season, you don't
know if they're going to get it, but this team, obviously, has bought in and
has committed in terms of a season where when you're managing 13 players and
everybody having to sacrifice, just really proud to be able to see them fully
be able to grasp that within a season.  
  
Q. Does this feel like 2006 at all or do you not want to make any
comparisons like that?  
COACH FRESE: Well, of course you'd love to say that. Every team is different,
so, no. I think my appreciation is greater because you know how hard it is to
get to a Final Four. Just only four teams left standing, but you know the one
thing I will say that is similar to 2006 is watching how everyone's been lined
up and committed for one another, our staff and our support staff and just
always pulling in the right direction for this team.  
  
Q. With all the buzz yesterday of Tyler Summitt getting hired by Louisiana
Tech at 23 years old, what do you think you would have been like if you were
hired by a Division I school at 23 years old?  
COACH FRESE: Very good question, a wreck. That is the first thing that came to
my mind. Yeah, I would not have been in a position to be able to handle that
animal, especially how much women's basketball has changed with the media
attention and everything you have to balance. The one thing I will say for
Tyler Summitt is he has experience on his side. You can't underestimate the
fact that when you grow up with the game and have as many games under his belt
that he's had as a child and through his experiences with Pat, I'm sure he is
more than ready. He has been learning all those years under her, so I'm sure
that he will do a tremendous job.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Malina Howard? I know she doesn't have big
time numbers, but what she brings to your team?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, first and foremost, not a better person in the world to
be able to coach, not a better person. She brings so many things to the table.
First and foremost, she's a winner, and she has an extremely high IQ on both
ends of the floor, defensively in terms of her rotations and how we guard, and
offensively just understanding the game and where the ball needs to move to,
the screens that need to be set. She just does all the little things that
don't always show up on a stat sheet but that allow you to win a game.  
  
Q. Just wondering, off the subject a little bit, just your thoughts about
joining the Big Ten next year and coming over in this direction and playing
some games?  
COACH FRESE: Oh, I'm thrilled. I'm going back to my roots, the Midwest. When
you talk about, as you go through this career and you get to be at my age and
have a family, just how important it is to be able to share kind of your
livelihood and your profession with your family and your friends. So for me,
that's kind of where my path started, obviously, in the Midwest and the Big
Ten ties and the relationships that I've developed throughout the year. So I
couldn't be more thrilled to be able to have the opportunity to be able to
come back into the Big Ten Conference.  
  
Q. Jewell Lloyd has got a rather remarkable skill set rebounding, passing,
little bit of Michael Jordan in her attitude. In your mind, what makes her
such a special player?  
COACH FRESE: Jewell has had a phenomenal year. By far probably one of the‑‑
when I watch her on film, she is just a pure joy to be able to watch. You wish
you were coaching her instead of having to game plan against her. Her
athleticism, first and foremost, her exchanges, her and McBride on the court
for their alley‑oops, which is like a dunk in the women's game. Her ability to
be able to just a really high game IQ. She can read the defenses, knows when
to post you up, when to pull up, when to shoot the three, an extremely
difficult match‑up.  
  
Q. Plus, she's also a surprisingly effective player in the paint at 5'10 ".
What does she do so well that allows her to be that effective down there?   
COACH FRESE: You would think when you look at Jewell that maybe she's, based
on how she's built, maybe she's not that strong, but she is. She's extremely a
lot stronger than her body type looks. So she's a really difficult match‑up
when she can go in there and post up smaller guards. She's able to kind of
motor her way and get the shots that she wants.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on your win. I heard you talking a few questions
ago about going to the Big Ten. Kind of piggybacking off of that, do you and
the program take any extra pride in being ‑‑ in representing the ACC in the
Final Four in this your last year?   
COACH FRESE: Yeah, no question. The ACC has been really good to us in the
tradition and the history that we've been able to have. But I think obviously
the conference prepares us, when you talk about the teams that we've faced and
having two ACC teams that are in the Final Four.  
But I think probably the overall theme when you look at the different
conference realignments is that we're probably most proud of the fact that we
get to represent the university of Maryland and be able to, for our fans and
our community, to be able to represent our university.  
  
Q. You've played Notre Dame before, so you obviously know the team. But I
wonder do you have to speak to the team? Is there any danger about players
maybe thinking that the Notre Dame team is not as strong because, obviously,
they've lost a really great player in Natalie Achonwa? Is it something you
have to specifically address with your players or do you think your players
know the strength of the other players of Notre Dame and you play who is in
front of you?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously, it will be stressed but no team gets to the Final Four
with just one player; it takes a team. When you see the four best teams that
are coming through, and it's truly about a team. We faced adversity with
injuries last season, and I know those injuries made us a stronger unit. Just
like we faced when Connecticut came to play us this season, and Kaleena went
down before the game to play us. We knew they were going to come in and play
stronger in spite of losing her.  
So we've been through that element before, and the reality is that most of the
time your team rallies behind it and plays even better.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously been to the National Championship before and been
to the Final Four. Tell me how it differs going from different stage to
different stage. How does it differ from your preparation and how will it be
different from last time?  
COACH FRESE: Well, there are a lot more demands that take your attention from
being as focused as you probably want to be or be as prepared as you want to
be. So it's a different animal. I know from going through it the first time
and already seeing your morning unfold, there is just a lot more that you have
to tune your team into and your staff to be able to minimize the distractions
that are out there.  
  
Q. Coach, this is more of a fun question. So having Alicia DeVaughn on your
team, does Yolanda Griffith pop up at practices all the time?  
COACH FRESE: You know, actually she doesn't, I'm sure because she has her own
real job as she's a coach. But we've been able to‑‑ it's been fortunate for us
to be able to see Yolanda in the postseason. She's been through the NCAA
Tournament runs usually when her season is complete.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Alyssa Thomas has been somewhat underrated maybe even
this year?  
COACH FRESE: You know, she's received a lot of attention and rightly so
because she's extremely talented. I guess if you wanted to compare and
contrast in regards to the other players that are out there or are deserving
of the attention as well, it's a great question to be able to ask. But you
know what? At the end of the day, none of it really matters. What matters is
that this team has taken her to a Final Four in everything that she's meant to
our program. I know that the people within Maryland and what she's done to
leave her legacy here is the most important thing for her.  
  
Q. You had a stretch, I think it was three games in a row in January where
you lost back ‑to‑back to back, Virginia, Notre Dame, and N.C. State. A lot of
times when a team has that kind of stretch, they can go either way. They
respond as you clearly did, or they can go in the tank and that is the season.
What happened after those three games that, I don't want to say that changed
things, but obviously they went a certain way as opposed to another way?   
COACH FRESE: I think it's important as a leader to continue to give
perspective and not to get too high or too low when you're going through those
moments in a long season, for us just giving back to our players. Two of the
three were on the road. The third was against an undefeated Notre Dame team.
Just that we were a young team with three freshmen that we needed to figure it
out as a team together. So just not losing confidence in your team and their
abilities.  
  
Q. Was there a game that happened after that, whether it was a February game
or maybe a game in the tournament or maybe not in the tournament, because that
would be too late. But was there a game a couple weeks after that stretch
where you sort of knew that this team was heading in the right direction?  
COACH FRESE: You know, honestly, it was after the ACC Tournament, after we
played NorthCarolina and lost in the quarterfinals. You say that's pretty late
to be able to see your team kind of rally, but for us, I think it was kind of
that our team clicked into that this could be the finality of our season. So
really some people don't like the two‑week stretch that is off before you come
into play. For us, it was the best thing that ever happened. No question
having those two weeks to recenter and refocus and put all the time into us
was tremendous.  
  
Q. Was it practice schedule during those two weeks the same or did you
change something up after the NorthCarolina loss?  
COACH FRESE: After the Carolina loss the practices were grueling. So it was a
mindset that you're going to figure out how to‑‑ you're going to get tougher
and you're going to learn what it takes to fight or this is it. Credit this
team. We saw our team really within a week figure it out together. I mean, it
really was incredible to be able to watch.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2014

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, and welcome to today's women's Final Four head
coaches media teleconference. Over the next several minutes you'll have a the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.
UConn will be playing in its record seventh straight Women's Final Four in
2014 and will be playing for a record ninth national championship in the next
week or so. I will ask Coach Auriemma to provide an opening statement.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. I think I speak, I'm sure, for all the other
coaches that it's a great opportunity, one that you never take lightly, to
play in the Final Four. For our team it's something that you work all year
long for, something that every basketball player that's playing aspires to be
doing at this time of the year, and we've had a great season with a lot of
great moments and some fantastic wins and an awful lot of accomplishments that
we're really proud of, and we're looking forward to coming out there this
weekend.  
I know we already played Stanford once, and it seems like years ago that we
played them, but it was November, and I watched them play last night, and
they're a vastly different team than they were in November, and I hope we are,
too.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the shot blocking this year. Obviously you have
three players who are really good at it. Can you talk a little bit about how
they became good at it? Is it something Marisa is coaching them and how they
stay out of foul trouble while doing this?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it goes back to one of the best shot blocking teams in
the history of college basketball was our 1995 team with Carol Walters and
Rebecca Lobo. I think that might have been before Marisa was born. I'm not
sure. She probably likes to hear that.  
It's something that when you have the right kind of players, when you have the
right ingredients where you've got kids that are obviously skilled enough that
have great footwork and are pretty intelligent defenders and their timing is
pretty good, then you can have the kind of success that we've had this year.
Both Chris Dailey and Marisa really emphasize positioning way more than
anything else. I think blocking shots just is a byproduct of being in the
right place at the right time and making good decisions.  
I've got to tell you, I think the improvement in officiating has helped,
believe it or not. I think blocking a shot is not as hard as making sure the
official understands it's a blocked shot and not a foul, which didn't always
used to be the case in women's basketball. It used to be every time you
blocked a shot, it was a foul. Every time you got an offensive rebound it was
over the back.  
So I think the officials have gotten better at recognizing when it's a blocked
shot and when it's a foul, and I think therefore our players have‑‑ as other
players around the country, have been allowed to be better defenders and play
better in the post.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you attribute your success to, and what do you think is
the key to motivating players to give maximum effort at all times? Your team
seems to epitomize that and has forever it seems, but what does it take for a
coach to convince his players that all it takes is 40 minutes, and how do you
get them to do it?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, yeah, it's something that we take great pride in, how
hard we work every day, how hard we work in the off season, and how hard we
work in the preseason, how we maintain that during the season. We used to do
that in 1985 and '86, '87, and we weren't any good. We didn't make the NCAA
Tournament. The last 20‑some years we've worked just as hard, we do the same
thing, we work our butt off, we have high expectations for our players, but
the players are really, really, really good. I'd like to think that we get
some of the best players in America to come to Connecticut, and when they get
here, I'd like to think that we have them work as hard, if not harder, than
any other team in the country year in and year out.  
We could do the same exact thing and not have the players that we have and we
wouldn't have the success that we have. It's a combination of things,
obviously, but I think the expectation level here is you go to the Final Four
and you play for a national championship, and we're pretty proud of it, that
since 1988‑'89, every player that's been recruited at Connecticut has played
in the Final Four. The kids know that. That's why they come here. When you
have high expectations you tend to live up to them.  
  
Q. Why don't we talk a little bit about the match ‑up with Stanford and what
you said a little earlier about how they're vastly different and you are
vastly different. If you could elaborate on both those points.   
GENO AURIEMMA: Just based on what I saw last night watching them, they seem to
be much more well‑rounded. I think early in the year you're trying to fit all
the pieces together. I think there was a inordinate amount of the load placed
on Chiney, and maybe rightly so, because the kid can carry her whole team for
a whole season if she has to. But based on what I saw yesterday, they seem to
be much more well‑rounded in terms of other people are doing more things. You
saw players step up and make big plays. It wasn't just let's stand around and
watch Chiney. That means their team has grown, their team has evolved. They're
certainly experienced enough. It's not like they're playing four freshmen and
Chiney, so they've got people around here that are certainly capable, and they
beat a really good team last night. If anybody thinks, well, yeah, we're going
to play the same Stanford team that we played in November, they're kidding.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, in what ways do you think your team is vastly
improved?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think my team has changed. Every team changes. You just
hope you change for the better, that you improve on the things that you
thought you needed to improve on and you get better at what you were good at.
Playing together all these games, all these months certainly has made us much
more confident, not that we weren't confident in the November game, but in
some ways we've changed and it's a little bit different. We didn't have
Kaleena Lewis our second half of that game, so if everybody is healthy
tonight, that'll be a little bit different for us and we'll have our starting
five.  
We got great contributions from Kiah Stokes and from Saniya Chong in that
particular game. Kiah continues to get better and better. Saniya has not. So
hopefully Sunday the five that we have as starters playing together and
playing really well and we can get some contributions off the bench.  
  
Q. It seems like it's just a monumental achievement just to come within 20
points of you this year, and only seven teams have done that, and you've got
five players on the all ‑America team. You probably get asked this question at
the end of every year, but I'm wondering how this team stacks up with the
other UConn teams you've had. I'm not asking you to rate them, but I'm
wondering in what particular plays is this team among your best in any
particular way?   
GENO AURIEMMA: I think most of the good teams that we've had have
similarities. They have obviously good players at every position, which we do,
really good guard play we've had since Moriah Jefferson had a great, great
year, and she and Bria Hartley in the backcourt have been just really solid
all year long.  
We've got, I think, the best center in America, Stefanie Dolson, and certainly
that's huge.  
And then we have a couple players that are just dominating the game, but I
don't think we win games the way we want without having more than just one way
to win games. All the great teams that I've had could beat you a lot of
different ways. That doesn't necessarily mean they're going to. That doesn't
mean they can't lose, but that they're a hard team to just say, okay, if we do
that we can beat Connecticut. Some teams that I've had, if you did one or two
things, it would be difficult for us to overcome those things. This particular
team, they team to have answers for a lot of things that come up on the court,
and I just hope that continues.  
  
Q. You obviously know Chiney well. You've seen her for the last four seasons
and you saw her sister before that. But just on sort of first blush, what do
you think you're going to have to do to slow down Stanford beyond Chiney?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's kind of the same as that question that I was just
asked about our team and why we're a good team. If Stanford wants to just rely
on Chiney, they're a really, really, really good team, just by she doing what
she does. She's so good at scoring the ball, rebounding the ball, playing
defense, running the floor. She's a great emotional leader. But I don't think
that's enough to win a national championship.  
What I think has happened is Ruef has become, I think, a much, much better
complement to Chiney. Amber has become much a more aggressive offensive
player, much more consistent offensive player. Watching last night the kids on
the perimeter, Bonnie Samuelson and Karlie, they look very confident. They
look confident, they look they know that they're good and that they know that
they can provide the other things that you need to win a championship, that
it's not just let's put three guys on Chiney and let's see if Stanford can
win.  
So I've been impressed watching them and how much their other players have
evolved, and I think that's what's going to make the match‑up, for anybody to
play Stanford, a difficult one.  
  
Q. I know you didn't play Notre Dame this year, but you've seen Natalie
Achonwa 12 times in the previous three years. In what ways will her loss
motivate Notre Dame most, particularly when they have the challenge to trying
to defend against Alyssa Thomas?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I doubt that Natalie Achonwa was going to be guarding
Alyssa Thomas anyway. That wouldn't have been‑‑ probably, it could have been,
I don't want to speak for their coaching staff. The problem when you have a
great team and you lose somebody as integral as she is to their team and you
lose them late in the year, it's hard to just put somebody in and expect the
same results. She was a terrific passer. She could score around the basket.
She played great defense inside. She rebounded the ball. She had a little bit
of an edge to her, which I think every big guy needs. What effect does not
having her? Well, obviously the easy answer is she's averaging 20 points a
game in the NCAA Tournament, so that's a huge effect. What effect does it have
emotionally on the team? I don't know, each team's makeup is different.  
In 2001 we lost two first‑team all‑Americans, Svetlana Abrosimova and Shea
Ralph. We lost Shea in the Big East championship game, so we went into the
NCAA Tournament missing two First‑Team All‑Americans. When we got to the Final
Four and we ended up losing to Notre Dame that year, but I know exactly what
it feels like to all of a sudden you've got to retool your team. It's not
something that you wish on any team, and certainly you don't wish that kind of
injury on any player. But I don't think Notre Dame is just Natalie Achonwa. I
think they're a whole lot more than that. And if anybody thinks that that's
all they are, they haven't played them enough times. That just means Joe Lloyd
and Kayla McBride are going to take even more shots, which makes them more
dangerous. Losing her really, really, really hurts. I guess we'll see this
weekend how much.  
  
Q. I realize I'm asking this question about a team that hasn't lost a game,
but what for you up until this point did you or do you consider the key moment
of the season, and why do you consider that the key moment of the season?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Wow. Well, there's been moments, I believe. One moment was in
the Stanford game when Kaleena went down and we played the whole second half
without her, and we got some great contributions from the bench and we beat a
really, really good team. That was one moment.  
The next one was not long after, we played at Maryland without K, and I don't
know if Morgan Tuck played. I don't think she did. So we played without
Kaleena, without Morgan Tuck, and we went down at Maryland in front of 15,000
people and played a really, really good team and we got great contributions
from guys off the bench, and still we took over the game. That was another
great moment.  
I think those two games maybe let everybody on our team know that, hey, it
doesn't matter whether we have everybody or most everybody. We may have it in
us to just persevere and overcome no matter who we're missing. I mean, there's
certainly a limit to how many people you can play without, don't get me wrong.
I wouldn't want to go through next weekend missing one or two key players.  
I think those two games early in the season really showed us an awful, awful
lot.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Stewie's goofy personality and how well it
balances or complements her skills and her serious approach to the game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, she certainly has a different personality than you would
expect. Someone from the outside looking in would probably be surprised to
know that Stewie doesn't really take herself too seriously. She's not one to
make everything about her. She's not one of those prima donna types. She's not
one of those me‑me‑me looking for attention types that we've seen in the NCAA
Tournament recently. She's just more about winning. She's just more about I
go, I play the game, and everybody says I'm a great player, and everybody
heaps all this stuff on me, and she tries really, really hard to live up to
that all the time. It doesn't always work out that way. She really struggled
this weekend, and one of the reasons why she does struggle is she really wants
to be great, and she wants to be great every minute of every game, and that's
a lot more someone who's a sophomore and young.  
But I do think one of her biggest strengths is that she doesn't take herself
way too seriously and that she just acts like a normal college kid who's a
sophomore who has been blessed with a lot of things and doesn't want any more
than that. Just wants to play basketball.  
That's what I love about Stewie, when she committed and she signed, no
fanfare, no nothing. We don't have an entourage, we don't have bodyguards
following us around. We don't need to hire anybody to protect her from
anybody. She's just a normal kid who loves to play basketball, and that's why
we all love her.  
  
Q. Natalie's injury notwithstanding, do you feel like this Final Four has a
little bit different aura or dynamic considering there are two unbeaten teams
going into it?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I do, but not for‑‑ not internally. For us internally we're
getting ready to play Stanford, and it's no different than us last year
getting ready to play Notre Dame regardless of what their record was,
regardless of what our record was. We've entered the tournament undefeated a
number of times, and I know what the hype is surrounding that, and I know how
everyone throughout this season has wanted to make it about this inevitable
march towards two undefeated teams playing for the national championship.  
I've kind of not bought into any of that, so I don't really feel that. I kind
of don't like when you have a sense of like you're disrespecting people, and I
wouldn't want either Maryland or Stanford to feel like we're just there as
filler for the Notre Dame Connecticut big thing, because I've been there, I've
seen it, and I don't like it.  
So we're just preparing as if we would anything else. I know it's a great
story, and I know everybody loves story lines, and in today's day and age God
forbid if you don't have a story line, we'll just create one. So fortunately
there is a story line. And the story line, God bless them, is two teams that
are undefeated. Great. As opposed to years past when it's individuals.  
This is a team sport, and I'm glad that there's two teams that are undefeated.
But I caution everybody, there's two other teams out there that are good
enough to win a national championship, so let's not write that story just yet.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, yesterday with all the buzz about Tyler Summitt
being hired as a 23 year old. I wanted to see if you can recall what you might
have been like as a head coach of a Division I school at 23.  
GENO AURIEMMA: (Laughing) When I was 23, actually when I was 23 I was driving
a truck for a friend of mine, for my dad's friend who owned five supermarkets.
I'm not sure that I was confident that I was going to be able to keep that
job, so I wasn't really in a position to do anything like I guess Tyler is
going to be doing at Louisiana Tech.  
It's been an interesting couple of days, I guess, in women's basketball with
the last couple of hires, both at Arkansas and at Louisiana Tech generating a
lot of buzz in the women's basketball world. Like they say, any kind of
publicity is good publicity. I think when you're young and it's your first
head coaching job and you've only been a coach for a couple of years, I think
two years as an assistant, heck, I was 30 when I got the job here at
Connecticut, and that was my first head coaching job, and I thought I knew
everything about everything. Two years later I realized I didn't know anything
about anything.  
So I'm sure he's going to be overwhelmed at times, and I'm sure he's got a lot
of great ideas that he's going to implement, and I'm sure he's going to have a
great staff that's going to help him. That's just a tall task for a 30 year
old, much less a 23 year old.  
  
Q. Obviously you schedule your out of conference schedule with the idea of
testing your team throughout the season. That really hasn't happened. How do
you prepare when you have such a large margin of victory for what might be
some tight games at the end, and are you at all concerned about how your team
will react?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you schedule the games that you think would be really
good games to play. You hope that those games are competitive, and you hope
that your team comes out of there with a certain knowledge of themselves and
what it takes to win games. You can't orchestrate what the score is going to
be. You can't say, okay, well, we just played four of the top 10 teams in the
country, and damn, I wish some of them would have gone into triple overtime so
we could find out how we would do in those kind of games. It just didn't
happen. People say, what are you going to do. Hey, I hope both of these games
we're up 25 with three minutes to go and I don't have to worry about it.  
But the reality is whatever happens, whether it's a close game, not a close
game, I think we've proven in the past as coaches that it's all about putting
your players in the position to make plays. It works the other way, too. You
can also have the kind of team where your players feel like it doesn't matter
what happens, we're good enough to win every game we play, regardless of what
the score is, regardless of what the situation is. That doesn't mean if we're
in a close game we're definitely going to win it, it doesn't mean we're going
to lose it. But it won't be because we're not prepared or we haven't been in
any games. If you look back, every single one of these kids has been in a
close game and then some during the three or four years that they've been at
Connecticut, so I'm not really worried about it.  
  
Q. Earlier in this conversation today, you mentioned Stefanie Dolson, and
we've seen her, of course, over the course of her career, and she's really
evolved, and I just wanted to hear from you about her evolution.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Stefanie Dolson is one of the great success stories that I've
ever been around in all my years of coaching, high school, girls, boys,
college. It doesn't matter. For someone to come out of high school and for her
to do what she's done, and not just do it anywhere, it's one thing if you're a
big kid and you go to a mid‑major or you go to a place where nobody is paying
attention, and all of a sudden before you know it somebody looks up and goes,
wow, what happened to that kid, she turned out to be really good. You're doing
it at Connecticut, you're doing it in the spotlight, you're doing it against
the best teams in the country on national television, and she got exposed as a
freshman early of what she couldn't do, all the things that she had to get
good at.  
Stefanie's sophomore year in the Final Four, we lost, and she made a
commitment at that point in time, this is never going to happen again, and
went about and changed how she trained and how she was going to look and how
she was going to prepare and made herself into the best center in the country.
A lot of kids say they want it. A lot of kids talk about it. A lot of kids
wish they could do it. But we're talking about somebody who actually set her
mind to something and did it and has done it as well if not better than any
kid I've ever coached in my life.  
  
Q. No one has come within 11 points of you this season, your teams have lost
11 games in the last six years. Talk about how you create adversity just to
keep it fun for yourself, for your players, just to keep yourselves
interested.  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's a good question. I've been known to keep things
interesting at practice, and creating adversity has never been a problem for
me in practice and creating situations where we have certain things that are
monumental that can't get through. I kind of enjoy that, and I teach my
players how to enjoy that, how to embrace how hard it is. You've got to‑‑ the
joy in doing something is creating an atmosphere where it's just so difficult
to do it that when you do accomplish it, there is a tremendous sense of
self‑satisfaction, and it's not fake, either. It's not like you get kids today
who they jog up the floor and you've got coaches clapping going, way to run,
baby, way to run.  
For us it's‑‑ the kids love it. Like I'll give you a perfect example, and I
can relate back to some of my teams. It's a little different today, don't get
me wrong. You have to work a little bit harder today to get players to really
embrace the challenge because there's so few challenges that they face growing
up. What's their biggest challenge: Which AAU team to play for. What's their
biggest challenge: Should I get three pairs of sneakers this weekend or four.
There's very few challenges, so we would lose seven games in a weekend, so
what, I'm not really playing for my team, I'm playing for the college coaches
to come and watch me play. I'm not really interested in winning, I'm
interested in how many scholarship offers I'm going to get. They don't face
many challenges.  
I remember we would play‑‑ and like every coach does, every coach does this,
you play four or four, and maybe you put five defenders and four offensive
players or maybe six defenders and four offensive players, or four offensive
players on your team and five defenders for them or five offensive players for
them, four‑‑ you just keep changing things around as you go. I remember we
were playing one time, and it was five of our guys against seven of them. So
there's 12 people on the floor, we were playing five against seven. Our guys
kind of got a kick out of it. Yeah, let's see how many times we can get stops.
And then a week later it was five against eight, and it was like Jesus, Mary
and Joseph. Every once in a while they would get a couple stops and they would
feel unbelievably good about that. Then the following week I went five against
six; they looked at me like, what, you think we stink? We aren't seven anymore
or eight?  
So once you create that challenge, then all of a sudden they start to look for
challenges. But they need to be challenged every minute of every day, and I
just don't think that kids that we get today‑‑ me all the way down, I don't
think they face enough challenges throughout their high school careers. So
that's one of the biggest things we try to teach them: Embrace the challenge,
embrace how hard it is. That's what makes winning so special.  
  
Q. You mentioned Moriah a ways back in this conference. I'm curious how many
different ways could her career have gone after what was kind of a tough
freshman season? Was it a certainty in your mind coming off last season that
we would eventually see who she is now?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think that's the big question that every player has to
answer: What am I going to do between my freshman year and sophomore year to
prove that I belong at this level, because freshman year at Connecticut,
there's not‑‑ there are expectations, don't get me wrong, but you also have a
lot of leeway. You don't get necessarily scrutinized as much as some of the
upperclassmen do. So last year‑‑ Moriah's biggest problem was she didn't
really believe that she could do all the things that I thought she could do,
so I just kept looking at her incredulously going where's the kid I recruited
out of high school that was so confident, so cocky, thought she could do
anything any time anywhere with the basketball, offensively, defensively, and
now there's this kid who keeps looking over at the bench to see if everything
is okay, can I do this, can I do that, should I try this, should I try that. I
thought, you know, that's not the winning edge, and towards the end of the
season that kind of got dispelled a little bit and a little bit more and a
little bit more, and like with all the great players, they go through a summer
between freshman and sophomore year where they figure things out, come back to
practice, and she came in in September, and the very first day that we got
together to practice, you could tell she was a different person. She went from
should I, should I not, can I, do you think I can, to, Coach, this is what I'm
going to do, and telling the other players this is what we're going to do. The
transformation was absolutely incredible.  
That's the player that we recruited. That's the Moriah Jefferson that we
recruited. There's a lot of great guards out there, and certainly we played
against all of them.  
But right now I'd take Moriah Jefferson as a sophomore for the next couple
years over anybody.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  76  
Louisville  73

  
JEFF WALZ: First, I just want to say a thank you to our crowd. I mean, the
city of Louisville to come out, our fans to come out like they did tonight was
just absolutely amazing. I thought it was a great event. I thought it was a
great crowd, a great atmosphere, and we asked them to come out and support us,
and they did.  
Not every place gets the type of support that we get and has the fan support
that we have. I mean, they're true University of Louisville fans, and we're
grateful for that, appreciative of that, and we know that there's choices to
be made on places you can go, things you can do, places you can spend your
money. I never want one of our fans to ever think myself or any of these young
ladies or our team take it for granted because we travel too many places where
they can't get anybody to come out to a women's basketball game, and it's
absolutely amazing what our fans do, how they cheer, how knowledgeable they
are, and I want to say thank you to them.  
I would like to congratulate Maryland. I thought it was a very good basketball
game. It was a game of runs. We got stuck there on 45 for about five or six
minutes and just could not get a shot to go. Had three or four of them that
were in and out. We finally would run a play and get a lay‑up and they'd call
a hold on the screen, and it was like, boy, can I decline that and I'll take
the lay‑up. Calling for a foul all game and finally got a foul when we got an
open lay‑up. We didn't need that one there. We needed the ball to go in the
basket.  
But it sucks. There's a few other words I could use, but it wouldn't be
appropriate. These kids fought. We're down 12 with two minutes to go, and I
mean, there was never quit in one of them. I mean, we executed that play at
the end there to perfection, and we got a great look. The ball just did not go
in the basket. Unfortunately for us it wasn't our night.  
Thank you.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you talk about the final play there, how it went down, was it
what you were looking for, and did you think that it was going in?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, we executed it perfectly. We both came up, Bri and I,
and Asia was going to get the ball, and she got it. All she had to do was
throw it to me, and I was actually kind of open, and so for me to take that
shot, we perfected it. The ball just didn't go in.  
The one that didn't go in was the last shot that I wanted, but it just didn't
fall. Nothing much you can do about that.  
  
Q. Shoni, it looked like all you could do when it didn't go was smile, and I
know you weren't happy and I know Coach wasn't, but it seemed like you did
everything so right down there. That was kind of your last moment. What was
going through your head when it didn't go?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Just not to get down on myself. It was my last shot, and it
just happened to be the one that didn't go. It sucks, but‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: Amen.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: What can you do about it?  
  
Q. Shoni, if you could talk about the final 18 seconds, the two threes that
you made to get your team within a shot of forcing overtime. What was going
through your mind when you were trying to rally the team?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was just trying to get easy, quick buckets and I knew they
were going to guard me, and her hand was down so I took that quick one right
in front of her. I had that mentality like I wasn't going to quit and I knew
my teammates weren't going to quit and so we just ‑‑ we did a great job of
fighting back, especially that last two minutes, and I couldn't be any more
proud of my team because we battled to the very last second.  
  
Q. You've always had a short memory when it comes to shooting. During that
stretch where you missed seven in a row, I think, did you just tell yourself
just keep shooting, just keep giving yourself opportunities?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I was tired of missing so I had to get an easy bucket. That
lay‑up helped right then and there. I'm not going to sit there and dwell on
the past. I'm not going to sit there and think about the last shot I just
took. I'm just going to move on, move forward, there's nothing I can do about
it, except learn what to do differently. I thought we did a great job those
last two minutes of doing the best we could.  
  
Q. Asia, just talk about playing with these girls the last three, four, five
years and what it meant to you and just kind of your thoughts about them and
spending time with them.  
ASIA TAYLOR: Yeah, well, it definitely meant everything to me. Coming in as a
freshman, from Columbus, Ohio, I never would have thought that my five years
here would have went like this. I've got just to say thank you to Coach Walz.
He believed in me when I was in high school and stuff. We've had our ups and
downs. I know there's a lot of times he could have given up on me, he didn't,
and he just kept pushing me. I'm a better player because of it. Off the court
I'm going to be I successful person because he's pushed me. Shoni and Nita and
Tia, it's been amazing playing with them. I'm just going to miss them. I'm
going to miss their faces and smiling and dancing and everything. It's been
amazing, and the fans, as well. Never going to forget this.  
  
Q. Asia, what did you think about the stretch where you guys ‑‑ I think it
went about seven minutes where you guys couldn't score and they went on a big
run. What do you think contributed to that and how frustrating was it to see
some of the baskets that didn't go down?   
ASIA TAYLOR: It was definitely frustrating. We were playing really hard, we
were boxing out, we were defending, and we were getting good looks, they just
weren't falling. It was tough, and they just went on their run, and we just
tried to fight back. Nobody ever hung their heads, though. That was the big
thing. We always thought that we had a chance. We always believed we had a
chance to come back, and I think that's why we made the run at the end. If we
could have just not given up one or two of those baskets, mistakes I made in
the first half, getting that technical foul was huge. There's a lot of things
that could have prevented this, but just proud of how we fought.  
  
Q. Antonita, we didn't know if we were going to see you on the court again
and you get to play this last half of the season and played tonight. What has
this meant to you?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: It's meant everything. It's just a blessing, first of all
just for my health, and then just playing with these guys. You know, they're
great teammates but they're great people off the court, as well. Like we said
in the locker room we're going to all keep in touch. These four years at
Louisville have meant a lot.  
  
Q. Shoni or actually any of the players, two things: The last two minutes I
think was one of the best examples of end ‑game clock management that I've
ever seen, especially the amount of timeouts. Is that a drill you practice
regularly, two minutes we're down 12 or whatever? And secondly, you've become
much more of a facilitator this year than you seemed to be last year. Was that
a conscious choice, and how did you develop those skills?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: The first question, I think our coaches have done a great job
of preparing us for situations like that. I mean, we knew that we weren't
going to give up and we knew that Coach Walz knows what he's doing, especially
when it comes to perfecting the time and the scoring. He's a very smart coach,
and he shows it every game. For him to do that, we have to believe in him and
he has to believe in us. That's exactly what happened. We just came up a
little bit short, and I mean, what more could you ask for? We ran the play
perfectly, and the ball just didn't go in the hoop. It's not always the ending
you want, but I couldn't be any more proud of my team because we fought to the
very last second, and so I mean, I can't hang my head on that. I don't think
any of us should because we fought, we were down 12 with two minutes to go.
Who comes back from that? We almost did, and so I mean, I'm proud of every
single one of my teammates and I'm thankful for them.  
For your second question, I definitely put a lot more work into my game just
because I wanted to be the best person I could be on the court and off the
court. I took the time and went out there and worked on things that I need to
get better at and just did all the smart things that I needed to do.  
  
Q. Antonita, everything seemed to be working the latter part of the first
half. You were forcing turnovers. You were up by four. If you could talk about
the early minutes of the second half and how everything changed there. What
did Maryland do to kind of swing that momentum?  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I'd say that the second half they came out and hit us in
the mouth, just on the glass and just rebounds that we didn't get, maybe a
couple turnovers that we had. All that led into their run. But like Coach was
saying, it's a game of runs, so I'm proud of my team, like Shoni was saying,
for fighting back, and just never giving up.  
  
Q. Tia, thinking back on the last minute, the last 30 seconds, what did you
think about just seeing Shoni hit all those threes that were so deep, every
time down she was hitting them and keeping you guys in it. What was it like
seeing that and maybe what that's been like just seeing her do that kind of
thing her whole career?  
TIA GIBBS: From day one we knew Shoni was a special player and she was going
to make a huge impact on our team and the program. Every time she shoots, of
course the crowd thinks it's going in, but we kind of know it's going in.
We're on the court and Shoni is like, all right, she's going to send a three
and I'm going to shoot it, you go rebound. Gotcha, simple as that.  
Shoni, that's nothing that amazes me. She hits those shots in practice with
the tallest person in her face. When she hit that, it was like normal. Of
course it gave us a huge boost and there was no doubt in my mind she wasn't
going to make the last one. That's what she does. She puts the team on her
back. I was very grateful to spend four, maybe five years with her.  
  
Q. Just the seniors who have given so much to this team over the last four,
five or six years, what do you say to the juniors, the sophomores and the
freshmen in the locker room when you go back in?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, just tell them to keep their heads up, and next year they
have to keep carrying the torch. We still didn't win a national championship,
and I know Coach Walz is going to do everything in his power to have them
prepared. As long as they put in the work over the summer, everything is going
to be fine, and they know what it's like, and this year we made history, and I
know that everybody enjoyed being a part of that. It doesn't mean that it
stops now. We're going to be in a better conference next year, it's going to
be tougher competition, but I think they'll be fine. Listen to coach, and
everything will be good.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I definitely think it's nothing to base your next season on,
the rest of your career on. I think it's something to learn from, especially
being the younger kids. They have to learn from this. They saw what everybody
could be, what they could do, especially on our team. We saw the potential in
the younger people, and for them to kind of grow up and be mature, exactly
what we did. We matured as people, and for us to do that, they have to do
that, as well. They're going to have all the correct things for them to do
that, the coaches and the people around them. They're going to be set up to
where they're going to succeed, and they have to be willing to do that, and
they have to go out there and do it for them and this team and this program.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: I'd say just listen to the coaches because every game
they're going to have them prepared to win. They have the best fan support in
the nation, and just to play here is a blessing. Just work hard this summer
and listen to the coaches.  
TIA GIBBS: Well, for me I think it's just to continue to believe. This year we
believed. We believed in our coaches. We believed in each other, and we
believed that no matter what, we'll have a chance to get to Nashville. You
know, I think I can speak for all of the seniors here, we've matured and we've
trusted our coaches so much that if Coach were to tell us to run through a
brick wall, we'd definitely do it. For the younger ones, coming in at 18 as a
freshman, it's kind of hard to buy in, but once they buy in, we'll have a
special group again. We've got a lot of work to do and we've got a lot of
freshmen coming in, but we still have five seniors, five seniors on the floor
with maybe five or six freshmen coming in. We'll still be a mature team with
the mentality of getting to the Final Four. We'll work.  
  
Q. Jeff, considering the crowd support and what you've seen lately and
having a regional semifinal and final here, what do you think about the odds
of maybe hosting a Final Four here? I guess the NCAA has a rule as far as home
arenas ‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: I'm not sure how that works. I would think you'd want to be able to
host a Final Four on your home court, but I'm not sure what those rules are.
Like I said in my opening statement, we're very blessed to play here and have
the fan support that we have. Tom Jurich believing and putting a bid in to
host a regional, I'm sure that there were a bunch of people that they couldn't
even get their school to even bid on it, to put their name in the pot. You
have to believe in your fans that they're going to come out and support
women's basketball, and ours do. It was a remarkable night tonight.  
  
Q. You said the other day by tip ‑off you'd have a strategy against Alyssa
Thomas. What was that today, and how do you feel your team executed?  
JEFF WALZ: I thought we did a really good job on her. I thought we slowed her
down in the first half. I mean, the frustrating thing for me is we sat there,
the things that I told them we had to do: Stop transition baskets, we did.
They get six points in transition. We had to do a good job on the glass and
limit their second‑chance points. They get six. We just couldn't beat them at
the free‑throw line. They go 25 of 28 from the free‑throw line, we go 11 of
13. We couldn't get there enough. And that really is where the game was won.
It's real simple. We turned it over way too much in the second half, some
uncharacteristic turnovers. When we got up seven there the start of the second
half, we just did some things that we don't do, and you can't do those in a
game like this.  
We had opportunities to get up nine I think at one point, and we throw the
ball out of bounds. If you go back and look at the number of lay‑ups that we
missed, there's at least six, and just one‑on‑one lay‑ups where you've just
got to go finish it, and we didn't finish it tonight.  
Our kids, I'm so proud of them. They played so hard. We never gave up, and
they know it. We give credit to Maryland. It's a great win for them. But when
we sat down in the locker room, we were proud of our fight, but we knew we had
an opportunity here tonight, and we let it slip by, especially with missing as
many lay‑ups as we did.  
  
Q. You talked about that point where you were stuck on 45 for about seven
minutes there and I think Sarah had a lay ‑up rim‑out, Shoni had a‑‑ will you
look back on it as you got the shots you wanted‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: We had some really good shots. Schimmel had one on the baseline off
of a ball screen, a pull‑up that she makes eight out of 10 times. It didn't go
in. I thought we did a decent job for about two minutes of that stretch of
defending them, and then we rushed a couple shots after we had missed four or
five that led to, I think, four of their six transition baskets, and that's
what happens. When you start to press and you really want to make a shot so
bad, sometimes you take one too quick.  
You know, I'm proud of the kids. It's been an unbelievable year. There's no
question that our goal was to get to Nashville, and unfortunately we fell a
game short.  
  
Q. How do you think you'll reflect back on that last minute and 30 seconds
or so, just to furious you came back and the threes that you hit and how close
you came? Was it surprising to see how well, other than the final shot didn't
go in, just how well you guys executed and how you nearly pulled something
off?  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's not surprising to me at all. You know, we have worked on
that last‑second play. We executed it to perfection. We got a great shot. You
really can't ask for anything more.  
We subbed, we had our offensive subs, our defensive subs. Just things that we
do when we work on, we sub on the second made free throw instead of before the
second one so now you've got a dead ball and you can set up your press. If you
sub before that, then when it goes in they have a chance to get it in as quick
as they want. It's things like that that we do practice. It's a tough way to
end.  
  
Q. Coach, your team averages around 19 forced turnovers against some other
teams. You guys forced 15 on Maryland the first half. What were you doing
against Maryland?  
JEFF WALZ: I thought we did a great job of getting our hands in passing lanes.
I thought we back tipped a bunch and got some steals off of those. We forced
them into 25 turnovers, but you can't win by getting one point per turnover.
Our problem was we turned‑‑ we forced them into turnovers in the first half,
but then we turned it over ourselves after we stole the ball, so it washed
itself out. That's what you can't do. We had a lot of opportunities in that
first half to really put some things together and just could not finish it.  
  
Q. Just wanting to reflect on your time with Maryland, when you were with
Maryland, and you knowing the coach there, Brenda, did you and her talk prior
to this game, and if you did, what kind of conversation was that?  
JEFF WALZ: We probably haven't spoken, besides saying hi out there, in six
years. I mean, no, there was really no conversation that took place. We both
have families, we both have teams that we're trying to run. No, but they had a
great season and they played a great game tonight, no question about it.  
  
Q. There's a momentum shift there early in the second half. Were they doing
something differently when they came out of the locker room or whatever that
caused that?  
JEFF WALZ: No, because we went up seven. It's not like they‑‑ it didn't start
the second half. We come out and go up seven and have an opportunity for a
transition lay‑up and throw it‑‑ just got a little too excited and throw it
out of bounds. I don't think they did anything differently. We missed open
shots. We had a great post move by Sara Hammond that's halfway down and comes
out, Shoni gets a great three on the wing that goes in and out. We
unfortunately went for about a four‑minute stretch where we could not get the
ball to go in the basket.  
  
Q. Just talk about Shoni, what she's meant to this program, and sort of the
last few years what she's brought to Louisville basketball.  
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's been a great four years. If she's not one of the top
10 players in the country, top five, I'm not sure what everybody is looking
at. You know, the kid loves the game. She loves to play basketball. That's
what she does. She's been extremely coachable. She's developed her game. I
asked her to work on her pull‑up jump shot this summer, and she did. That
really helped her game.  
She's going to go down as‑‑ her and Angel are the two best players as of right
now that have played here. She took us to a Final Four, to a national
championship game, and it's unfortunate that it had to end tonight the way it
did, but she's meant a lot to not just our program but the city, the fan
support, the amount of people. It's not just us. When we go on road games, the
amount of natives that come out and her and Jude have inspired, it's been a
remarkable story all season long. When you sit there after games and you're
signing autographs when you're at Memphis out by the bus for an hour after the
game, you know, all of our players are, and they're coming up in busloads from
Mississippi because that's the closest game that we played.  
It comes down to the game of basketball, it's wins and losses. There's no
question about it. That's what we're here to do. But this year for our program
it's been a lot more than just that, just seeing how our players have been
able to inspire so many, it's been a wonderful experience.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  76  
Louisville  73

  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, what a great game, just a phenomenal environment. I know
the fans probably didn't enjoy the outcome, but you can't ask for a better
game when you talk about the fans and how many were here. Obviously two teams
you saw battle. Coach Walz and his team battled for 40 minutes when it comes
down to a possession, but I think the biggest thing for our team, what I'm so
proud of is the fact that we had to grow as a team to get to this point, and
to be able to see all of the lessons that we had learned, the sacrificing,
just being prepared for your moment, to be able to see it unfold before your
very eyes is going to be something that each and every one of us is going to
remember for a lifetime.  
Only appropriate, obviously, with everything that Alyssa has done for this
team and this program, that we take her and our five seniors to be able to go
to Nashville.  
  
Q. Alyssa, with as much as you accomplished in your career, now you can add
a Final Four. What does that mean to you personally?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Oh, man, something that I've been wanting for four years, but
we're not done yet. We've still got two more games, and hopefully we can get
this national championship.  
  
Q. Alyssa, Brenda mentioned the great environment that was here tonight. Was
the environment kind of everything you expected it to be, taking into account
how the environment was in the regional semifinal there? Is that something you
weren't surprised when you saw?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, we weren't surprised at all. It was everything we
expected and what we wanted. We wanted to be the people that were cutting the
nets down at the end, and we just wanted to silence the crowd.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that final few seconds, particularly when Shoni
Schimmel gets that last shot up? What were you thinking and your thoughts when
you saw it bounce off?  
KATIE RUTAN: Well, we chose to double her, but they threw a great pass and she
got that. Just thank God Mincy was there to contest that because that ball
went up and I'm pretty sure that ball took about 25 minutes to go through the
air. But then just seeing it just bounce out, I mean, and then the buzzer hit,
I don't have words. Like I just‑‑ my whole life went blank for a second.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think it was probably the longest three seconds, and I spent
that three seconds on the ground watching the shot go up. I was just glad to
see it hit the rim and go out.  
LEXIE BROWN: I mean, they said it all. She had hitback‑to‑back crazy‑wild
clutch shots, so for her to‑‑ it was a great look, and all I could do was pray
that it didn't go in, but when that buzzer sounded I went running to go jump
on the first teammate I could find.  
  
Q. Lexie, did Coach say anything to you to prepare you for the crowd and the
noise and how do you drown it out with so many thousands of fans screaming at
you?  
LEXIE BROWN: She just said to stay poised. The crowd will feed off of your
body language, so if you show them that they're bothering you, they're going
to bother you. The only thing that you can do to silence them is to score and
to get stops, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you're playing a familiar opponent in Notre Dame. Does it help a
little you know who you're playing and probably have a couple scouting reports
from a couple months ago?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It does, especially we had them at home, and we let it slip
away. We let them get up early on us before, but we're a different team now,
and we're looking forward to the match‑up.  
  
Q. Katie, four threes for today. Was there any indication going into the
game that you were feeling good about your stroke?  
KATIE RUTAN: I had a good shootaround and a good coach with Coach B and Coach
Atkins and Coach Langley before the game and Sue, and so my mindset was if I
saw an opening I was going to take it. I play every game like it's my last,
and I'm going to do anything I can. It takes a lot to step up and hit those
threes in a game like this with a crowd like that, but those are moments that
you live for, so that's all I could think about was seeing that ball go
through the net.  
  
Q. For Alyssa and Lexie, the first half Louisville's defense, what was
discussed in the locker room in terms of really trying to beat that in the
second half and really trying to overcome that?  
LEXIE BROWN: We just had to kind of settle down. I think we were playing into
what they wanted, which was a lot of junk defense and a lot of extra
physicality that was unnecessary, but we kind of had to get our minds right,
slow down, get back to our game, run transition and get stops.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We're just getting set up on the offensive end and they were
swiping at the ball, and we just had to cut down on the turnovers and try to
capitalize and score.  
  
Q. Lexie, Brenda mentioned that this team has grown throughout the season,
and four of your past six losses have come on the road, some of them in
hostile environments, especially the Duke match ‑up. What do you think has
grown about this team to be able to pull out a win in front of such a big
crowd in such a hostile environment?   
LEXIE BROWN: I just think we've got a renewed focus. We really have come
together as a team these past couple weeks. We've been spending a lot of time
with each other. We've been really getting our chemistry right on the court
and practices we've been working hard for each other and we just have this
new‑found trust and now we have a common goal and we've reached it, so now we
can only go up from here.  
  
Q. Lexie, you were like ice at the foul line down the stretch. I'd like to
ask you how you felt that pressure, if you were thinking about it and that
sort of thing, and I'd like to ask Alyssa and Katie what it was like for you
to watch your freshman guard at the line in a clutch moment like that.  
LEXIE BROWN: Free throws are free shots. It's really about focus. You've got
to tune out the crowd. I think the best thing that Coach B would bring us a
stroke called free throw ladder, and it's the same kind of pressure in
practice, but instead of not scoring any points you got 15, 20 line sprints. I
would take the pressure in a game over free throw ladder any day.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We have complete confidence in our freshmen. I mean, they're in
the game in the tight minutes and making plays for us. I wouldn't have it any
other way.  
KATIE RUTAN: I agree with Alyssa. As Lexie is my shooting partner, I have to
give her a little extra moments, but if the ball is in Lexie's hand I'm more
than confident than anything. I don't think she's a freshman anymore. She
doesn't play like this. She doesn't hold herself as it. To see her on the
line, I just knew it was two easy points, and I knew she was going to hit it
no doubt.  
  
Q. Take us through what you said to your team to kind of prepare them for
the crowd out there and the hostile environment.  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, the last couple days I can't say enough for our staff
in terms of the teamwork and obviously all season in terms of what our staff
has done to prepare this team. You know, we really got them to buy into
welcoming the environment, embracing it, being excited, being able to silence
them, being able to get them to boo against you, and really just enjoy it.  
If this was three months ago we wouldn't have been prepared or been in this
place, but just to see this team grow, the trust level, the confidence level
was really special to be able to watch.  
  
Q. There's a chance if Carolina holds on this could be a very similar
situation with three ACC teams you've already played. Does it help you to play
familiar teams that you already know, sort of take some of that out of it?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, there was a lot of déjà‑vu going on these last
couple days. I've already had that feeling in terms of feeling that us and
Carolina could advance, three ACC teams. It brings back special memories
obviously from 2006. And really the teamwork is the same, when you talk about
your players and your staff and your support staff, very similar to '06 in
terms of just being lined up together.  
  
Q. I know you said before that everyone knows your name now after you beat
Tennessee. Clearly everyone is talking the UConn ‑Notre Dame match‑up for the
championship game. It's the hype, it's already been said that's what's
happening. Does it make it easier, you guys are there, there isn't the
pressure with the underdog in that game?   
BRENDA FRESE: I love it. I love it. It's par for the course. You know,
continue to talk and we'll just try to fly under the radar and just be who we
are. Nobody expected us to be able to walk in here in front of 15,000‑plus
fans to be able to pull off this upset. It's easy to say that a team should
win on their home court, but this team just keeps believing and they just keep
staying grounded, and we'll just continue to be true to ourselves.  
  
Q. The game was so fast ‑paced throughout, there was a lot of turnovers from
both teams. You guys had 15 turnovers in the first half. When a game is going
back and forth like that so quickly, what do you say to your team to kind of
calm their nerves or make sure you guys get more solid possessions throughout
a game?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think one of the biggest adjustments that we made as a staff
was at halftime when we settled our team down, and then really getting‑‑ every
time‑out we went into talking about ball reversals and being patient. I
thought we were too quick to get the first pass, to be able to go attack, to
go have aggressive pressure that was going on the ball. Making them have to
defend for a longer period of time, the ball reversals, the screening action
we had taking place off the ball reversals was huge.  
  
Q. The kids said what was going through their head the last three seconds.
What was going through your head? Did you think of fouling?  
BRENDA FRESE: There was. Even leading up to that when Alyssa was at the foul
line, our staff talked about‑‑ when I saw her two threes that went in,
absolutely that was my thought, do we foul? Took it into the huddle with the
team, asked them. It's their team. They're going to decide the end, and they
chose not to foul. They wanted to go straight up in terms of what they were
doing. Obviously it paid off for us.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
JEFF WALZ: First off, we're just thrilled to still be having the opportunity
to play. You know, to be playing in a regional championship with eight teams
left, I think it speaks volumes about this group of young women that we have
here that represent our University. The amount of effort, work and dedication
that they've put into this program has been very much appreciated not only by
me but by all of our fans. They've been a great group to coach, and hopefully
we can continue this, but we do know we have a tall task at hand tomorrow
night against a very talented Maryland team that made Tennessee look bad.  
I don't think it's anything that Tennessee did not do in yesterday's game, I
think it was everything that Maryland did. I was so impressed with how well
they rebound the basketball, how they push the ball in transition, did
everything they needed to do to set the tempo of the game and did not let up.  
So we know that tomorrow night should be a lot of fun, should be a great
environment here. Hopefully we can get 13,000 or 14,000 to come out and see a
great women's basketball game. That's what it's all about, two great teams
playing for the opportunity to play in a Final Four.  
I know we're going to be prepared. We're going to play hard, and we're
excited. Thank you.  
  
Q. Shoni, what do you remember about the last time Maryland and Louisville
played, and do you take anything from that game that you can apply to tomorrow
night?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: You know, I remember playing them my sophomore year, and we
didn't rebound there at the end, and we were up by four at one point, and we
ended up losing. You remember that because it's the last time you guys played.
You don't usually play each other until it's tournament time. You take that
and you remember it and you take it like‑‑ you remember it but at the same
time you've got to move forward with it and you've got to go out on the court
and just continue to keep getting better. Now we have the opportunity to play
against each other again. It's going to be a great game. It's going to be
exciting.  
  
Q. Asia and maybe Bria, what do you think about matching up with Alyssa and
what kind of challenges will she present for either of you or for anybody on
the team?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, she's a great player, and we know that. Just from watching
film on her, we're going to get all her tendencies down and what she likes to
do. I don't think you can ever hold a great player scoreless, but you can do
everything in your power to make every bucket that they do score harder than
the previous game. So we're just going to try to take away what she likes to
do and play good scouting report defense and we'll be fine.  
BRIA SMITH: Yeah, definitely going off what Asia says, we're just going to
find out her tendencies and pretty much try to take those things away from
her. I think that it's going to be very difficult because she's such a great
scorer, and she's a hard worker. But we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. For you two and Sara, not only does she handle the ball well, she can
pass out if you do collapse on her. How dangerous does that make her and how
aware do you have to be of the other guards and bigs when she's not getting
the ball out of her hands?  
SARA HAMMOND: Well, I think that's what makes their team so good. I think
that's why they're doing so good right now is they're having other players
step up, and obviously when you have your all‑American in Alyssa Thomas
playing at the top of her game and you have your other teammates around you
playing their best basketball, they've proven they deserve to be where they're
at right now in the Elite 8. So it is going to be challenging, but I think our
coaches are doing a tremendous job in helping us in film and knowing what
their tendencies are, what their strengths are. But people like Mincy and
Brown who are stepping up in the guard positions, like you said, when she
kicks it out, that's another threat that we have to be aware of. I think we
just have to contain her, pick her up early in transition and not allow her to
see the floor and let her do what she normally does. It is going to be
challenge, but I think our team is up to it and our coaches are going to
definitely have us prepared.  
ASIA TAYLOR: Pretty much just the same thing. We just want to play good
scouting report defense. We trust our coaches are going to have us ready,
prepared, and we just have to follow that game plan.  
  
Q. Shoni, just before we came to the press conference we got word that you
were a USBWA All ‑American. What's that mean to you, that you kind of
officially got that, that you're considered among the top 10 players in the
country and got that prestigious honor?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It's a great honor. I've put a lot of hard work in, especially
this last year, so for it to all pay off in the end, it's a great feeling.
Especially where we are right now, it's kind of like, oh, yeah, that's cool,
but at the same time we still have an Elite 8 game to go play. So it's
exciting, and it's a great honor. But I'm ready to play this next game.  
  
Q. Shoni and anyone else, a year ago you played for a trip for Final Four on
someone else's court. Now the idea of being at home where you are, I think, 18
‑1 this season, what's that comfort level like and what kind of a confidence
does it bring?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think it's going to help us a lot, just because we're at
home and the fans are going to be behind us. We have a great fan base, and so
for them to support us throughout every game this season and so forth, like
it's going to be great for us. We're looking forward to playing. It's not just
our fans getting excited. We're excited to play. We're playing in an Elite 8
game, and we're looking forward to it, and we're just ready to play already.  
We still have focus and we still have to take care of business, and that's
going to be on our part. Our coaches are going to do a great job of preparing
us, and we have to go out there and stay true to the game plan.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Just going off what Shoni says, our coaches are going to
have us prepared, just following the scouting report, playing scouting report
defense, hopefully taking care of business at home, hopefully in front of
20,000‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: We'd be okay with that.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Just giving back to our fans.  
  
Q. Sara, tomorrow is sort of a second senior night for a lot of these
players, and especially Tia and Nita will be playing their last game in
Louisville, Louisville kids. What does it mean to see Louisville players at
Louisville and being an in ‑state player, as well, kind of seeing what they've
meant to the city and the program?   
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, just being an in‑state player, it means a lot to us. It's
personal because our family is here, and they get to watch us every chance
they get here in the Yum! Center. I know for Nita and Tia, they've meant a lot
to this program and to this city of Louisville just because like you said
they're from here and they're representing their families, their communities.
I'm excited that they get to play one last game here in the Yum! Center. I'm
sure they were disappointed like we all were in the result we got for senior
night, and I'm just grateful and thankful that they have another opportunity
to play here in front of our fans, in front of their family again, and
hopefully we get a win for them. Not only Nita and Tia, but Shoni and Asia,
all four seniors, we want them to go out with a win.  
  
Q. Bria, has coach discussed with you at all his history at Maryland and
what kind of background, coming up and winning a national championship at
Maryland, has that been discussed at practice and how do you approach getting
a chance to play his former team?  
BRIA SMITH: That hasn't really been discussed. I feel like the motivation
basically is just‑‑ it's an Elite 8 game, and we just want to get out there
and play our hardest because our goal is to get to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Coach, you've played opening round NCAA games in this arena before, but
this is your first go ‑around to host a Sweet 16 and an Elite 8. How much
different is it for your team when you're basically at home just with a
different floor in your arena?   
JEFF WALZ: Well, you pretty much stay with the same routine. Times change. You
don't get the exact shoot‑around time that you normally always have. But
besides that, everything is pretty much the same. Our players are staying in
their dorm rooms. We aren't staying in a hotel. It's not what we do. I mean,
you get the opportunity to play a game at home in the NCAA Tournament, the
reason you do that is so you have the comforts of home, so why would I want to
stick them in a hotel?  
And I've got a group of players that I feel are mature enough to handle the
distractions that might come with that. It's pretty much everything same as
we've always done, just some time changes.  
  
Q. Brenda said she knew right away you'd be a star at your next stop. Can
you talk about what you learned from her maybe, and is there an advantage or
disadvantage of knowing a tendency of a coach you worked with for so many
years?  
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's been seven years, so a lot has changed with both of
our programs, the personnel, you know, things that we do. It's really, for us,
a year to year. What our personnel presents is how we'll try to play. We don't
play the same way as we did in '09 when we had Angel McCoughtry and Candace
Bingham. Angel pretty much just stole it when she wanted to half the time. I
don't have that player out there right now, so we have to play a little more
player‑specific defense and know the tendencies of the opponents.  
We have more players right now than can score for us. Our bench is deeper than
what it has been in the past, so we try to take whatever we have that's to our
advantage and make sure we use it.  
The one thing I say is I'm not stubborn in how I coach. I don't have an ego.
If we need to throw it in the post 50 times, we'll throw it in the post. If we
need to shoot 30 threes like we did yesterday, we'll shoot 30 threes. I'm not
claiming to be smart, but I'm not dumb. I'm not going to sit there and say
this is what we have to do if it's not working.  
So we are willing to change up. I had a great six years, a year at Minnesota,
which was an outstanding experience, was fortunate enough to have Brenda hire
me after I spent six years with Paul Sanderford, I go back to Paul, and Paul
is one where I was fortunate enough to just learn a ton of basketball from.
The man should be in the women's basketball Hall of Fame, and unfortunately
for some reason he's not. He only took three teams at western Kentucky to
Final Fours. So hopefully somebody in women's basketball might figure that
out.  
And I learned a lot of basketball from that man. Seeing how he handled himself
during games, not worried about the first 10 minutes of the game of running
something if you're going to score, more so how are they defending it. So in a
time‑out you make an adjustment.  
And then Brenda gave me the opportunity to come join her at Minnesota, and it
was a great experience. Brenda is a coach, and I've said it all along, we had
the opportunity to work together for six years, one at Minnesota, five at
Maryland, and she has no ego when it comes to the game. She allowed me to
coach. She gave me the freedom to do some basketball things that I learned
from Paul. I learned a ton about recruiting from her. She was relentless when
it came to recruiting.  
She was doing it before most head coaches were. She'd miss four or five days
of practice and go out on the road recruiting, knowing, hey, we have to get
better players if we're going to want to compete with Dukes when we first got
there, and then she was confident enough to say, all right, hey, my staff
that's back here, you guys take care of practice. We obviously discussed with
her what we were doing. Erica Floyd at the time, Brenda's sister Marsha, then
Marsha moved on and Joanna Bernabei joined our staff. She was confident enough
to hire people that were good at what they did and allowed us to do it, and
that's not always the case. There's some that are like, hey, I want the reins
of all of it, and I think those are the ones that you see that aren't as
successful as Brenda has been.  
She does a great job with her players. There's no doubt there's a lot of
respect there. They play hard for her. She motivates them. I was fortunate to
get into a situation where she was confident in herself, and at the same time
I knew I was an assistant. I wasn't trying to take over. That's not what I
wanted to do.  
But because she allowed me to do so much, it helped me get this job, because
that's one thing when I asked Tom Jurich why did you hire me, he's like, hey,
I was able to see what you were doing during games even as an assistant, and
not everybody allows you to do that, and Brenda was comfortable enough in her
own skin to say, hey, we want to win, and she allowed me to do some of those
things, and that's why I've been‑‑ I've had the opportunity to be here, and I
try to do the same thing with my staff. We've had three of my assistants now
move on to be head coaches in the past seven years. The past two years we've
had one turn over, and we don't have assistants going on to take other
assistant jobs. They're going on to take head coaching jobs, which I think
speaks volumes for our program and for how I try to treat my assistants,
because I want them to have as much responsibility and as much into this as I
do.  
  
Q. You saw Alyssa Thomas score 33 in such a big game yesterday. You see how
she's been able to perform. She had 32 against Wake Forest in the ACC
Tournament, these big games of her career. It's another big stage for her.
What's the plan to make sure she doesn't go 30?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm hoping she misses the bus, which would be great. So we're going
to change the arrows down there where their bus is supposed to be before they
come to the arena, first off.  
She's not a kid that you're going to shut down. It's just not going to happen.
What you have to do is just try to make it difficult for her to score. You
can't give her easy looks. She doesn't miss the easy shots, and she makes a
lot of the tough ones.  
So for us we have to make sure we're making it as difficult as we can for her
to score the basketball, and then we have to do a good job on everybody else.
I think at times you get caught up on the star player, and all of a sudden
you're giving wide‑open shots to other ones that start going in, and now all
of a sudden you've got five or six players that you're really out there trying
to defend, and now you really can't focus that attention on her, and she goes
for 30, which is what I thought she did last night.  
Laurin Mincy stepped in, came in off the bench and hit two big shots for them.
Lexie Brown was playing very well. And now Alyssa Thomas is one‑on‑one, and
you can't stop that kid one‑on‑one; it's about impossible.  
What she did last night, I've seen her do it before on film, and now that I've
had the opportunity to watch some film, she's pretty impressive.  
  
Q. You mentioned not being able to stop Alyssa Thomas. The last time you
played you limited her to six points. Is there anything you can take away from
that game that you can apply defensively to her this time?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, that was when she was a sophomore. She's had two years to
really work on her game, and she's done that. You know, she's not the same
player she was as a sophomore in college. If she was, then I'd feel good that
we could hold her to about 10, but unfortunately she's really worked on all
aspects of her game.  
I have gone back and looked at that film, trying to see what we did to her,
how we frustrated her, but unfortunately I don't think it's going to be as
easy tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When you look at how Jude's game has matured, what she means to you when
she comes on the floor, and just kind of gets you guys settled, makes the
right decisions, and then watching Shoni not just always go to the three, the
mid ‑range game, the ability to cut down the turnovers, that kind of thing,
how have you watched their games improve? Was that all part of the game plan
or just take them will care of business?   
JEFF WALZ: You know, it's all about film work, it's all about sitting down
with players and trying to develop them as they get older and mature. For
Shoni, it's all about time and score, and that's one thing that I think she
has really grown into, the knowledge of that. When you go back to her freshman
year, she wanted to win so bad, which all freshmen do. They all want to try to
win basketball games, and don't always do it in the best way. You're down
eight and they're coming down the floor firing up shots, and it's like,
there's no such thing as an eight‑point shot.  
Now we get down eight, ten, it's, hey, let's relax, people. Let's get the ball
inside out, let's get a good shot and then let's come up with a stop. Those
are the things that she's really grown into.  
Her passing, which I think you saw in yesterday's game. Starting off the game
there were some simple chest passes, bounce passes, and then we get a little
bit of lead and then she throws the behind‑the‑back pass to Jude, she lays it
in, and the whole place goes crazy. Those are big plays for us, too, but I
really have a hard time thinking if it would have been like a two‑ or
four‑point game that she tries to throw that pass because she had Antonita
Slaughter slicing down on the right, I think she just drops the pass to
Antonita for a lay‑up. Knowing time and score is really important for Shoni.  
Jude is just playing with a lot of confidence. Jude has the ability, the
basketball IQ, that is probably as high as any player that I've coached. She
understands the game. She's always asking questions. She's the type of kid
that can go out there, I can put her on somebody, she'll get beat once, but
she's not going to get beat twice with the same move. And that takes some
talent and some still because you've got to be able to adjust in the middle of
a game.  
I thought in yesterday's game when she went out there and went on Ballard, she
actually did a great job. Did she score, yes, but she also disrupted a lot of
things that she was trying to do, which made it harder for her to score.  
So Jude is very, very important to this basketball team. She also has the
ability to knock down some open shots, and when she does that, it just spreads
everything out.  
She had a great drive and dish to Antonita in the first half that kind of
started our run. We're expecting the same type of play out of her tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Do you expect to put Taylor or Smith on Thomas?  
JEFF WALZ: All five. We're going to put all five on her and leave the other
ones wide open and see if they're in such awe that they just miss shots. You
know, we're actually still debating on what we're going to do, but come 7:00
tomorrow we will have a plan. You know, will it work, I'm not sure yet, but
that's one thing that I feel good about is we will come with a game plan. Our
kids will execute that game plan, and then if it's not working, like I said,
I'm not stubborn enough to stay in it; we'll switch. We might have to go
through three or four game plans until we figure out what can slow her up. But
our ultimate goal is to try to get that done before it's too late.  
  
Q. With this being your second trip to the Elite 8 after last year's Final
Four and the team a few years back that went to the Final Four, do you think
it's safe to say that Louisville women's basketball is firmly in the
conversation when it comes to the elite teams in the country?  
JEFF WALZ: I would hope so. I mean, we've had the opportunity, besides UConn
and Notre Dame, we're the only team that's played for two national
championships in the past five years. So I think that puts us with a pretty
good group of teams right there.  
That's not Baylor, that's not Tennessee. You're looking at Louisville, UConn
and Notre Dame, which I still go back, and I'm very proud to be in the AAC
right now, but you look at the teams that used to be in the Big East, boy, I
still argue that the Big East was the best women's basketball conference for
years.  
You've got three of us right now, the old Big East teams again playing in
Elite 8 games with a chance to go to a Final Four. We've had that experience
of playing some great basketball teams, so we know tomorrow is going to be a
battle. But it's one that our kids have been through before.  
  
Q. Can you kind of summarize thinking back on the careers of the two
Louisville players that are on the team and who will be playing their last
game in Louisville tomorrow night, Tia and Nita, and what has it kind of meant
that you've had those two local players and the accomplishments they've had?  
JEFF WALZ: It's been great. You know, it's something we really don't sit here
right now and look back on and try to bring some tears and all that good
stuff. I mean, we have a game to play tomorrow. That's really all we're
focused on. Having even thought about the fact that it's their last home game
for sure because our goal is to get to Nashville. That's been our goal from
day one when the season started.  
And now we've got the opportunity to play a great Maryland team on our home
court with the chance to do that. You know, that's our focus. That's our
complete focus. Haven't even thought about anything else. All of our seniors
have meant an unbelievable amount to our program. Tia has been here about as
long as I have, going on year six as a player. She got her clock extended
because of all the injuries that she's had. It's remarkable that she's been
able to make it through this year. I mean, I don't think people have any idea
what she's gone through, just her body, the aches, the bruises, the pain, but
she's figured out a way to do it.  
Antonita with the scare that we had in December, just so fortunate and very
blessed that she's even able to come back and play.  
So we've had‑‑ these kids have dealt with a lot and been through a lot. It's a
great group of young women, and we're going to miss all the seniors for sure,
and I know these two have meant a lot to this program and this city because
they are from Louisville.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously we're happy to still be playing. As you've seen in our
last couple games, I mean, it's been against really rugged opponents, and we
expect more of the same in our next game out. Obviously getting to a regional
final, you've had a really, really good season, but I know this team wants so
much more.  
I was really impressed with the fans that we saw come out on Sunday. You can
tell how much support that they have for their team, and it's really how
college basketball is supposed to be. I know for us, Tuesday night is going to
be a fun environment to be able to play in front of so many fans.  
Clearly Schimmel is the star of the show. So much fun for fans to be able to
watch. But as you look at Louisville's team they have a lot of other really,
really good parts. Didn't get to see Louisville much in the regular season. We
didn't have really many common opponents, didn't come across much film with
them. But I kind of liken them, they're somewhat similar, I think, to their
team in 2012 when we played them in the NCAA Tournament.  
I think it's great in terms of what Jeff has been able to accomplish here. So
proud of him. I knew when we worked together that he would be a star. We went
through a lot obviously in our four years together. I can think back to our
first season when we went down and played Duke and got drilled by them by 51
points, and four years later we were standing on the podium to be able to win
a national championship.  
So that whole staff, including Jeff, was a very important part of our success,
and it was a really fun time for us as a program.  
I think the biggest thing when you look at what Jeff and I have done, we've
taken our programs to this status. You take about that inevitably our paths
were going to cross. The reality is we've continued to cross on numerous
occasions, but the reality is only one team gets to move on to Nashville. I
think where you're looking at both teams, both teams are playing extremely
well. That's where you should be playing if you're an Elite 8 team, and I know
both teams are going to be ready to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you remember about the last time you played Louisville? I
think they held you to six points. Do you take anything from that going into
this game?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, that was my sophomore year, and they just came in and
tried to take me out early and get in my head. I'm definitely a different
player from back then, so I'll be interested to see what happens.  
  
Q. Alyssa, you play at a regional final, usually you're going to be playing
in a very tough environment. Talk about playing Louisville, they had 10,000
plus yesterday, 11,000, going to be a lot of people, probably going to be
pretty hostile. Do you kind of expect that at this point of the season, and
how do you deal with that?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, we were there yesterday and just the environment that
they had, the fans were great, very loud. We're definitely expecting that
tomorrow, and looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Katie, as a senior can you speak to what it means to you to be in the
Elite 8 and the opportunity that's in front of you?  
KATIE RUTAN: I mean, of course being one of the last eight teams is one of the
greatest feelings you'll ever have, and going out your senior year, us five
seniors, this is all we have left and we put everything into it every day, and
we try to show that through in practice and games to our underclassmen and to
whoever is watching. Not many people get this moment, and you have to
appreciate it and just be humble with it.  
  
Q. Alicia, Brenda mentioned it would be another rugged team you're playing
in the tournament. The past two games it's been really tough battles inside.
What do you anticipate going into this game?  
ALICIA DeVAUGHN: From here on out, all our games we're going to be playing are
going to be a physical game, so I think it's just match the physicality and
not just give in and not give up, just got to play hard and play good.  
  
Q. Alyssa, coming off of yesterday's game, career game in some senses for
you. How much confidence does that give you going into tomorrow, and then what
do you kind of think about that you have stepped up and played these great
games on some of the biggest stages with the most on the line?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: It's just good to see your shot falling on this court. Tomorrow
is just about letting the game come to you and not forcing anything.  
  
Q. The last time Louisville and Maryland played, Maryland had to overcome
some foul trouble. Is that something you're focusing on to make sure you don't
get into foul trouble early so you can stay in the game?  
BRIONNA JONES: Definitely that's going to be a focus for this game, trying to
stay out of foul trouble so everybody can be in the game and play, so we have
all the pieces that we need.  
  
Q. Katie and Lexie, Louisville shoots the three so well and they knocked
down a bunch yesterday. What do you have to do to try to attack them and keep
them from getting into a rhythm from outside the arc?  
KATIE RUTAN: Well, we have to be on attack. Obviously we can't give them the
space they need, so it's more focusing on being there on the catch and not
giving them the easy open looks. When they're open they can hit shots easy,
but to be in them it's going to make the game tougher for them and their shots
a lot tougher.  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, going with what Katie said, it's going to be all about our
communication on the defensive end, switches when necessary, and we just have
to be all up in their face before they can even get a shot off, and it's going
to turn into a mental thing to make sure that they don't get any shots off.  
  
Q. Brionna or Katie, were you aware that Jeff Walz was an assistant at
Maryland? Is that something that comes up? It's been seven years since he's
been at Louisville, but is that something that you guys were aware of or that
people in the program are aware of?  
KATIE RUTAN: Yeah, just knowing the history of Maryland basketball and when
they won, you know who was there, who was a part of it, and he was one of the
major parts of that team.  
Just hearing from Coach Frese the history they had together, he's a great
coach, and when he was at Maryland he made his mark.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what do you feel like makes this such a tough match ‑up for teams
now, the four years that you've been doing it? Why is it that you feel like
you've really ascended to the level that you are and that you are as hard to
defend as you are?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think just my versatility, being able to play inside,
outside. I can take it off the bounce, and just am able to hit the open
player, that it's not just all about getting my shot.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage or a disadvantage when you're playing against someone
you worked with for so long? You know his tendencies, he may know yours. How
does that work?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, yeah, obviously I think we both know‑‑ I mean, when
I'm watching film and I see some of the different sets, we've run them at
Maryland. So I think we can both on the sideline understand kind of what's
coming next and fully can prepare our team.  
But at the end of the day, it's the players. I mean, yeah, as coaches we have
our programs, and I'm very proud of everything that Jeff has accomplished.
That's part of our tree and where he got one of his starts. But this game
belongs to the players. Every step of the way that we've gone, it's been about
the players taking the game plan and the scout and executing it, and I really
think it's obviously going to come down to that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Your depth must be a luxury for you after all you've gone through with
the injuries, and you talk about it's all about the players, the joy that they
show to be able to be healthy, give you guys a chance for rotations, it's been
joyful to watch that.  
BRENDA FRESE: Thank you. I would agree. It's been a work in progress. Each and
every player this year has had to sacrifice minutes, roles. You look at Laurin
Mincy, a starter in our program who had to sacrifice this year for the better
of the team to be able to come off the bench for us. But as you've seen it all
line up together in our run here, it's the true definition of a team. When
you're allowed, like we've said, we can go two or three deep at every single
position, and when you look at we're really kind of opposite ends of the
spectrum where we were a season ago when we were kind of limping to the finish
line, to get to the Sweet 16, to now what we went through a year ago to be in
this position.  
  
Q. You mentioned you could take some things from I couldn't match ‑up
against Louisville in 2012. What specifically do you think you could take?   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, obviously the physicality is going to be there
obviously from the tip. I thought watching Louisville live last night, they
were even more physical than what I saw on film. Their box‑outs, how they're
going to rebound, in my opinion they're a better rebounding team than
Tennessee. When you talk about that kind of physicality, we saw it back then,
it's been a staple of who they are and it's obviously something that we have
to be prepared for.  
You know, I think any time ‑‑ we've both played each other twice now, we're
1‑1, so obviously we know what to expect.  
  
Q. You mentioned Laurin, she had a huge game last night Louisville and
Maryland played. What kind of contributions do you want to see from her
tomorrow night?  
BRENDA FRESE: Just more of the same. She's come in ready in the first half and
has given us just a huge boost off the bench. I mean, her scoring, her
defense, her toughness, to be able to see Laurin now coming off of her knee
injury at full strength, we knew Laurin would get to this point, we just
didn't know how long it was going to take. To see it all kind of coming at the
right time for her is really special to be able to see.  
  
Q. I know you'd love to be home and playing in front of your fans, and yet
tomorrow will be special. There will be a lot of folks here and some special
kids on both teams. This is what women's basketball needs and is all about,
correct?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah. You know, I'm just going to visualize that sea of red as
for Maryland, that they're screaming for Maryland. But it is; I'm going to
embrace the moment. So is our team. We've worked hard just as Louisville has.
This is what you talk about star power, depth, talent, two evenly matched
teams. It's made for TV, two coaches that have worked together, and you've got
all the drama and all the excitement. We're going to embrace it. We're going
to love every single moment of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what's your relationship like with Jeff now? How often
do you stay in touch? What's it been like since you guys have moved on and are
no longer on the same staff?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, I take full credit for all of his success.
I've taught him everything he knows. (Laughter.)  
You know, I mean, Jeff was a huge part of our program. In the four years, I
said before, I knew he'd be a star because his work ethic, how he thought,
really talented. I've been really fortunate just like my current staff to have
great assistant coaches.  
I'm not surprised for Jeff to be able to come in here and have the support.
It's even better coming here to be able to see my first time in the Yum!
Center and the fans and the support that he has, so I'm really, really proud
of him.  
Obviously we cross paths. We're both extremely busy juggling our families as
well as our teams. But we cross paths on the recruiting trails, and we've
recruited some of the same players. But obviously thrilled for him in terms of
the success that he's had.  
  
Q. I believe that was a career high for points yesterday for Alyssa against
Tennessee. Is that a result of a match ‑up or do you let your star players go
at this point of the season?   
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, it was a great day for the Thomas family
that I heard her sister Lexie won the halftime show with musical chairs, so I
think it shows you how competitive their family is.  
Seriously, with Alyssa, our staff has been blessed to be able to watch her for
four years. When you talk about the human spirit and her will to win and how
she elevates everyone to follow her lead, it's incredible to be able to watch.
And I think the thing that separates her as a player is, yes, she puts the
team on her back and makes these incredible runs and plays and finishes and
rebounds, but she also does it within the framework of the team, and like you
saw yesterday, there's times when she knows she needs to give it up. She knows
now she can trust her teammates and the depth we have on this team.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches at this stage might shy away from saying we can win it
all. This team has Final Four written all over it; you will know us after this
game. The boldness, obviously that's you, and the kids kind of extend off
that; is that the mindset, what you bring to the table, or is it just your
personality, and speaking of the last question, you just let her fly?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think for any team and any program, you have to have
confidence. You wouldn't be in this position if you didn't. Yeah, you know, if
it comes across as bold, the snippet that you get in a pregame locker room
talk and don't get it all, but yeah, you have to believe it. You have to
believe that you can win the whole thing. You have to believe you can get to a
Final Four. You have to believe you can get to a Sweet 16. You have to believe
you can beat a No.1 seed. If you don't have that mindset, you're not going to
win.  
Fortunately for us, our team has a ton of confidence, and we believe in each
other.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Louisville  73  
LSU  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to open it up with opening remarks from coach.  
COACH WALZ: First I'd like to just start off by saying thanks to all the fans.
What an environment we had here today for both games.  
That's what I know we're trying to do is get as much publicity, as many fans
as we can to come out and watch women's basketball. I thought our marketing
department, the University of Louisville did a fantastic job.  
I'm expecting an even bigger crowd for Tuesday night, which is only good for
our game.  
I would also like to congratulate LSU on a great year. We understand how
things can be when you lose a few kids to injuries. Unfortunately for them, it
was at a tough time of the year to try to regroup, but I thought they fought.  
I was very impressed with Danielle Ballard. We knew coming into the game
tonight how well she had been playing. She was extremely hard to defend. She's
got a great midrange game and goes to the offensive glass extremely well. So
we had a hard time containing her, but I thought we did a good job on the rest
of their players. That's what gave us the opportunity to win the ball game.  
  
Q. For Tia, what were you doing effectively defensively to wear them out to
cause them to shoot such a low percentage?  
TIA GIBBS: I think we just focused on our pressure. We knew we needed to slow
Ballard down or attempt to as much as we could. I think our post did a great
job on Plaisance. Those are kind of their two go‑to players.  
The rest of us just were playing scouting report defense. We knew what the
other team was going to do, and we tried to prevent them from doing it.  
  
Q. Question for Tia and Shoni. Talk about the hammer you guys have been
laying down in the tournament. Would you have expected that you would have won
by these kinds of margins and be up from start to finish in these games the
way that you have so far? What do you think has contributed to that?  
TIA GIBBS: I think it's just that we don't actually play the score. We won't
let up on people, and we know that there's a lot that we still have to work
on.  
So we can be up 30 with a minute left, and we're getting upset at our players
for doing something wrong. So I think it's just our focus and knowing that we
still need to get better and not play the score.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I think the big thing is we can't take anybody lightly
regardless if there's still eight minutes left in the game. We were the person
last year that everybody didn't expect to win. We know what it's like to be on
the other side.  
We like to keep pushing at it. Regardless of who's winning, we just want to
keep going and keep getting better. Regardless of anything, we still want to
play one more game after the one we're playing in right then and there.  
  
Q. The back ‑to‑back three‑pointers got the team going. What was going
through your mind in terms of just trying to get open for a shot? Were you
thinking about the three? Was it a matter of just maybe trying to answer
Danielle and what she was doing and really just become involved in the
offense?   
TIA GIBBS: I don't think I was trying to answer what she was doing. I was just
trying to provide a spark to the team. Coming off the bench, that's kind of
what our job is to do. Whether it's on defense, making threes, whatever the
case. My teammates did a great job looking for me. They were the ones creating
the open shots by driving and kicking to me.  
It's easy to knock them down when somebody is pulling two people towards them.  
  
Q. Shoni, can you just describe your play so far in this tournament and
today, not just in terms of scoring, but also efficiency.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah. Well, it's tournament time. So it's kind of like if you
win, you're done. That's important to me because I don't think we should lose.
I think we need to come out and play strong every game because, if you lose,
you are done.  
I mean, I'm just letting the game come to me. I'm having fun. It's been a
blast these last couple of games just because we're just enjoying the game of
basketball. I mean, I'm having fun just playing what I love to do.  
  
Q. Shoni, it's an 11 ‑12 game, media time‑out. Then you guys take off on an
11‑2 run. Did Coach Walz say anything that inspired you all go on that run?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: He probably stuttered a little bit just because that's him.
Coach is always talking to us, getting us ready to go out and play for the
next four minutes until whatever the next media may be.  
He says a lot of great things, but we also as a collective group, as a team,
we talk to each other a lot. We hype each other up. We get out and like, hey,
you've got to do this better. We just talk to each other as a team. We're at a
good point with our team where like we're able to do that with each other.  
  
Q. Shoni, when did you kind of think about ‑‑ I mean, were you aware sort of
that they didn't have very many players? Did you feel like you guys could kind
of take it to them, that they only had eight players available and two
starters out? Did that sort of give you motivation to sort of put the pedal to
the metal against them?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Definitely. In the back of your mind, you know that they are
kind of short a team. They lost two players, important players that they
needed. So for us, take advantage of that.  
It wasn't what we strived at, but we also understood, hey, they don't have
these two players. We still have to play Danielle Ballard. We still have to
play Theresa Plaisance, so for us not to take them lightly and just keep going
at them. It definitely helped us. You can overlook somebody, but at the same
time, we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Nita, you are a starter in the game. What do you think about the bench
that you guys have pretty much ‑‑ I don't even know if you're aware of it.
You've almost shut out every team, the reserves have. How important is the
bench to your team compared to how good other benches are for other teams and
how much your bench has outplayed other benches?   
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Coach actually just read out a crazy stat. It was like 80
points‑‑ yeah, 84‑2\.  
Our bench means a lot to us. It's a team sport. One of us goes down, we need
rest, we've got players on the bench that can come in and just give us a spark
of energy, and that's good to have on a team.  
  
Q. For Antonita, a year ago you all were in that same position as LSU, just
really trying to get everybody to chip in because of injuries. If you could
kind of compare what the mentality is now to then in terms of having everybody
back and how much that's really, really helped you, particularly this time of
year.  
ANTONITA SLAUGHTER: Yeah, I'd say the mentality last year, no one expected us
to win, so we came together and we did what we did. But this year people know
our name and they know who we are. So we just have to, like Shoni was saying,
not overlook anyone and just leave it all on the court.  
  
Q. Tia, what was your thoughts on the crowd today? 11,000 people here and
getting to play a Sweet 16 game at home with that kind of a crowd. What did
that do for you guys?  
TIA GIBBS: Well, our crowd has been great all season, and our following just
continues to grow. So I don't think we expected nothing less but the 11,000
that we received.  
As you can tell, it kind of provides a spark to us. We take advantage of
having the crowd and playing the Sweet 16 on our home court. Like I said
before, we're very fortunate that our athletic department took a chance and
believed in us that we would make it this far to give us the opportunity to
play‑‑ to have a chance to play on our home court to get to Nashville.  
THE MODERATOR: That's our time with the University of Louisville
student‑athletes. We'll open things up for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, compare and contrast Shoni's play this tournament as opposed to
other tournaments.  
COACH WALZ: She always figures out a way to play her best basketball at the
right time of the season. I think you can go back to her freshman year. We
went on the road at Xavier, a 2‑7 game in the second round where we weren't
given much of a chance.  
I can still remember she hit back‑to‑back threes in the last two minutes of
the game on shots that most kids probably aren't going to take. It's a
one‑on‑four fast break, and she's the one. That's kind of how she plays.  
Now I think, as she's gone and gotten older and more mature, she's letting the
game come to her more. I was really impressed. She goes 6 of 13 from the
field. They were doing a really nice job trying to face guard her, trying to
frustrate her, and she didn't force thing. She let the game come to her.  
She did not force any threes, six assists, two turnovers, just a solid
basketball game, and she's been playing that way the entire tournament. So
hopefully, that will continue.  
  
Q. Jeff, obviously, Tuesday night you'll be facing your former team,
Maryland, where you coached at. Your thoughts on that. And what were you
looking for today, knowing that you were going to be facing them? What kind of
effort were you looking for today?  
COACH WALZ: You know what, we haven't even worried about that yet. We haven't
even concerned ourselves about it. I told the kids we're going to enjoy this
for about two hours. We'll go get something to eat together, have some fun and
some laughs, talk about the game.  
Then we'll get together as a coaching staff and start putting together a game
plan, starting to break down some film. We know we're going to have our hands
full. They're a very talented basketball team. They've got great size. Alyssa
Thomas has been playing passionate basketball. She's on a mission to get her
team to a Final Four.  
So we know what's at stake. We understand what we're going to have to do. Now
it's a matter of us being able to put a game plan together to try to slow them
up.  
  
Q. As a followup, any thoughts about facing your former boss on Tuesday
night?  
COACH WALZ: I don't worry about that. It's the third time we played‑‑ we
played each other in the NCAA Tournament, and we're 1‑1\.  
I haven't scored a point since about '92, and I'm not even sure I scored that
year. So it's not about me. I've got to do my job to get these kids prepared
and motivated and confident that on Tuesday night, if we follow a game plan
and go out and execute, then we're going to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight you faced a rather different post ‑game than is likely to
be the case on Tuesday, in that they had so much height on you, but you still
effectively shut that post‑game down. Maryland, you're more on even footing
with in terms of size‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Have you looked at their size? They've got 6'6" starting, 6'5",
and 6'4". We're at 6'1", and we lie about our height.  
  
Q. You lie?  
COACH WALZ: We're all about 6 foot if we're lucky.  
  
Q. Can we quote you on that?  
COACH WALZ: You sure can. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.  
  
Q. But in terms of players who score the most points.  
COACH WALZ: Yes, they have great size in there. Everybody does it with the
media guide. You're always going to make your kids up to be a little bit
taller so they think, oh, gosh, she's 6'2". We don't have that. Sara Hammond
is a good 6'1". Asia Taylor is about 6 foot, 6'1". We know we're going to have
to rebound the basketball. That's my biggest concern.  
You're looking at a ball club that I thought handled Tennessee extremely well
on the defensive glass, stopping them from getting any second chance points,
and that's what Tennessee makes a living off of. Maryland was fantastic with
that.  
And then I thought Alyssa Thomas, in a really important part to the game,
where Tennessee thought they had a little bit of a run going. They get it to
ten, they got it to eight at one point, and she comes back with the offensive
board and stick‑back. Ones that as a coach, you're like, man, if you're on the
other sideline, it's a dagger. It's one you can't have.  
So they are very talented. They're very strong. We're going to have to give
the best effort we've given all season long on boxing out.  
  
Q. If I could just follow on that, with the mobility that Thomas has and the
ball handling skills, which are pretty impressive ‑‑  
COACH WALZ: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. I know you did a lot of trapping and denial to Plaisance tonight.  
COACH WALZ: They're completely different players. Thomas is playing the three
for them. So she'll post up some, but she's getting most of her work done on
the perimeter, attacking off the dribble.  
Plaisance is a great outside shooter. She really missed Kenney on the floor.
Having a point guard that's a senior that understands the game as well as she
did, she's‑‑ when I watched the film, she was able to pick teams apart. Was
she getting 20 a night? No, but she was‑‑ if you threw in all of her assists
and how she got people to have to guard her because she could shoot the three,
Plaisance really missed her on the floor in this game.  
So Tuesday night, Alyssa Thomas is a completely different player, no question
about it, but they're still going to put the traditional four and five on the
floor that have great size. So we're going to have to make sure we somehow
figure out a way to box out Alyssa Thomas and then both of their big posts.  
  
Q. Jeff, same question I asked the players, but have you been surprised that
margins of victory that you've had, just you've really ‑‑ have you played a
better stretch than you are now? You mentioned, before the tournament, you're
talking about you've tended to think that after the two‑week break, you guys
always sort of peak at the right time. Are you doing that now? Have you been
surprised at just the blowouts you guys have had, 25, 40 points?   
COACH WALZ: I think we're playing really good basketball right now. Did we
look to me exceptionally sharp in the first half in the half‑court? No. I
thought LSU really did good things in trying to confuse us some, trying to
make things a little unorthodox. But I thought we really did a nice job of
just attacking out of transition.  
We had some really nice kick‑outs from our post players for some open threes,
and that really got things going for us. I think the first half we go 7 of 18
from the three‑point line. If you're going to do that, it's going to make
things a little difficult for your opponent, and then it spreads the floor out
for us.  
I mean, I told our team, we didn't have a true post entry pass probably until
about ten minutes left in the game where we actually were posting up on the
low block and then threw a post entry pass. We can't do that on Tuesday night.
We've got to try to go inside out, try to get a presence in the post.  
Not that we're just going to barrel somebody over and dominate them, but Sara
Hammond and Asia Taylor do a great job of reverse pivot, face up, shoot the 10
to 12‑foot shot. Those are things that we have to do in the post because we
have to have a post presence in order for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Is your team playing its best basketball these last couple of games? And
if so, why?  
COACH WALZ: It's not that we're playing our best basketball. I mean, we're
winning by larger margins than we have in the past. I've had a lot of people
say, well, why couldn't you guard like this all year? Why couldn't you guard‑‑
because we can't.  
For six games, they let me coach them. I mean, they let me, when they don't do
it right at practice, boy, I'm on them. I'm demanding it from them, and you
can't do that the entire season. It's not what they're going to be able to
handle.  
So we go play some people, and we're up 25, and instead of putting the hammer
down and winning by 40, we give up a 7‑0 run. So now it's 8 with two minutes
left. Well, I tell my assistants all the time, relax, we're going to win, it's
okay.  
So there's time and places when you can push your players to try to get the
most out of them, and because we've had success here in the postseason, and I
think we've done fairly well, my kids know, okay, the conference tournament's
over. Coach is going on his mission, stay out of his way, and they let me do
it because they want to win. They know what the prize is at the end.  
Does it guarantee we're going to win every game? No, it sure doesn't. If that
was the case, we'd have two National Championships here, but they go into it
with such more focus.  
I mean, you look at this tonight, we held them to 23 and 24 points in each
half. I mean, Plaisance goes 1 for 13, Harden goes 1 for 11. Ballard is
phenomenal, there's no question about it. I was so impressed with her and have
been on film. So I was like, guys, we're not going to be able to shut her
down. We've just got to try to make it hard on her, but we've got to be able
to shut everybody else down, which is what I thought our kids did, and they
did a great job of that.  
In the past, we might get up 18 or 19 and then we allow Plaisance to hit
back‑to‑back threes. We give Harden, who I think is a great three‑point
shooter‑‑ our number one goal was to run her off the three‑point line. You've
got to make her put it on the ground. We did a fantastic job of that. These
ladies did an unbelievable job of that.  
During the regular season, it's very possible we probably would have given her
two threes too. Now they're honed in, and they know personnel. That's what
makes us, I think, a very talented and good basketball team right now.  
  
Q. Jeff, how have Asia and Tia helped make this team what it was this season
separate from what it was last season?  
COACH WALZ: They add depth to us. They add depth. When you're able to bring
Tia Gibbs off the bench and she gets us 15 points in 16 minutes of play, it's
pretty special.  
Asia brings us some athleticism that she can play inside out. She comes up
with 10 boards tonight, 3 assists, 1 turnover, really causes a little bit of a
mismatch problem because she rebounds it so well, but then you're going to
have to defend her at about 15 to 18 feet.  
It's still‑‑ I mean, you know, we've got to get Sara going right now. We're
running out of games to get her going. So I'm going to talk to her tonight and
tomorrow, just how important she is to our ball club. The past two games, if
you had told me that offensively she would have had the output that she's had
and we still won, I would have doubted you.  
So we're very fortunate to have some bench players and some other players that
are stepping up to take more responsibility while Sara's in a little bit of a
slump, is what I would call it. There's no doubt in my mind she'll get in the
gym tomorrow, we'll have a great practice, and I'd be shocked if Sara Hammond
had three games where she struggled at the offensive end of the floor.  
Thank you, everybody.

### [Cierra Burdick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24841)

### [Meighan Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24840)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  73  
Tennessee  62

  
HOLLY WARLICK: I'm just sad that that was Meighan's last game, and we're going
to miss her. She's done a hell of a job for our program, and I know she's
going to go on and do great things. Got beat by a better basketball team
today.  
  
Q. In the second half Meighan showed her will and her heart for the
University of Tennessee. What has it been like to play with Simmons this year
and last year and the years you've been here?  
CIERRA BURDICK: I think Meg is a competitor. She's going to compete every
single time she steps in between those lines. Meg just wants the best for the
team. She wants to win. She's had a great career here we're definitely going
to miss her. She's going to go on and do some great things and represent the
lady volume program. In 10 or 15 years down the road, we're all going to have
the opportunity to say that we played with Meighan Simmons. Probably one of
the best scorers to ever play the game, and we're going to miss her.  
  
Q. Cierra, you guys have played a lot of strong, physical teams in the SEC
and you were able to prevail against them. What was the difference against
Maryland today which seemed to dominate inside, especially early?  
CIERRA BURDICK: They just out‑willed us. They out‑muscled us. Like Holly said,
they were the better basketball team today. I think our turnovers really hurt
us. You can't win the ballgame when you've got 20‑plus turnovers. We couldn't
get into a rhythm offensively and we weren't getting the stops that we needed
defensively. Give Maryland all the credit; they came out and played a heck of
a ballgame, and they took away our strengths.  
  
Q. Meighan, as far as Alyssa Thomas is concerned, every time you guys cut it
down there in the second half to eight or nine points she would come back with
a big bucket. What did you guys do to try to limit her today?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: First we had Cierra to face guard her, and later on in the
game when she got to runs we tried to double‑team her. Me and Cierra had said
in an earlier media session that we have so much respect for her. She's one of
the top recruits as of right now to go to the WNBA. She's worked really,
really hard. Really she outworked us and out‑muscled would us today. Like I
said, we have the utmost respect for her.  
  
Q. How painful is this loss? I hate to mention it, about the Grind For Nine
and the Final Four in Nashville, it's been a goal all season long. Can you
talk about that?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: It's always been a grind for us. We've had a heck of a year,
and any game where we were down we found a way to fight back and Maryland just
had the extra oomph today. They pushed through even harder. We just didn't
have it today. It was always a grind for this year. I mean, I think we showed
that. A lot of people realized exactly what we could do out there on the
floor, and for the people that they have coming in, the freshmen who are
coming in and the people who are returning, I would just say to any other
team, just look out because I know when I leave here I know everybody else
that's going to be coming back is going to be pushing twice as hard to get
back in this position and maybe even get over that hump and get to the Elite 8
and get to the Final Four. That's all I can really say about that.  
  
Q. Holly, deficits early have been a problem so much of the season. I know
finding the answer would have helped fix it today, but what was it you saw
them doing today that they couldn't dig out of it this time?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I thought we came out just nervous, a little scared for
whatever reason. We didn't have that fight‑back at the beginning, and then we
got ourselves in a hole. We're a get the ball inside team, and we couldn't
find a way to get it inside. It was physical, and we just couldn't, for one
reason or the other, get the ball inside. When you turn the ball over 22
times, you're not playing very well. As this team has battled back all year,
Maryland wasn't giving in. We dug ourselves in a hole too deep.  
  
Q. With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, is there anything you would have
done differently in terms of preparing your team for this game or strategy or
approach or anything?  
HOLLY WARLICK: No, I thought we had a good game plan. I mean, Dean did a great
job scouting, and we wanted to mix it up. We were going zone, going man, and
we just didn't have the togetherness on the defensive end, whether it was
trust, we gave too many lay‑ups. We understood that they score in the
transition. We couldn't stop that. We understood that they were great
rebounders, we worked on that quite a bit, and we couldn't stop that. You
know, I don't know. Looking back maybe play more zone, but I thought we had a
good game plan, we just didn't stick to it.  
  
Q. In the first half when Maryland made their run, you elected not to use a
time ‑out. Did you feel that this team could overcome that without you calling
one, or take us through that for a little bit.   
HOLLY WARLICK: I obviously didn't feel the need to have a time‑out, so I
didn't call one. I don't have a‑‑ I didn't feel the need to call a time‑out.  
  
Q. You mentioned you thought the team was a little nervous and jittery. You
said the same thing about the Louisville game last year when you guys lost in
the Elite 8. Is that maybe a greater concern for you about the team than
execution or Xs and Os or anything like that?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I mean, think about it right now, probably yes. All we
can do is prepare them for what we need to do in the game and put them in
situations where they know what they're defending and where we need to attack
offensively. I don't know, the last two times we've been in the tournament, we
didn't get it done. We lost to a very good basketball team today, very good.
Maybe we'll address that for the next season.  
  
Q. Will you assess the play of Jasmine Jones and Mercedes Russell today?
Jasmine came in in the second half and provided the spark, and obviously
Mercedes's wing span played a big role today, as well?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, they're kids. Jasmine just is an athlete who plays hard,
and I was proud of her. She did what we wanted to do. We wanted to attack the
basket, stop the clock and get to the free‑throw line, and I thought she did
that. Mercedes is going to be a great player for us. She's getting stronger
and better every day, great knowledge of the game, and I have so much
confidence in her. I mean, I thought she‑‑ she didn't score a whole lot, but
she was a factor on the defensive end, which helped us get back into the game.  
  
Q. In the first half, Meighan put a whole lot of points on the board and she
was your only double ‑digit scorer in the first half but she was also shooting
a business less than 25 percent, and I noticed that you sat her out for a
while in the second half, and when she came back she seemed to be shooting way
better. Can you talk about the decision making there?   
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, we needed defensive stops, and we thought when we brought
Meighan out that we would get‑‑ brought in our better defenders, and we needed
stops. That pretty much was plain and simple. I think when Meighan sits and
settles down a little bit, she shoots the ball a lot better. So that was our
thinking.  
You know, we weren't hitting outside shots. I mean, they were packing it in,
they were taking away our middle‑‑ our inside game, so we needed to hit a
couple outside shots, and we didn't. And they were quick shooting the
basketball.  
  
Q. In the second half the team got down by 16 points, but kept battling
back, brought it to eight. How proud are you of them just the way they battled
back and against a team that had a player hitting nearly all her shots?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, this team is special to me. I mean, they have committed
since last year. They don't give up. They don't have that in them, so I think
that's what makes it tough. It makes it tough for us to go out this way.
Obviously all teams put in the time and effort; that should be a given. But
this team has been really close‑knit team and they'll take this pretty hard,
as the staff and myself.  
But we just get down and we keep fighting and we keep battling, and that's
what our MO has been. We've just had to prove our worth all year. I don't know
why we've had to prove our worth, but we have. But I think this group has had
a great season and a season to be proud of, and we're Tennessee, and we're not
happy that we're not playing for a national championship. That's in our DNA.  
So we'll go back to work and we'll prepare for next year.  
  
Q. When you guys game planned for Alyssa and you saw I guess her being a
lefty, do you game plan differently because of that because the way they shoot
the ball is different than what you normally see?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, when we game planned we wanted to limit her touches, we
wanted to force her right. We wanted to keep her off the boards. She did just
about everything she wanted to do. 13 rebounds, 33 points. I thought she came
up with big rebounds when they needed them. We just didn't have an answer for
her tonight, and I don't know why. We just didn't step up and get it done.
She's just had a great night, and you understand why she's an All‑American.
She made great plays.  
  
Q. You guys had three tough, good games in the SEC Tournament against a
really good team. You think that maybe took a little out of this team and
perhaps that's when you guys peaked, in that tournament?  
HOLLY WARLICK: You know, I thought it was going to prepare us for what we
needed to get ready for in this tournament. They were tough. They were tough
games. The SEC is just a brutal conference. It's tough to survive the regular
season, and then you go into the tournament. You know, I don't know. We took
off‑‑ I thought we took off days that I thought would help us. We had some
pretty hard practices. We were in great shape. We just didn't have it today.
We just didn't have it, and give Maryland credit; they came out, they played
just an outstanding game. They did whatever they needed to do to get the win
today.  
  
Q. What's your advice to Meighan as she leaves the University of Tennessee?
You've been with her the last four years.  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, get her degree, number one. She's got to get her degree,
which she'll do that in the spring. Meighan works at her game, and I think she
will be a very good professional in whatever level, whether it's the WNBA or
overseas. I think she's got a special gift, and that's to shoot the
basketball. Not too many people can do that, and she has tremendous speed.
Just continue to be a professional that she is and keep her head up. I know
today was tough for her, but she had a great career, and just continue that
effort and her love for the game at the next level.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Maryland  73  
Tennessee  62

  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, this game was everything we thought it was going to
be, just a phenomenal game by both teams. You know, it was intense, obviously
we felt like it was going to come down to the rebounding and being able to own
the glass. Going into this game obviously we knew it was going to be a game of
runs and we had to maintain our confidence. Obviously have the utmost respect
for Holly and her staff, and obviously the tradition that Tennessee has,
that's where we all want to be. But I'm really proud of the fact that our kids
played for Maryland and played with a lot of confidence, were never
intimidated and really played for each other. I thought you saw us really get
after it defensively, dominated, being aggressive on the boards and really
being able to get out in transition. We want to continue to be under the
radar, make sure nobody writes about us, talks about us, but really proud of
our team and what we were able to accomplish today.  
  
Q. Alyssa, can you talk about just your mindset tonight? Obviously you had a
decent game against Texas, but tonight you looked to be very aggressive, and
can you talk about Laurin, she hit some big shots today and came in and did
well off the bench.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Just came out and went for my opportunity and just attacked to
the rim. And Mincy, this is the Mincy that we know, it's crunch time, the
lights are on and she's playing her best basketball.  
  
Q. Alyssa, their coach said that they didn't have an answer for you tonight
and she thought you could do whatever you wanted to. Did you feel like you
were able to impose your will?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: We knew we could get to the rim on them, and that was my
mentality, just get to the rim and just try to get easy shots.  
  
Q. Laurin, you guys came out from the very outset and looked really
confident and aggressive. Was there something in their scouting report or the
preparation that made you guys feel so at ease and so confident against a
favored team?  
LAURIN MINCY: I think the coaches just did a good job of preparing us for
Tennessee. We thought that we had to beat them on the boards to win this game,
so we focused on that for the last two days.  
  
Q. Lexie, Alyssa has the ability to score whenever she wants, but she also
kicked it out to you guys for threes at times. Talk about her passing ability,
too.  
LEXIE BROWN: I mean, it's incredible. She draws so much attention to herself
when she's on on offense, so for her to be able to just be unselfish and dish
it out to us, it's our job to knock those shots down, and it makes her job
easy, too, because then they won't be able to send so many people at her.  
  
Q. Lexie, the team really in the regular season against teams of the top
tier had regular ‑season losses against Notre Dame, UConn, Duke in particular,
but how does it feel to get a win against a top team on a big stage at this
time of year?   
LEXIE BROWN: It feels great. I think it was great that we got to play those
three teams before we got to the tournament. I mean, we have a lot to prove in
this tournament, and to get a big win over Tennessee is just giving us a lot
more momentum going into our next game.  
  
Q. Laurin, after you went on your run to pull out in front, you never let
them go. What was the key to stopping them and making sure they couldn't get
possessions where they scored consecutively?  
LAURIN MINCY: We just wanted to focus on making them take tough shots. Meighan
Simmons gets it going so we wanted to make sure we contested all her shots and
box out. Like I said, that was the key for this game, and obviously we won the
battle on the boards.  
  
Q. Alyssa, do you feel a little bit fresher this season, whether that's
mental or physical, not having to play quite as many minutes as you did last
season?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I just feel like this year we have so much more‑‑ last year we
didn't really have any subs, and now this year we can send so many waves at
them, it makes it so much easier.  
  
Q. Laurin, you've been through some things obviously in your career at
Maryland with knee injuries, but you looked very good, very explosive. Can you
talk about how you're feeling right now?  
LAURIN MINCY: I'm feeling really good. I had time to refocus a couple weeks
ago, just staying confident throughout the season and being patient. I think
patience has got me where I am right now.  
  
Q. Alyssa, Tennessee is usually known as a top ‑tiered defensive team. What
did you guys see on the offensive end that you knew you could get to the hoop
and score on them down low?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Well, we knew we could get out on them in transition and just
get easy baskets, and then once we got ball reversals we were able to attack
the rim and get easy lay‑ups.  
  
Q. You've talked about getting to the rim in terms of the offensive side of
the game, but you also effectively shut down a Tennessee post that
cumulatively has a significant height advantage on you. What was your
defensive strategy and how were you so successful in shutting them down?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Our post players did a phenomenal job of just limiting them,
getting them in foul trouble really early and just trying to keep them off the
boards from getting second opportunities.  
  
Q. Laurin, is there something about this time of year that brings out the
best in you? A couple years ago against A &M you had 21 points.   
LAURIN MINCY: I think I just like the big stage. I mean, it's crunch time. I
want to send my seniors out well, so I want to play as hard as I can for them.  
  
Q. Alyssa, did they do anything to you defensively that you hadn't seen for
a while or maybe even seen this year?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: No, it's just the typical face guard trying to make it
difficult to get catches.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive game plan? It seemed like you were
really able to clog the lanes and take away penetration. Was that the mindset
going into today's game, because it seemed like your height on the perimeter
seemed to shut down them wanting to penetrate.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I thought when we came out in the first half, we were
really locked in, being able to kind of keep them in front against the dribble
drives, did a phenomenal job and Theresa being able to get that spread. I
thought the second half they did a much better job getting to the rim, really
getting to the free‑throw line. They shot a ton of free throws. I thought they
were a lot more aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. Tennessee suffered from turnovers earlier in the season, they averaged
about 16 turnovers a game. Obviously you forced 22 turnovers against them
today. It seemed like every other time driving the lane you were swiping the
ball away. Was that something you guys wanted to do in the beginning of the
game or is it something that you guys pointed out in preparation for this
game?  
BRENDA FRESE: It was a stat I came across when I kind of compared our
conference stats and our cumulative. When you watch them on film you see their
dangerous deal is they get to live‑ball turnovers. I looked at our stats and
we actually had more steals than they did. I really felt like we could be
getting that message to our team to be able to understand how aggressive we
could be.  
That was important in terms of being able to get steals and being able to
cause turnovers.  
  
Q. Tennessee in winning the SEC Tournament had to go against three big,
strong, physical teams, beat them all. What made you think that you could beat
Tennessee and its very strength, inside and at both ends of the floor?  
BRENDA FRESE: When you watch what we've grown into, obviously we have a ton of
depth this season, and it's taken us a while to be able to kind of‑‑ for
everyone to understand how critical their role was. But when you look at our
bigs, you want to know the difference? Alicia DeVaughn, you look at
defensively what she was able to do in her rebounding, then you add Brionna,
you add Malina, AT sometimes going down there playing the 4 for us. Just the
fact that I felt like even with all the foul trouble that happened in this
game, we were able to withstand that. Fortunately for us we had a lot of depth
because there were a lot of fouls called in this game, so we were fortunate to
be able to have that kind of depth.  
  
Q. You've seen so many great performances from Alyssa. Where would you rank
this one, and also particularly the zero turnovers?  
BRENDA FRESE: I think the most special thing about Alyssa, when you talk about
everything that's been written and everything that we've seen, is just her
ability to, obviously, the higher the stakes, she elevates her game, and I
think the thing that separates her is her ability to elevate everybody else on
our team around her. They raise to her level. She was huge. I mean, and then
when you talk about the unselfishness, she was having fun being able to
penetrate to be able to get really nice kicks for her teammates.  
  
Q. Laurin mentioned needing to have patience this season as she got back
into her rhythm. What kind of patience did you need to have with her and she
found herself again?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think it was more for Laurin to trust and be
patient. This is very similar to when Laurin came in with a knee injury. We
knew it was going to take her time, for her body to be able to respond. But I
think what you see, what's so special about Laurin is her competitiveness. She
wants to be on the floor. She wants to make plays. Really being able to see‑‑
I saw in her the last two to three weeks, just the bounce come back, her step,
and obviously you see how she's playing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about apparently your pregame speech to your team, you
talked about ignoring Tennessee. How much of that is that tradition and trying
to get your team to not focus on that and to play their game, and then
secondly, how big a win is this for the ACC over the SEC Tournament champ?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think first and foremost, obviously we all want to
be where Tennessee is. We have the utmost respect for what they have and their
tradition and what they've been able to create. Obviously that's where we all
want to be.  
I think more of my pregame speech was the talk of like, hey, nobody is picking
us, taking the pressure off of us, and really playing so we can make sure that
everybody knows who we are in this tournament. Just the mindset. I mean, that
is a hurdle obviously when teams go out to play is sometimes you kind of
overthink the game, and I think we wanted to make sure our team was just as
confident as we could possibly be.  
For the ACC, you know, nobody goes into these games thinking about
conferences, obviously with the shifts that are taking place, but we do feel
like our conference has prepared us for postseason. When you get to have the
battles that we've had all year with Notre Dame and Duke and Carolina and the
depth of our conference, we feel like it's prepared us for this time, so we're
really proud.  
  
Q. Sometimes coaches will take a look at the box score at halftime and get a
glance at the numbers. Were you shocked to see the margin of your lead
compared to your field ‑goal percentage in the first half? I think you shot 37
percent in the first half but still led by about 14.   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, yeah. But I thought our defense and our rebounding was
keeping us in it. If we could tighten some things up, I really felt like we
needed to be able to get to the free‑throw line more to be able to kind of
help. I mean, sometimes these are games that you have to grind out, which you
saw with the different possessions that took place. But again, just trying to
put it all together.  
  
Q. All season long the SEC has touted itself as the best conference in the
country. The selection committee kind of followed that in its seeding. Do you
think maybe the SEC was a little overrated and the ACC maybe underrated?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I think the selection committee has a really tough
job, and I think this season when you look at it, there's really two teams
that have separated themselves in this field, obviously with UConn and Notre
Dame being undefeated. I think they had a really difficult job. I think they
based it on how you played in your tournament, and rightly so. Tennessee did a
great job going out and winning the SEC Tournament, three games in three days.
Obviously for us we didn't perform well in that tournament.  
You know, I think they have a really difficult job, and I think the biggest
thing is to come into the tournament that it's the clean slate and just come
out and play the best basketball you can to be able to advance and move on.  
  
Q. What were you able to do defensively to prevent them from going on those
runs to get them back within a few possessions?  
BRENDA FRESE: We talked about a lot in the second half the dribble drives that
were taking place. We went a few possessions of zone and we also just talked
about being able to get better help‑side defense to be able to withstand the
runs that they were making. Just some simple adjustments.  
  
Q. Alyssa said that you all felt like you could get some easy baskets in
transition. Is that an advantage you've had all season over teams with your
quickness, or is that something you specifically saw coming into this game
against Tennessee you felt like you could take advantage of?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, our transition is a big piece of who we are, and then
when you talk about having Alyssa Thomas lead your break, it's like having
LeBron come down the center of the court. We feel like there's a great
advantage between Alyssa and Lexie in how our team runs. But we did feel like
we wanted to be true to who we are and that we could take advantage of their
transition D by putting them into a track meet. We felt like we had more depth
in this game.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  

Louisville  73  
LSU  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with opening remarks from Coach Caldwell.  
COACH CALDWELL: I'm extremely proud of this group. They have an unbelievable
spirit about them. They have shown not only to our fans and families but to
the basketball community that they can achieve when people think that we
can't, and they've shown that we can.  
Honestly, tonight we played a very tough Louisville team that played extremely
well. Tonight just wasn't our night. But I can't say enough how proud I am
with this group for the challenges and the adversity that they had to
overcome.  
  
Q. This question is for Theresa. If you could just kind of sum up what
you're going through right now as a senior and what it's meant to play for LSU
these last four years, or for your career.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: For me, it's a pretty sad moment. I really take pride in
wearing LSU across my chest, and knowing that I won't get the opportunity to
do that again is pretty heartbreaking to me.  
But I just‑‑ I've been through such a huge journey, and the people‑‑ the
seniors that I came in with, Katherine Graham, Latear Eason, they really got
me through my first year, along with LaSondra Barrett, Swayze Black, those
people really got me through my first couple years here where I was
struggling, and I wasn't the player that I expected myself to be.  
My junior year, my teammates just really had trust and faith in me that they
were going to get me the ball, and I have nothing but great things to say
about the girls that I've come through with.  
And the players that are currently on the team right now, this is a great
group of girls. I can't say more about them. It's a sad moment for me. I'm
really going to miss this place. I'm going to miss the staff. I'm going to
miss the players. I'm just going to miss the whole tradition of LSU. It's a
great place to be.  
  
Q. This for all three of the girls. Jasmine, we'll start with you. Could you
just talk about the lack of offense today and, I guess, the teamwork to create
it. It seemed, if you weren't making it on your own, just two assists on the
game, it just wasn't happening for you guys. Was that something they were
doing or something you were unable to do?  
JASMINE RHODES: Like Coach said, it just wasn't our night tonight. But we kept
fighting, even though we were down by a lot. We strive to come back and never
gave up. We tried to overcome adversity, but we just came up short.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We were just never in our rhythm, running plays. We couldn't
hear each other really on the court. We tried to do our own thing, but‑‑
that's good.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I think they said it all. We never really got into our
rhythm, and then coming down playing on defense, we didn't really start off in
what we‑‑ in the rhythm that we wanted to start off in on defense, and then
Louisville kept hitting those threes.  
So our defense really sets a tone for our offense and vice versa. Our shot
selection wasn't that great. We just weren't making buckets. And even easy
little buckets that we typically make, they just weren't going our way.  
But we were playing against a great defensive team, and those nights happen.  
  
Q. You guys obviously are missing two key members of your offense as well,
and I understand they traveled with you. Have you texted them or been in any
kind of contact with them, any communication since the game?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, yeah. Rai's here with us. She's our supporter on the
sideline. It's really hard to keep Rai in her seat. She's always trying to
keep us hyped. She's trying to keep us in the game.  
I can't say enough about Raigyne and her heart and determination to succeed
even when she's obviously limited with a torn ACL. We have a great trainer
that's going to get her right back to health, and she'll be 100 percent as
soon as they're ready to go.  
Jeanne Kenney is at the hotel, and she wrote us a note before the game.
They're here, and they're supporting us. Having those two probably would have
helped us out a lot on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Do you have the note?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I don't have it. It's in the locker room. Basically, she
just told us to play hard and that no matter what, she's proud of us. We
worked really hard to get to the spot, and we just need to play in the moment
and just play for LSU across your chest.  
  
Q. How good is Louisville compared to the teams you've seen in the SEC? Two
1 seeds out of the SEC. Just kind of how good are they, and how far do you
feel like they have a chance to go in this tournament?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Going up against a Louisville team, I can't compare them to
any team in the SEC. Their pressure defense is one of the best we've come
across this year as well as their three‑point game. They shot an unbelievable
percentage tonight. That's what they do. They do a great job, and they're led
by a great senior, Shoni Schimmel, who really gets it done for them.  
And also defensively, they caused us a lot of trouble. We had a hard time
splitting the traps and getting out of the traps and converting, finishing
contested shots.  
They're just a great team. I don't think I can really compare them. They have
a pretty good shot of making a really good run this tournament and doing well.  
  
Q. For Jasmine and Danielle. Could you talk about next year's team. Clearly,
you kind of assumed that role in the postseason. How do you carry that over to
next season? Jazz, you as well, stepping up here, you're going to be the key
cogs moving forward.  
JASMINE RHODES: Coming in next year, I know we're going to have a pretty big‑‑
some big shoes to fill with the seniors leaving and everything, but it's been
a nice run with them, and I'm happy to have had this opportunity.  
But for next year, we just want to keep working hard. I know Coach is not
going to let up any. So just going to keep working hard and having fun as much
as we can and do our part to get back here and even further.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Going on next year, we have some great players coming in
next year, and I'm going to step up, and I'm going to improve to be a leader.
We're going to grind hard. Next year we're going to be a better team than we
were this year.  
We're going to have some good players, and the returning players, they're just
going to improve on their game. So we're just going to be a good team next
year as a group.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to excuse the student‑athletes.  
We'll open it up for questions to Coach Caldwell.  
  
Q. Nikki, Theresa looked like she had a hard time offensively around the
basket. Were you trying to do some kind of action with her, high ‑low with
Shanece, or were they just making it difficult?   
COACH CALDWELL: I think the one thing about Louisville's defense is they do a
nice job of changing up their defense, and they do a nice job of picking and
choosing who to trap, when to trap, and things like that. So we wanted to take
the guesswork out of it.  
With Theresa's ability to pass the basketball, we wanted to always have a
relief person, if you will, in the middle of the floor, and that hopefully
will take some pressure off of Jasmine and Dashawn because we were down two of
our other ball handlers. So that was the reason for putting Plaisance in more
of that high post area.  
We would have liked to have gotten her inside a little bit more than we did,
but she obviously kept us from turning the ball over as much as we typically
have been.  
  
Q. Along those lines, if you knew going into this game that you were only
going to commit 12 turnovers, would you have thought that this would have been
a drastically different game than what the final score ended up being?  
COACH CALDWELL: Our turnovers, even though we've had 20 a game, we typically
have good turnovers. So 12 probably averaged out for us. But I thought our
shot selection really hurt us. I felt as though there were times we were
rushed, and we didn't get any of the reversal action. That could be attributed
to the play action that we were running.  
But definitely did a better job of taking care of the basketball because we
didn't want to put our players in those positions to get trapped as much, and
so that kept us away from a lot of our ball screening action.  
But, again, I felt as though we got some good looks. We didn't knock down a
lot of those looks, though.  
  
Q. Coach, late in the game, Danielle came out, and you had a pretty long
conversation with her. What was your message? Were you looking to the future,
like the girls were talking about here?  
COACH CALDWELL: With Ballard, I just thanked her for being a competitor and
putting this team on her back, if you will, and carrying us. She's just a
sophomore, and she's playing like one of the best guards in the country.  
We have her coming back, and I'm glad that she's on our roster. But just
wanted her to know how proud I was of her and that we will be back, and she's
going to be better because of this experience.  
  
Q. Nikki, how much did the shorthandedness really kind of maybe catch up
with you guys today? I don't think anybody off the bench scored, and just
maybe the second half wearing down, especially Louisville plays 10, 11 deep.
Did it catch up with you guys today?  
COACH CALDWELL: I think it played a role. I mean, when you lose what we did
with Moncrief and Kenney, two players that are two of our better offensive
players, if you will. And, obviously, Jeanne Kenney is one of our‑‑ we'd love
to have her back there in some of those transition breaks they've got because
she typically saves six to eight points in transition alone.  
But this team, they did all that they could considering, and our bench, they
came in, and they tried their best. I'm proud of them for that. We didn't
execute as well as we wanted to, but it wasn't that they were fearful. I
think, when you look at Louisville, they're a very experienced team. They have
unbelievable guard play. They have depth. They did a nice job of pushing the
tempo. Their transition game is one of the best in the country, and they get
out quickly.  
But they also do a nice job of finding the open player. Their spot‑up shooters
from the three‑point line, they're hunting for the three‑pointers. And there's
so many times when Schimmel is coming down the floor, and you can just see her
searching for an open teammate. She's a great play maker for her team, and her
teammates have answered the call.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team in the huddle? When you were up 12 ‑9, and
Danielle, I think, hit like four or five in a row, five baskets in a row, what
kind of things did you say to your team to try to get them to support her, or
what did she say in the huddle?   
COACH CALDWELL: Honestly, I don't remember, but it would probably be along the
line of we've got to make sure our shot selection‑‑ I know we were talking
about that because we were getting good looks, but also I knew that their
transition game was where they had scored half of their points at that point.  
So we were talking about probably the transition‑‑ our transition defense
because we didn't do a nice job. And once you get the crowd involved and that
first three goes down, I mean‑‑ because we know how it is when we're at home.
That right there was a momentum play for them, and then it became contagious.
So then you had different players stepping up and making shots for them.  
So I know we talked about our defensive scheme.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, when Gibbs hit the back ‑to‑back three‑pointers
that got them ahead or helped them get ahead, is that the kind of, I guess,
twist that you were warning them to avoid?   
COACH CALDWELL: Yeah, I think the one thing is that we were doing a nice job
of guarding their initial action. We just didn't do a great job in our
transition game. And that's where they're very good.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a two ‑part question. First, could you kind of give us the
scouting report, in a sense, on Theresa Plaisance at the next level. She seems
to me to have so much more than height to offer. And maybe a little bit under
appreciated. And then the second half of that is that Louisville is known for
its guard play, but they did a very good job of containing two taller post
players tonight. Could you evaluate their post‑game.   
COACH CALDWELL: I think the one thing about Theresa is you've got a player
that's very versatile who can play with her back to the basket, and she can
also go to a face‑up game. She has the ability to stretch the defense with her
three‑point shot. She's also a player that, when you are looking for a player
that can play away from the basket and be a great passer and a read and can
read defenses, she's been that for us.  
I like Theresa's ability when she's‑‑ when play action isn't being ran to her,
her going and getting those offensive boards. I thought she's added that to
her game as of late.  
Defensively, Theresa's somebody that we've had to play on the perimeter, and
that's not an easy task. But every game, night in and night out, she's does
that. We play a matchup, and she's on the back side, and we're asking her to
go out of her comfort zone. So you're going to get a player that's going to do
whatever the team needs of you.  
I thought that our post‑game, the disruption of our guard play kept the ball
from getting there, and I think that hurts you. When you don't have one of
your best passers in Jeanne Kenney able to get the ball there and play in that
high‑low action, that will challenge us. They did a nice job of taking that
action away.  
  
Q. Nikki, could you also look towards next year. I know you have a couple of
transfers maybe. Who else can kind of supplement this roster and kind of get
you guys back where you want to be?  
COACH CALDWELL: Every year it's different, what you lose and what you have
coming in, and we're going to be a different team next year with different
post play. We won't have two 6'4" book ends next year, but we will have an Ann
Jones, who's a very mobile post player. Akilah Bethel is that 6'1" tweener
type post player, guard. She'll play three and four.  
We'll have Boykin back at a swing. She can play the four or five for us, and
Anne Pedersen can play the three or four. So we're going to be a little bit
smaller, if you will, but faster and quicker.  
We also had a couple of first years and looking forward to them adding. I see
this team pressing a little bit more. I see this team spreading the offense a
little bit more. I think we're going to be a little bit more guard oriented
than we have in the past. But, again, it's about how well you're going to play
this game together, and I feel like we've got some great cohesion already.  
Thank you.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
JEFF WALZ: First of all, we'd like to welcome everyone here. Hope you're
enjoying the beautiful weather outside.  
For us right now if it's not snowing, it's great. So we are thrilled that you
all were able to make it. We're thrilled to have the opportunity to come back
here and play, and looking forward to a great ballgame tomorrow.  
We know we're playing a very inspired LSU basketball team who's been doing
some great things despite some injuries that they've had. I've been very, very
impressed with what I've seen, and we know we're going to have a ballgame on
our hands tomorrow.  
  
Q. They have had two key losses in their last two games. How are you going
to kind of counteract that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, they've won both of them. We have to be prepared to play.
I've been very impressed with watching them on film the past game, two games,
of how some players have stepped up for them, exactly what you have to do.
That's what our kids did a year ago when we had our injuries.  
You know, you're giving players an opportunity to play that were not getting
those minutes before, and they're taking advantage of that, and that's what
you have to expect. I've been really impressed with what Danielle Ballard has
done in their absence. There's been a lot more put on her shoulders and she's
responded extremely well.  
So we know that even without those two, they're a very talented basketball
team. I mean, as I said, it's the same thing that we did last season. We were
without two, three players, and then you just have to have other players step
up to the challenge.  
  
Q. We see a lot of high seeds host the first and second rounds, but as the
tournament gets deeper does it become more of an advantage to be at home when
you're in the Sweet 16 and the Elite 8?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, of course. It's nice to have the opportunity to play on your
home floor in front of your home fans. I was just told five minutes ago that
we've sold out the lower bowl, and now we're opening up the top at $10. You
know, it's great. You're going to have that home feel behind you.  
Now, at the same time there are distractions that come with that. Families
come in town, they all want tickets, they all want to hang out with their
kids. It's like, no, it's a business trip. Even though we're at home, they
have responsibilities, we have to make sure they're focused to play
basketball, not worried about where families are going to go eat. Don't ask me
to go eat with mom and dad when we have a team meal tonight. You've got the
distractions, but they definitely don't outweigh the positive.  
  
Q. You mentioned last year the situation you guys were in. Probably people
are thinking LSU's chances are about what they thought your chances were last
year. Chances are they'll be inspired by your year last year. How do you
remind your players about that ‑‑  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I've already reminded them. You don't have to worry about
that. I'd be extremely disappointed if we did not come out prepared to play
tomorrow. I know how talented they are. They've got a fantastic coaching staff
that they've got the troops rallied, and they have been impressive to watch.
They beat a very, very good West Virginia team without those two. I know
Kenney played about 12 or 13 minutes in the second game, but they played a
majority of it without her.  
We know how good West Virginia is from having been in our league in the old
Big East for so long. They've got our respect. That's not a concern of mine.
My players are not going to be going, oh, they've got two starters out, easy
game. No, it's not going to be that.  
If we lose tomorrow, I promise you it's not because we overlooked them.  
  
Q. You talked last year about conversations and texts you exchanged with
Coach Pitino. Obviously a tough loss for his team last night. But how has the
relationship that you guys have developed helped you and your team grow?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's great. I mean, Coach has been great to me. If I've got a
basketball question, he's more than willing to have me come out to his office,
sit down and talk. You know, a really tough loss for them last night. I mean,
no question about it. Those late games I'm not a big fan of myself. I was
sleeping before halftime, and somehow woke up with 3:58 to go in the game and
watched it and went back to sleep.  
I would like to be able to tell you I watched the whole thing and was cheering
for it, but unfortunately I can't stay awake that late. I've got a nine‑month
old at home, too, that when she sleeps, I sleep.  
Rick has been great. He's very supportive of our players, our program, and
we've got a great relationship, and I think that's what makes our university a
special place to work. It's special for our student‑athletes because it's not
just men's and women's basketball that support each other. We're all
supporting each other. We just had a swimmer that won a national championship.
There's a lot of great things going on here, and they don't go unnoticed or
unappreciated.  
  
Q. What specifically did you think Kenney did for their team and what maybe
do they lose without her out there and specifically against the kind of press
that you may put on them?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, she is a great shooter. She has great basketball instincts.
She understands the game. She made big shots for them, but she also got the
ball to the right people at the right time. But you know, you have Danielle
Ballard, who's taken up all of that slack. She does a great job of getting to
the basket. She gets the ball up on the rim. Their post players are doing a
fantastic job of cleaning up her misses when she does miss.  
You lose someone as talented as Kenney, and then you're giving Ballard more
responsibility and more of a green light. It's kind of like, it's funny
because we were watching the Baylor game today, and I'm not sure what that
score ended up against Kentucky, but everybody is like, people are talking to
me going, oh, they're a better team without Brittney Griner. No, they're not,
it's just Odyssey Sims now is taking 25 to 35 shots, and they're nights when
she can make 22 of them. And when she does, they're hard to beat.  
There's a big difference as a player when you know you can shoot it whenever
you want and you're not coming out because there's nobody else to put in for
you, you feel pretty good out there. Right now it's not that LSU doesn't have
players to put in, but Daniel Ballard I think is playing more free, and she's
making some decisions that are pretty impressive and taking some tough shots,
but it's like I tell our players, and Shoni, I think, plays the same way, too,
you're going to take a bad shot or two, but she knows she ain't going to come
out, and Danielle I think has got that feeling my coaches have confidence in
me, they know they need me, and I need my teammates, but she's willing to put
that on her shoulders. That's what I saw in that West Virginia game. I was
just really, really impressed with how she competed.  
  
Q. I'm certain LSU is your only focus this time around as I'm sure was the
case for your two previous opponents. On Selection Monday when you saw your
region unfold and you saw Maryland, did it cross your mind maybe I'll get a
shot at the Terrapins?  
JEFF WALZ: No, never thought about it to be honest with you. I was too
concerned with getting back here. We knew we had a good Idaho team that shot
the three well, and going to play at Iowa, was a game I was really concerned
about. It never crossed my mind that it would be a 30‑point game. And then as
soon as that game was over, we knew we were going to be playing LSU, that's
where our focus has been. I have not watched a minute of film on Maryland or
Tennessee because we have to get past a very, very good LSU team before I
worry about that.  
  
Q. What do you kind of remember or what do you take away from the last time
you guys played, and what does that do for you guys that you think about that
you do have a 20 ‑point win against them?  
JEFF WALZ: We don't take anything away from it. I've told my kids over and
over, and I share our experience at Maryland, in 2006 we won the national
championship at Maryland; 2007‑'08 season we play an Ole Miss team in a
Thanksgiving tournament and I think we won by 30, and then they're our
second‑round game in the NCAA Tournament, and I think we're a 2 seed at that
time, and we get beat. You know, you can't sit there‑‑ what happened in
November has no bearing on what's going to take place tomorrow.  
They're a completely different basketball team. We're a different basketball
team. We've both improved in areas. There's not going to be any surprises.  
As great as it is for us to come back home and play, I think they also have
the advantage of having played here, also. So they're not completely
unfamiliar with what they're coming into. They know about our crowd. I'm not
buying drinks tomorrow, so we might not have as many, but they know what's
going to take place. They know the environment. So I think that's a big plus
for them.  
You know, we don't worry about what happened in November. We have to worry
about what's going to take place tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were successful shutting down Theresa Plaisance when they were here
in November. She's averaging 15.5 a game. Same strategy again or do you have
to switch it up?  
JEFF WALZ: We're definitely going to have to switch some things up. We'll try
what we did in the first game. She's very talented, goes inside out, really
causes some problems when she sets ball screens because if you switch they'll
sit there and post her up, if you just hedge big she'll pop for the three. She
presents concerns for us defensively without a doubt. We're going to have to
be on top of our game making sure we know where she is at all times, and then
more importantly, we're going to have to make sure we somehow try and keep her
off the offensive glass.  
  
Q. You mentioned your press. The press obviously is physical and you're
trying to mentally affect your opponent. This is a team that turns the ball
over 20 times in a game and it doesn't seem to faze them that much. How do you
deal with that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, and that's kind of what we've done in the past, too.
Everybody tells me you have to cut your turnovers down. You have to cut your
turnovers down. The two years that we've had the opportunity to play in the
Final Four, we've averaged 20 turnovers a game. It's just a matter of what
type of turnovers you have. If you have turnovers that lead to baskets, then
you've got problems. But if you've got dead‑ball turnovers where you can get
back on defense, it's not‑‑ sure, it's not something you want to have happen,
but at the same time it doesn't affect you as much.  
So that's one thing that I've noticed about them. They have a lot of dead‑ball
turnovers. When you look at the stat sheets, people aren't getting 25 and 30
points off their turnovers. You know, they're getting 15 to 18, but LSU is
also getting 15 to 18, so it's turned out to be a wash for them.  
For us if we can get them to turn the basketball over, we need to somehow
convert those into baskets.  
  
Q. Although you don't take a lot away from that November game, how has your
team improved our grown since that early ‑season game?   
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think our depth has improved. We've had some players that
have grown into some roles that back then they really weren't sure what their
role was going to be. We've also become a better rebounding team, which we're
going to have to do extremely well tomorrow, especially with how well LSU has
been rebounding the ball at both ends of the floor. They've got great size, so
we know we're not going to be able to just out‑jump them. We have to put a
body on them.  
And then our shooters have continued to shoot the basketball well, which has
allowed Asia Taylor and Sara Hammond to have some things open up for them in
their mid‑range game and in the post.  
  
Q. What you were just saying there at the end, and then you also mentioned
it on Tuesday, how motivated you feel like Sara and Asia are to bounce back,
play a lot of minutes this game and contribute a lot. Asia had maybe one of
her best games of the year against LSU previously.  
JEFF WALZ: They're both excited to come out and play. I know Sara especially
is a competitor. The great thing about it is Sara wished she would have played
more and played better and stayed out of foul trouble at Iowa, but the bottom
line is we won, and she was excited about that. That's really the character of
all of our players.  
Sara Hammond was just as excited for Cortnee Walton for how well she played as
she would have been for herself if she would have gotten 15 or 18 points.  
Asia Taylor, although she didn't play a bunch of minutes, she was very
efficient in our Iowa game with I think about 10 or 12 points in about 10 or
12 minutes. She took advantage of the opportunity when she was on the floor,
but we definitely can't have those two get in foul trouble. We've talked about
that. They understand that. You've got to be able to play with one or two
fouls and know I can't pick up this third one. And that's what we really sat
down and showed film with Sara on. Sara had two in the first half and picked
up her third within 40 seconds of the second half on a reaching foul. Those
are the ones you can't get.  
Excited for both of them. We're excited for the opportunity to play tomorrow,
and it should be a great basketball game. The first game should be a great
game. I think we're very fortunate to have four very good basketball teams
here in this region, and I'm expecting three great basketball games.  
  
Q. Sara, how much does LSU remind you of your team in the regional semifinal
last year and the fact that people probably aren't giving them much of a
shot?  
SARA HAMMOND: Oh, yeah. Well, I think they're a very well‑coached team. I
think they have a great coach. She's a great motivator. She knows how to get
her team going, and I think her players respond to that. They did a great job
when they played West Virginia, they were down two players I think it was, and
their team rallied around each other and got a big victory against a 2 seed in
West Virginia. I think they're going to have that same mentality coming up
here as everybody is counting us out, we're the underdogs, but we're going to
stick together as a team, kind of the same mentality we had last year going up
against Baylor. Nobody gave us a chance. I know they're going to come in here
thinking we're the underdogs like everybody is thinking, but they're going to
stick together as a team and I think it's going to be a good ballgame. I think
we're looking forward to their competition.  
  
Q. Asia, you and Sara had the best seats in the house in Iowa. Kind of talk
about what you're going to do to prevent something like that happening against
the LSU Tigers?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Definitely this is going to be a physical game, going to be an
aggressive game, but we've just got to be smarter. We know our value to the
team and we need to be out there and our best attributes are when we're on the
floor. I'm a good cheerleader but not as good of a player. We're just going to
be smart. Me and Sara talk to each other a lot. Shoni talks to us and just
tells she needs us out there with her and we've just got to be smarter at the
end of the day, stay away from the tic‑tack fouls that we can avoid, and if we
do that I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Asia, what do you remember back about the first LSU game, and how
important was that for you to kind of know that you were back and going to be
back this year and playing at a high level?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Well, that was definitely a good game. It was a good game for me,
good win for the team, as well. It just felt good being out there. I felt
comfortable. I felt like I could be aggressive. I was playing off of instincts
and I wasn't overthinking things. I think it was just good. It was a good win,
and we fought hard. I just remember just the battle of it all and just that
21‑0 run that we went on. Everybody played well in that time, and I know that
LSU is saying, other than that spurt we went on that 21‑0 run, they played us
pretty much even. But they're going to see a more‑aggressive team, a better
team, a smarter team and a more‑disciplined team this time around.  
  
Q. Just going back to the locker room talking to the girls before here, they
said that Party Crashers 2 is what I'm hearing now. Can you explain what Party
Crashers 2 is all about and what that exactly means to us fans? We need to be
in the loop here, ladies.  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, in reality not a lot of people expect us to continue
to keep winning. We went to Iowa and it was going to be a hard game going in
because you're on Iowa's home court. They average 10,000 fans or whatever it
is, and for us to go in there and get that win by so much, it was just kind of
like, hey, we're here having fun, we're here for the Big Dance, and that's on
our mind. We're a 3 seed, and so we embrace that because, hey, we're going to
come in and ruin a couple people's parties. It's kind of like last year all
over again, but it's a little bit different at the same time, and so we just
embrace it because we like to have fun, so why not go out there and be the
party crashers again.  
  
Q. Shoni, your impressions of LSU, and I don't know how much you've really
seen of them since the last time you played, but how has that team maybe
changed from the last time you played them in November until now?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, they've definitely grown. For them to go through a whole
season since the last time we saw them in whatever the beginning of November I
think it was, for them to grow, it's just you've gone through a whole season
now. You understand what you're good at and what your strong points are on the
court, and so Theresa Plaisance, she's a very good basketball player, actually
had a chance to play with her this summer, and she's a great ballplayer, and
Danielle Ballard, she's coming in tough and she's out there to go out there
and win. At this point it's going to be a battle because everybody wants to
win, and nobody wants to go home.  
For us to just sit there and not take these people lightly as a team, we can't
take them lightly. That's something we have to just go out there and do the
best we can and dominate for us.  
  
Q. Shoni, obviously when you're watching film of LSU you're trying to figure
out ways how to stop them. But as a fellow basketball player are you kind of
at the same time admiring the way Danielle Ballard, the creativity around the
basket in her NCAA games, the ability to rebound as not a very tall player?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yeah, definitely. She's a great basketball player. She's
shooting left‑handed, right‑handed floaters in the key, and how do you stop
that? She obviously is versatile, so for her to have that, it's great for LSU.
She knows what she's doing. She's obviously played basketball for a long time
and she obviously loves the game, because she embraces it and she goes out
there and she's a hard worker. That's something we can't take lightly. We have
to box her out, because we know she goes to the glass ‑‑ she ended up with
like 15 last game or something like that? So for her to do that's impressive
from the guard spot. Usually the guard is getting back, picking up the
transition, whatever it may be, so she's not doing that this game, and so we
just need to box out.  
  
Q. Sara, how much do you think it'll be an advantage for you guys, even
think about last year when you played Purdue, that you're at home and that you
guys have been in your own beds and been going to class and not traveling, not
staying in a hotel this week? How much is that an advantage for you and how
much are you encouraging fans to come out and support you guys tomorrow?  
SARA HAMMOND: Yeah, obviously I wouldn't say it's an advantage, but we prefer
being in our own bed and having our own routine and not being in a hotel all
day and being on the road, it's really nice because you get to do your daily
things that you're used to, going to class. I think really like that, and I
think just like you said, being at home with all of our fans, the people that
come out all season long, that really gets us going.  
But it's the NCAA Tournament. Anything can happen. I think we've seen that
both on the men's and women's side this year in the tournament. If you don't
come ready to play, whether you're on the road or you're at home, you're going
to get beat, and I think our coaches have been telling us that this whole
week, the time we've been practicing. Yeah, you're on your home court, but
look what we just did to Iowa. I'm sure they had the same mindset going into
it, we're on our home court, this is an advantage, and LSU is going to have
the same mindset we had going in that they're thinking they've got this
because this is on their home court, so let's go prove people wrong and have
that underdog mentality, we're going to come in here and ruin their season. So
I think we've just got to put that in perspective and say it's great at that
we're home and we're wanting as many people to come out on Sunday, but we've
got to treat this like it's do or die, win or go home, and not kind of think
of that as an advantage over the other team.  
And we are, we're trying to get everyone possible out to this game on Sunday
because we need all the support we can get, and our fans is what make us go.
The energy they bring, the excitement they bring and how loud it gets here in
the Yum! Center, I think me, Shoni and a Tay would all agree that gets us
pumped and gets us going. I think we want as many people as possible, 22,000
plus, as many people, bring a friend that's never come, bring your grandma,
bring your grandpa, anybody, a friend, as many cardinal fans as there is out
there.  
  
Q. Shoni, is the Emmonnie Henderson coast ‑to‑coast lay‑up something that's
new for the offense?   
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Yes, that's something we've definitely practiced. For her to
just finish a lay‑up. But she's learning the game, and so for her to just make
that move, she's pretty beastly, and for people to not get in her way, it's
probably smart. We've got to keep pushing her to be the best that she can be.
Full‑court, coast to coast, whatever it may be, she's going to learn and
figure it out. I think that was kind of a once‑in‑a‑lifetime kind of thing.
She was tired after that. She needed an oxygen tank after that.  
No, she's figuring it out, so it's good for us.  
  
Q. Asia, can you kind of just comment on maybe where you guys watched the
men's game last night, if you're able to, your thoughts on their season and
you guys have kind of over these last two years, both teams have had these
great runs and maybe how well you know the guys on the men's team if you do
and anything about your relationship with them and kind of seeing their season
end?  
ASIA TAYLOR: Yeah, we love our men's team and we were all supporting them. I
know a lot of people were supporting the game. Some of us fell asleep, but I
got to watch the game. I just want to congratulate them on a great season.
Their success and our success last year was a big story around Louisville, and
we were the heroes. We were the talk of the town, and that was great. And this
year I know they were just as hungry as we are, and it just sucks that their
season had to end like that. But they had a great season, nothing to hang
their head on, and I'm just proud of them. I hope the city still supports them
the same, whether they won a championship or not.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, excited to be here. Just looking forward to seeing all
the teams play, obviously. Our first‑ and second‑round games were challenging,
but figured out a way to win and now we're here.  
  
Q. Coach, just kind of give me your general impressions of Maryland, what
you've known about him, what the scouting reports have revealed about them and
what kind of challenges you feel like you'll face?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I think Thomas is one of the best players in the country.
They're very well coached. They're quick getting up and upanddown the floor in
transition. They've got a young point guard that's very good that's doing a
great job of leading their team, and I think they're one of the best
rebounding teams in the country. It's going to be a battle of wills on the
boards because I think both our team and Maryland are athletic and they rely a
lot on second‑chance points. They follow a game plan. They're very well
coached.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up, is Thomas probably the most physical rebounder that
you've seen? Can you compare her to some of the SEC teams?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, I think she is. I think she goes to the boards hard, and
I think that's from her athleticism and just‑‑ that's how she plays the game.
She has a knack. There's kids that just have a knack to go to the boards and
they're always around the ball and rebounding. She's one of those kids. So
yeah, I think she does‑‑ the SEC for us, it's physical, it's strong. We rely a
lot on our rebounding opportunities, and I think she fits that bill.  
  
Q. Going back to the SEC Tournament, the two games in Knoxville, you guys
are 5 ‑0, but slow starts. Competition is going to get tougher. How much of a
concern are the slow starts, and if it is a concern how much is it addressed
with the team?   
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, we talk a lot about not quick‑shooting the basketball,
and this team seems to be a slow‑starting team. It's been that way all year.
But I'm more concerned how we end it. You know, I think we had to get a little
settled down. It seems to be once we get settled in, we play our game, and I
don't have an answer to why we're getting off to a slow start just as a matter
of quick‑shooting the basketball and giving up quick scores from the other
team.  
But they've got a resilience about them, and they don't panic. Now, I'd love
for us to get out to a good lead and keep it. That would help my nerves a lot.
But you've just got to go with it, and hopefully their focus will be early and
get off to a better start here.  
  
Q. Holly, Thomas is probably one of the most versatile players you've
coached against. Who is going to match up? Who will draw the defensive
assignment on her?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, I think starting off with our starters, it would probably
be Cierra, it may be Andrea, Jasmine Jones, Jordan Reynolds. We're going to
put a variety of people on her, Bashaara Graves. I just don't think one person
can guard her the whole game, and so we're going to mix it up and put
different people on her, obviously put our best defenders on her.  
  
Q. With Meighan Simmons, who is she as a basketball player now compared to
the kid who first came to Knoxville four years ago?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, well, we were just talking, Meighan started her career
here. She was a freshman and had a start, and we opened up the Yum! Center
against Louisville and she had a great game. I will say this: I think we all
know Meighan came in from high school as a scorer and known to shoot the
basketball. I've watched her game develop and grow, and I think she has come
to understand and learn the game of basketball, and she's getting so much
better on the defensive end. She's become a really good passer, and I think
Meighan now has a lot of trust in this basketball team. I think Meighan in
particular this year, at the beginning of the year, felt she was the lone
senior, felt like she had to do everything, had to do it all, and I think now
she understands that there's some ladies on the basketball team that want to
help her, and it's changed her kind of whole demeanor or outlook of this team
and her play, and so I think I can say now that Meighan is becoming a complete
player.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Nikki? Have you talked to her since she made the
tournament, too? Have you guys had a chance to talk or have you been too
busy?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, we played phone tag last night a couple times, and then
she called me with 10 seconds left during the game, the Tennessee game, so I
didn't take her call. What is she doing? Is she not watching the game? But
we've gone back and forth, and I talked to her before the first and second
round. I know I'll kind of hook up with her today. Proud of her. She's taken a
team that's depleted and injured and has done a great job. I know this is a
tough place to play.  
  
Q. You were talking about Meighan's maturation. Your team in general, this
is familiar territory for you. Where do you feel like they are now compared to
last year's tournament team? Where do you feel like they're growing, and maybe
with having those two tough games, where do they kind of grow from that?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, you know, we're a year older, and we're still young as
far as playing time. Isabelle Harrison was‑‑ she's a junior, but this is
really her first year of being healthy and getting an opportunity to play.
We've got freshman point guards and Cierra Burdick is now getting playing
time, and Meighan is probably our most‑seasoned player. Bashaara Graves is a
sophomore. I think we're more mature. I think we understand that we've got to
do. We're a more focused team. We're a together team. We've spent a lot of
time together off the court getting to know each other and understanding that
we have obviously different personalities, but we've got to trust each other
on the basketball court, and I think what we've done off the court has helped
us tremendously in our success on the court.  
I think that the SEC has prepared us and has challenged us in just about every
aspect of the game as far as it being athletic up and down, physical, going
against zones, going against mans, getting pressed. I just think that we're at
a better place, and we feel a lot better about each other.  
You know, and I probably‑‑ they're more comfortable with me. I mean, last year
is the first year as the coach, and maybe I'm more comfortable. I've been
there but haven't coached in NCAA Tournament games. I think I've evolved, as
well, just along with the team.  
  
Q. You mentioned watching a men's game last night and the last 10 seconds,
and I saw that you guys posted some video of the girls watching it. What has
this run been like for both of you guys? How have you fed off of each other?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, our team, the men's and women's teams are very close
teams, and I personally have a lot of respect for Cuonzo and what he's done
and how hard he works and what he makes his guys do. We feed a lot off of each
other, and the whole community is excited when both teams are playing well. It
gets our fans fired up when the guys do well and vice versa. I was hoping they
could move forward, but just really proud of them, and we ask our group if we
wanted to watch the game together, and we didn't hesitate. We spend a time of
lot with them, and I know our players spend a lot of time with the guys, as
well. Great run.  
  
Q. Going back to what you were saying before about spending time off the
court, anything specific? Is it like movies, more dinners together, just
taking in activities like that to kind of bring them together?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Absolutely. Well, I had said this earlier. We made a decision
last year to move everybody back on campus, number one. That was the biggest
thing for us. We moved everybody back on campus. We put them in the same dorm.
You know, they were spending time together on the court, but when they left,
they were going different directions and staying in different places, so we
thought it was important for them to live with each other and be around each
other, and so that was probably our first step. We've done a lot of team
building. We've stayed up in the mountains and did a ropes course. We do a lot
of dinners together. Especially when we're on the road, we eat every meal and
we do everything together. You just get to know a kid and they get to know you
away from the basketball court, and I think that's where we've changed our
philosophy as far as we want to be around our kids as much as possible.  
I want to know what's going on with them outside of basketball, and I want to
have them in an environment where they can actually sit down and we can have a
conversation, and it's not a‑‑ there's no pressure. We're just sitting around
talking. That's the environment we've created, and I think it's paid dividends
for us.  
  
Q. Cierra has been such a consistent player for you rebounding. Her offense
has been kind of up and down. What is her role right now in your offense,
because she just came up with a big game against St. John's. How do you see
her role?  
HOLLY WARLICK: I just want Cierra, like you said, she's so consistent, and
she's one of our best rebounders. We talk a lot about her, getting rebounds
and controlling the boards. Cierra has a beautiful shot, and when it's going
in, Cierra is the type of player that you think, man, I don't really see her
playing, and she has, whatever she had, 12 points, 10 rebounds, five assists,
and you're like, really? So she's that type of player. She's just kind of a
utility player for us, and when we need something big she seems to come up
with a big lay‑up, a big rebound. She's been very consistent for us.  
  
Q. Cierra, Alyssa Thomas for Maryland is probably one of the most versatile
players you've ever played against, and Holly said you would start out on her
defensively. Did you draw the short straw or how did you get that
assignment?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Well, I think we both play the same position. We play similar.
She's a great player. I have a lot of respect for her. But I think my
teammates and my coaches have done a great job of preparing me for the
assignment that I'll have at hand. I've watched some film on her. I know her
tendencies. Our practice players have done a great job of playing similar to
her. So I'm looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead of me.  
I think I'm prepared. I think my teammates will have my back and will be able
to limit her touches like we want.  
  
Q. Obviously the Final Four is the goal, and I'll say for any of you to
answer this question, you all really need to kind of just get over that hump,
what thing did you look back on last year or past trips here and think if you
can do that we can get over that hump and get to the Final Four?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Just looking back at last year when we were defeated by
Louisville in that Elite 8, the feeling we had, I still remember it to this
day. It was an awful feeling because we were so close. I think we should have
won that game.  
From the day after that, 360 days from yesterday is when we got knocked out by
Louisville, so these past 361 days we've been working for this moment, for
these next two games, to get over the hump, to get to Nashville. That's been
our goal, that's been our dream, and I think we've put in the time. I think
we've done what we needed to do, and now it's just a matter of executing and
playing our ball.  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: I think it's just, like Cierra said, that feeling, that gut
feeling of knowing that we were doing everything that we could. We fought
back. Our huddles were so tight. We were communicating with each other. We
never one time got negative in the game. We stuck together. I think it's just
one of those things where we just have to continue to tell each other to never
give up, to push for 40 minutes straight until that clock hits 0:00 and not
letting up if we do get a lead, not letting up, and just continuing to have
that fight, and this team is completely different from last year's, and I
think we just need to just go out and give 110 percent if we want to get to a
Final Four. That's what we need to do, each and every one of us have to give
110 percent.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think we just need to focus on our next game. We can't
get to where we want to go if we don't focus on the game at hand right now. I
think in years before, we've to the Final Four, but we can't overlook who
we're going to play next, and I think if you take every game as a full 40
minutes and take advantage of that and know that they have to play Tennessee,
and once we get that confidence about ourselves and know that we're coming to
the gym to play and play our hardest game, I think it's going to be the
turning point for us, and definitely last year was a terrible feeling. I
remember thinking this time next year, remember how it felt, and you don't
want to lose again, so we've been having that bitter feeling on our shoulders
for a while. Now is the time, and we can't back down from it.  
  
Q. Isabelle, Holly said you guys watched the men's game together last night.
That must have been an emotionally exhausting experience for you the way the
game went?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: Yeah, it was a terrible turnout because I know how hard
those guys work and how much it would have meant for them to go even further
in the tournament. You just don't want to see it happen to a group of guys
like that. You don't ever want the refs to call a game for you, especially
when it comes down to the last play like that. That's why it's important to
play the full 40 minutes and kind of dictate where you're going to go, don't
let it be in the hands of the refs. I think the guys did a great job this year
with Cuonzo and the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Meighan, Holly was talking about your first game as a freshman was in
this arena. Can you maybe think back to then, that day, and just the
transition from freshman to senior year and maybe your emotions then versus
maybe your emotions tomorrow?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: Oh, man. My adrenaline is still‑‑ is flowing like from
walking into the arena and just having flashbacks of where we were sitting to
the locker room that we were in to the hotel we're staying in. I mean,
everything is just coming back to me.  
I just remember being very, very nervous. I didn't know whether or not I was
going to play. I didn't‑‑ I had so many different emotions, but I knew I was
confident enough that if I did get out there and play, I would give my 110
percent. Just now the feelings are a little bit different because there's
something else that's at stake. I want to finish my career trying to get to a
Final Four and just take it one game at a time. I'm just trying to enjoy this
moment and just that feeling of being here, and this is the first time opening
in the gym, this is their first game, as well, but I remember Pat telling me
be confident in you, and everything else will fall into place. When I put you
out there, I expect you to give me your 110 percent. I will never forget that
that game was just something I will never forget, and I just played my
hardest, and I didn't want to lose that game. I didn't want to let her down,
and for my teammates, for Cierra and Izzy, just for speak for them, I don't
want to not give my 110 percent. Being the only senior that's what I have to
do, and I want to take them to a Final Four just as much as they want to take
me to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Meighan, when you look at the teams, you've got Maryland, yourself,
Louisville, we're talking about teams that can score. How do you kind of ‑‑
when you face a similar team that can score, what has to give? What kind of
things do you have to do on defense to really kind of negate that, especially
with Maryland being a top 20 team in scoring?   
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: I think just for us, I think it's just playing as if we're
playing against us. Everybody on our team can score at any point in time. I
think it's just a matter of who's going to want it more, who's going to play
harder, who's going to get the 50/50 balls, who's going to be more gritty,
have more of a swag and attitude about them that when they do get out there on
the floor everybody is on point and everybody is clicking together. Like I
said, it's just a matter of‑‑ everybody is going to try to score, it's just a
matter of who's going to want it more and who's going to do the dirty work
besides just scoring, like getting the rebounds because we have excellent
rebounders, getting to the free‑throw line and just continuing to attack out
there on the floor.

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
BRENDA FRESE: Obviously excited to be here in the great state of Kentucky. I
think it's really interesting obviously to be here in Louisville with us
exiting the ACC and as Louisville enters. However it shakes out, obviously we
are going to hand off our ACC banner to the Louisville folks.  
Even though this is our third‑straight year in the Sweet 16, it's something
that we never take for granted. Obviously it's extremely hard to be able to
get here. When you look at the four teams that are here, what you see is a lot
of programs in women's basketball with a ton of history and a lot of success.  
Tennessee being our next opponent is right there at the top tied with
Connecticut with the most national championships, a program with incredible
tradition. We haven't played them since 2005, but we've seen many of their
players out on the recruiting trails.  
Holly has done a terrific job. I can't say enough, in terms of the right
person for the job. Tennessee is really an extremely athletic team with a ton
of depth.  
I think you'll see with both teams a lot of similar tendencies. Both teams
want to rebound extremely hard. Both teams are very up‑tempo and have a lot of
depth. Both teams are led, I think it's ironic, by the ACC/SEC Player of the
Year and both have freshmen point guards leading the way. As far as I know I
don't think anyone is picking us to be able to win this game, so we're just
going to come out and obviously play extremely loose. I love where our team is
at, how we're playing, playing some of our best basketball at the moment.  
  
Q. Is there anything you take from the last two appearances in the Sweet 16
that you can apply to this time, particularly being able to beat A &M two
years ago?   
BRENDA FRESE: You know, first and foremost, I think it's important for your
team, especially when you talk about your young players that we have on our
squad in terms of being able to experience these moments and to be able to get
to a Sweet 16, and if you're fortunate to be able to advance. I think the
biggest thing we've talked about to our team is minimizing distractions. You
have a lot going on, a lot more media requests, and so for us just really
narrowing the focus to us and really preparing for our moment and what we can
do.  
  
Q. Holly, when asked about who would guard Alyssa Thomas, named five
different players, two point guards, a post, a couple of forwards. Just how
varied have defenses been against her, and what gimmicks, if any, have teams
tried?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, obviously I'm sure it's by committee. It's a whole team.
You can imagine with Alyssa in her four years, she's seen everything. She's
seen man, zone, box‑and‑one, two players running at her, teams game plan to be
ultra‑physical, just anything and everything you can expect in her career
she's seen. Hopefully I would think at this stage that she would be ready for
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your freshmen have developed this year and how
much of a contribution, how helpful that's been for you?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, I think when they came in in the summer, we saw
really special group in terms of the freshmen, how quickly they were able to
pick up on our plays and different things out there. But when you talk about
Lexie and Brionna starting for us as freshmen and giving us an inside‑outside
presence, and then you talk about Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough coming off the
bench and being second in scoring on our team. So all three are really
dynamic, have had a huge impact on this team, and obviously we're thrilled for
their future, what they're going to be able to be asked after Alyssa
graduates, to be able to bring to the table.  
  
Q. Having been both a favorite and an underdog, is there a different
approach depending on what side of the ledger you fall ongoing into any
particular game?  
BRENDA FRESE: There really isn't. I think it's more based on your team's
mentality in terms of how do they handle being the underdog, how do they
handle it in terms of the different seeds. You know, I think really every team
is unique, and it's really in terms of how they are able to handle what
expectations are placed on them.  
  
Q. Certainly this game is more than just about two players, but can you talk
about the appreciation of seeing Simmons and Thomas on the floor at the same
time tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, like I spoke of earlier, pretty neat dynamic
when you talk about the ACC Player of the Year and the SEC Player of the Year
in two powerful conferences. Obviously what each one of them has meant to
their respective programs, what they've brought to the table in their four
years, obviously from both ends their ability to score the basketball, the
ability to be able to get others involved, and I mean, obviously two
incredible players that are seniors, that one is going to be able to advance
and the other one's senior season will be complete.  
  
Q. Of course you already know they're probably going to be a lot of
Tennessee fans here tomorrow. How have you prepared them for that? They've
been in hostile environments such as Duke and Carolina, but your familiarity
with Tennessee from years ago, what's the biggest challenge when you go into
an environment like that when you face a team like Tennessee with a big
following?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you think there will be a few fans here? No, we're excited
about it. You embrace it. You want to play in front of fans instead of an
empty arena. From our end, yesterday we piped in "Rocky Top" and allowed our
players to‑‑ some of them hadn't even heard "Rocky Top", so to be able to get
used to it, and then of course our Maryland fight song so they would know back
and forth what this is going to look like.  
Our conference prepares us for tough environments. Our staff I think does a
really good job in terms of just preparing them for what this is going to be
like, and obviously if you're in the Sweet 16 and you're not prepared for this
moment, then you'll probably be going home. Our kids fully know what it's
going to look like and feel like.  
  
Q. Did you have it on a continuous loop or did you have to stop and explain
what the song meant to them?  
BRENDA FRESE: It was on a loop, but I heard later through some quotes that I
saw that even our senior Alicia DeVaughn wasn't even sure. But she was used
to‑‑ we've done this before in terms of different teams that we face.  
But I guess you liken it, as well, to last year when we played UConn up in
Bridgeport, and that was definitely filled with a lot of Connecticut fans. So
the fact that our team has experienced this before I think is key.  
  
Q. When you were recruiting Thomas, did you envision her becoming this
versatile and this great a player?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, it's one of the best recruiting stories,
probably one of the best decisions I've ever made in recruiting. A lot of
staffs went out to USA Basketball and followed a lot of players, and I decided
to go up to a local Battle of the Baltimore Tournament to be able to go check
out this Alyssa Thomas that we had heard great things about. You know, from
the minute I saw her in the lay‑up line and you saw those big shoulders and
her size and her strength and her speed, we did envision one day her name and
her number being up in the rafters.  
I think kind of the greatest thing about Alyssa, though, is how humble she has
stayed throughout all of it and just how she's never satisfied with her game.
She's always wanting to get better, wanting to improve, and really the
versatility that she has, has played every single position in her four years
and has done anything that we've asked her to for this program.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up, what things do you see her do that reinforce your belief
or your feeling that I'm glad she's on our side? Is there any one thing that
really stands out that continues to improve you?   
BRENDA FRESE: Well, first of all, I'm going to petition the NCAA to get her a
fifth year and to be able to bring her back. You know, I mean, when you see
plays we'll see in practice and then in games where she'll rebound the ball
and throw it the length of the floor on a dime, like the basketball is like a
dime‑‑ a nickel or a dime in her hand, she's just so strong. You saw her get
it off the glass, and I liken her in our transition game to LeBron. Like who
would want to step in and take a charge off of that, and with her speed and
power coming down the floor in transition, I'm not sure there's another player
in the country that can come at that pace that she's able to do.  
Just so many things that she's able to do that you have to appreciate that
we've been given in these last four years.  
  
Q. You had alluded to your team's mentality a little earlier. What is the
mentality of this team given the particular makeup of veterans and freshmen?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, I'm excited by the fact that I really feel like
we are playing some of our best basketball, and I think it's a group that is
really confident and really believes in each other, and I think when you look
at our last game with Texas and you see Alyssa scoreless in the first half,
which I can't ever remember happening in her career, our team didn't miss a
beat. They weren't concerned. There wasn't any kind of anxiety. Earlier in the
season there would have been that case.  
I do like the fact that I feel like we are peaking at the right time, and
we're really playing for each other.  
  
Q. Alyssa, your take on the number of people in any one game that can cover
you; how have you adapted to that and sometimes being double ‑ or
triple‑teamed?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: I expect it. But with the team that we have and the scorers
that we have, it takes it hard to just focus on one person.  
  
Q. Any of the players, your coach was just in here saying that she was
playing "Rocky Top" I guess at practice this week. What was that experience
like? Did there have to be some explanation as to what was going on there?   
LEXIE BROWN: Well, yeah, of course I was the first one to be like why is this
music playing? She was just trying to simulate the type of environment we're
going to be in tomorrow just with a lot of noise and a lot of Tennessee fans.  
LAURIN MINCY: To piggyback on Lexie, it was obviously very different. But
Coach B was just getting us prepared. Tennessee is going to have a lot of fans
here, so we just have to be ready and keep the noise off.  
ALYSSA THOMAS: I think it was the first time any of us heard that song, and
just like they said, they were just simulating what it's going to be like.  
  
Q. Alyssa, is there anything you can take from the last two Sweet 16 trips
that you can apply this time around, particularly being able to beat A &M two
years ago?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, it takes a team effort. You've got to come out from the
start and play your best game, and most importantly stick together. Hopefully
good things come out of it.  
  
Q. Alyssa, as the season has gone along, have teams tried to be more
physical with you?  
ALYSSA THOMAS: Absolutely. They try to be extremely physical, try to take me
out of my game, and just really eliminate me from moving around out there.  
  
Q. Alyssa, what was your familiarity with SEC ‑style ball before this, and
can you talk a little bit about what the addition of Syracuse and Pittsburgh
in the ACC, what they brought there, speaking of physicality, how much that
has helped you or how you've adjusted to that?   
ALYSSA THOMAS: Yeah, SEC, just what I've seen, very physical teams, very
high‑energy teams, a lot of great players come out of the SEC. And then as far
as Syracuse and Pitt, they've just elevated the ACC. They're both teams that
have really come in and played hard and just added to the ACC.  
  
Q. Laurin, we've seen you shoot the three, score a bunch of points in many
different games, but just your thoughts on defense and how important that is
to you and where that stands in terms of how you like to approach the game.  
LAURIN MINCY: I think just defense is ‑‑ just play your part. I always look
forward to guarding the best player on the team, and I think we're just going
to come out and it's going to be a team effort on defense and also on the
rebounding battle.  
  
Q. Laurin and Lexie, Coach Frese talked about how fast and strong Alyssa is
and how she didn't think anybody would want to take a charge from her. Have
you ever taken a charge from her in practice?  
LAURIN MINCY: No.  
LEXIE BROWN: No. We know better. We save that for the opponents. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Have any of you tried to charge against her in practice, and what's that
like?  
LEXIE BROWN: Like hitting a brick wall.  
LAURIN MINCY: She'll try and block you before she takes a charge.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONALS SEMIFINALS & FINALS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONALS+SEMIFINALS+%26+FINALS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 29, 2014

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

_LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY_  
  
NIKKI CALDWELL: They had a really nice crowd the last time we were here, and I
know they had a beer promotion going on, too, during that time. But I know
we're not going to have any this time.  
I think the one thing about playing a team like Louisville, they're an
exciting team to watch. Their transition game is very explosive. Schimmel is a
fun player to watch. I've followed her career for a long time, and they do a
very nice job of distributing the basketball and having a balanced attack.  
Yes, we are familiar with playing them earlier on in the season, and this team
has grown from that experience and we've gone on to play other difficult
teams, as well. And we're just going to make sure that we come in prepared and
stick to our game plan.  
  
Q. Coach Walz was talking about Danielle and he said that the fact that
you'll have fewer numbers allowed her to be a little freer, allowed her to
have a little more feeling of I need to take over this game because there's no
one else to do that. Do you feel that's helped her with her progression
because clearly she's playing some of her best basketball of the season?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We were joking about the fact that our numbers are low and
they can do pretty much whatever they want. What am I going to do, sub them
out? They're in a good spot right now, and Ballard has really elevated her
play as of late. But Ballard has been that player all along for us. I can
recall playing at Tennessee and her really taking that responsibility of
putting the team on her back and being aggressive, so she's had numerous games
where she's done that for us, so just proud of her play and proud of the play
of all of our players at this point. Our freshmen came in and gave us valuable
minutes. Shanece McKinney is playing bigger, stronger, more dominant than
ever, and Theresa Plaisance has just been very, very solid for us.  
Again, we're in a good place even with our numbers being as low as they are.  
  
Q. What lessons did you guys learn from the first time you all played them?
I guess it ended up being a loss for you guys. Do you put that out of your
mind? Does that have an impact on this game at all, that outcome? Anything
that you took away from the game the first time?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: You take a lot away from the game as a coach. I think players
take‑‑ it's a little different for the players because they know they have
another game, and so they move on and they continue their season. But as a
coach you go back and you watch the play action that you ran and you watch
what they did, and then obviously you're watching what they're doing now
because they're not the same team that they were when we played them early in
the season, and neither are we.  
We know that there were areas that challenged us, and obviously taking care of
the basketball was one of them. They did a nice job of capitalizing off our
turnovers. So have many teams. So we know that that is an area that we've got
to be solid in, and then obviously I'm a firm believer that you've got to get
on the boards and you've got to control the boards. You control the boards,
you control the tempo of the game.  
  
Q. How do you view them as being different since that first meeting? What's
been something that stood out about their team.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, I think the one thing that when you watch, they've had
different looks thrown at them where people have tried to really tried to
disrupt Shoni Schimmel, and I think she's been exposed to a lot of different
defensive looks, and she's figured them out. I think early in the year, your
team is a team that, as far as Louisville and a lot of teams, everybody's role
is being defined and everybody knows exactly at this time of year what's
expected of them when you get late in the season.  
There's a difference in urgency that you're playing with, and that's what
you're seeing with a lot of these teams.  
  
Q. You're giving up 72 points a game, so I don't know if you're ever truly
pleased with your defense, but it seems like ‑‑ are you more pleased with the
commitment they've made to defense in the tournament? Seems like you're
pursuing more, rotating more to the ball, you're showing a little more
intensity on that end compared to the regular season.   
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, we're not the best defensive team in the country as far
as statistics. We're just finding our way to get it done. As long as they're
playing hard and they're supporting their teammates, whether it's rotating
over, taking a charge or dropping down to help on the weak side for board
play, that's all we can ask of our team. We've got a group of young ladies
that have made the commitment to really play together and lay it on the line,
and that's all you can ask for in your team is for them to go out and give you
those effort plays.  
We had a lot of effort plays, positive‑effort plays, if you will, over the
last two games in the tournament, and the plays that you make may be unspoken
and they may not show up on the stat sheet, and you may not be written about.
But there are plays that you know as a competitor that you've played to help
your team win.  
  
Q. How much does this help that it to some degree is old hat? You faced
limited numbers last game out but also last year, so this team has some
experience with dealing with that.  
NIKKI CALDWELL: We've got some experience with it. No coach wants to go into
the season or go into postseason play with a limited roster. It is what it is,
and our team, their attitude towards it has been very, very positive and very
focused. They know we've got to play extremely smart but we've also got to
play as a unit. No one can hide. Your numbers is going to be called, and it's
just a matter of going in there and answering the call. And the way that
they're going to do it and the way that they have prepared for this weekend
has been very, I would say, focused, and that's what you want this time of
year. No matter if you've got eight, nine, 10, 11 kids on your roster, you
want them to have a sense of focus about them.  
  
Q. The first meeting Asia Taylor who had missed all of last year for them
had kind of a breakout game. What have you made of her, and is that something
you guys are now maybe focusing on more as sort of being more aware that she's
come on as one of their premier players?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, she's done a really nice job of being just everywhere.
You can watch film and her name is going to be called. But you can't just
focus in on one player on their roster. They have so many different weapons
and so many players have stepped up at different times of the year for their
team, and that's a mature team.  
There's times where a lot of the notoriety and the recognition goes to
Schimmel, but you can't lose where Slaughter is. When Jude comes in she makes
positive plays. You've just got to have a team balanced ‑‑ a sense of effort
against their team, because you can't just focus in on one player.  
  
Q. Do you plan on starting Hill in place of Kenney?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, we're going to go with Jasmine Rhodes, and a lot of times
when you look at your potential starters, Rina Hill has started for us, she's
going to see valuable time, and so is Sheila Boykin and Anne Pederson.  
  
Q. Has Coach Kenney made her contribution yet so far? Are there ways she's
tried to school the other players, or you, in what they should do strategy
‑wise in this game?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: Well, she's definitely aware. She knows the scout. She's
always been a student of the game, and she's been very helpful to her
teammates, and that's what we need from her. Her voice still will be heard and
her leadership is still going to be needed, although she's going to be
sidelined.  
  
Q. Your last presser you talked about the drama that is inherent with a team
like yours, I guess. Do you want them to feed on that? Do you want them to
play to that emotion of maybe not having Jeanne, or is that something you
would prefer them to be very businesslike with?  
NIKKI CALDWELL: No, you want your kids to feel whatever it is, and there's a
different relationship that each of the kids have with Jeanne, and obviously
Theresa Plaisance and Jeanne Kenney have been playing ball for a long, long
time, so Theresa is going to have a different feeling toward not having Jeanne
out there. Danielle Ballard and Jeanne have been a great combination so they
have a different relationship. But I know that the upperclassmen have
developed unique relationships with all of our underclassmen, so there's this
feeling of we don't want it to end for them, and so that's a positive thing.
If we can continue to just be of service to each other in that way, then it
takes a lot of pressure off of you as the individual to have to go out there
and perform when you're saying I'm doing this for someone else or something
bigger than myself.  
  
Q. Danielle, Louisville has been playing very good defense in the NCAA
Tournament. I think they're leading the tournament in points allowed.
Obviously you'll be a key for their defense tomorrow. Do you feel like you
have to try to do some things differently from what you've been doing or just
try to do those things better?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: No, we're just going to do what Coach has planned for us,
just run plays, do everything right and don't force anything, don't try to do
too much, just play our game and play the way how we've been playing.  
  
Q. Danielle, what are your thoughts about their pressure and how much
pressure will be on you with Jeanne out of the game?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: We have other guards that can handle the ball, too, just not
me that can handle the ball. We have other guards that are good at handling
the ball, so if I get pressure I have a way to kick it out to one of my other
players, or even the post players, they can handle the ball, too. We have a
lot of guards that can handle the ball, too.  
  
Q. For all three of the girls, could you talk about your previous experience
with this team, does that help or hinder in any way?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Playing this team before, we definitely know what they're
going to bring to the game on Sunday. We just use that past experience as
motivation to go out there and play harder. We're definitely not the team that
we were before when we played them. We just try to think of the ways to play a
lot better than we did before and what were our weaknesses in that game and
our strengths, and we just try to play into those.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, just to piggyback off of what Shanece said, we're not
the same team that we were in November. We've matured so much and we've grown
so much since we last played them, I really don't think it's going to be a
similar game. We're familiar with each other in that sense, but as far as
knowing what each other is going to do, I feel like both teams have grown, and
we've had a lot more experience, have a lot more games under our belt now at
this point. I feel like the game is going to be a pretty good game, and it's
unexpected what's going to happen.  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Yeah, exactly what they were saying. We're a better team,
being in the gym, putting in work, just improving on our game and on our
defense, too, and we've just been studying Louisville for this past week, so
we're just prepared for this team. We know they're going to bring it, but we
just have been preparing for this team. What happened in November, that's not
the team that y'all are seeing now. We're a way better team than we were in
November. We've got a better IQ now than we did in November. We're just going
to play harder. We're going to play hard this game.  
  
Q. Theresa, from the first game, basically the game was tied and very close
and they had a 20 ‑0 run or something along those lines. What do you recall
about that? What does that kind of tell you about the ability that they have
to go on a run like that, what you guys need to do to stop a run like that?
Just kind of reflect on that a little bit and anything that you learned from
it.   
THERESA PLAISANCE: Louisville has a great team, and they have great pressure
defense. At halftime we came in the locker room, came back out, and they went
on that 20‑0 run. We had a lot of trouble with their pressure and we were
coughing up the ball, turning it over left and right. Now we're a little more
prepared. I feel like in the tournament we experienced teams that bring the
same kind of pressure defense. Georgia Tech did a great job with their
pressure defense, and same with West Virginia. So I think we've done a better
job of settling and really staying patient with the ball in our hands, and I
feel like now we're better prepared for the pressure defense that they're
going to bring. Hopefully that won't happen again, that 20‑0 run, because once
that happened we really had no chance of coming back.  
  
Q. Shanece, it seems like you guys are playing better defense in these first
two games, but how important is it for you and Theresa to play without fouling
because the only person you can go to is Sheila can come off the bench and
that's it. Everyone saw against West Virginia it was her and four guards for a
long time in the second half.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Well, I mean, it's definitely important that we don't get in
foul trouble this game because they do have decent‑size post players, and we
wouldn't want to put our guards or Sheila in that situation of having to guard
their post players, and it would be a disadvantage. I think if we can try to
be sweet to the refs a little bit, maybe we can get a couple bumps (laughing),
because definitely against West Virginia we couldn't do anything right as far
as trying to block the shots without getting fouls. We've just got to play a
little bit smarter.  
  
Q. Theresa, last year when they played Baylor, very similar spot to where
you guys are, no one thought they had much of a chance. Baylor was this huge
favorite not only to win the game but to win the tournament, and they pulled
the upset of the tournament really. You guys are in a similar spot this year.
Do you take some encouragement or inspiration from what they did last year?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: I really haven't thought about that much. Louisville is a
great team led by Shoni Schimmel, a good friend of mine. I know they have a
lot of weapons. I feel like we match up well against them, because we also
have a lot of weapons. We're down a few players, but we have other players
that can step up and fill their spots and do a great job for us.  
I don't think anybody really expected us to actually come in the tournament
and win our first two games. A lot of people were counting us out in the first
round, and right now I feel like our hope is alive and we're feeling extremely
proud of ourselves for making it this far, and I think we like playing against
the odds. When you don't have anybody on your side, then there's not much that
can go wrong, like what do you have to lose kind of thing. But we're going to
fight tooth and nail for this, and we want this more than anything. We believe
in each other, and that's all that really matters. We're just looking to come
out here and play our game and stick to our game plan, and if that happens,
then I feel like the odds are in our favor.  
  
Q. Theresa, can you talk about your friendship with Shoni from playing with
her over in Russia and just kind of being a teammate with her and getting to
know her over the summer? Do you guys stay in touch and anything about y'all's
relationship?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, Shoni was super shy at first, and I was a more
outgoing personality on the team. But once we got to Russia, we had a great
time. Shoni is one of my closest friends on that team, and yeah, we still keep
in touch. We have a lot of inside stories, a lot of inside jokes, and just
playing with her, she's an amazing, amazing player, just her ability to score
and her passing ability.  
I remember this one play, I spun and I knew I was about to be wide open, and I
missed the pass because she already saw it like two seconds before I did, the
ball went right by my head and I was sitting there waiting for the ball and
she already passed it. She's just a great player, and she's an even better
person. I really enjoyed spending the time with her in Russia. There's so many
stories that I probably shouldn't even share. We just had a great time. We
just had a great time.  
  
Q. Just going back there to the locker room at LSU and talking to some of
the girls, just about the last time that you all played Louisville here, what
do you feel like coming back here? Do you feel intimidated by the crowd at all
or are you used to that? I heard some of the girls talking about Tennessee and
being in that crowd situation. Does that not intimidate you at all, the
crowd?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: You know, the crowd here the first time we came, the
support, the fan base here is outstanding. Louisville has great fan turnout,
and I don't expect anything less for a tournament game. But we've been up
against crowds like this, and we have to do what we can to control what we can
control. We can't control the crowd, we can't control the refs. We can't
control a lot of things. If we just stick with each other and not let other
things, outside things affect us, then we should be fine. That crowd is
roaring at times, and we need to do the best we can to try to keep the crowd
out of it because they really have a great turnout here.  
  
Q. Shanece, Nikki mentioned what am I going to do, take them out if they
make a mistake? Kidding aside, is there a little freedom to that, knowing
that, hey, I just have to keep playing and just got to make it work whatever
the situation is?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Yeah, we were even talking about that off the court. In the
beginning of the season we weren't allowed‑‑ like we're not allowed on social
media until the season is over, so at this point she was like, well, y'all can
probably post on Instagram or Twitter or something. What am I going to do,
suspend you guys? It's definitely a little more freedom, I guess, but we
wouldn't take advantage of it in a bad way.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Yeah, I wouldn't try it.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Because you never know.  
THERESA PLAISANCE: We can read Tweets, just no actual Tweets.  
  
Q. Theresa, one more question about Shoni. Did you know that she had kind of
gained this fame in the Native American community or have you learned about
that since and read about that?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: Well, when we were up there, Coach Coale talked a lot about
our podium, and the podium that we're on right now is probably the biggest
podium that we're going to be on in our entire lives. Even if you go pro, your
podium really isn't as big, the fan base of pro leagues aren't as strong as
women's college basketball, and she was just like using Shoni as an example,
like not only is she on the podium for women's college basketball but she's
also on the podium for Native Americans, and everything that she's done and
the support that she has, and I think that's great. Her and her sister do a
great job, and they earned it. They came out and they showed what they can do,
and they made believers out of everyone. I feel like they deserve everything
that they're getting.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  74  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Stanford University Head Coach, Tara
VanDerveer, student‑athletes, Chiney Ogwumike and Mikaela Ruef. Coach, can we
start with an opening statement from you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, if a game was like five minutes long, we would not be
sitting up here and be in a good mood. If the game was even ten minutes long,
we'd probably not be excited. But in 40 minutes our team, I thought, really
showed great resilience, figured out things that were working, worked really
hard together, and beat an excellent UNC team, and I want to congratulate
Andrew and the NorthCarolina team on a great season. They just really are a
young team, and they're going to be really good. But we're going to Nashville,
and we're very excited about that.  
I think our leadership with Chiney and Mikaela and for Mikaela to be knocking
down her threes, that was absolutely huge. Her free throws, her defense was
great. Chiney with a double‑double, and not playing maybe as relaxed as she
usually does, but a lot of different people helped us win. Bonnie had big
shots, Lili had great defense and big shots, and Amber, I thought, really kept
us in the first half.  
  
Q. Chiney, why are you guys going to Nashville?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Heart, heart. People were making plays based on heart. It
wasn't like the perfectly executed play. It was the play you wanted to make
because you played with your heart, and that was from the tip. Obviously, I
struggled quite a bit. But Amber, whenever we need her, she steps up big.
Mikaela, those shots were from her heart. She shoots a lot in the gym, but I
mean, it was just a heart game. This is a fifth‑year senior playing in Maples.
I mean, it just came down to heart.  
  
Q. Mikaela, Chiney kind of touched on it a bit, but where did that three
ball come from?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I'm trying really hard not to say something stupid. I told
Chiney I'm going to say something stupid when I'm up here. You know what, I
don't have a voice right now either, so that's always good. I used to be a
three‑point shooter back in the day, and then I came here and it wasn't my
thing so much anymore.  
But they were literally standing in the paint, and I was like, well, you know
what? I'm either going to turn it over or this is going to go in, so I shot
it, and it went in. Then I just kept shooting it. I was like, hey, why not,
and it had to be three because that's the magic number.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: That's her favorite number.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about the defense that you faced and how they draped
on you like ornaments? Was it difficult to allow your teammates to do their
thing to free it up for you or did you want to force it?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Absolutely not difficult at all. Yeah, we had a lot of people
in double figures. Like they were just talking five. I think it was a very
difficult game. For me, the physicality was a lot. They were sagging in a lot,
and that changes the perspective. But I've talked about it, and talked about
it, and talked about it, I have the utmost faith in my teammates. If I score
zero points and we win, I'll be the happiest camper on the team. If we have so
many people‑‑ that's when we play at our best is when we have more people in
double figures. When Amber was doing it in the beginning and Mikaela
consistently through the second half, and Lili coming up with big plays off
the dribble, those are the things that make us a better team. So I say I like
to be an afterthought sometimes, and I think tonight I had to be an
afterthought a little bit, which was good because other people were being
aggressive.  
  
Q. Chiney, halftime, four points, things not going that well. What did your
big sister say to you in the hallway?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: She told me to relax. I've seen a lot of different defenses,
and this one was different in the sense that it was an NCAA Tournament
defense. It was will, and it was just banging in the paint. Like throwback
basketball. She just told me to relax. And Coach Tara told me the exact same
thing. That's why Nnemkadi and Coach Tara are soul sisters in a way. She told
me to relax and play basketball. The game will come to you. She told me just
be aggressive and push through. That's exactly what Mikaela told me, and
exactly what my bench teammates were telling me. So I was just relaxing and I
was like, okay, I'm going to be aggressive, and hopefully I'll finish a couple
of shots. Hopefully, I can do that for my team.  
It's not hard to finish when you have someone giving you dime pieces, and
that's Mikaela Ruef and Amber Orrange and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Chiney, you've been in a lot of big games. Why were you not relaxed
tonight in the first half? What was the difference in the second half that was
Mikaela's outside shooting and your other teammates, did that loosen things up
inside for you?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Mentally, I thought I was relaxed. I feel like I was playing
relaxed. It's just that things weren't coming the same way they usually were.
It's sort of like you just have to step back and be like, okay, just keep
playing the game. So I was relaxed, but it was just different. It was just
different.  
I honestly don't know how to answer that question. It's a 40‑minute game. It's
not going to go the way you want the first 20 minutes, but if you just keep
pushing through, that's what good teams do. You keep pushing through.  
  
Q. Mikaela and Chiney, the NorthCarolina players were in here and the coach,
and they talked about how the game could have been even more physical. They
wanted to make it physical, and they wished it had been even more physical. It
looked pretty physical for me from the outside. Do you think you guys are
underrated as a physical team? Do you think some of that is because of the
whole Stanford business?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I don't think it's fair for the game to be more physical than
it was today. I usually get physical games from a lot of people and so does
Mikaela down low. It's different, so I think anymore physicality should have,
would have, could have, it's like that. I don't think that's fair to the
players, honestly, that kind of phrasing.  
At Stanford, we pushed through that. It was physical, and we found a way to
win. I mean, if that's what people want to do, we're going to just try to keep
pushing through. That's what we did tonight and that's what we'll continue to
do is pushing through.  
MIKAELA RUEF: I think our team did a good job of not letting it bother us. It
was a physical game. I thought the rule changes this year were to try to get
it away from the physicality. But if it's going to be physical, our team can
handle that. I think we did a decent job of it tonight.  
  
Q. Mikaela, can you talk about what Lili did tonight? What Bonnie did
tonight? There were some big plays by some various people tonight.  
MIKAELA RUEF: Lili played amazing defense the entire night on Diamond
DeShields. She had two back‑to‑back tough match‑ups, and she's played like
she's been here forever. She's only a freshman, but you know, we trust her and
we expect her to play well because she's a great player and played some
amazing defense today. And Bonnie is more than just a shooter. She had a nice
pull‑up today. I was like, nice Bonnie. And she was boxing out really well on
the defensive end too.  
I mean, these are things that these kids do it in practice. It's not like
surprising and I'm just happy they were able to do it in the game too.  
  
Q. You have talked about the heart being the difference in this game. How
much was your experience edge a difference in this game?  
MIKAELA RUEF: I thought before the game that experience doesn't really mean
anything. They kind of came out here and you could tell that they were playing
super, super loose, and we were tight. Tara told us we were tight. I think the
crowd could tell that we were tight. It doesn't matter how much experience you
have, if you're playing tight, that's not good.  
They came out and they played well. They shot well, and I don't think that has
anything to do with experience. But at this time they're not freshmen anymore.
They've been playing a whole year, so they're basically sophomores. Maybe
we've been here a little longer, but I don't think really experience‑‑ it was
heart in this game, not experience.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I'm on the same page. It was heart, not experience. I
think that will be something that they'll learn from this experience because
they're a very talented team. I think that also we've played a lot of games
where we haven't necessarily played our best game, but we've pushed through
coming from behind and not playing as well as we'd hoped. I think those
experiences helped us stay steady and positive. You make a turnover, and you
don't hang your head. It's great to have Mikaela say, Chiney, don't worry
about that, or Lili say, Chiney, don't worry about that also. I think that
experience helped us.  
  
Q. When they went up 22 ‑9 in the first half, still a lot of game left to be
played but they simply weren't missing. I think Allisha Gray had three
three‑pointers in a row or something. Was there any sense of, uh‑oh, these are
freshmen, and they're not even thinking and they're just going to be able to
keep this up? Or was there more of a sense that just take a deep breath and
play your game, and it will all come back?   
MIKAELA RUEF: I think it was probably the second. The entire time they just
kept making shots, and I kept telling our team, it's all right. They're going
to miss. They're going to miss. Keep playing hard. Make them make tougher
shots. Get up there and contest their shots. And they're going to miss, and
we're going to start making our shots. I think our team did a really good job
of not being discouraged. Basketball is a game of runs. They had a run in the
beginning of the game, and we got our run right before halftime to give us a
chance in the second half. I don't think our team ever thought‑‑ maybe we did
panic, but nobody showed it. I think that's something that our team did really
well.  
  
Q. I don't want to make you guys cry, but this is the last time you'll play
on this court. What is going through your minds right now?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Wow, I mean, if there is any way to win at Maples in front of
your fans and family and everything, it's a win with heart. Honestly it's
unreal what just happened. Just to push through when you're not necessarily
playing well and you have people like Mikaela playing out of her mind because
we're at home and there are so many people. She's come so far, and we've had
so many people that just really wanted to keep this year going, and that
started with everyone, not necessarily people who were out there, but like
Erica Payne, Jasmine Camp preparing us. I guess that's like the only thing.  
We have so much heart this team. Sometimes people say heart, you can't win
only on heart, but tonight, I think we did.  
MIKAELA RUEF: At the beginning of the year when the regional sites came out
and I saw there was one at Stanford I was determined to play here, to win
here, to go to the Final Four. This was our goal all year to win here and go
to the Final Four. We have higher goals, but to be able to do it in front of
our home crowd, in front of my grandparents who have been coming to games for
five years.  
My freshman year I would sit at the very end of the bench, and as Tara would
say, hug the water cooler. They've been great supporters. My grandparents are
the reason why I started playing basketball to begin with. To be able to play
the regional championship, to go to the Final Four in front of them with them
cheering is the most amazing feeling ever. In front of all of our fans, there
is no greater feeling that I've had here in my entire time, and I just am so
happy and words honestly can't describe it. Happy is not happy enough. It's
more than that. I'm so‑‑  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Extremely elated.  
MIKAELA RUEF: To make fun of Kayla, extremely elated.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now open it up for questions for Coach VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, was this the game of Mikaela's life?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It was by far her best game ever putting on a Stanford
uniform. You know, but Mikaela downplays how much work she put into doing what
she did tonight. You know, she's one of those early risers and she was in the
gym getting her shot up. People have played soft on her because of Chiney's
incredible ability, and she was ready for it. It was really exciting to see
her play so well. For us to have five people in double figures, and Chiney
struggled. I know Chiney had a double‑double. But she really‑‑ you know, you
kind of asked about it, but when you come out, and she was a little bit like a
circuit overloaded, which is what happened right here? She wasn't herself. She
was missing defensive assignments. She was trying so hard. She might have said
it wasn't panic, but it looked like it. Not just her, but she wanted to do it
so badly for her team, her fans, all that she represents at Stanford so it's
great that Mikaela could kind of be her Robin tonight.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the first ten minutes? You said it's good the
game doesn't end there. But those first ten minutes you guys are hitting
threes and you're in a bit of a hole, what were you thinking at that point?  
COACH VANDERVEER: There were a couple plays where Amber went for a steal and
the girls open with the three. They came out, and first of all, they're a very
talented team and an athletic team. For us to only have 13 turnovers and them
having 13 turnovers, that was a really good thing for us to take care of the
ball. The game was plenty physical. Should people be allowed to hack and foul
each other? I don't think so. I mean, we can do that too. But I think
adjusting to the size, they're a very big team, and to figure out‑‑ it took us
a little while to say what should we be doing offensively to help our team get
the shot that's we need? And I thought we got some great shots in the first
half.  
Bonnie had some wonderful looks, Lili was wide open. Mikaela, they're leaving
people. They had three people on Chiney, and I told our team, we're not going
anywhere without other people. This is not going to be‑‑ this is other
people's time to step up. They're giving us what we like. We like to shoot.
Bonnie, that's what you were recruited for. Lili, this is a shooting game.
This is up our alley. Let's go get our shots up, and we did such a good job in
the second half shooting like 58%.  
  
Q. Obviously, they thought by banging you and doing all that stuff was the
way to beat you. Do you think you guys proved something tonight by overcoming
that? You mentioned you didn't think they'd be able to hack, is it an insult
for them to try to do that? Give me your feeling about that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that you look at Chiney and what else can you do?
You've got to body her. She gets that every single game. But other people, you
have to draw‑‑ she'll draw them in and other people have to draw them out. So
the fact that Bonnie hit shots, Amber, I thought Amber kept us in the game in
the first half offensively. Then defensively, we had some slip‑ups, but once
we got on track defensively, and I like it when we have the whole week to get
ready, but we only had a day for people to learn a lot of stuff, and they
learned it very well. You know, we opened it up for Chiney by hitting outside
shots.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, now six out of the last seven Final Fours, it's a
remarkable record. But you haven't pushed through to win one. What is the best
word in your mind to describe your feelings about all of that? Is it
frustrated, angry? You haven't been able to do it, looking ahead, how do you
see it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I am so excited for our team to be up here tonight and be
happy. I'm so proud of how we battled. You know, we didn't go anywhere last
year, and we had some kind of dips in the road this year that I think really
have helped us be who we are.  
We'll be ready. We're excited. We're looking forward to playing Connecticut.
We're looking forward to going to Nashville. But tonight we're going to enjoy
being a regional champion and representing the West. We have great basketball
on the west coast.  
  
Q. Was that the best defense you've seen from Chiney? And it was 24 minutes
into the game before you got a pass to her on the low post. Were you thinking
man, as a coach, I've got to find a way to get the ball down to her?  
COACH VANDERVEER: When she had three people on her, I was like look, you guys,
other people are going to have to knock down some shots. You know? It did take
us a while to get her on the move, but as soon as we had some people open it
up with some perimeter shots, and I think that was good for her.  
You know, I think it was a good scheme. We've played against it a lot, and
they made it a really good scheme because they're so big and their whole team
is so athletic. But I think that I personally thought that for us we could
handle it. It just took us a while to get some traction.  
  
Q. I'm sure in Nashville a lot of people are going to be expecting the final
of Connecticut and Notre Dame. But I'm just wondering what you think or how
you think your team is different than the first time you played Connecticut
earlier this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think our team can‑‑ the fact that we've played them
already helps us. Everyone will understand this is what we need to do. They're
a very big team. They're a very talented team. But our team will be very
focused, and the fact that we've played them has played to our advantage.  
If they just wanted a Connecticut‑Notre Dame showdown, what did they make us
do this for? If they wanted from the selection show just to have these two
teams and show up in Nashville, then where's the excitement? I think everyone
last year thought Baylor was going to win. Obviously, they didn't.  
So we're excited. We're looking forward to it, and our coaches and team will
work really hard to play better than we did last time at Connecticut in the
opening game. I think we're much improved.  
  
Q. Coach, when other teams are preparing for you guys, do you think that the
opposing coach sits down and tells his team, hey, Chiney's going to make plays
for 35 minutes? She's in great shape. She will make plays in the last couple
minutes of the game, or does it sneak up on them in terms of just how
consistent she is throughout the whole game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that Chiney's played against everything that she's
going to see. She's played against doubles and triples and banging and
fronting. She's a player. In some ways I think she'll be excited not to have
three people hanging on her. But she's ready for anything that they throw at
her.  
  
Q. You play any country music?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm going to listen to some country music. I'm going to be
ready. I'm going to get some cowboy boots and be ready for it. I'm excited.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  74  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by University of NorthCarolina Associate Head
Coach, Andrew Calder, student‑athletes, Diamond DeShields, Allisha Gray, and
Xylina McDaniel. Coach, can you start us with an opening statement?  
COACH CALDER: Yes, I said this to the players and I will say it to you. I want
to first thank Coach Hatchell for the respect she gave me for trusting me with
her team. Thank you, Coach Hatchell. I want to thank the players for the
respect you gave me to lead you. I thank the Athletic Director and Associate
Athletic Director for the respect you gave me for trusting me with the team
this year.  
We had the talent to get to the Final Four, and I didn't get us there, for
that, I'm sorry. We had some outstanding players and we battled extremely
hard. But next year we have a lot of players coming back, and we have a Hall
of Fame coach that's going to work with them every day.  
Congratulations to Coach VanDerveer, an outstanding coach. I respect her so
much, an outstanding woman and Stanford University women's basketball team,
and Stanford University, it's a beautiful campus, and you did a great job
hosting this tournament. Thank you.  
  
Q. You guys did a good job of balling up Chiney in the first half in
particular, and they managed to get her loose. Could you just talk about what
changed there and what happened that sort of shifted in their direction?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: I mean, the second half we couldn't play as hard as we wanted
to in the post because I mean we did have‑‑ I had two fouls in the first half.
I believe Stephanie ended up having two fouls in the first half. I mean, we're
not going to be able to battle as hard as we wanted to, and that's what we do.
We battle hard in the post to stop the post players so I mean, that helped
them out a lot.  
  
Q. Diamond, can you just tell us how you were feeling when it was touch and
go. I know it was really painful, but you were going to give it your all and
you did.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, definitely. I played to the best of my abilities. I
refuse to make excuses for myself. My legs felt good and I felt able enough to
go out there and give it a hundred percent, which I did. Yeah, I mean,
everything felt good. You have adrenaline and you're warmed up. Warm‑ups were
a little tough just because I was stiff and cold, but once the game started
and my body got heated up, I was just fine.  
  
Q. Allisha, you were hot in the first half, 17 points going into halftime
feeling really good. What went on in the second half with you?  
ALLISHA GRAY: I don't think nothing happened in the second half. I think I
kept my intensity in my play.  
COACH CALDER: I need to do a better job getting her the basketball. We ran
some plays for her, we just didn't set good screens. We need to set better
screens. In the first half we were able to move on our screens a little bit
and we weren't in the second half. So we've still got to set better screens
and come off those screens. So that's my responsibility to get her a shot.  
  
Q. Xylina, you did a great job and the rest of the team did on Chiney in the
first half. What were you guys doing in particular, technically or whatever
trying to defend her?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: Honestly, I was just playing. My whole mindset was don't let
her get the ball. Don't let her get offensive rebounds, so I was just using my
strength to my advantage. I'm very strong in the post, so why not use it? I
mean, it was working.  
  
Q. Allisha, can you talk about defensively they had five players in double
figures, they were kind of scoring from everywhere. Was that making it
difficult for you guys to figure out what you were going to be defending?  
ALLISHA GRAY: No, I mean, it was basically because we were in foul trouble we
couldn't play as hard as we wanted to because we were going to get a foul
called on us. So I don't think we had the defense (Indiscernible) most players
were in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about Jessica? She really played great and made
some big shots in the second half. Obviously, she's as young as you, Allisha
and Diamond, just talk about how she kind of grew in this tournament?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Jess has struggled with her confidence as far as taking
shots. I don't know why, because she's very able, as you see out there. And
tonight I recognized that I wasn't able to get open shots in the second half,
Allisha wasn't able to get open shots. So I told Jess at the timeout, you've
got to take it. You've got to take the shot for us, and she did. Like I said,
she's very capable. So I mean, those are shots she should always take. She
should have been taking them all year. Something in her was telling her no,
but I gave her the okay about it, and I think that made her more confident.  
  
Q. Diamond, you guys came out just on fire in a hostile environment. You
guys got to be proud of the way you came out, especially in a tough situation
to play?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Of course, of course. You can't help but be proud
especially with such a young group. We never really were affected by the
crowd, I don't think. I know it's just easy to ignore them, basically. But
they did do a good job supporting their team. They had great attendance
tonight and great energy, and that really fuelled the intensity of the game.  
  
Q. Diamond, is it fair to say that you guys feel like you should have won
this game?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yes.  
  
Q. Xylina, twice fouls have been mentioned as sort of the culprit tonight.
Is there a suggestion that the officiating was a little too tough on you
guys?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: Officiating to me was just inconsistent. Sometimes they let
us battle in there and sometimes they'd call a foul. So you really didn't know
when and where you could be physical. I mean, yeah, in my eyes it was just
inconsistent.  
  
Q. It looked from where I was watching that it was a really physical game
tonight. Was it more physical than other games you've played this year? Was it
not physical enough then, and what do you think about Stanford moving ahead in
all of that?  
XYLINA McDANIEL: We play in the ACC. The ACC is a very physical conference. A
lot of people don't like to say it, but it is really physical. It wasn't
really a physical game to us. It might have been to them, but not to us. We're
used to it.  
I mean, yes, we should have won, but, hey, we're coming back with the same
team next year, and then Megan Buckland will be well, so we'll have her as
well. I mean, we're just going to move forward with this. I mean, it's a loss,
but we're going to learn from it, and come back harder next year.  
  
Q. Diamond, your teammate just said that you guys should have won. What
tangible factor leads you to say that?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, there were moments where there could have been
momentum shifts for us. I know the free throw that Allisha
uncharacteristically missed, not to blame her for anything, but there were
just moments in time. I know Danielle missed a lay‑up under the basket that
could have been a big play. There were a couple of iffy foul calls, and just a
lot of stuff that could have really changed the game around.  
I'm not going to blame officiating. The game is over with. But I do believe
that there were some specific moments in times that we could have really taken
the lead back, and it just didn't go our way.  
  
Q. Assuming you guys were right with Stanford in the whole game. The last
four minutes things kind of fell apart, could you put your finger on what
happened there at the end?  
COACH CALDER: Well, obviously, they're very good. They played well together
for more than one year. They executed on the week down the stretch. Got some
looks. I tell you, I thought we got plenty of good looks to start the second
half that went in the first half. I thought we got what we wanted. They did a
pretty good job on Diamond, but Diamond's going to be, you know, she was‑‑ I'm
not going to say injured, because we're a no‑excuse team. We don't get any
excuses, but Diamond wasn't quite‑‑ I don't want to say that, no.  
I don't know. I thought the game could have been more physical than it was
actually played. We wanted to bang her more down inside. We banged her in the
first half and they allowed us to do that, and we wanted to bang her more in
the second half. But we're talented and we should have won this game. We
didn't execute down the stretch, and they executed down the stretch. Bottom
line.  
  
Q. Coach, can you address the balance they ended up having? They scored from
a lot of different places. Was that a problem for your defense?  
COACH CALDER: Well, we play the percentages. You're going to have to look at
it. I think Ruef made two threes all year. Is that right? Do you know? She
made two all year and she made three tonight. We played the percentages. We
backed off her in the first half and they were able to put somebody in front
and behind Ogwumike, and that gave us a lot of confidence. Then she made a
couple of threes, and that obviously changed the game when she was able to
make those threes. So I thought that was big.  
Then that left single coverage down inside on Ogwumike, and we weren't able to
handle her like we had wanted to in the second half. We thought we could play
her one‑on‑one though on the inside.  
  
Q. Do you think Ruef was the X ‑factor tonight?   
COACH CALDER: Ruef was no question the X‑factor, because she doesn't make
those threes and we're still right on top of her. We're on top of Ogwumike,
they're still struggling to score. We went off the handoffs outside. She was
an X‑factor obviously in the game. She was the difference in the game for
them. For their ability to score.  
  
Q. Just to clarify, you said you wanted to bang her or you thought you
banged her in the first half or in the second half. You're talking about
Ogwumike, right?  
COACH CALDER: Yeah, we thought we could have banged her more.  
  
Q. Is it in your mind being physical with her the key to beating the
Stanford team? How do you think they'll do moving ahead against the
competition next week?  
COACH CALDER: I don't know. That's hard to say. UCONN's got the best team in
America, great coach, great talent. I mean, they're clicking. You take
something away from them, and they've got counters left and right. That will
be a difficult game. I don't want to say Ogwumike with her talent is a great
enough talent to win a game, but Connecticut's just unbelievable. They defend.
They move the ball like you can't imagine. They're really skilled, really
impressive.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH CALDER: Oh, yeah. No question. You've got to be physical with her. She's
too athletic. She's too athletic. You can't put your body on her. She just
drives around you. You've got to be able to put your body on her. Try to get
her away from the basket. She's not as good the further away she gets from the
basket. She's outstanding down in there low. Outstanding down around the
basket. So you try to bump her and move her away from the basket as much as
possible, and that's what our game plan was.  
  
Q. Coach, you apologized to Tar Heel Nation earlier saying that you
apologize for losing. But do you guys overachieve being that you beat the No.
1 seed here and you beat the No. 2 seed which is actually the home team? Do
you think you're being too hard on yourself?  
COACH CALDER: I think we had the talent to get to the Final Four. I don't
think there is any question. That was my job, my responsibility to get us
there. If we're not there and we've got that talent, then I take that
responsibility for UNC, and I am sorry.  
But we'll continue to work. We have a Hall of Fame coach coming back next
year, so that will help us out, and we'll roll from there.  
  
Q. Coach, I've got to commend you guys. You guys played great tonight and
throughout the tournament, your group is very confident. Do you think when
they go home they'll at least acknowledge the fact that Chiney is probably in
better shape than anybody in the country in terms of her physical conditioning
and got them late. Up here they're going to be very confident and feel that
they could have overcome anything, but that's part of their maturation, right,
that they have to see how great players get it done and kind of incorporate
that into their own game.  
COACH CALDER: Yeah, but if you talk about‑‑ Diamond knows how to get it done,
trust me. She's an unbelievable basketball IQ. She knows what to do. She
studies great players, studies Michael Jordan. She studies those players and
she knows how to get it done.  
  
Q. Andrew, yesterday we talked about experience and maybe having a little
bit more veteran experience than you guys did in games of this magnitude. Did
you feel like that played in your world tonight?  
COACH CALDER: Maybe more Coach Hatchell experience than Coach Calder
experience, how about that experience right there? We did some things at the
end that I wish I could replay, but I can't. I don't ever look back and say at
that time and moment, you know what, this is the decision we're going with.
This is what we're going to do right now, and I'm not going to look back.  
But obviously, having a Hall of Fame coach on the bench could have made the
difference in the game. We'll never know.  
Let me say it's a really tough day to lose. But Tiger Woods is not playing in
the Masters, and that's bad too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Calder.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  82  
PENN STATE - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tara VanDerveer, Chiney Ogwumike, Amber Orrange
and Lili Thompson. Coach, can we get an opening statement?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm really excited for our team. I thought we played really
smart. We worked really hard, and I want to compliment Penn State. First, I
think Coquese and her staff do a fabulous job. They're really talented.
They're really big, and we had to work really hard to win. I especially think
that the defense that Lili played on Maggie Lucas was a real positive reason
why we won. But we had great contributions from a lot of people, and we're
really excited to be playing on Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lili, can you talk a little about what your plan was against Maggie, and
how it worked during the course of the game?  
LILI THOMPSON: Coach provided me with a lot of film to watch on her, and I
kind of studied her game and just decided that I wanted to shut her down and
make other people score for them, and that would be the best way I could
contribute to the win. So just playing hard and trying not to let her get as
many touches as she usually does was pretty much my number one plan.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you talk about that run that you guys had in the first half?
You were down by 4. They had scored 7 in a row, I think, and then you guys
went up on a 14 ‑0 run. What changed there for you guys? Was it a scheme thing
or was it just sort of an energy?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I don't think our team is really conscious about runs. We
just go out there and try to do our jobs. If that amounts in them not being
able to‑‑ us bringing the defensive energy and us scoring, that's what we
expect. I think we have high expectations and that starts with Coach Tara. She
pushes us every day, and sets huge goals. Like Lili will really work hard and
Mikaela and I to O‑board and rebound, and those goals are what we try to
attain as many possessions in the game as possible. So we're not really
conscious of runs, so it sort of surprises us when people tell us the stats
after games like that.  
  
Q. Amber and Chiney and Lili, what did Mikaela show you on both ends of the
floor early on, just making plays and with the energy she brought? Also, just
the balance you guys were able to produce today?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I think defensively Mikaela's rebounding was really essential
for us. Like in the beginning of the game they were getting a lot of offensive
rebounds, but as we focused on it and Mikaela just boxed out and got more
rebounds, and I think that made the difference, like you said, in the run that
we had.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In some ways Mikaela's our rock out there. She sees the game
so well, and she knows what defense the other you team is running and she
usually calls out and echos what Amber says for our offense. She's our rock
and she does a lot of the grunt work, like getting rebounds, blocking out
every time and making the extra pass and things like that, finding the open
person. So we're just so fortunate to have someone and she's so passionate. I
don't know if you can tell, but she wants to win. This is her fifth year.
Playing at home, playing in general means a lot to her, so she just brings
that and it's contagious to our team.  
  
Q. Lili, you guys got off to a good start today instead of the slow start
you guys had gotten off to in the first games in this tournament. What was the
difference between today and maybe the first two games?  
LILI THOMPSON: I just remember Chiney telling us before the game if we took
care of the energy, the start would take care of itself. We wouldn't have to
focus on not so much the scoreboard telling us how we were playing, but how we
felt out there. We came out, the energy was there on both offense and defense,
so I think that contributed to the better start that we had today.  
  
Q. Chiney, I'll let you look at the stats. Tell me when you're ready.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Oh, we're good.  
  
Q. All season you've been trying to act like you don't really do much and
you've talked so much about all your other teammates. Was the game today ‑‑ I
mean, really, everybody that came in contributed something important. I'm
wondering if that is what you envisioned when we talked back in October and
November about what you saw?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I completely agree. I think today was an ideal day for
Stanford basketball. I think we had so many contributions. I'm looking at
defense, looking at offense, and I told my team, you guys, we are great
players collectively and individually. I want to be an afterthought. I want
people to be aggressive, and I think that's what we saw. There was a point
where Amber drove into the paint and it was basically 1 on 5, and she shot it
over one of their big posts. I was just like, wow, this is the kind of energy
and intensity we want. Lili was ferocious on the defensive end. Mikaela's
always doing the grunt work, and Sara James is a huge leader for us. Having
that aggressive mindset, and that's what Coach Tara said, one of our big goals
for the game was have the aggressive mindset. We know they have the size
advantage, but we want to have the heart advantage.  
  
Q. Amber, talk about your third year and how you've controlled the offense
and just the patience you guys have within your offense and don't panic and
the shot clock situations? What kind of drills Tara has taught you along the
way?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I would say we've done a lot of triangle offense drills. But
for me personally, it's just focusing on being vocal and making sure we have
everyone's attention, so when we run a play, everyone knows what we're running
and everyone's in the right position so that we can run it smoothly.  
  
Q. Chiney, can you just talk about four years ago I remember seeing you play
San Francisco in the summer league, and it was obvious that you were just
going to be the type of player that was going to offensive rebound. Now here
it is four years later, and I've got a half a page of list of different places
on the floor where you hit the ball, and plays were being run. Just talk about
that transition of being a player who is kind of floating around and now
you're an integral part of the offense with all these different plays being
run for you and through you?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think first of all, it's the utmost honor of being the
recipient of so many passes on my team. And the way I approach everything is I
don't want to let my teammates down. If Mikaela gives me a great pass, I want
to finish for her. If I'm open on the perimeter, I want to make the best play.
I need to find the shooters if I'm double teamed. I think it's cool to see how
far we've come, but at the same time whatever I do it's for my team, and I'm
just so fortunate to have such unselfish teammates that pass it to me all the
time. But I just try to make the best play for everyone, and if it's kicking
it out to get our shooters going and being aggressive and not being afraid to
get blocks like I was multiple times today.  
  
Q. Chiney, what happened when you landed on your face in that rebound
there?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In the last minutes? I'm just old. Takes me a while to get
up. Yeah, I was sort of undercut, but it happens. I don't know. It just takes
me a while to get up. I'm fine.  
  
Q. Chiney, do you think this was on both ends of the floor as well as you
guys have played in a while? It looked that way.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think it feels good. I think as a team, like Coach said,
the past month or two months we've sort of been stagnant and we were just
fighting to get out of that. We want to play with energy and confidence, and
that's the number one thing, confidence. I think our team is so deep. It's
understated how many people come into the game. Coach says it's by committee.
Someone has to guard Lucas. Just happens to be the person that started on her,
which is Lili, was great.  
We have so much faith that someone else can come in and do like for one play
or two plays, make that play. So I think we just want to play where we feel
good about how we're playing. I think today was a great moment for us. I think
this tournament has been building that for us as well.  
  
Q. You guys are one win away from making the Final Four. What's it going to
take for this team to get there?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Just aggressiveness. That is the number one thing we talk
about, aggressiveness. It doesn't matter who we play, we just want to play
Stanford basketball. Coach says that all the time. So I think it's just coming
out, being assertive and leaving it all on the court. It's weird, we talk a
lot about intangibles and, I think that helps us.  
  
Q. Chiney, there was talk from Penn State about playing here. The band even
did a neutral site, neutral site chant late in the game when they were down by
20. Could you having been exiled to Iowa for the first two rounds, could you
talk about the environment today and what that meant to you in terms of the
energy?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think we had to earn the right to play at home, and that
started in the first and second round. We had two tough games, SouthDakota was
great and Florida State was great. So I think we had to earn the right to play
at home. The crowd was great. We love nerd nation, but it comes down to doing
our jobs on the court. The energy was great, but people in the stands can't
make the plays. So I think that's what we focused on, just controlling what we
can control. It's nice to have cheers behind us, but I think it just comes
down to just playing basketball.  
LILI THOMPSON: I think Chiney's right. We had to go to Iowa first and fight
through those two really good teams to come back here. It makes it more
special, but if we're not doing what we need to do, our fans are going to be
quiet anyway. So allowing us to get off to a good start and keeping the energy
high is something that we have to bring as a team.  
AMBER ORRANGE: I agree with them both. I would say the energy helps us more.
The energy from the crowd gave us energy. I think we just fed off of it, and
it really helped us.  
  
Q. Amber, Lili, where was it when Chiney told you guys today that she wanted
to be an after thought? Was that your final hug, team group meeting before you
hit the floor or?  
AMBER ORRANGE: This whole season Chiney has been really unselfish. Even though
she's the most dominant player on the court, it's never about Chiney. She
always puts us first. Tells us to be aggressive and score and shoot the ball
and she'll get the rebound for us. So she's really unselfish.  
LILI THOMPSON: Yeah, the same. It wasn't something that was just said once,
but we know that Chiney's going to get doubled. So if we're being aggressive,
it kind of hurts the other team when they double her. So it's kind of
something that she's advised us about all season, just unselfishness.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations. Questions for Coach
VanDerveer.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the game in terms of you guys being down a
little bit, and then they were playing the zone, you guys hit a couple of
threes in transition. But what was the key to that today?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, we switched things up offensively a little bit. We
went kind of more of a 1‑4 high and tried to spread out a little bit more. We
never really know exactly how teams are going to play us, so kind of in the
beginning it's kind of just like figuring out what are they trying to do. Penn
State came out and they were really extended defensively on us, getting out,
getting in passing lanes. I think that's why we had some really nice backdoor
plays.  
Amber had a really nice play where she got a lay‑up, and I think that was in
that run. Bonnie hit some shots. Taylor got her three‑point shooting going.
But Mikaela had some great plays in the beginning of the game. She led her
team in D‑boards, and I thought she rebounded really well. She had five
assists. She played really well in the beginning of the game.  
We got some stuff‑‑ we're not like a big kind of turn the ball over team, but
we did get some turnovers and we were able to push it in transition, and
Amber, I thought had a great game.  
  
Q. Tara, has Lili Thompson taken over the defensive back court job that Toni
Kokeni used to have? Can you talk a little bit about exactly how she did this
in today's game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think one of the things is that we have played
against great teams during the year. She played against Meighan Simmons who is
really super athletic and quick. Crook at USC, very tough match‑up, Boyd at
Cal. I could go through kind of the list of guarding Fields. I kind of had to
take Lili out a couple times like you're not guarding that girl. So I think
that Lili really understood that this was her job, and for us to be
successful, she had to do it. And I thought she did a fabulous job. Maggie
Lucas hasn't had six points since third grade. That girl can flat out score.
We've seen her light up teams. She's in a great league and she's a great
player.  
We had to not only have Lili, but other people had to help on her and make
them have someone else score besides her.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk a little bit more about your back court? You only had
one turnover in that first half, and certainly that helped get the runs going
too.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, they talk about the tournament having good guard
play. We have some guards that are really stepping up. I thought Amber had a
fabulous game. She scored well for us, and Amber is a great defender. We can
put her on somebody if we need to work hard on them. But Lili and Amber have
really good communication out on the court. They play really well together.
They're very unselfish. None of them care about their own points. They just
want to do whatever the situation is dictating. If they're open, they'll take
shots.  
I thought Amber had a big three. She had a nice pull‑up, she went to the
basket very well. I thought this was one of her very best games of her career
at Stanford.  
  
Q. Tara, was this the most complete game you guys have played maybe this
season, but in a while? Do you feel like maybe the team is hitting the stride
at the right time?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, I think people‑‑ I think different things happened in
the season. For us probably come back to the Pac‑12 tournament where we stunk
it up, and we got sent home. I think that got everybody's attention. You know,
if you want to play, you've got to do the right thing. Our team really focused
a lot in practice, and to have‑‑ I thought everyone did something valuable for
our team to be successful. Mikaela played well, Chiney played well, Amber,
Lili. Sara James started us out but then Bonnie came in and did a good job,
and Taylor did a good job.  
We're going to need more to be successful Tuesday night. We'll need more from
more people.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm not sure where that ever came in. You could hear them
say well, Coach Tara says this. I've never said that. You know, Chiney is a
star, and she is‑‑ she does amazing things for us. I thought that she was up
against some really big, physical kids. It's not going to get any easier. But
I think that sometimes she needs other people to make plays so she doesn't
have to feel like she has to do it all. And other people made plays today, and
that was great.  
  
Q. Along that line, Chiney said this felt really good today. Did it feel
good to you? Is it important that it feels good to them at this point in the
season?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Definitely, it was a very happy locker room. I didn't
recognize the dance moves, but they were really happy. This is a team that,
through even not winning, they don't turn on themselves at all. They are
really a tight group. I think that's because there is great leadership with
Chiney and Sara and Mikaela Ruef. Kids are very unselfish.  
But they have fun, and they know they've played well. I mean, like one
turnover, nine turnovers, I thought we did a really nice job. We did things
that we needed to do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about do you run more sets for Chiney than you
did with Jane when Jane was here? And second part of that would be if not
maybe was that one set that you ran in the first half where Chiney got a full
run at the basket from the top of the key, got Bonnie on the left.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, we were not running anything for Chiney. We don't
really run anything for Chiney because she gets so much out of just our
transition and our regular offense. So basically all the sets, there might be
an occasional one, but we don't run stuff for her. We want other people kind
of to‑‑ we don't want to come down and think about going into Chiney. In fact,
I say other people have to touch the ball, other people need to do things.  
  
Q. In the first half you had a nine ‑minute run of only allowing two field
goals. Can you comment on that?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that our team, one thing they do is I think
actually one of my favorites, Charles Barkley talked about this yesterday and
I told our team this. You know, we had a week to get ready, and our team can
really absorb. There is no finals, there is no studying. They're watching
video and they're absorbing what we're asking them to do. I think they were
really able to absorb the scouting report. Now it's easier when we have a week
and we obviously have only a day. But they were really able to take the
scouting report and really focus on what we were planning to do. Take away
people's favorite moves. Not have the key people beat you. Make other people.
I thought Ariel Edwards did a nice job in the first half of the game for them,
but that wasn't Maggie Lucas.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think we had a great crowd, and I hope everybody will come
back on Tuesday.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  82  
PENN STATE - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State head coach Coquese Washington and
student‑athletes, Talia East and Ariel Edwards. Coach Washington has chosen
not to make an opening statement, so we'll take questions for the
student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, will you talk about the run that Stanford had in the first half? I
think it ended up being 14 ‑0\. You guys were up at that point and things
turned really quickly. What happened there?   
ARIEL EDWARDS: They got out in transition a good amount. Chiney was running
the floor very well, and they found her a lot in transition and they did a
good job of crashing the offensive boards. Yeah, they did a very good job of
that.  
  
Q. Talia, how was it playing against Chiney? Was she what you expected?  
TALIA EAST: She's a great player, I think. She did a good job with what her
teammates gave her. I mean, my main goal was to make it physical and difficult
for her, and I think I did that. She made some tough shots, but I was just
trying to make it difficult for her.  
  
Q. You guys were able to start out the game getting some things going
inside, and it seemed to dry up a little bit. Did they change something
defensively that made it harder for you guys to get going?  
TALIA EAST: I'm not sure if they started doubling a little bit, but the paint
got a little bit crowded.  
  
Q. Ariel, can you talk a little bit about being aggressive, especially
toward the end of the first half and in the second half trying to get your
offense going?  
ARIEL EDWARDS: Well, my coaches kept telling me that they needed me to be
aggressive this game. After I got a little bit of the jitters out, I felt like
I settled in a little bit and was able to be more aggressive. My teammates
definitely helped me out. They found me when I was open and they played great
today, so all the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Talia, had you seen Maggie get frustrated like that at any time this
season?  
TALIA EAST: I don't think she was necessarily frustrated. We all kind of‑‑ I
think it was jitters. We all were a little bit jittery, but I don't think she
was necessarily frustrated.  
  
Q. Ariel, will you talk a little bit in the second half trying to get back
in the game? You guys couldn't get it under double digits. Was it a matter of
just not being able to put enough shots together to get some momentum and
stops at the other end?  
ARIEL EDWARDS: I would say shots more than defensive end. They did a great job
of executing their game plan and running their offense all the way through. We
were trading baskets for a while, and we know that's not the recipe to win a
game. So that's what I would say.  
  
Q. Talia, can you just talk about what you guys, what the game plan was to
disrupt their triangle offense? It looked like you guys were doing a lot of
bumping in the second half and the refs didn't help you. But it looked like
you wanted to be physical with them in terms of your cutting.  
TALIA EAST: That was part of it, to be physical and kind of disrupt them a
little bit. But sometimes calls don't go your way and that's okay. That's the
way it works. But they did a good job of executing their game plan. It didn't
really fluster them at all. They came out and played well.  
  
Q. Ariel, Talia, talk about how difficult it was to come in and play on
Stanford's home court and try to take the crowd out of it?  
TALIA EAST: I think Stanford, you know, it wasn't‑‑ I don't think the crowd
was swaying any point in the game. They were loud, but we've experienced
things like that throughout playing in the Big Ten.  
ARIEL EDWARDS: This is definitely a difficult place to play. We knew they were
going to use that energy from the crowd and come out hard and they did. They
used that energy throughout the whole game. As I said before, they played very
well today, and all the credit goes to them.  
  
Q. Talia, you guys talked a lot about defense before the game. How tough was
it to come out and give up 44 in the first half?  
TALIA EAST: I mean, I agree with what Ariel said, we were trading baskets. You
know, I think both teams getting the jitters out in the beginning of the game
and they kind of got a stretch in the beginning of the first half, but you
can't do that. We tweaked some things in the second half, but it was a hard
deficit to come back from.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll open it up for questions for
Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, will you talk about the defensive job that you thought they did on
Maggie, and how much it had to do with what they did defensively, and how much
had to do with Maggie?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought they did an outstanding job on her. She didn't get
very many clean, open looks. She put the ball on the floor. They ran secondary
and tough defenders at her. Then they just made her take tough shots all
night.  
  
Q. Coach, aside from the defense on Maggie, what went wrong for your team?
If you could sum up.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought offensively we didn't exhibit enough patience.
Once we got down a little bit, I thought we shot too quickly and we didn't
really make them work enough on the defensive end of the floor. That allowed
them to get out in transition a little bit to get some easy baskets and go on
a couple of the runs that they went on.  
  
Q. Coach, did Mikaela Ruef show you anything on both ends of the floor that
maybe were a step up from what you'd seen on tape from this woman?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I wouldn't say she showed anything that was a step up. But I
thought she played well off of Ogwumike today. She was very aggressive. I
mean, she's always aggressive on the backboard, but she was really aggressive
on the offensive end in terms of looking for a shot. As we knew coming into
the game, she's a fantastic passer, and she did some things that way. I just
thought she was pretty aggressive.  
  
Q. You probably saw what you were expecting from Ogwumike, but how much did
the other kids in their lineup hurt you guys today?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I thought we led Orrange get loose too much. She's a
really good, 15‑foot jump shooter, and I thought she got in the paint a little
bit too much for our liking. Some of that was because of transition. Some of
that was some defensive breakdowns in our help rotation. But coming to the
game, we knew that. That's why they're an outstanding team and they've won
30‑plus games. It's not just Chiney Ogwumike; they've got other players that
are capable of stepping up and making big plays. I thought Orrange did that. I
thought Mikaela did that. I thought Thompson hit some big and timely shots.
When you've got contributions coming from a number of different people it's
tough to stop a run and make a run of your own.  
  
Q. Is Ogwumike the best player you've played against all year? Do you like
her as a player?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I love her as a player. But we've played against quite a few
good teams this year, and we've played against some really good players. I'll
leave that up to other people to rank where she is. I know she's outstanding
and she's an All American for a reason.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that first half Stanford run. You went on a 7
‑0 run and they answered immediately, and obviously pushed it out even
further? What was going on? You guys went to the zone?   
COACH WASHINGTON: Yeah, we had a couple of defensive breakdowns. They got two
breakaway lay‑ups, got some uncontested shots and then they hit the three in
the corner. I think those plays were somewhat deflating. You know, we seemed
to never really recover from those three plays in particular. I think they got
a lot of confidence once they went on that run. Or I think they settled down
and settled into the game and played with a lot of confidence from then on
out.  
  
Q. What did you think of Edwards play in this ballgame?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think she played like she's been playing the last ten, 12
games of the season. When she's really aggressive and attacking the basket,
you know, and her mid‑range game. You know, she's a tough cover, and I thought
she played really well on the offensive end and gave us some big shots.  
  
Q. You won't get out of here without us asking about playing on Stanford's
home floor. What impact do you think it had on what you did and what they
did?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm not in favor of it. I think it's an extremely difficult
task to act. I'm glad the NCAA has gone back to neutral sites in the regional
next year moving forward. I think that's important for our game. But that's
the path that we had at hand today, and I think it's on one hand a good
experience for our kids to come out and play in Maples Pavilion and play on
this campus and have this kind of game. But in terms of the competitive equity
for the NCAA Tournament, I'm glad we're going back to neutral sites for the
regionals.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

North Carolina  65  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of South Carolina head coach Dawn
Staley and student‑athletes Alaina Coates and Tiffany Mitchell.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH STALEY: I'm just disappointed that our season ends tonight, but truly
proud of the team we put on the floor, just proud of the effort that we gave,
proud of the season that we had.  
I think our players did probably what most people didn't think was possible.
I'll say this and then you can open it up for questions. This probably won't
be the last time you see a South Carolina women's basketball team at this late
stage of the NCAA tournament. So we're going to look forward to our future.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tiffany, just seemed like very early in the game North Carolina was
really shutting off the passing lanes, not letting you get inside. What were
they doing to keep you from the rim?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: They were just clogging. They were sagging off a lot,
clogging up the paint, making it difficult for us to drive in the lane.  
  
Q. Alaina, what advantage did you see when you were able to get things going
inside there for the team?  
ALAINA COATES: I was able to take advantage of the fact that their post
players were in foul trouble and they weren't trying to go as hard as they
wanted to because they were in foul trouble.  
I saw that as an opportunity to get really physical, knock down the shots,
make sure I was open for my teammates to see me.  
  
Q. Alaina, with that, you started out a little rough with your teammates.
The layups would not fall. Was it just the rim, strange gym, North Carolina
bumping you a little?  
ALAINA COATES: We just weren't able to execute shots. We know how to hit those
shots and we just weren't making them today.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you talk about at one point you were down 11, what Coach
Staley said to you at halftime to bring you back?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: She just told us we're still in this game, not to put our
heads down or anything. We still have a lot of time to play and come back.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you.  
We'll open it up for questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. You have been inside all year. That's been the preferred game plan. How
frustrating is it to see you get the entry lanes but they wouldn't fall that
early?  
COACH STALEY: A little frustrating. But anytime you can get a high‑percentage
shot like that... A little bit disappointing is us taking outside shots. I
think we got lured into taking them. If we can pound them, penetrate into the
paint, drawing fouls, when we started doing that, we started decreasing the
lead.  
  
Q. What effect did it have when Aleighsa had to sit down with two fouls in
the first half?  
COACH STALEY: Well, unfortunately for us it was Lisa and Tiffany Mitchell that
had to sit a few minutes in the first half.  
It's hard, but it wasn't a place which we've never been. I think Mississippi
State was one in which both of them had to sit.  
I thought we had enough to keep the game close. If we can hit some of those
easy shots in the paint, I don't think we would have felt it as much. Since we
didn't, your leading scorer and second leading scorer out, you feel that.  
  
Q. You mentioned this in your opening address, but how bright is the future
for this program?  
COACH STALEY: I feel really good about the future of our program. We're
probably a little bit ahead of schedule with what we're trying to do as far as
continuing to play on the second weekend and the third weekend of the NCAA
tournament.  
I just hope our players feel really disappointed that our season ends today
and hopefully they'll go back and work on their individual games, watch a lot
of film, watch the rest of the tournament, hopefully get motivated not being
at home at this time of the season.  
  
Q. What did you see from North Carolina? You saw them in December. What did
you see different? What type of growth did you notice from them?  
COACH STALEY: Well, probably North Carolina is a little more patient. They
seemed to be a lot more patient with us than most of the games that I've
watched them. They were really selective in the type of shots that they
wanted. I thought they did a good job of working inside‑out and keeping our
post players on the move. Also getting us in foul trouble.  
I thought they just put us back on our heels and forced us into some foul
trouble that you don't want to anticipate coming into a game like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_STANFORD, CALIFORNIA_  
  

North Carolina  65  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of North Carolina associate head
coach Andrew Calder, Diamond DeShields and Stephanie Mavunga.  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH CALDER: As always, I want to thank Coach Hatchell with the game plan,
the motivation to the players, gave them a great speech before we left, as did
the women's soccer coach, Coach Anson Dorrance.  
I want to say to South Carolina, Dawn Staley is a very, very good coach.
They're a talented team. Today we were successful against a very talented
team. I thought we battled hard, very hard. I thought it was a physical game,
the way we wanted to play it.  
Diamond, definitely an All‑American. Slightly injured, but she's a competitor
like you can't believe. You're not going to hold her back from being out there
and she'll be out there on Tuesday night.  
But congratulations to the Tar Heels, Mavunga, Xylina, Brittany. Their
defensive effort was tremendous. I thought defensively we were very good.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Diamond, what happened to you in the first half? Looked like it was a
knee and ankle?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: It was an ankle, then a knee. The first one was when Welch
was dribbling the ball in transition. I'm not really sure, but I twisted my
ankle. Went back and got it taped up super tight. Came back out. Then I
reinjured a preexisting knee injury that I had had earlier in the season. That
was it.  
But coach wanted to sit me for the half. Like I told him, I was ready to play.
I didn't want to have that burden on my shoulders of not having done
everything that I could to contribute to the team win.  
I think I didn't hold the team back with my injuries; I think I was still a
contributor and I was still able to produce. So coach trusted me, trusted my
instincts, I guess you could say. He put me out there and gave me a chance. I
did the best I could with it.  
  
Q. Stephanie, they got to within 2 with about five minutes left, then two
plays inside. Did you feel like that pushing it back out to 8, that was a key
point in the game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I guess I didn't really think about it till you just
mentioned it. Now that I look back, I'd say probably yes.  
But anytime we came back and fought back, every time they made a run at us, we
fought back, I felt like all those times were key points. Even Diamond's
injuries, those were key points. Me getting into foul trouble, those are key
points, things like that.  
So I'd say yeah because then that took the lead to 8. I mean, I'm just excited
that I could do that.  
  
Q. Stephanie, that was a back ‑and‑forth battle. Tough to have a game like
that. I think you are probably battle‑ready at this point. How difficult will
it be to have one day for the Elite 8?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I feel like we've practiced so hard this whole year, this
is what we've been waiting for. We've gone hard during the off‑season and
during the season. I think having just one day won't really hurt us.  
Yes, it's a quick turnaround, but there's things that we've done previously,
so I think that will help. It's not really going to change too much. Having a
quick turnaround won't really hurt us, I believe.  
  
Q. Talk about how important you thought it was in the first half, the
defense you played.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Definitely did set a tone. I believe it gave the coaching
staff of South Carolina something to think about going into the second half
because we were so successful defensively against their offense.  
It was new for us. We had barely practiced it in practice last night I think
it was. So it was new for us. We did a good job of adjusting to it. I know I
did. I think I had one of the toughest mental parts in the defense. I think
that I did a good job of adjusting.  
If I did make any mistakes, my teammates backed me up. So, yeah, like I said,
I believe our defense was extremely important in the first half.  
  
Q. You finished fifth in the ACC. Here you are trying to go to the Final
Four. As freshmen, it's unusual to see guys do as much as you do. Tell us,
what part of the season this year was the biggest part for your growth as a
player?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I can't really pinpoint any one specific moment in time
that was important for our growth. I just feel like as time has gone on, we've
grown exponentially. We've grown faster as time has gone on.  
At the beginning, it was a little bit slow. We were making typical freshmen
mistakes, I guess you could say. At this point in the game we're growing every
day, two times faster, three times faster than we were.  
I can't name a specific point. But as time goes on, as we continue on in this
tournament, we are growing faster ‑ only because we have to.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I agree every day we're getting better and better on the
court, off the court. We do a better job of feeding off of one another,
whether it's an upperclassman or underclassman. I can't think of a time in my
freshman year that I can say, Oh, my goodness, this is where I've gotten
better, this is where I've grown.  
I can just say in the off‑season, that was a lot of it. Then during season
every day, like I said, in every way we're just getting better and better.
Just the little things, the big things, rebounding, communication, just
everything I believe.  
  
Q. What are your first thoughts about playing Stanford?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: They're a great team. Phenomenal team. Great coach. Chiney
Ogwumike in the paint. USA Basketball player that is just dominating. Averages
over 25‑ish points a game. I watched her play many times on TV. Phenomenal
player. From the motherland, just like me, so I think that's cool.  
It's going to be a great game, a tough battle. Have one of my best friends,
Erica McCall, that plays on the team, so that will be fun.  
I feel once we get on the court it will be time to play. It's about who wants
it more. I think it will be a great battle. Up‑and‑down game. At the end of
the day it's who battles more and who wants it more that night.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Similar to what Stephanie said, you've got to play
attention to Chiney down low. I had the opportunity to play with her on a USA
Basketball team. It will be nice to reunite on opposite teams. She's the focal
point in their offense and in their defense.  
We're definitely going to do some things, figure some things out how to get
around her, how to find a weakness in their defense.  
Amber did a great job this year. Just Coach VanDerveer and their staff,
extremely smart coaches. We just got to be ready. Mentally it's about who's
better that night. We have to make sure we don't have any lapses and come out
with a lack of focus.  
They are at home so we're going to have to be on our toes.  
  
Q. Diamond, I'm sure this is a question you've answered before, but with
your father having played so many years for baseball, what advice does he give
you before a game like this, if any? Do you think having a father that played
at that level naturally trickles down to you?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, he's pretty simple before games. He doesn't try to
coach me or be that dad that's just annoying basically.  
All he told me was, You need to stay on the floor, you can't get in foul
trouble. I love you, good luck. That was that.  
Even when I got hurt, I need to stay on the floor. I got his voice in the back
of my head, I need to stay on the floor.  
Just having a father that's played professional, I don't think it's really
affected me. Maybe it has in an indirect way. He's a baseball player. Baseball
is a whole different culture. I understand that. As far as basketball goes,
you have to compete play by play by play. I think I have that naturally.  
Having athletic members of the family, it helps, because they understand. I
think as far as what I do on the basketball court, I think it's something that
God has blessed me with individually aside from any of my family members.  
  
Q. Can you both comment on what Coach Hatchell said to you before.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: She texted me and said, I have faith in you, I'm proud of
you, go out there and play hard. Words like that are encouraging, especially
at times you may forget. Sometimes you forget she's not here with us. I know I
have. Partially because she hasn't coached me. We've had Coach Calder with us
all year. Have that reminder play back in my head helped motivate me as far as
getting ready for the game.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Similar to what Diamond said, just like the little things
she said will get to you. She texted me also before the game. She's just like,
I'm really proud of you, so go out there and get 'em. I was smiling, Oh, my
gosh, coach just texted me.  
Just things like that make me smile, get me motivated. I know she's going to
be at the Final Four game in Nashville if we get there. God willing, we'll get
there. That keeps us going. Before we left, she kept saying, Well, Nashville,
there's the Final Four, there's Elite 8, all these games, why not us, why not
us? Why not Carolina? That always plays back in my head.  
Next play, next play. She's always saying that. Next play, forget about it.
Say I miss a shot, Next play. Not always immediately because sometimes I get
frustrated, then I have to be reminded, Next play. Just things like that.  
Oh, my goodness, we're going to the Elite 8, Final Four is next, why not us?  
  
Q. Stephanie, you're really familiar with South Carolina. I think some of
the players were teammates in high school if I have that right. You said you
know McCall. Now you're playing a team the other side of the country you don't
know. What does that present as far as an obstacle?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Like you said, I know McCall. We were teammates. Other than
that, I don't know any of the players or the way they play.  
I played against Samuelson. Other than that, I mean‑‑ oh, yeah, Kailee
Johnson, I played against her. McDonald's All‑American games, AAU tournaments,
things like that. Other than that, I haven't played their upperclassmen.
Chiney, it would have been nice to have a battle with her previously.  
I feel like our coaches do a really good job of scouting and helping us out
with the things we need to do. So tomorrow getting into practice, the
intensity we have to have is going to be great. I feel like practice tomorrow
will get me ready for it and I have to also mentally prepare and have a
mentality that, Okay, I'm not going to be stopped, I'm going to have to stop
the other opponent.  
I think the mentality is going to help, so that's that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Calder.  
  
Q. What was the new defensive plan?  
COACH CALDER: I'd rather keep that a little bit to ourselves personally. For
us to not have practiced it very much at all, Diamond and them did a
tremendous job adjusting. Brittany was also one of them. Latifah did the
adjustments we needed for our defense.  
It did help us with their post players down inside.  
  
Q. Was there a turning point during the season as far as a loss and how much
has Ivory contributed with the players?  
COACH CALDER: I think when we went to Duke and won at Duke. Diamond and
Allisha had tremendous games. I thought that was a tremendous turning point
for them to realize that we can beat anybody. We followed that up with a win
the very next week at NC State with seven thousand something people. Coach
Hatchell always gives them a great speech about playing on someone else's home
court.  
I think when we played and won at Duke, played and won at State, will have us
ready to play here at Stanford.  
Ivory has been tremendous. She knows all the tricks of the trade from the
WNBA. She had had a tremendous coach this past year. One of the best things
that Ivory brings is her competitive fire, her enthusiasm. Also I think she
made the most threes in the WNBA this year. She shot over 40% at Carolina. I
think she's helped us tremendously with our shooting.  
  
Q. When Diamond went down twice, slams into the bottom of the basket, were
you wondering, Why did I let her talk me into this?  
COACH CALDER: She's a competitor, like I said. No, I don't second guess that.
I don't second guess anything, any decisions I make during the game, because
if you do that, you'll beat yourself up all the time. I'm not interested in
beating myself up.  
We made a decision, me and the other staff members. I also talked to the
players. I'll communicate with Diamond. Where do you want the ball on the
floor? We do a lot of communicating.  
I'm not going to second guess myself in any of those situations. I knew
Diamond was a competitor and she'd continue to play and she'd be out there on
Tuesday.  
  
Q. You mentioned Brittany. Did you plan to put the ball in her hands at the
end of the game?  
COACH CALDER: That answer is a yes. We were up one. Her freshman year we were
up two at Maryland and she missed a one and one. They came back and tied it,
won it in overtime. Then we played Maryland in the ACC tournament and were up
one. I put her in the game. Brittany knocked down two free throws, we got up
three. We got the rebound, beat Maryland.  
So tonight the emphasis was to get the ball to Brittany at the end of the
game.  
  
Q. What is it about this system that allows young players to flourish so
quickly?  
COACH CALDER: Well, I think we don't try to tie them down as much when they
first get there. We want to play a style of play where you can play and read
and react without us saying going from PointA to PointB. We have some set
plays, don't get me wrong, that we do that. But we give them a reasonable
amount of freedom, give them the good shot rules, we and try to play out of
that. We want a fast break. We want to give them a certain amount of freedom
to read a certain screen, et cetera, to make plays. I think that freedom they
get helps them to continue to develop and they want to play at Carolina
because of that.  
This is about the program. I'm just following the blueprint from Coach
Hatchell from the beginning of the year. That's what I'm doing. It is the
program. She helped build that program. It's a tremendous program. I'm just
kind of following it along.  
  
Q. Will you give us your first thoughts on Stanford.  
COACH CALDER: Well, other than I need to watch 'em actually. I was so into
South Carolina. Obviously Coach VanDerveer, outstanding coach. Olympic gold
medal, won that. Won two national championships. They're very talented.  
We'll come up with a game plan. We'll put our heads together with Coach
Hatchell and come up with a game plan and go from there.  
I can answer more tomorrow about Stanford. I know‑‑ I can't pronounce her
name. I need to buy some vowels. Ogwumike is a tremendous player, as is
Samuelson, et cetera. Talented and well‑coached.  
  
Q. What's the challenge with playing defense against a triangle offense?  
COACH CALDER: Well, that's why Phil Jackson runs it. It keeps the floor
spread. It's a team offense. Everybody is touching the basketball. It has
post‑ups. It has down screens, double down screens for open threes. It has
also a backdoor offense in it. It's a complete combination. It's just a great
offense. It's a very, very good offense. I think it has everything in it that
you want so you can go against a team that pressures you, you can go against a
team that plays sagging man, and you also have a post player that can take
advantage of that. Again, I think that's why Phil Jackson runs it.  
  
Q. Why do you think you don't see more of it in the women's game or the
men's game, pros or college?  
COACH CALDER: Well, I think with the rules of driving and hand checking, et
cetera, I think if you're playing a lot of sagging man, and you see more of
that in women's college basketball especially, but men's college basketball a
certain amount, too, if you play sagging man, you got everything clogged up.
If everybody sagged inside to three, it has a tendency to clog it up. NBA, you
have illegal defensive rules. The floor stays spread all the time. If your
pressuring people, the floor is going to stay spread all the time. I think
it's a great offense for that. Coach VanDerveer does a tremendous job with it
really.  
  
Q. You played against Stanford with different players, but in Spokane you
did have that slugfest of a game. You've seen the triangle there. I'm
wondering if something that can help you as you get into this tonight and
tomorrow?  
COACH CALDER: Yes, I do. I believe it will. Latifah Coleman played in that
game. We have a player on our team that did play in that game. Hopefully that
will help us. We have a copy of that tape so we'll be watching it, see some of
the things that we were successful with.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very.  
COACH CALDER: Thank you.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  71  
Oregon State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the Oregon State Beavers. Coach Scott Rueck, Sydney
Wiese, and Deven Hunter. Coach, I'll let you open.  
COACH RUECK: All right. First off, what a great week. Pac‑12 did a phenomenal
job with this tournament. Seattle has treated us great. Then today, credit
USC. They played a great second half. They punched us in the face to start the
second half and gain momentum and it was hard to get it back.  
Proud of our team for weathering the storm and fighting like they did. But
they played a really good game today. So credit them and Coach Cooper.  
With our team, you know it's not a happy locker room. It's not a mad locker
room. It's, I don't know, heartfelt, sad kind of a sense of mourning a little
bit because this team has done everything right. When you stick yourself out
on a limb like that and you invest everything you have and you care about each
other and it doesn't go your way, it hurts.  
I've been part of groups that do that, and most of my teams do that, and I've
been part of some that don't invest everything and it doesn't hurt that much.
I couldn't be prouder of this team for the way they compete, take care of each
other, the way they represent Oregon State, the Pac‑12, basketball and the
west coast. These are champions in my book the way they carry themselves. This
is an incredible team that's learning and getting better every day and that's
not going to stop.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk specifically about the things in the second half that
changed? Their back court pressure, obviously, ramped up as you guys went.  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, the full court press was obviously the biggest difference.
I thought we came out soft to start the second half. For whatever reason, that
is something that's happened to us a few times this year, and they gained
momentum right away. They came to fight. I thought we did early and I thought
we did late, but we didn't during that stretch. I thought that was the key
stretch of the game. It allowed them and gave them confidence.  
We didn't respond really well on the offensive end to that, you know, which
gave them the opportunity to relax and then shots started falling for them.  
  
Q. Scott, Deven was mostly on Plouffe in that first game, locked her up. And
tonight had one of the best all ‑around performances of the tournament. Could
you attest to how important she was for you tonight?   
COACH RUECK: Deven's a warrior. She's in many ways our heart and soul. She and
Ali are household hustle players. They're chasing down balls, and now Jamie is
back. Those players are known for that. Deven has been as important to this
run and the improvement of this team as anybody. She's not necessarily the one
that's mentioned. You hear Ruth and you hear Syd, but she impacts the game in
so many ways. So it's the little things.  
You know, she had an incredible tournament, and she's got an incredible future
ahead.  
  
Q. You guys have had a good run, but you haven't been in this spot where
you're playing for a title before. Do you feel like that inexperience played
any role in how you guys reacted in the second half?  
COACH RUECK: Maybe. It's like anything. We hadn't played a team like Penn
State until we did, and Notre Dame until we did, and going to the Bay, that
was a first. So like anything, experience certainly helps you prepare for the
next time you go through it.  
So today, being in that situation, it may have. I thought we started the game
great though. I thought we played a great first half. It was just being on our
heels in that environment in the second half, we didn't shoot the ball like
we're capable. So maybe there was some, I don't know, hopefully we'll be in it
again to find out if we improve.  
  
Q. Jamie missed more than a month but got three games under her belt here.
How important was that heading into the postseason?  
COACH RUECK: It's vital. I'm so happy for her and so proud of her for
rehabbing the way that she did and kept herself ready, kept herself engaged.
She had an incredible‑‑ she was off six weeks, five or six, and she was a part
of things every day. So it was like she didn't miss a beat getting back out
there. So really proud of her. That obviously makes us a better team having
her out there and deeper. So I thought she played great basketball this
weekend.  
  
Q. You guys were down five late there with a minute and you decided not to
foul Jamie. I think one of the plays was Jamie attempted a three and missed
it. But what was the decision making there?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, two different thought processes. That was one of them. The
way they were shooting free throws, you know, that was just the gamble that we
took. Score and press and then foul was the thought process on that.  
  
Q. Obviously this is an emotional loss. But can you talk a little bit about
how you think the game went and what you guys take from it?  
SYDNEY WIESE: It's just another life lesson. We're going to learn from it and
we still have a lot of work to do. USC is a great team and they earned this
championship. It hurts and it's going to burn today. But we have to get back
to work tomorrow and finish the season strong.  
  
Q. Deven, can you talk a little about the pressure in the second half? You
were able to get some shots to kind of break those droughts that you all had.
Can you maybe talk about the change and playing against them in the second
half?  
DEVEN HUNTER: They brought the pressure. I thought we could have hung a little
better. But I credit them for their pressure and their denial and everything.
They worked hard for it and denied well.  
  
Q. To see that half court pressure from them, this was their fourth game in
four days. Were you surprised at all at the legs that they had to execute that
down the stretch?  
COACH RUECK: No, somebody asked me about that going into the Washington State
game and I didn't feel like‑‑ I mean, these are great athletes, you know. So,
USC, if you think of them, that's what you think of. You think they're elite
athletes at every position, and that was evident today. I remember when I was
20 I could run all day every day. So with the media timeouts and with all of
that, I didn't think fatigue would be an issue, and I didn't feel like it was.  
  
Q. If you think about takeaways in this game, your first half zone worked
pretty efficiently against them. Is that one of the positive keys you'll take
away from this game?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, it's worked for us the last month. We used it extensively
against them in Corvallis, and that was one way to slow down Cassie. There are
not many ways to do that. But it was effective in that game. It was effective
against UCLA as well, and we've used it in spots ever since. That's been a
signature of my team's first two years here. It's all we ran. So it was neat
to see this team execute at that high level again. It's most effective though
when you're scoring.  
Once we got in the drought, they were able to relax and found open looks
against it, then we ended up back to man, which I thought we executed well
down the stretch.  
  
Q. Between your conference finish and this run, do you sit pretty
comfortably for the next two weeks leading up to the selections and then what
will that mean for the program if you guys are able to get in for the first
time since '96?  
COACH RUECK: We were certainly hopeful of that. I'm not on that committee. I
think this team certainly deserves it. I don't know why we wouldn't be in the
tournament. I don't see that argument. I've looked, of course, and I think
this team has earned the right to play in it. But it's not up to me. But I
feel like we do deserve it. So until then we prepare, and it doesn't matter
who we're playing or where we're playing, we'll prepare to improve every day
like we have to get here.  
  
Q. Do you have any sense from USC's side of how much they're already very
quickly a reflection of Cynthia's style, her passion? I mean, you guys both
coaching at your Alma Maters and there is something that comes from that. Do
you feel you are picking that up from her?  
COACH RUECK: I think so. They played with a lot of pride in this tournament.
It takes time for any coach to put their stamp on a program. As this season
has progressed, we've all season that with her and with their team. They
played with passion and pride today, and I think our team did as well. It's
good to see with any program.  
  
Q. Even though it burns right now, do you have a perspective on what you've
done in such a short amount of time?  
DEVEN HUNTER: I think it's amazing being part of this experience, and with my
five freshmen, or four freshmen in this new freshman class with Ali and
Alyssa, I think it's amazing to be part of this and be part of a team that can
play in a championship game and go even farther throughout the rest of the
tournament. And we have so much to keep reaching for and we can do whatever we
put our minds to.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Cassie and what they were able to do inside?  
COACH RUECK: In this game? I don't know. What did she end up with? We made her
really work again for her points. 12 points on 15 shots, and Ruth is I think a
good match‑up for her, but she does have the ability to step out. When we
played them at SC, she hurt us from the perimeter. She was very comfortable
out there. At our place we zoned and doubled when we could to get the ball out
of her hands, obviously.  
Today we did that again, and it was effective. It was effective until they
changed momentum and made offense a little tougher for us, then they got
control.  
But she's such a great player. I can tell I can probably count on one hand how
many people I've doubled in my career in 18 years and she's one of them. So I
have ultimate respect for her as a basketball player and as a leader on her
team.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
COACH RUECK: Oh, yeah, they did a good job on Ruth. She and X, they did a
great job fronting and keeping Ruth off her spot. It was not easy to get Ruth
the basketball today. So they're good athletes. They're a good team.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  71  
Oregon State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome and congratulations to USC. We have Coach Cynthia
Cooper, Cassie Harberts, Kiki Alofaituli, and Ariya Crook. Coach, I'll let you
start.  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Congratulations to USC women's basketball team. We are
definitely dancing this year. I am very proud of these women. They have fought
and worked all year long. Not just three weeks ago everyone had counted us out
and we had very little chance of making it to the tournament. Well, we wanted
to do something about that and they did something about it today. They fought.
Even though we didn't play a great first half, we came out and showed what
Trojans do, and we fight on, and we did that in the second half. I'm proud of
them.  
  
Q. Talk about that second half, the change you made, back court pressure,
the full court pressure, and the difference you thought it made?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I thought the press was the difference in the game. I
thought we were slow and lethargic and really played Oregon State's pace in
the first half. I thought we mentally were trying to figure out if we had
enough energy to finish this thing out.  
In the second half, I decided on all makes, whether it be free throws or
otherwise, we were going to press. We were going to speed the game up. If
we're going to lose, we're going to lose with no stone unturned. These women
stepped up to the plate, and we rotated players. We kind of shortened the
rotation and just rotated about seven, eight players and kept them as fresh as
we could and kept the pressure on Oregon State.  
Before I continue, can I just say what a team that we played today. Oregon
State had a great game plan. I mean, they slowed us down. We played a very
tough opponent, so my congratulations go out to Oregon State.  
  
Q. Ariya, can you talk about the halftime and strategy and what that energy
was like in the locker room and how you translated that on to the court to
really get your team going?  
ARIYA CROOK: At halftime we just came together as a team. We knew that we were
playing their pace, and it was like they played us 2‑3 zone even when we were
at their place, and that was a good strategy that they had.  
So for us to play our game, like Coach said, we switched up our game plan, we
pressed. Once we pressed, that got us going. Our energy went sky high and we
just went on from there.  
  
Q. Kiki, where do legs come to do that when you're on your fourth game in
four days?  
KIKI ALOFAITULI: I want to thank one of my seniors, Desiree Bradley. She took
me aside and said you really have to get your stuff together right now. The
team needs your energy, and she gave me that motivation?  
  
Q. Cynthia, kind of adding on to that, playing your fourth game in four
days, how impressed were you with the mental response in that second half in
the fourth game?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Yeah, I was extremely impressed. But I yell at these girls
every day. We work out every day, and I know what they're capable of. So it
was my job to spark them, to get them going. I know they were looking at me
crazy like, Coach is crazy. We're going to press win all the time?  
Yeah, yeah, because we're going to earn this victory. We talked about earning
this championship, and they responded. They stepped up to the plate. They
responded against Stanford. They responded against ASU. They responded against
Arizona. There was no doubt in my mind that they had it in them. It was just
up to our coaching staff to pull it out of them.  
Along with what Kiki just said, I want to give a shout out to my coaching
staff. They just do a tremendous job. Brandy Manning, Evan Unrau, and Jualeah
Woods. I could go through my entire staff with Becky and Jessika and Matt and
Essie, we just really came together. Kelly Dormandy is our strength and
conditioning coach, and she just kept them loose and stretched and, I mean,
you talk about a team effort. Our trainer, Rachel, they must have done five
ice whirlpools from the hotel bathtubs to getting in the ice whirlpool here.
We just tried to do everything possible to be prepared for this game and be
able to give a hundred percent.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the play that you all had on Ruth and just taking
her out of the game and also (No microphone).  
CASSIE HARBERTS: We had previously played Chiney Ogwumike the day before, and
we wanted the same game plan, be really physical from the get go, push her out
of the paint, and make her back to the basket and move, because once they get
a steal they're good at turning and finishing. So we had to box her out. We
just really wanted to be physical and get her out of the paint.  
  
Q. Cassie, I noticed with about four minutes to go you were squatting down
and talking to the other players going into the game. I could see your eyes
were wide. I couldn't hear what you were saying. But what type of message were
you trying to convey there?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Pretty much we needed to finish out this game and keep our
focus. We needed to keep attacking them. We couldn't let them come back with
free throws and rebounds. So we needed to keep our focus going and the game
was ours.  
  
Q. Coach, half-jokingly talked about how you guys reacted when she said
fourth game, four days and you guys are going to full court press second half.
What was your reaction? Were you surprised you had that much energy?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I was actually excited. Whenever we press I think it just
ramps up our energy, our defense is so much better, and that translates to our
offense. I was glad we started doing it, and you could tell the difference it
had in the game.  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: That's only because she was in the back.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Sure was. I'm so proud of these girls.  
  
Q. If I could ask the two of you the same question. Were you surprised you
were able to amp up the energy that much, fourth game, four days?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I'm not going to say surprised. We have all the energy in the
world off the court, on the court. It doesn't matter. We play six games six
days, if Coach told us we've got to do X, Y, Z, we've got to do X, Y, Z. So we
came together to do what we had to do to get the W.  
  
Q. Cassie and Cynthia, Cassie, I've heard a lot of stories in the seven last
or eight years about USC basketball, and most of them end with coming up short
or injuries or whatever the story has been for this program. Do you feel like
today you changed the story?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: I do. I feel like I've been through injuries. Saying we're
going to the tournament, but we're coming up short for the past two years. I
felt a difference in this team that we wanted it, and we were going to do
whatever we had to do to get it. I'm so proud of them. That was the first
Pac‑12 championship in our program's history, so I'm just glad to be a part of
it.  
  
Q. Your alma mater the last nine or ten years have been rough on this
program. There's been a lot of almosts or maybe not quite good enough. So here
you are.  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: When I first landed on campus, my No. 1 goal, I love this
university and this basketball program and I love these players. The one thing
I wanted was my No. 1 goal was to not allow these women to underachieve. I
said that right from the beginning. I'm not going to allow you to
underachieve. The other thing is when Cassie and I went to Pac‑12 media, there
was a lot of talk about us being soft. You didn't see a soft team out there
today.  
You didn't see a soft team out here all tournament long, because we worked on
our toughness. We worked on coming together as a unit. So I'm really proud to
be the head coach of such wonderful, great students, wonderful athletes,
talented athletes, and women on a mission. That is what I wanted to bring. I
wanted to bring that passion back to USC. The drive back to women's basketball
that, listen, we earned this championship, but in doing that, we earned
respect.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your initial strategy for defending Wiese, and how did
that evolve as the game went along?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: My initial strategy was to go over the top. But when I saw
my guards continuing to underneath and her firing up three pointers‑‑ no, I'm
just kidding. Wiese is such a difficult guard to defend, because she has so
many tools. She has size, she's left‑handed, and she can go either direction.
So what we tried to do with the post players, we tried to hedge and get her
going further out and create space. That hopefully will create space for our
guards to get over the top and get in position to stop her penetration.  
But she was awesome today. She made it tough on us. I thought when we sped up
the game, I thought that got her out of a rhythm, and that's what we needed to
do in order to keep her from taking over the game in the second half.  
  
Q. For the players, it's one thing to have a game plan, but you have to
execute it. How much does Coach Cooper's enthusiasm and energy, does it bring
you up a level out there?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Yes, I definitely think it does. When she started telling us
that we were going to press them, I mean, we got amped just feeding off her
energy. So I would say yes.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We feed off her energy during practice, off the court, on the
bus, at the airport, everywhere. I mean, I'm speechless because I mean Coach
believes in us so much and her energy translates into us and she just wants
the best for us. For her to start the energy, start the tone are us it's huge.
That's why we're in this position right now is because of her. Big ups to
Coach Cooper.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Yeah, I don't know what else I can say. Like the girls
already said, she's the Energizer bunny. There is not one day. 6 a.m. practice
every day, she walks in the gym singing, dancing.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Doing cartwheels.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Well, her foot. But anyways‑‑  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Just throw me under the bus.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: You threw me under the bus (laughing). No, but she's been
great this whole year. Like Kiki said, we feed off her energy on and off the
courts. So we're thankful for a coach that bleeds Cardinal gold and really
wants to see us succeed.  
  
Q. If you were on the bubble or under the radar you're not anymore. So how
does that feel going into the NCAA Tournament where people are going to know
about you now?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: You know what, I'll pass that question on to the players,
because I want to know how they feel to know, for sure there is no doubt that
we're going through the tournament. We don't have to wait. We know that we've
solidified a ticket to dance in March. I'm proud. So I will pass that question
to them. How does it feel?  
KIKI ALOFAITULI: It feels good. Because since day one since Coach walked into
campus, we found out she was our Coach, since day one she had been saying like
forget about the history and what happens when she played. We just have to
bring our own identity. So we haven't accomplished that since before Cassie
was on the team. So, yeah.  
ARIYA CROOK: It's an amazing feeling knowing that all of our off‑season hard
work really paid off. Kelly Dormandy had us outside running the whole
Coliseum, which was so difficult. 5 a.m. mile times. It's an amazing feeling
knowing that all of that hard work really paid off.  
CASSIE HARBERTS: I think coming from my point of view as a senior, I've sat in
our locker room for the past three years and watched our name not be called,
whether we thought it was going to be called or whether it wasn't. This time
we can sit and be proud of what we've accomplished, and we've rightfully
earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Having rattled off four wins in the last four days, and these last two
days the way you've ended against two of the best teams in the conference, how
confident are you going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: We don't know who we're going to play, but we're confident
no matter who we play. We feel like we're willing to put in the work
regardless of who the opponent is. We're going to fight on and give our best.
And we're going to represent the Pac‑12 conference in a very positive way. So
we're ready. We're ready as everyone has said. They've worked really hard to
be here, so I want them to really enjoy this moment. Enjoy this moment, and
tomorrow is time for business. I've spoken to Kelly, our strength and
conditioning coach, and she has a workout program for them. Hey, y'all
probably didn't know that, did you? Anyway. Yeah, we're going to be confident
going into the tournament and give it a hundred percent like we did in this
tournament.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  71  
Stanford  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the Stanford Cardinal and Coach Tara VanDerveer,
Chiney Ogwumike, and Lili Thompson. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH VANDERVEER: First off, congratulations to USC. I thought they played
very well. They have‑‑ they really have an excellent team. I thought they had
some people really step up big for them. Vaioletama I thought played a great
game, Crook in the beginning of the game especially. But their big three were
all in double figures.  
Chiney battled in there. She was a warrior for us. This is something I think
Amber and Lili both made some big plays for us. But we did not shoot the ball
well. I thought we worked hard on defense, but offensively we really
struggled, and that is something that I think we have two weeks to work on it,
and that is our plan. This can be something hopefully that we'll get our
collective team's attention, and we'll work harder and be ready to go in two
weeks.  
  
Q. Why did you struggle offensively, do you think?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that sometimes it's almost like your strength
is your weakness. We go inside to Chiney, and she delivered for us so well.
But we have to have other people stepping up, or just being offensive
contributors. I think that was good for‑‑ we did not shoot the ball well. We
were not moving the ball well. This has been something that I think really
within the last, I'm going to say the last maybe month or so, we've been
stagnant offensively and we need to really fix that.  
  
Q. Chiney, this is unfamiliar territory for you. Can you talk about what
you're thinking and what you're feeling right now?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think we played hard, but Coach told us before the game
that playing hard sometimes is not enough. You have to execute. I think we
didn't execute as well as we could have. But I'm proud of my teammates for
sticking with things and still being aggressive. I think they played a
really‑‑ they hit shots, timely shots. That's always tough. We'll learn from
that defensively. Offensively we'll just fine tune things.  
It's unfortunate to not win a Pac‑12 tournament championship, but these are
all learning points going forward.  
  
Q. Chiney, you had gone on a scoring run there from about the 12 ‑minute
mark to the 7‑minute mark and you're held scoreless the rest of the way. What
did you feel changed from USC's defense that last seven minutes?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I didn't feel a change, honestly. It was just I don't know. I
missed a couple shots. I was still being aggressive. I honestly don't think
that there was a change. We just need to finish better.  
  
Q. You guys will be in the tournament. What are you looking for to improve
on at this point? Kind of a tough loss tonight, but you guys still have a lot
to look forward to here.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I was proud of our defensive effort, but I think
offensively we need to execute better and play with a sense of urgency. I
think we played hard, but we need to take that to another level.  
  
Q. Tara, there is going to be conversation now about No. 1 seeds and lots of
things have happened across the country this weekend. Do you have any thoughts
about how much it matters for your team to go in as a No. 1 seed?  
COACH VANDERVEER: The most important thing for me at this time of the season
is to be healthy. So losing a game is not the worst thing. If something
happened to one of your key players, that is the worst thing. We're just going
to‑‑ we're not going to worry about seeding. We're going to worry about
getting our team really running offense much better, working harder
defensively, having people understand what shots we want them to take. Just
pick it up from here. I like the fact that we have two weeks before the NCAA
comes out. We can do a lot of work in two weeks and improve a lot in two
weeks. That is what we've got to do.  
  
Q. The Pac ‑12 said that there was a problem with a leakage from the roof
here and there was moisture on the floor. Was that any kind of a factor in
this game?   
COACH VANDERVEER: No, they were right on top of it. That was not an issue at
all. They had someone right there that was wiping it up. One time it hit me
during a timeout. That is the only time I noticed it.  
  
Q. Was it coming down near you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No, it was coming down right where our huddle was. Right
where I was standing where our huddle was.  
  
Q. What happened to Bonnie?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Bonnie got undercut, and her feet were totally out from
under her and she came down flat on her back. I think it scared her a lot. To
her credit, they checked her out and she was able to come back in the game. I
mean, I thought it was a very physical game.  
  
Q. Lili, can you talk about the last ten minutes of the game just in terms
of you guys are down by ten. You come back, you cut it. You get ahead. I mean,
just kind of the back and forth? Did you feel you were in a position pretty
much that whole time to win this game again?  
LILI THOMPSON: Yeah, I think I felt that we were in a position to win it. I
think everybody just fought back. We were down by ten, and we stayed positive
and we fought back. There were a few plays there toward the end that had gone
our way. We were up by three. If they had gone our way, we'd be up by five or
six.  
So there were some key possessions in there that we didn't get that we
probably could have changed the outcome.  
  
Q. Coming out of your first Pac ‑12 tournament and heading into the NCAA
Tournament for the first time, what are you going to take away from this since
you were such a key role player at the end of the game with knocking down
shots? I mean, didn't come up with the win, but it must say something about
your role and significance to this team?   
LILI THOMPSON: I think I have a lot of support from my teammates and from the
coaching staff. I know they'll get us prepared for the NCAA Tournament.
Hopefully this loss will help us turn around and let us go far in the big
dance.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Oregon State  70  
Washington State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome and congratulations to the Oregon State Beavers. Coach
Scott Rueck, Ali Gibson, and Ruth Hamblin. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH RUECK: A great win for us tonight, obviously. Excited about where we're
at, excited what these student‑athletes have accomplished and what our program
has accomplished in such a short time. I think that is the perspective we have
to reflect on a little bit to know what we'll be playing for tomorrow and what
we've accomplished to this point.  
Heck of a game tonight. Washington State is such an explosive offensive
scoring team. I thought we did a great job defending them, and we saw who they
were down the stretch. They didn't quit. They kept battling. That is the
reason they are where they are, and that's they're doing a great job. June is
doing a great job. Excited to get the W and looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. What do you hope folks will make of this Pac ‑12 tournament with the
final set‑up the way it is, and you're the only top 5 seeds left in the field?
  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, it's interesting. The teams last Monday when we saw the
seeding, the teams that you would expect to be facing on every account are not
the ones that are there. It shares or it shows the parity in our conference.
There are a lot of great coaches and a lot of talent. Congrats to USC. That is
a big W tonight for them, obviously.  
But anything can happen. That commercial that we run. Anything can happen in
this conference. That is how tough it is. You can't relax, and that's been
evident in the tournament so far.  
  
Q. You pride yourself on defensive intensity. And you said one of the
markers of a great program and what you're seeing from this team is the way
they've approached the scout and they relish shutting down opponents. Is this
another step in the long road that you've seen them take?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, this has been indicative of all three of our games. This is
a team that puts up a ton of points. You've all watched that this week. But
we've been able to hold them down in all three games. Tonight certainly they
made their run at the second half and did a great job there, where I thought
they got loose.  
But when the game was really in doubt, we locked them up, forced them to
weakness, and made them miss shots. I think I read something that said Utah
missed a bunch of wide open shots last night. That's a lie. That's not true.
We made them take tough shots they don't normally want to take. There is a
reason they missed shots. There is a reason our field goal defense is 1/1000th
point behind Stanford's for second in our conference. There is a reason these
guys sell out every day. They're committed to it, and having the nation's top
shot blocker or whatever Ruth is, she's close to that, the best in the
Pac‑12\. I know that. Having her back there certainly doesn't hurt that.  
  
Q. You guys came in and already projected to be an NCAA Tournament team. Now
you're playing for a chance at the automatic berth. Do you still feel that
you're trying to prove something?  
COACH RUECK: I think that we're going to have to continue to do that for a
while. We're not a household name in our sport yet. That's what we're all here
to do. That's why I came back to my alma mater. That's why each of the players
on our team chose Oregon State to turn it into that. That is the story of our
team.  
So if anybody looks at the numbers for what this team has accomplished, I
think that speaks for itself. But we're excited to be playing in a venue
tomorrow where more people will get to see us. We're so blessed to have the
network that we have. I think national exposure is at an all‑time high, so I
think that's changing quickly.  
ALI GIBSON: I feel like we're always trying to prove something. We're trying
to prove that we're better each game, and I think you can tell that through
each game that we play. This is my first tournament win, and I think that
we're on a roll, and hopefully we can get to the NCAA Tournament. But of
course, you have to prove something each day.  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I agree. We're proving it to ourselves and to everyone what
we're capable of. We're selling out on the floor every night, and that's
showing in our record.  
  
Q. Playing as well as you are, are you a little disappointed you don't get a
shot at Stanford?  
COACH RUECK: You picture them in the final. They've never not been in one. I
learned that today. So that's kind of what you expect. But, no, we're happy to
be playing anybody in that game. So USC is a team that beat us and then we
beat them. We had two great games against each other, so we're looking forward
to the third. It's going to be a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ruth, and Scott if you want to comment after. Ali is one of two
upperclassmen on this team and often credited for being a spark plug both on
and off the court as a leader. Can you attribute what she does exactly that is
so special?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, Ali brings energy every day. You know what you're going to
get. It's little things like hustle plays, getting on the floor, grabbing dead
balls, she's so good at this. It inspires us all to get going. She's a good
energy provider in that way. She cares about all of us and has our backs, so
that helps in a lot of ways.  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, Ali, when we recruited her, she was described to us as the
greatest teammate and leader that had ever played in one of the best programs
on the west coast in high school girls basketball and her AAU program. And at
that point, that was our first year. We were like that's exactly who we need
to build this program around. She was our only freshman we were able to
recruit that first year. We were hired so late. Ali has provided that. She's a
big‑time winner. She's used to winning everything she does, that's all she's
done. So you saw that tonight. When we needed a hustle play, she provided it.
When we needed a three to go down, she provided it. And I think maybe four in
the second half, something like that.  
So she's glue, and she brings energy every minute, and we all count on that,
including the coaches.  
  
Q. Did your parents make it down?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: They did. They made it down for the tournament.  
  
Q. How long did it take them?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's a 16‑hour drive.  
  
Q. They did drive?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: They drove.  
  
Q. Have you talked to them since the game ended?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: No, we're locked in our locker room so far (laughing).  
  
Q. Ruth, you said you're still trying to prove to yourself that you guys
still belong at this level, and proving to yourself in every game. People hit
big shots today. You guys just looked like this is what we're supposed to do.
Have you believed for a while that you guys belong at this level?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, I think the belief is definitely starting to become a
reality for us. We know what we're going to bring every night in the game and
everyone's going to come mentally prepared. It's definitely that standard that
our team has built and it's now a foundation for our program. That is
definitely something that comes with every night.  
  
Q. You guys expect a real defensive struggle with USC tomorrow? What are you
looking forward to in that game?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, that was what our last game was. They've defended us very
well both games that we've played against them. We defended them well the
second game that we played.  
So that's what I would anticipate; it's going to be not easy to find shots.
It's going to come down to great offensive execution. I'm anticipating both
teams dialed in on the defensive end, no question.

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

### [Cassie Harberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24821)

### [Alexyz Vaioletama](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26568)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  71  
Stanford  68

  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I'm very proud of my team. All season long even through the
ups and downs and the bumps in the road, they fought, and they persevered.
Through 40‑minute games and tired muscles, and tired minds, and tired of
coach, they still worked hard and they deserve this win tonight. I'm really
proud of how they rebounded, how we battled, and how we finished this game.
That's really all I have and good night. No, I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. Cassie, how does it feel right now?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: I don't know if you guys saw, but I was an emotional wreck
out there. I'm just so proud of my team. I've been working towards this for
four years, and I've just never seen a team that's given so much heart and
never gave up. Even when they made a run, we knew we were going to come back
and win the game.  
  
Q. There was a point in 1:20 where you scored ten points. As a senior and
not beating Stanford in your career, does that take on an added importance for
you?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: I wasn't having a great game, and I've kind of been
struggling lately. But without my team I wouldn't have even been in that
situation. They kept believing in me, and I just did what is in my nature. I
just kept working hard and waiting for something to happen and it did.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your team's defense on Chiney? She had
30, but you made it obviously tough for her and made it tough for their whole
team. Could you talk a little bit about your defense?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, we talked about, especially at the beginning of the
game and really during shootarounds, we talked about being physical with
Ogwumike and really all of their post players before they receive the ball.
Not allowing them to get deep position, and then making them make offensive
moves as opposed to grabbing that ball, turn around and away they go. And I
thought Alexyz did a fantastic job. So Ogwumike had 30 and 21, and I guarantee
you, she hasn't worked that hard all year long to get those numbers.  
She's just a phenomenal player. You can't shut her down, but you can make her
life tough. I just thought Alexyz gave that for 40 minutes tonight. For every
rebound Ogwumike got tonight, I just thought X responded either with a
three‑point shot, going to the basket, a great rebound. I mean, she ended up
with 19 and 15, and this is what we expect out of her day‑in and day‑out.  
But this is a heck of a time for her to actually give it to us. You know, it
was just tough. We wanted to be physical with Ogwumike. We wanted to get her
off of her sweet spot on that block and make her into a player that had to
wheel and deal and make offensive moves to the basket. I thought we did a
pretty good job. When we went to our zone in the first half, we started double
teaming her with the middle of the zone and the back of it. But we were
leaving three‑point shooters open, so we kind of got out of that quickly.  
  
Q. Cassie, as you said, you weren't having a great game, three points in the
first half. We talked yesterday about Kate Oliver being the X ‑factor. Today,
X, the X‑factor. What's it mean to you to have that kind of support from your
team?   
CASSIE HARBERTS: Just seeing how much my team has grown over the course of the
season. X had a phenomenal game. Who knows who could be it tomorrow night. But
we just relied on a lot of people, and a lot of people stepped up tonight even
when I wasn't doing well.  
  
Q. Now you have a winning record again against Tara VanDerveer. Can you
remember your senior season playing against Stanford?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: That was a long time ago. I don't remember my senior
season. What I do remember is the look on my players' face, on each one of my
players' faces as they took on the challenge of playing the number four team
in the country in a power house like Stanford tonight. I remember the fire in
their eyes that they wanted to achieve something that they hadn't done before,
and they put forth that effort, that drive and that passion to achieve that
goal.  
Every rebound, even if we made a mistake, they were up off the bench, cheering
each other on and picking each other back up and fighting to the very end.
That is the only way as a team that you can beat an awesome team like
Stanford, and we were a team tonight.  
  
Q. Alexyz, you guys are one win away from guaranteeing your spot in the NCAA
Tournament. So as big as this is, as huge as this is, you have to switch gears
quickly and win a game tomorrow night. How do you do that with a team being so
high today and having to turn around and get ready to play tomorrow?  
ALEXYZ VAIOLETAMA: Right now we're seizing the moment, but we know when we get
back we have to focus on what's coming up next. But I think that we have to
come together as a team and refocus and really focus on what's ahead of us as
well.  
  
Q. Cynthia, sorry to cut into your celebration of this great victory. But
since we're not going to get to talk to you after this coming game, could you
just tell us how you feel your team matches up with Washington State and
Oregon State?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, we've played Washington State at home and we didn't
play extremely well. We'd probably like to have that game back. So I think we
match up well. We match up well with both teams. Oregon State, we won at our
place, we split with them. We lost at their place. Once again, not necessarily
playing our best basketball, but they're two great teams. They get up for
games and they'll be ready to play whichever team we play.  
Right now, we really want to enjoy this for this moment and make a distinct
line when it's time to quit celebrating and start focusing on the next
opponent. We'll watch a little bit of this game right now and then we'll shift
gears into preparing our legs, our minds, our bodies for tomorrow.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit about this last night, but what do you hope that
the people who are paying attention make of this tournament with three of the
top 5 seeds at home now?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, I hope that‑‑ I'm not really sure what you're asking,
but I'll try to answer. I hope the NCAA and all watching understand that the
Pac‑12 is a powerful conference, and every game‑‑ there is such parity in the
conference, and every game is a battle. We just beat a very good Stanford
team, and it just demonstrates our growth. It doesn't demonstrate a weakness
in Stanford. And the strength of our conference, it demonstrates the strength
of the Pac‑12\. So for me personally, I hope they say USC is in the
tournament, regardless of what happens tomorrow, but we're going to try to
take care of business tomorrow and just take it one game, one step at a time.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Oregon State  50  
Utah  35

  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Welcome Oregon State coach Scott Rueck, Sydney
Wiese, Ruth Hamblin. Coach, an opening remark and then we'll take questions.  
COACH RUECK: Okay. Just really proud of our effort tonight. I thought the team
was just really gritty. Utah is such a good team, and they play a style that's
not easy to play against, and certainly not comfortable. They make you really
grind it out, and that's what we did tonight.  
So love the hustle plays. I thought the hustle plays this team made, the extra
effort plays were the key to this game. There was opportunity for Utah to gain
momentum in the second half, and it seemed every time they did we'd come up
with a loose ball or an extra effort play, and I thought those were key to
this team. So W tonight, and certainly really proud of the team for what they
accomplished.  
  
Q. Coach, you've said that one of your challenges to players is to make me
play you. Coming off the bench in the second half, Kolbie had some pretty good
minutes. What did you think about her performance tonight?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, she did. Sam is a very gifted basketball player. In the
first half we chose to go small and used Gabby in the four position to back up
Deven. Second half we went with Sam at the four and five, and she gave us
phenomenal minutes. Both offensively and defensively, she hit the big turn
around. That was a momentum‑type shot for us. I thought that was a big one. I
thought she did a great job on Plouffe and slowed her down during her minutes.
So that is one of the nice things about this team. We've got a lot of places
to go, and everybody's producing right now.  
  
Q. How much credit do you take for the low ‑score that Utah produced
tonight?   
COACH RUECK: Well, that's what we've been doing. We've been holding teams
down. Field goal percentage, defense is one of my favorite stats, well, it is
my favorite, I'll be honest. I think they shot 14% in the first half. I
thought we had an edge. I thought we beat them in the spots. I loved our edge
and intensity in the first half. We were a little soft in the second half and
I didn't love it that we fouled a few more times. But that's what this team
does, when you have Ruth Hamblin behind your front line and then the four
players in front of her competing like they do to stay in front of the ball.
We challenged every shot, and that allowed us to control the boards as well.  
  
Q. On Hamblin, Plouffe coming off 30 points on 46% shooting last night. Does
having Hamblin as almost a safety valve allow whoever was guarding Plouffe to
be more aggressive on the perimeter denying her? Whether she's on the
perimeter or going in the post?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, whether it's on Plouffe or anyone. It allowed us to get up
into them a little bit, take three‑point shooters away. But I thought Ruth was
really key, first half anyway, challenging Plouffe. Anytime she put it on the
floor, Ruth was there and she felt her presence.  
Deven did a phenomenal job first half, so did Gabby. I thought we did a pretty
good job throughout the game with a few exceptions. But having Ruth slide over
in a help position, I know Michelle felt that and that changed her shot. Might
have made her think for a second. Take some aggressiveness away from her.  
The thing that Ruth is doing such a great job of is helping and recovering,
and that's progress for Ruth. Getting back, because Potter is a nice shooter
from 15 to 17 feet. So Ruth was able to do both of those today, which was
great for us.  
  
Q. Sydney, you guys have won 10 in a row now. I think that is the first in
school history or first time in a long time. It started without your best pure
scorer. Are you guys aware of what you're doing or at this point are you not
even thinking about it? Do you understand what a big deal this is especially
with so many young players?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think we're just trying to remain focused on our ultimate goal
which is the NCAA Tournament. Obviously, you have to win games to get there.
The past ten games have been a lot of fun, especially getting the wins, and
hopefully we can continue to get a lot more wins, especially having Jamie on
the floor again. She brings so much energy and we're just happy to have her
back. We have a big one tomorrow and we'll prepare and work for another W.  
  
Q. Coach, three straight games under 50 points now. Do you feel like this is
maybe perhaps the best defense that your team has been playing all season?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, I feel like it's progressively getting better. I think for
those of you that have been watching us all year, you can watch improvement
from one day to the next with this group. That is partially our youth, but
it's also just them wanting to compete and just come together and embrace that
end of the floor. They're finding‑‑ we've talked about it, they're finding joy
in defense, which makes me happy because that's the end of the floor I love.
This team is competing so well. I think our length really adds to that.
They're dominating the boards.  
I don't know what our streak is for not rebounding. It's like 17 games where
we haven't been outrebounded. So they're just competing so well at that end,
and that's obviously been a key to this run.  
  
Q. Scott, you said Sydney is light years ahead of where a freshman could or
should be. Ruth is light years ahead of where she was last season. How
rewarding has it been to see them playing this well this late in the season
when you need them the most?  
COACH RUECK: It makes me happy. I love it for them. These are life lessons.
You work hard to get rewarded. You do things right, and you guys come in every
day and they progress. It's just so fun to watch them and learn to love this
game at a level they never thought they could and then, gain confidence in
their own abilities. They're figuring out, man, if I focus and work like this
and concentrate, I can do anything. That's what they're learning. Ruth in
particular has been a joy for me to watch. I love coaching both. Coach Ely and
I, we team up on that. To watch her develop from a player a year ago who is
unsure, just learning the game really, to this year, doubting her abilities.
Knowing that she could hang and play, but not knowing how good she could be to
now figuring out I can impact every possession in a big way on both ends of
the floor, and really help my team, which is her ultimate goal. She's as team
player as it comes. She's about everybody but Ruth. It's just a joy to watch,
I think, for everybody.

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  69  
Colorado  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, and congratulations to Stanford. We have Coach Tara
VanDerveer, Lili Thompson, and Chiney Ogwumike. Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought Colorado came out and they were very aggressive.
Brittany Wilson hit some big shots for them; and they made a decision, I
think, to really double Chiney, and it took us a while to kind of really get
ourselves going. Credit to Colorado.  
But then in the second half I thought we struggled in the first half. We
missed open shots, but we made those shots in the second half. I thought
Bonnie hit some big shots, Chiney made her three, Lili hit her three. Just
getting out and getting some more energy. I thought Alex Green did a great job
first coming off the bench. I thought Karlie helped us coming off the bench,
and I thought Mikaela Ruef had a really good game.  
  
Q. In the games in the last few weeks you've gotten off to a slow start or
had somebody that's played with you into the second half. Is there a common
denominator in those games?  
COACH VANDERVEER: At this point with your conference teams, they've scouted
you. They've played against you for three or four years twice a year. So I
think that this is the best preparation for the NCAA Tournament. They're going
to make you do things that maybe aren't comfortable. They put you out of your
comfort zone a little bit. I think that Colorado did that a little bit to us.  
But, again, I think credit, Lili's poise. We did a better job in the second
half with our free throws. First half we were bricking free throws too. We hit
some shots in the second half. It's hard when you're not making shots, you're
not making free throws. One thing that we did pretty well, we took care of the
ball pretty well. To have 12 turnovers against an aggressive defense is a good
thing for us. Again, I thought Mikaela's play was really, really important for
us to do well in. Obviously, we count so much on Chiney, and she was missing
some shots that she ordinarily makes. We're used to the gym now, and we did a
much better job in the second half.  
  
Q. Chiney, in the first half, five points, what were they doing to stop you?
What was that like for the whole team, basically, in the first half? It looked
like you folks hadn't woken up yet or something. But obviously it was their
defense that did it.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I think it was the physicality. I mean, it was
unconventional physicality. It was different. I think they sagged off a few
players, they always had that person sagging off helping. I think throughout
the year we've had a good balance inside and outside game. So when they
doubled, we had people hitting shots. It just took us a while to hit our
shots.  
But at the end of the day, I think our perseverance showed. I'm really proud
of my team, because Lili had a big plays. Bonnie was diving on the floor. Alex
gave us quality minutes. So if teams are going to play that way, I think we
now understand that a little bit better. We're going to get everyone's A game
and get an unconventional A game to make us shake it up a little bit. So as
long as we just weather the storm, I'm really confident for my team.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that three ‑pointer? Was that designed or did you
find yourself wide open? How much fun was that?   
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It was absolutely not designed. But Coach Tara always tells
me, throughout the years she's said, Chiney don't let your shot be an after
shot. I love being close to the basket that I force things up close to the
basket a lot. So it's sort of like YOLO a little bit. It's the end of the
year, you only live once, if you don't know what that is. It's the end of the
year, and we shoot a lot. Coach has so much confidence in me, and she said,
Chiney, just shoot in rhythm. I'm like, all right. It's tough inside, I'm
going to just take this with me outside, and I felt confident. It was fun. I
mean, if they're going to take away the inside, I have to diversify my game.
It just felt good. I was a little hyped afterwards.  
  
Q. Lili, can you talk about that stretch early in the second half when you
folks made that big run and you made that off balance shot from the baseline,
everything seemed to be working for you. You didn't seem at all nervous in
your first Pac ‑12 tournament. What was it like for you during that particular
stretch?   
LILI THOMPSON: I think we kind of‑‑ it started in the timeout with everyone
kind of getting their energy going. I was feeding off of my teammates starting
on the defensive end, trying to get some things to go our way. I could just
see it in my teammates eyes that we just needed one little spark just to get
going.  
I just wanted to come down because I found myself in a position where I could
score. It kind of just got everybody hyped up and everybody going. It really
allowed us to pull away there. It was fun. It was good.  
  
Q. Tara, do you know what YOLO means?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I do not.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: That's why I gave the definition, you know? She has so many
Taraisms. I'll say that's a Chiney Ogwumikeism.

### [Kelsey Moos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26527)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  59  
ASU  57

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the Arizona State Sun Devils, Coach Charli Turner
Thorne, Deja Mann and Kelsey Moos. Coach, I'll have you open with remarks and
then we'll take questions.  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I mean, heartbreaking game for us. Give SC credit.
They hit two contested threes down the stretch, which was pretty clutch
shooting for them, and we had a couple of threes go in and out.  
So we didn't want to be in that situation. We wanted to play better
basketball. We needed to take better care of the ball. We needed to do a lot
of things better. But definitely, it's March. I thought both teams really
battled. It was a great game. Hopefully our resume speaks for itself in terms
of postseason play, and we can have a little time now to get healthy, which
will really help us.  
  
Q. You said on the call this week that you wanted to get back to doing the
things that you had been doing. To what degree did you guys do that?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I still didn't think we were as poised as we should
have been. I thought some players did a great job staying with things and
stuff. Actually, a number of them. We haven't played a possession or zone all
conference, and we brought that out because we just gave up so many points in
the paint last time we played this team, and I thought it was working really
well. Just we didn't create as much offense off our defense, which we rely on
to score our transition game.  
So we got back to some things, I would say, but not completely. Not where we
need to be in March. You can get away with some of the stuff in January and
February, but March you have to be a little more consistent in everything that
you do.  
The turnovers really hurt us today, for sure, and making your free throws,
just little things that added up for us that we've done through most of the
season.  
  
Q. Charli, you mentioned, do you worry about your NCAA resume at this point,
or do you feel it's strong enough you should be in no matter what?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: It's out of my hands, but I think it's strong enough.
Every time somebody beats us they seem to think it's going to help them get
in. So I think we've had a tremendous season. We've beaten a lot of top teams
or a number of top teams. We've had a very tough back‑end schedule. Five out
of seven on the road, and we're dealing with some unhealthy players.  
But all in all, yeah, I do think we're an NCAA Tournament. We've earned it.
They tell you to go out and play teams in the preseason, and you've got to
win, and we did. And we beat almost every team in our conference minus
Stanford. So I think we did a lot of things. I think everybody sees through
the back end of the conference, and the conference tournament, and probably
preaching to the choir here, but the Pac‑12 is a good conference. Everything
that you see happening all over the country, everybody is beating everybody.
That's BCS basketball.  
I think the committee gets that, and it really goes back to your full body of
work. And I think ours is very strong. I do think that we should be in the
tournament. I'm probably not totally objective, but I've been doing this for
27 years and I've had teams with lesser resumes get in, so I think overall we
have done enough.  
  
Q. Deja, will you talk a little about momentum and whether or not you feel
like you guys have some given what's happened over the last couple of weeks?  
DEJA MANN: Momentum, if you just look at the record, we don't really have it.
That's something that we have to go back and practice, get confident, get back
to work and build up on our own.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what was your mindset there in the second half? You seemed to be
a key in the comeback. What were you trying to do to get your team back in the
game?  
KELSEY MOOS: I think in the second half we just needed to come out really
strong and have a really solid second half. We had let‑ups in the first half.
The score was tied at halftime, so we had to come out, and we just had to take
the game. Like it came down in the end they hit a couple good shots. We just
needed to get shots and hit shots ourselves.  
  
Q. Coach, you went to the full ‑court press at the end during a timeout. Did
you think about going to that any sooner? It seemed to cause a couple
turnovers. Did you think about going to it earlier?   
COACH TURNER THORNE: We stayed with it from 8 minutes on. When we went man and
had an opportunity to press, we pressed. So we didn't stay in it as well as
we'd like, but it's kind of what we were denying and then just picking up.
That's kind of what we were prepared to do. Yeah, we just needed to be a
little more‑‑ make a few more plays down the stretch.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Linda Lappe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21392)

### [Arielle Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26520)

### [Brittany Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26472)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  69  
Colorado  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Colorado, Coach Linda Lappe, Arielle Roberson and
Brittany Wilson. Coach, we'll have you open and then questions.  
COACH LAPPE: You've got to give Stanford a lot of credit. They're a good
basketball team. They've only lost a couple games for a reason. You know, they
struggled in the first half. We got them out of some of the things that they
were trying to do, and then really just erupted in the second half. Free
throws were probably the biggest difference in the game. We put them to the
free‑throw line way too much, and they were just a little bit too much for us
today.  
I thought we played with them for a lot of the game. We just had trouble
scoring there for a segment and defending in the same segment, and that
allowed them to get a lead on us, and we were never able to really recover
from that.  
  
Q. How much of what happened after the half could you sort of you knew was
coming? You knew they'd make adjustments and make a run at you guys and then
you'd have to adjust to that? Did you kind of know that was coming and it was
up to you to adjust that?  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, playing Stanford is not a sprint, a marathon. There are a
lot of teams that have been ahead of them at the half this year, and really
ahead of them middle of the way in the second half. I thought we lost our
focus to start the second half. We talked about that at halftime making sure
that we were going to put two halves together and play well. You have to play
well for 40 minutes to beat Stanford. When you start making mental errors,
they really take advantage of that, and you could see that was knocking down
some open shots, and a few fouls with times that we just weren't in the right
position.  
So, yeah, we knew they were going to make a run there. They're a really good
team. So we didn't withstand it very well, and we weren't scoring at the rate
that they were scoring.  
  
Q. You held them to 21 field goals, which is their season low, and in the
first half Chiney only had five points. What was the plan on her and how were
you able to limit her touches in the first half?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, we wanted to help off of Mikaela Ruef, and then just not
let her get to a body. We essentially didn't guard her with any one player.
What that allowed us to do is she had a hard time finding a body to post on.
She's very physical. She's very strong. When you give her a body to post on
it, they feed her well and then she makes a lot of great moves.  
So I thought our ability to pressure their guards and keep the ball out of her
hands was pretty effective. Second half they started getting by us with their
guards, and now they were exchanging our help side and different things like
that. But in the first half, we just were steady. I think we made one
defensive error in the first half because of our positioning. Second half we
made quite a few more than that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference between the first half for you and the
second half? Did you feel like in the second half you were still getting good
looks and they just weren't falling?  
BRITTANY WILSON: Yeah, I essentially felt like I got the same looks. My legs
just were short, a couple of them were in and out. My shots just were starting
to fall short, but I essentially feel like I got the same shots I did in the
first half. My legs just didn't carry me through this time.  
  
Q. Brittany, how would you describe your senior season? It's been obviously
some highs early on and some lows. Now it seems like you guys were playing
pretty well.  
BRITTANY WILSON: I would just say it's been a war. You know, win every battle.
But I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world. I'm proud of the fact
that we gave everything. When our backs were against the wall, we fight. That
is one thing I can always say about this team. Doesn't matter if we have
three, if we have six, we're coming to fight. I think that we showed that up
until the buzzer went off. I think that's all you can ask for.  
  
Q. Arielle, how much does this experience going against an All ‑American
like that help you going forward?   
ARIELLE ROBERSON: I mean, I think the whole season helped me progress, but
especially going against Chiney. You don't go against that every game,
especially preseason, you don't really see that. And throughout conferences
there are multiple post players. I think she's made me tougher. She's given me
a lot of things to work on that I know my weaknesses. It's just a great honor
to go against her and show what I've got.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  91  
California  83

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome California and Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, Afure
Jemerigbe and Reshanda Gray. Coach, opening comments and then questions.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think Washington State earned every bit of that win. They
coached better. They played better. They shot the ball better. They played
better defense. They rebounded better, and that's not because we weren't
trying. I thought they came out and did an outstanding job. They're a really
good basketball team and they played like it today, and we couldn't do enough.  
We tried to hang in there and hang in there and weather some storms, and we
just didn't quite have enough. I really credit them. Obviously, we're
disappointed, but we are excited for the fact that we're a postseason team,
and we'll use this to get better.  
As you recall, we got spanked pretty bad here last year, and turned that into
a long postseason run. I know our players are looking forward to getting back
in the gym and fixing some things and having a chance to play basketball
again.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about that hanging in there, hanging in there? Does
that get wary when you're playing from behind a lot?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: At some point I was happy that we were down four or down three
or shooting so well. They can be streaky. So I just kept thinking if we can
get a couple stops and string together as much as they can make really
difficult shots, they can miss a couple in a row. I was hoping we could do
enough to hang in there. So I felt positive about that.  
But at some point they just continued to make plays. We couldn't get those
stops, and it got away from us a little bit. Wearing on us was not really the
word. They just kept putting the gas pedal down and credit to them for doing
that.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you made a great game comeback, but you didn't have Boyd in
those final minutes, and that was pretty critical. With all her talents and
everything, was this the kind of game that in this particular game or perhaps
her competitiveness get the best of her?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think she's always competitive and hates to lose and wants
to do everything in her power to make us win, and those are really, really
good qualities and some of the reasons why I enjoy coaching her so much. I
think it's part of her continued growth to sort of understand how to manage
the game in any situation, but I think this was a collective loss. I think we
couldn't get enough stops on the defensive end, and they really exploited us
with their face‑up four players,Romberg and Cooks, and their guards were
terrific and they shot the ball well. I think that was the story more than
anything else.  
But we'll continue to grow and learn, and Boyd is one of the best players in
the country, and she channels that really well. We just have to get to the
point where we're all figuring out how to win when it's not easy.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just talk about the guards in Galdeira and Presley? What
do you do when Romberg and Cooks go after double digit points in the same
game?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, that's a big problem for us. If you look at the two
teams, on paper we have the advantage inside because of having two posts that
can rebound the ball, score the ball. That is sort of our MO. Their MO is they
have a face‑up four. It's not like we don't know that. I always tell our posts
we have to be able to guard people on the perimeter and keep them from
exploiting us there, and we have to exploit them inside.  
So obviously, Jem and Reshanda, combining for 46 is good. But we can't give up
what we gave up on the perimeter. Credit to them. They picked us apart on the
wing, pick‑and‑roll. They do a good job of using those perimeter face‑up type
post players and gave us more problems today than we would have liked.  
  
Q. Coach, coming into the game, obviously you know the two big scorers. What
was your plan defensively and what happened?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Right, if you look across our conference, there are a lot of
teams with a pair of good guards. There is just really good guard play. I
really trust our perimeter defense. I think in the past we've done a good job
with that. But Washington State presents particular problems because there are
four of them that can shoot, so you can't get as much help on the interior
from your other post player because she's out chasing around the shooter on
the perimeter.  
So we had two good games with them, and I felt like we got the best of the
different styles; and obviously, today, in a glaring way, they did what they
do really well. It was a big problem for us. I'm sure I'm going to look at the
film and see a bunch of areas defensively where we could be better. But I
think it was a lot more of them being really good and we just had a rough
night defending them.  
  
Q. What is your take away from today? Last year you guys left here
disappointed as well, but you put it away and were able to do something great
in the NCAA Tournament?  
RESHANDA GRAY: My takeaway is we still have room for a lot of learning. I give
props to Washington State. They came out and played a really good game, and I
wish them the best. But I'm still riding on my team because I still have faith
in us. This is just another lesson for us.  
  
Q. Can you speak a little bit about what was different about guarding those
two guards today versus the last two times you played them?  
AFURE JEMERIGBE: I just think they hit shots. It seemed like the basket was
really big for them. They were knocking down shots, and I think Galdeira and
Presley were persistent in scoring and aggressive. Galdeira was just like, I'm
not going to let anybody stop me. She's really good about that. We let her
have too many shots. I think just overall they were making shots and we
couldn't defend them.  
  
Q. Reshanda, can you explain how Brittany was trying to help you out? I saw
her on the sideline when she did foul out.  
RESHANDA GRAY: She was just being positive. Like it's not over yet. We still
have a lot of time on the clock. Just being positive.  
  
Q. You don't have Brittany down that stretch run and you have to put
together a comeback at that point. Does that make it more difficult for you
guys?  
AFURE JEMERIGBE: Yeah, I think it's always difficult when she's out. She's our
leader and point guard and the up‑tempo player on the court when we're down.
Even when we're up she always has that energy and kind of getting us to keep
going. It is difficult. I mean, we tried to keep the energy. Like Reshanda
said, from the bench, she was really positive and still trying to get us to
keep going and let us know that we still have it, we're still in this game.  
I try to reiterate that because I am on the court. I try to reiterate that to
everybody else and get us to keep going and keep pushing.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  91  
California  83

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome and congratulate Washington State coach June
Daugherty, and we have Lia Galdeira and Sage Romberg.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Good afternoon or good evening. Congratulations to Cal on
their tremendous regular season. They're a great team. Obviously, being in the
Final Four last year and most of their pieces back, it was a battle. I don't
think the score indicates how tough the game really was.  
But we're excited to see our bench come alive. Playing back‑to‑back games and
scoring almost a hundred points again within 24 hours is an amazing
accomplishment. But it takes talent. It's not just the starters. It was a
total bench effort, team effort all the way.  
We talked about going into the game with the enormous amount of respect that
we had for Cal. We lost in overtime down there about a week ago, and we felt
like we knew they were a really talented team, but we felt we were going to
have to leave it out on the floor and play as hard as we could with each other
and play with heart. And that's what these kids did. It was an exciting win
for the program and another step, survive and advance. So we look forward to
whoever we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sage, how does it feel to jump in and join Lia in the 1,000 point club?  
SAGE ROMBERG: It feels good. It's like, finally, you know. Good job to Lia.
She's only a sophomore, so I think she'll be at the 2,000 point mark.  
LIA GALDEIRA: No, good job, Sage.  
  
Q. Coach, last night you said there was some unfinished business. You
alluded to the overtime loss. Even at home you had been neck and neck with Cal
and went on a pretty blistering run. What changed tonight?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I just think that for us we didn't get frustrated with the
tremendous quality of play that their inside game brings with Gray and Brandon
and on and on and on. We tried to weather the storm, so to speak. We knew they
were going to get there, 20, 30, whatever it was going to be.  
But we felt like as long as we didn't foul and didn't give them the
three‑point plays, that we had enough offense on our side of the bench to get
it done. So we were able to do it. But we really felt like we had them in
overtime. We don't think it should have gone overtime down there, but it did.
It came down to a call. One call that was a little bit of a heartbreaker to
us. But to Cal's credit, they came back in overtime on their home court and
were able to get it done.  
But we left Haas Pavilion with a bad taste in our mouth from that. We felt
like we let it get away, unfinished business. That is something that fuelled
these guys the past week or so getting ready for the tournament. We won the
second chance at it today, and we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Coach, with that, taking them to overtime and this being your fourth win
against a ranked team, do you want to kind of coin a different term instead of
continuing to all these upsets seeing how you're hanging with these teams?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I just want to keep winning. This, as you guys can see, is a
really fun team to coach and be a part of. Truly, not only are they talented,
but they play so hard for each other and they give it their all, they really
do. You know, as a coach for almost 30 years, you don't always get this kind
of pleasure of watching these kids compete the way they're competing for each
other, so we just want to keep it going. You guys can write about upsets or
however you want to coin the phrase, but we want to keep winning and playing
for a long time in March.  
  
Q. Lia, can you speak a little bit about how the basket felt to you in the
beginning of the second half? You hit a three and just screamed out loud. Did
it seem that you couldn't miss at that point?  
LIA GALDEIRA: Well, I mean, I have a problem with not taking it to the hole
and always pulling up for threes. Once I hit that one, I just kind of felt
comfortable. It was just a feeling.  
  
Q. At this think Tia's only points came in that three ‑pointer when you guys
were up five or six points. Cal was making a run. She stepped back and hit
that shot at the buzzer at the shot clock. What did that shot mean?   
COACH DAUGHERTY: That was a total adrenaline rush for everybody. The bench
exploded. We've looked to Tia and Lia so much this year for the big shots. It
was fun. To us, that's fun to see Lia do that. Sorry, Tia to do that at the
buzzer. It's just exciting. The energy keeps building, the enthusiasm. You
look down the bench and towels are waving, kids are jumping up‑and‑down. It's
what college sports is all about. But that was kind of maybe the straw that
maybe broke their back a little bit.  
  
Q. Lindsay talked about how tough it was for them. They felt like they were
hanging on because you guys were up and you kind of weren't letting them back
in all the way. How important do you think it was to maintain that margin?
Because they cut it to six at one point toward the end, but they didn't get
closer than that.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, I think it goes back to our bench. We had so many
people step up tonight, and Taylor Edmondson I think had a great game last
night too. I thought Lex came in off the bench and gave us some great minutes
at the point guard. Hana Potter came in; everybody contributed. It was a total
team win for us. I think that we've learned it's a game of runs. On the
timeout, we knew that Cal was going to make their run. But this group has
decided about 15 games ago to handle runs and to show poise and know that
we've always got a run in our back pocket to come back with. When they do
that, it makes it pretty easy to coach them because they stay with it. Nobody
tries to just take over or do something crazy. We just try to stay with it and
play team basketball.  
  
Q. June, what are your views on pull ‑up threes in transition like Lia took
there?   
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, she was going against‑‑ what I'm thinking about is when
she went against Brittany Boyd, and Brittany had three or four. I'm thinking
take her to the rim. No, no, good shot. But she's a talented kid. She just had
her thousandth point as a sophomore last night. You know, Lia does a lot of
interesting things on the basketball court. There is never a game or practice
that something doesn't happen that myself or my assistant coaches or teammates
thought, what the heck? How did she do that? How did she split that trap or
get that rebound? So she's blessed with a lot of athleticism, and she's a
fierce competitor. How do I feel about it when they go in? Great job.  
  
Q. You alluded to that Presley three that was pretty key in those final
moments. That came off Galdeira since she drew a double team. How much has she
improved off the bench? How much more dangerous does that make this team going
forward?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Talking about Lia right now? Yeah, I think that Lia had a
fantastic opportunity this past summer. She was invited to the USA tryouts and
she was there with Olympians, and went through a great, great experience.
Unfortunately, she didn't make either team, and she came back to Pullman in
the off‑season, and she was way more focused on adding things to her game,
getting in better shape, getting stronger, getting quicker. It's pretty neat
when you see a kid not get disheartened about something like that and instead
turns it into a positive. It's great to see her development. She's got a ways
to go. She's got some things to improve on. But we'll take where she's at
right now and keep building.  
  
Q. Sage, can you talk about the environment? I know it was electric
yesterday, but it seemed like today even more fans?  
SAGE ROMBERG: Yeah, the fans are great. Our bench had lots of energy, and I
think everyone on the court had lots of energy. It was an awesome environment
to play in and a fun game.  
  
Q. Obviously we talked about the big shot late, but you had some huge shots
early. What were you feeling when you were out there tonight?  
SAGE ROMBERG: I was just trying to take everything that was given to me, and
I'm glad I could knock down some shots for the team and get some points on the
board.  
  
Q. June, as talented as they are on the inside, it looked like you guys were
trying to attack. Were you trying to get Gray in foul trouble? What was the
theory there?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: No, I think Dheensaw, we had a lot of confidence in her, and
she felt like she had a little bit of a size advantage. It started with the
tip, she got it, and she was fired up about that. They're very athletic, with
Gray and Brandon especially. But Shalie continues to develop every day, and
she feels very good about her step back, creating space against that kind of
size and length. But it's hard, you go with the left‑hand hook today and a
couple other good moves. So same thing with Mariah Cooks. I mean, what a game
she had. Huge game. I'm surprised nobody talked about what a game she had and
the run that she had.  
I thought Mariah showed great poise today. You know, she didn't go to her spin
move until late in the game because when Boyd was in there; they were digging
down. They know her play. But I thought she got some direct lines. She was
going to go to the rim and find a way to get two or three‑point plays. But
Mariah had an unbelievable run for us in that second half.  
  
Q. You guys are back in the semifinals for the second time in three years.
How does that feel?  
SAGE ROMBERG: It feels really good. It shows how far this program has come
since I've come here. It's good to be back in the semifinals, for sure.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: It's exciting. Let's keep going. Thank you, guys.

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

### [Ariya Crook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24820)

### [Cassie Harberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24821)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  59  
ASU 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, and congratulations to USC. We have Coach Cooper,
Ariya Crook, and Cassie Harberts. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, congratulations to these women. We played well enough
to win again. I thought we played extremely well. We played great defense.
Although we didn't end that defensive possession always with the rebound, I
thought we held a very good and dynamic team to 57 points, and I thought that
was a great defensive effort. Knocked down some big shots and got some crucial
rebounds. We're proud to be going to the semifinals.  
  
Q. Cynthia, you guys seemed to be doing things in spurts in terms of wins
and losses. You've won four in a row. Do you feel you guys are building
momentum that you can sustain now?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I think we have momentum that we have sustained. When you
go through a season with a new coaching staff, we're getting to know our
players, our players are getting to know us. You're going to have some bumps
in the road and you're going to have a season of ups and downs. I thought
we've had more ups than downs.  
I think right now at this point of the year we're right where we want to be
and we're playing the type of basketball that we need to play. The thing that
I love about this team is they're doing what we need in order for us to be
successful. So we've won four straight. We're looking forward to our next
opponent, and we know that that's Stanford. They're a very, very strong team,
and we're going to have to play our best in order to win against them. We're
building our case. We're looking for a Pac‑12 championship, and then we're
looking for an NCAA bid. So we're trying to put ourselves in the perfect
position to get that.  
  
Q. Coach, Crook and Barrett were both saddled with fouls in the first half.
How much impact did they make in the second half? You guys weathered it pretty
well with that run at the end of the first.  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I thought it was important to allow both Crook and Brianna
to play in the second half worry‑free. I almost got yelled at by Ariya because
she wanted to go back in the game in the first half, and that's just how
intense she is and how motivating she is, but I really thought it was better
that we allowed them to play in that second half free throw with only two
fouls.  
So I thought it was big for our team to step up and make that run at the end
of the first half to tie that score up and really give us a chance in the
second half. It was crucial. It was crucial that they were able to go out in
the second half and play strong defense and not worry about necessarily worry
about fouls.  
  
Q. Cassie, can you articulate how it feels different to be playing the way
you guys are playing at this point to maybe your past couple of years?  
CASSIE HARBERTS: Right. I think we've kind of struggled this year with
finishing games, but it's definitely something we've been working on. Last
year we only played one half of basketball. Just having a different mentality
and more attacking mentality, more aggressive, and just giving your all all 40
minutes of the game.  
  
Q. You have 20 wins now. You mentioned one of the things you're playing for
is an NCAA bid. How do you feel about your resume now?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Before this game I thought our resume was pretty strong.
Playing in the Pac‑12 is equally as tough as playing in the ACC or SEC, Big 12
included. We have some really strong teams in the Pac‑12\. So I really feel
like this win has added to that resume and built a case for us.  
If we don't win the Pac‑12 championship, then we at least are in a position to
get an at‑large bid. So I think we've done all that we can do.  
Like I said, we've had some bumps in the road, but even in games we've been a
little inconsistent, but we've always stepped up to the plate. We stepped up
to the challenge again tonight. I thought this team, they were amazing. When
we had foul trouble in the first half, we stepped up. When we weren't
rebounding extremely well, Alexis went and got two strong rebounds.  
When we were 1 for 11 in the first half from three‑point territory, we knocked
down three big three‑pointers and shot 61%, 62% in the second half, 51% from
the two‑point territory. So we stepped up in the second half when we needed
to, and we got the stops we needed to get, and we knocked down the shots we
needed to.  
So I think we've proven that we're a competitor that deserves to have that
second, that postseason, that dance that everyone talks about.  
  
Q. You've talked about the culture you've wanted to implement in this
program. It seems the way the game was won with those two threes by Crook and
Kiki and Kate hitting two big shots in succession, is that a by product? Do
you see that kind of coming to fruition in a game like this?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I don't know that we've necessarily built a culture and at
least consistently have that culture. We're still a work in progress. I have
to give the credit to the players. I have to give the credit to Crook. We
joked about the rainbow three‑point shot, and then to Kate who is coming off
the bench and really giving us a spark both from the two‑point territory as
well as her knocking down her first three. We see that in practice all the
time. But it was the first time you got a chance to see it. Then Jaco, Jaco is
really getting her feet set, Courtney Jaco is knocking down the big
three‑pointer. It's really a testament to how hard they've worked all season
long and what we've seen in practice. Now it's finally being expressed out on
the court in a consistent manner.  
  
Q. Ariya, how difficult was it for you to only play four minutes in that
first half? What was going through your mind?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: She was going to strangle me.  
ARIYA CROOK: It was difficult. I looked at Coach when we were down by nine
points. I was like, Coach, put me in. We have nothing to lose. She was like,
no.  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: How did I do it again?  
ARIYA CROOK: I'll never do it again. It was difficult to watch my teammates
going through a little shooting slump. My teammates didn't give up on me. They
told me, pick it up, Crook, be ready. You're going to go into the game. The
second half is your half. So, it was about my teammates, at that point. So I
just played for my teammates and the second half was ours.  
  
Q. You said against Arizona your team seemed to come out a little flat,
maybe some jitters in the first round. Do you see this getting some momentum
and building toward the semis?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, I will tell you that we came out flat in the first
half again. I just think it's new territory for us to come out with that level
of confidence and culture that we're still trying to develop. But I will say
the second half we came out on fire, like we came out on a mission. We were
out to prove something, and we did it. We proved it. We proved it to ourselves
first, and then everyone in the Pac‑12 Network, everyone got a chance to see
it, because we came out for one of the first times, and we were on a mission.
We played great defense. We got into player's faces. We rebounded the ball
early on, and then we were able to get out on our fast break and attack the
basket.  
When ASU went to man‑to‑man, it was almost like a light went on in our mind,
and we just started attacking and getting to the rim, which allowed us to then
get to the free‑throw line. So there are some great moments in that second
half that we can build on. We can build upon.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Utah  65  
Washington  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Utah here, Michelle Plouffe and Emily Potter. We'll
take questions, and we welcome Coach Levrets from Utah. Coach, some opening
remarks and we'll go from there.  
COACH LEVRETS: First of all, very proud of our team and everybody that played
tonight contributed to a complete and total team win against a really talented
offensive basketball team. I thought we had a very complete defensive
performance tonight and couldn't be happier for our players.  
  
Q. Michelle, everything seemed to be working. What was going so well for you
out there today?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I think my teammates were getting me the ball when we ran
plays and knocking down shots when they needed to, and I think that opened up
a little space for me to get inside.  
COACH LEVRETS: She's good. That's what was going on.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: We moved the ball really well.  
COACH LEVRETS: Oh, sorry, sorry.  
  
Q. Coach, you had said that one of the most amazing things about this off
‑season was that your most talented player was your most improved player. How
has she continued to grow throughout the course of the season?   
COACH LEVRETS: Well, it's been a tough year. She was really good at the end of
last year and spent the time, unlike anybody I've ever seen that's already
that good have that sort of improvement. Just her ability, although the
crossover, full court, we still want to work on not using that one. But her
ball handling, her ability to put the ball on the floor and get to the basket,
play through contact, play off the dribble in isolation areas. Just improved
her strength and obviously she has incredible stamina. She plays a lot of
minutes and is just able to‑‑ she's better at everything she does. That's a
credit to her work ethic and how hard she's worked.  
  
Q. Michelle, how much of a motivating factor is it for you to just keep this
run going and extend your career?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: That's just what we're trying to do, play as long as we can.
I didn't want this to be my last game, and I don't think we thought it was
going to be. We were ready to come out and fight. It's hard to beat a team
three times, and we knew that they weren't going to go away and they weren't
going to stop.  
But I think the whole team played for our seniors, and I was playing for my
last game, and I didn't want it to be today.  
  
Q. Emily, I forgot who the assist was for, but you had a three ‑quarters
court play. Does that galvanize the team? You guys looked pretty pumped coming
into that timeout after it. It must have been fun for you?   
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, for sure. We've done that in practice, and I mean it paid
off. Saw Plouffe and got that little high‑low kind of thing. Connected pretty
far past, but I knew she had good hands and I knew she was going to get it.  
  
Q. Kelsey Plum got her points, but she really struggled from the field. What
was working defensively against her?  
COACH LEVRETS: First of all, she's an incredibly talented young player. We
really tried to make her earn baskets. We knew we were going to foul them some
and they were going to make shots off the dribble, but we couldn't give her
uncontested threes. Our kids did a great job. She got a couple, and over the
course of 40 minutes, we did a really good job of being in her space and
making her dribble to a shot. That was the plan. We did it really well at our
place last time around in about a five‑minute stretch, and she got a couple
against us.  
But you're not going to stop a kid like that. You have to contain her and make
sure she earns everything, and I thought our kids did a goat job with that
tonight.  
  
Q. It was such an impressive recruiting class, including Malia Nawahine, and
she was state Player of the Year. Tonight she was playing defense Kelsey Plum
and Jazmine Davis. What has her commitment been to some of the more
unglamorous sides of the game but still effective?  
COACH LEVRETS: These freshmen are learning. It's been a hard year and there is
no getting around it. We've been through a lot as a group. The freshmen have a
ton to learn. The ups and downs and good and bad, and it's always harder when
you're not as successful as you're used to being, but you just try to get them
to continue to believe in what you're doing.  
Over the last month or so, I haven't seen a big change in Malia in her
interaction with staff and coaches and players. It just bought into completely
what we're doing she's obviously a long, talented athletic wing that has a
chance to be really good. She keeps working, and I think she has a chance to
be a really good player before she's done.  
  
Q. I guess to add to that, you could look at the two one ‑point losses to
Washington this year, and all the losses that you've noted have accumulated.
How integral has it been to have a rock like Plouffe end this season?   
COACH LEVRETS: I'm not going to let her go. She and I have been through a lot
together. I wouldn't have this job if it wasn't for her. She made a jumpshot
as a freshman to beat BYU during the Mountain West tournament during my
interim season which I was pretty appreciative of.  
So just having her, as good a player as she is, she's a way better person. Her
steadiness, everything about her is calm and cool and collected. She's an
unbelievable person. Hell of a player, but a way better kid and has been a
great role model and example for everybody in our program. It would be really
nice to play a couple more games with her and figure out a way to get her a
fifth year.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  76  
UCLA  65

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome and congratulations to Colorado. Coach Linda Lappe,
Brittany Wilson and Ashley Wilson. Coach, I'll have you open and we'll take
questions.  
COACH LAPPE: Really excited for our team. Any time you can win a game in
postseason, it's a plus. We're not ready to be done playing yet, and I think
you can see how much intensity we played in the second half that we want to
keep playing. Just excited for our entire team. I thought everybody that came
in and everybody on the bench was fantastic. Everybody did their job.
Everybody knew their role. When we played together in that game, we were
fantastic. When we moved the ball, when we played together defensively, hit
the open player, and then we knocked down those open shots and everything
seemed to go our way.  
So, happy for where we are, and now we'll celebrate very quickly and then move
on to the next game.  
  
Q. Brittany, you knocked down some three ‑pointers tonight, some big ones at
timely moments. What got into you guys behind the arc tonight? It seemed like
it was a better game shooting.   
BRITTANY WILSON: Me and Coach watched film before we left, and one thing that
she noticed about my shots was I was hitting the ball out of them. And she
said there is no reason I should be doing that on the three, and just stay in
my shot, and that's exactly what I did and they fell.  
  
Q. Coach, to me the pivotal moment in the game early in the second half, you
were down 46 ‑38, and they run off ten straight points essentially. What
changed at that time?   
COACH LAPPE: Just our aggressiveness. I thought the way we scored quickly in
transition. Ashley was a huge part of that in running the floor. Point guards
did a nice job in hitting her ahead. She did a nice job of finishing some
tough shots down there. So really some quick scores. To go on runs, it's all
about putting consecutive possessions together, getting a score and making a
great defensive play getting the rebound and getting the stop.  
So the game is pretty simple when you make it simple. We took what the defense
gave to us. We changed a little bit how we were thinking, I thought, at the
beginning of the second half we were playing one‑on‑one way too much. That's
not our team. We play our best basketball when we play together. We need each
other to defend, and we kind of flipped that switch at that point in time and
really relied on each other and helped each other out both on the offensive
end and defensive end.  
  
Q. Brittany or Ashley, both teams have had some hard luck with injuries this
year. What is it about your group that you guys didn't want to go home and you
wanted to keep this going?  
ASHLEY WILSON: With any team, adversity is going to come. So it's just about
how you respond to adversity and how tough you're willing to be and how much
you're willing to bounce back. We've done that all year long, no matter
injuries or whatever. No team is going to feel sorry for you because you have
injuries. You have to suit up and be ready to go the next day.  
BRITTANY WILSON: I would agree. We have to play our best ball because it's
either win or go home. It brings out the great in our team. We have 13 players
that are going to fight. Especially when one is down, we fight even harder.
With the loss of Jas and when I was out, regardless who it is, we fight. We'll
continue to fight whether we have five. We're still going to fight and punch
just as hard as anybody else.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Fields? Wanted to win pretty bad, but them being
shorthanded, did they kind of run out of gas?  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, you've got to give UCLA a lot of credit. Fields is a
fantastic player, and she's tough to guard. She can score in so many different
ways. She gets to the rim. She's strong, she can shoot the threes. I felt like
we just kept at it, and we kept wearing her down. She got some easy shots
early, but we made her work for most of her shots, and you can see that maybe
towards the end of the game with some of her shots falling short. So, yeah, I
felt like we did a nice job of wearing them down. I thought there was a
segment in the second half where both teams were a little gassed, and I liked
our toughness. That's where all the games earlier in the season and our
ability to bounce back from adversity, our ability to lose close games and
keep fighting and not give up, you can see that sort of mentality at that
point in time where either team really could have broken and I liked how we
had that resolve, and we had that resiliency and kept coming at them.  
It wasn't an easy win. UCLA, they do a lot with their players and who they
have and with the injuries that they've had. I thought we just kept at it, and
kept a little bit longer than they did and we were able to close it out.  
  
Q. It seemed you really disrupted them defensively. Did you change anything
or do anything different?  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, we did. They were really comfortable to start the second
half. Everybody was making shots, even players that don't normally make shots.
You could just see them start to get comfortable in what they were doing. I
always think your defense has a huge part in that, and we wanted to try to
make them uncomfortable, so we started to trap a little bit and tried to speed
them up and make them do things they weren't as comfortable doing, making them
pass to players, making them pass overhand, and just increasing our
aggressiveness.  
Our players did a nice job of really just bearing down and getting loose balls
and getting tips. I thought the fact that we turned them over in the second
half quite a bit really helped us be able to get our offense going. We're our
best when we can get out and transition.  
  
Q. You just played UCLA at the end of February. Did you make any adjustments
this time around?  
COACH LAPPE: We ran the trap a little bit more than we did at their place.
Other than that, no, not much. They had Lemberger when they played at our
place so it was a little bit different defensively. Offensively we ran a
little bit more kind of our basic offense versus the two‑three. We didn't run
quite as many on‑ball threes this time around.  
I think the biggest difference was our guards were ready to score tonight. Our
guards were not ready to score the last time we played them. When you're a
coach, you always try to figure out what the other coach is going to try to
do, and I thought they'd try to really pack it in on us and make them hit
outside shots. You could see how hard it was for our posts to throw the ball,
especially without Jen in there. We needed our guards to step up and take
shots they take every day in practice, and take shots they make every day in
practice, and I felt like they did a nice job.  
Brittany did a nice job. Ashley hitting an open three. Huggins coming in and
giving us key minutes as well. I thought that was probably the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Ashley and Brittany, are you guys looking forward to the challenge of
facing Stanford tomorrow night?  
BRITTANY WILSON: Yes, I think we're ready for them. Like you said, it's win or
go home. So you lay it all on the floor, and we're ready. We don't look at the
name on the jersey. We all have to come out and play 40 minutes. In the end,
it's about who plays 40 minutes the best.  
ASHLEY WILSON: We're ready. 40 minutes of absolute great defense. Same thing
we've been doing all year long. So try to do the best we can with Chiney. They
shoot the three really well, so try to contest outside. Just play good as a
unit, which is what we've been doing all year.

### [Tia Presley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26500)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  107  
Oregon  100

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Washington State Cougars, Coach June Daugherty,
Tia Presley, and Lia Galdeira.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Great to see so many media here. Want to start out and say
what an honor and privilege it has been to coach against Paul and his tenure
at Oregon. I've learned so much from him and admire him. I wish him and his
staff all the best. I'd also like to salute their entire team, especially
their seniors. I can't imagine how tough it was for them to come in here and
play with everything that was going on. Ariel Thomas is a phenomenal senior,
and she's had a great, great career as well as the rest of their seniors, so I
would just like to commend them on handling a very difficult situation. The
only other thing I'll add to that is what is truly great for the
student‑athlete.  
Moving on. Great fans here. Great to see so many Cougars in the house cheering
us on. This is a fun game. If you can't get excited about women's basketball
in the Pac‑12 after seeing what just happened, then I don't know. You have to
check your pulse or whatever.  
But this is an exciting win for us. Really proud of our entire team.
Obviously, Lia and Tia had a record‑breaking night together combining for
60‑some points. But I thought it was a total team effort. Shalie Dheensaw had
a double‑double against a great front line player with Alleyne. Taylor
Edmondson came in and had a stellar game for us as well.  
I think Dawny Awa never gets the credit. But she's the straw that stirs the
drink. There is just no doubt about it. Fun to see her have eight assists and
have the kind of game that she had tonight.  
  
Q. On Dawny, you said she might be the best passer you've coached, and she
can put English on the ball. When she's playing like she did tonight, does
that bring this team up another level?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Oh, there is no doubt. You have to remember she led her team
in high school to three State Championships. Fortunately, her mom is a pretty
darn good coach. Her mom and dad are the boys and girls coaches at Konawaena
High. She's just so calm. What you see is what you get from Dawny. We could be
up 20, we could be down 20, but Dawny is always so calm and in control and
running things the way she's done it. But you guys got to see a little bit of
it tonight with some of the passes. I don't know how she threaded the passes
through the way she did, but it was a lot of fun to watch.  
  
Q. To both the players, how fun is it to play in a game like this? Win or go
home, high scoring, you've got your fans cheering you on. How fun was it to
play in this game tonight?  
TIA PRESLEY: It was extremely fun. Especially for me, this is my first time
playing in a Pac‑12 tournament. So with a crowd like that and team like
Oregon, we expected a lot. We had a lot of fun out there. Coming out with the
win makes the experience so much better. I know I'm pumped and the rest with
my teammates too.  
LIA GALDEIRA: Same with what Tia said and Coach June, it's a team effort. I
give credit to my team, the coaching staff, and everybody that's along for the
ride with us.  
  
Q. How good was it to have Taylor Edmondson go off for ten points in the
second half?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, the kid's had a rough year. Injury, after injury after
injury, and she missed so much playing time because of it. Tonight was shades
of what we saw in Nebraska when we upset them at their place. When she came
off the bench and she was sort of aggressive, and she was just having fun out
there. When she's loose like that and as good an athlete and as great a
shooter as she is, great things happen. So I'm really proud of Taylor to come
in and play the way she did.  
  
Q. Coach, is this the type of game that you're comfortable on the
sideline?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Never, never. I mean, you look at the scoreboard and it's
just blowing up. You're in triple digits and you know at any point, Chrishae
or somebody is going to hit another three back‑to‑back or get a steal and rush
you into something.  
So never was comfortable the entire game. It's a great system that he plays.
Obviously, he's had great success in the NBA, WNBA, Pac‑12, so you're never
comfortable with the way they play.  
  
Q. Late in the game as you were talking about it it was possession and
possession. It seemed you would score, they would score. That one possession,
I don't know who got Lia the ball, but she stepped back and hit that three. I
want you to talk about that play, and I want Lia to talk about what it was
like to be part of that play?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, Dawny was at the controls at the time, and here we go.
I heard‑‑ all I saw was Dawny was starting to penetrate and there were so many
bodies in there for Oregon. I heard Lia say, sis, which is what she calls
Dawny, and she found her somehow. And that was, if I was ever comfortable
during the game I thought we've got a chance for this to be over now with the
big three, but Lia will have to explain it, I don't know. She could see it
better than I could.  
LIA GALDEIRA: Kind of like in high school, it's how we played. I knew the
passes were coming before they had been. Dawn, she's crazy. It took a whole
year, and now everyone's comfortable and knows the ball is coming at times.
But I just saw her driving, and I mean, six, three, four girls started to come
on her, and she just threw it without looking and I stepped back. I didn't
want to take the two, so I guess I just shot the three.  
  
Q. Dheensaw struggled with foul trouble last week. Was there a different
approach? Did you talk to her ahead of this big night?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, she's really disappointed in her weekend. The great
thing about Shalie with her maturation process, she looks forward to the next
challenge. You know, it was very concerning early that she didn't pick up
early fouls like last weekend against Alleyne in particular, and Danielle
Love, they're a great front line.  
But she's really stepped up her game this year, and to have a double‑double.
We're doubling down. We've forced some turnovers. We've forced some travels.
But Jillian's such a load. She's one of the premier players not only in the
Pac‑12 but in the country. So.  
I'm really proud of Shalie to bounce back the way she did tonight. But even
though you look down and you see how much she scored against her, she stayed
solid and just kept fighting for position and fighting for rebounds. I thought
her rebounding was a big key for us tonight.  
  
Q. Tia and Lia, I wonder if you could talk ‑‑ I was amazed. I didn't realize
until I saw the stat sheet, only eight turnovers against that nutcase game.
How do you explain that? That is pretty impressive.   
TIA PRESLEY: Yeah, that's extremely impressive against a team like Oregon that
is so intense on defense, and you're turnover prone. So for us to be able to
handle the ball under that pressure is really impressive. If you don't turn
the ball over against them and you can get to the basket, you have a really
good chance of winning. So I think the turnovers really helped us.  
LIA GALDEIRA: I agree with what Tia said, being strong with the ball, taking
care of the ball. Before getting trapped, breaking that is a big thing. Just
not panicking under pressure.  
  
Q. Not to look too far ahead, but a run ‑and‑gun game like this, are you
concerned about energy for tomorrow?   
COACH DAUGHERTY: It's March Madness, so no. Our kids practice hard. They're in
great shape. We've got a lot of talented kids. I think some of our front line
kids didn't play a lot of minutes tonight because of foul trouble, that will
be fresh. We can rest all spring and summer.  
  
Q. You guys had a tough loss against Cal a week ago. What are you looking to
improve on going into the game tomorrow?  
TIA PRESLEY: I think we just want to finish. We went into an overtime game
with them and came out short. That's always hard and you don't want to lose
that way. So I think we're going to come out fired up and ready to play. You
have to play confident at this point in the season and you have to be ready
every night. So we just need to come out and be prepared for a war with Cal,
because they're not going to back down.  
LIA GALDEIRA: Same with what Tia said. Finish free throws, finish the easy
shots.  
  
Q. Second half you go into halftime shooting 46.5%, you come out and miss
three or four of the first shots. June, what did you feel like? Players, how
did you guys turn that around?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I just felt like we just had to get our focus back on our
defense in transition. That's where they get so many or the great majority of
their scoring and make sure we're back on the game plan. We talked about that
in the one timeout. Always confident that shots are going to fall. With this
group, why wouldn't I be? You see how talented these two are and Taylor. I
think Romberg, Dheensaw and Edmondson, we've got a lot of weapons. These guys
aren't getting it done, put somebody else in. But I've got great confidence in
all of our team.  
  
Q. You promised before the start of the season you'd go to postseason. Now
you're guaranteed to be eligible for the WNIT. Have you even thought about
that? Do you think you deserve to go to the WNIT?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Of course I've thought about it. Of course I've thought about
it. You know, I think it's something that at the end of this tournament that
we can talk about. But right now we've got to get ready for Cal. It's an
exciting time for us. We just had a tough battle in the Bay last week; and, as
Tia said, we didn't finish our business. We're really looking forward to the
challenge of playing them tomorrow night. As far as postseason, we can talk
about that another time.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

### [Ariya Crook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24820)

### [Kate Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26476)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  59  
Arizona - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome USC. Coach?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I thought we played tentative at some points in the first
half. I thought we lost our focus defensively, and second half we played
better defense and executed on the offensive end and got some key defensive
stops. So we didn't play our best game, but I thought we played well enough to
win, and I was proud. I was proud of them. Kate came in and gave us a huge
spark off the bench. Defensively she made it tough on the inside; then she got
a couple offensive rebounds and putbacks and helped us in the half court
execution. So Ariya knocked down that big three‑point shot that really kind of
broke it open for us late in the game. So not happy with everything that
happened tonight, but really, really happy with the win.  
  
Q. Sometimes when you get in a game like that where the other team is such
an underdog they kind of play looser. Do you feel like in the first half they
played a little looser than you guys did?  
ARIYA CROOK: I know when we were in that position last year, and we came into
the Pac‑12 tournament last year, we thought we had nothing to lose and we
needed to come out and win so we could make it to the NCAA Tournament, but we
came up short. So for Arizona to come in and have nothing on their shoulders
or anything like that, they just came in and tried to win the game and take
our spot.  
KATE OLIVER: I would have to agree. They definitely came in with nothing to
lose. We were thinking that they would, but even still it took us a little bit
by surprise. But we definitely brought it back together and we were able to
get it back together.  
  
Q. I thought in the last couple of games you played more minutes than you
have been. Were you surprised you played as much as you did tonight?  
KATE OLIVER: I mean, I'm happy to get out there and play with my teammates and
do what I need to do (No Microphone).  
  
Q. 4 for 11 from the free ‑throw line. How concerned were you about that?   
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, I think part of that, I just thought part of that was
nerves. I thought we were a little nervous. We were a little tight. When
Arizona came out and they were so aggressive, I thought they had us on our
heels for a moment, and I thought that hindered us and really got us unfocused
even at the free‑throw line.  
So in so many areas we were back‑pedalling and on our heels and not as
focused. I just think the free‑throw line was another example of us not really
being in it. But I thought down the stretch when it was time and we needed to
hit free throws, we hit them down the stretch.  
So I'm not majorly concerned, but it's definitely going to be something that
we talk about.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys were going back and forth, it was 44 ‑43 there with
a couple minutes to go. What changed and allowed you to make that change?   
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, a couple things. Arizona starts to change defenses,
and so between the box and one and the 2‑3 zone, we had to figure out an
offense that would get the ball where we wanted to get it in a timely manner
against that type of defense.  
So we changed plays and then we put Kate in. The great thing about Kate is
that she's not necessarily a banger. She likes to shoot. She likes to finesse
it in, and she's 6'4". So what she did was not only did she provide an
offensive punch for us, but she also passed the ball so well that it allowed
Cassie to get some looks. It allowed Alexis, we call her X, to get some looks,
and it allowed our shooters to come out. Then the guards started focusing in
on the post players and it allowed our shooters to get some space to get some
shots off.  
I know Des hit a three‑pointer; and Ariya hit a three‑pointer later in the
second half. So really we changed offenses and we inserted Kate, and I thought
that helped open it up for us.  
  
Q. You guys are 19 ‑12 now. (No Microphone)?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, we want to win the tournament to make it to the NCAA
Tournament. But we're really‑‑ we take it one game at a time. So all we were
thinking about was Arizona, and now all we're thinking about is ASU. We really
take it one step at a time. We think we've done enough to hopefully make it to
the tournament. We have some big wins with Colorado with 12 in the nation, we
beat them. We beat Cal at Cal. We've played Stanford tough, and I'm missing a
win, a big time win. Oh, we took ASU into overtime at their place.  
So we have some games that I think will be very interesting for the NCAA. But
at this point we're not thinking about that. We're just thinking about our
next opponent, and that is ASU.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Atonye Nyingifa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24921)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  76  
UCLA  65

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome UCLA coach Cori Close and Atonye Nyingifa. Coach, some
opening remarks and then we'll take questions?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, this is my least favorite thing to do as a head coach is to
close out a season. I first of all want to say I have the utmost respect for
Linda Lappe and what she's doing at Colorado. Both teams have had a ton of
adversity, and I thought her team responded incredibly well today. I thought
they really got us out of rhythm in the second half. I just really have a lot
of respect for how she's building her program. Right now it hurts that my
season is ending, but I do want to give her a lot of credit for how she's
handled the difficult year as well. But for me, I just love my team. If you
would have told me I would feel this deeply and be so proud of a team with
this record at the beginning of the year, I would have said you're crazy.  
I didn't want them‑‑ I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to stop watching
Atonye Nyingifa keep growing. I wanted Thea Lemberger to get a chance to get
out there and play this game we so passionately love.  
I challenge this team to be one of the hardest working teams in UCLA history
and one of the closest teams in UCLA history at the beginning of the year. I
didn't know how important that would be. I didn't know all the adversity that
was ahead of us. But they have lived exactly that. I probably never coached a
team in 21 years of coaching that's been more resilient and has grown more or
taught me more.  
I think my staff has done an incredible job, and I think these two seniors,
Atonye sitting here and Thea Lemberger have left a legacy and a mark that will
be talked about for years to come.  
  
Q. You were ahead 46 ‑38 early in the second half, in your view, what
changed?   
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think they started really getting us out of rhythm. We
were able to move the pieces around and get the mismatches that we wanted. I
thought we were able to get Nirra and get her some great catches in the first
half and even in the second half, and I thought we got some good touches for
Atonye.  
But I thought they got out and started denying passing lanes and trapped our
first pass and really got us out of rhythm. We're a team that needs to move
the pieces around and hide certain mismatches and take advantage of other
ones. They really made us play just a read and react type of situation, and it
made it a guard game. We needed to attack off the dribble, and we didn't have
quite enough people that were confident in that kind of game.  
  
Q. (No Microphone). One question I had, I never heard, what was Thea's
problem? Was she ill last game?  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah, she suffered a head injury actually the last time we played
Colorado. And in the progression of her coming back, we were hoping that if we
could get to tomorrow, we could maybe start her back into play. But she was
not cleared as of today from actually an injury she suffered in the previous
game against Colorado.  
  
Q. Was it a concussion?  
COACH CLOSE: Yes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, like she said, a little bit out of rhythm, it seemed
that things didn't quite click as well in the second half?  
ATONYE NYINGIFA: Yeah, we came out in the second half, and I don't think we
rebounded as much as we thought we would. So we were down on the boards. Like
Coach said, I think our offense, we just couldn't find a good rhythm, and it
didn't help that we couldn't put together a couple stops in a row to give us
more momentum on offense. So we just kind of struggled on both ends.  
  
Q. How tough is it knowing this is the last game?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, very tough. We have never‑‑ the good news is Thea hasn't
practiced the entire Pac‑12 season, so it's not like we've never had any reps
without her. She's only played in games the entire Pac‑12\. But we only had
played in one game without her, and that was at Utah. I thought we responded
well there, but that's a really difficult position. She's been our rock, and
she's been the quarterback of our team. I mean, we really have ‑‑ Madeline
Brooks has never done that in her time here. Not only has she not had that
dependent upon minutes, which is really fun for me to watch her grow into
that. But at the same time she's never had to handle the ball, run the team,
make decisions.  
Dominique, I think brought us a ton of energy and rebounding, but it was hard
for her on the offensive end. The answer to your question is very hard. It was
hard, obviously, from a tactical standpoint, but probably more so in a calm,
just run‑the‑team, make‑decisions standpoint. We needed a calm decision maker
in that way, so we missed her immensely. I thought our team played, you know,
we really wanted to get the W for Thea, and we weren't able to do that.  
But I think that our heart and sentiment was really to try to fight hard to
make that happen, and that's what I need to see from my team. I need to see
their fight and togetherness, and willingness to keep swinging the punches, so
to speak, and they did that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Nirra Fields' game?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, really, it was first play of the game, and Tony Newnan on
my staff really thought we could get her some post‑up touches and that might
be a better way to get her going. First play of the game, that's exactly what
happened. So I give credit to him and to her for executing the game plan. I
think Nirra is maybe one of the most improved players in the whole conference
if you look at what's different in her game. I mean, she didn't dribble the
ball two times with her left‑hand this year. To see most of her attacks are to
her left. I think learning shot selection but she's attacking to the basket,
her mid‑range game, she's got a really nice pull‑up. I think her free throws,
getting to the free‑throw line and the improvement in that, she's going to be
a really fun explosive player to watch in the coming years.  
But we really always talk in our program about growth. You have an opportunity
to have a growth mindset every day. I think if anyone has embodied that and
taken that on as a personal challenge, Nirra Fields has, and it's played out
in her game. She is one of the best athletes I've ever been around. Her
ability, her strength combined with her quickness, and then as her skills and
reads happen, to catch up to her athleticism, it's going to be tough to stop
her.  
  
Q. Playing in these games here in Seattle, I wonder if you have an
impression, good, bad or indifferent?  
COACH CLOSE: Very good. I'm really excited about this community. This has been
a great women's basketball community for years in Seattle. We're really
relying on that as a conference to rally around. We want this to be the number
one premier conference tournament in the country. I do think the city of
Seattle has an opportunity to make that happen. I appreciate the efforts of
the Pac‑12 office. I think there is an excellence, a commitment to the very
best. There is sort of this wave of momentum and you're seeing it in the way
we're all able to recruit. We're able to keep people out west, top to bottom
in our conference, I believe we are by far the most improved conference in the
nation. I thinks a big piece of that has to be the way it culminates in
Seattle every year.  
So I want to thank the efforts of this great city and our Pac‑12 offices. We
have big things and expectations ahead. It's going to be really fun to watch.

### [Carissa Crutchfield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26474)

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

USC  59  
Arizona - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening remark, and then we'll take questions.  
COACH BUTTS: All right. First of all, thank you guys for allowing me to speak.
I want to first start off by saying how proud I am of our group for the way
they battled today. I thought we played extremely hard. I think we probably
ran out of gas a little bit in combination with our foul troubles.  
But we fought, battled to the end. These two young ladies sitting next to me
played their hearts out and we just came up a little short.  
  
Q. You got behind early, but you battled back, the casual observer would
have thought it was a lopsided game. What enabled you to get as close as you
did?  
COACH BUTTS: Well, again, all the credit goes to the team. They played hard.
They played hard even though we've been shorthanded most of the season, but
today we came in and we fought. We were physical. We met aggression with
aggression. I thought they never quit. They never quit. We played every play,
and we played for 40 minutes. We just came up short. Those are the ones that
hurt the most because you know you gave it all you had and you came up short.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the play of Kama in the first half?  
COACH BUTTS: I thought it was outstanding. She was knocking down shots,
shooting the ball with confidence. The rest of the team was feeding off that
energy. I thought we were flying around on the defensive end, getting to some
balls. I thought she sparked it especially in that first half.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH BUTTS: We gave up some offensive rebounds there, some key shots. And we
stopped moving. Fatigue started in a little bit. But overall, I still think we
kept the game pretty tight. Buzz basketball is a game of runs, so people are
going to make runs on you and they made one. We answered it, but we just could
not get over that hump again.  
  
Q. You both talked about Pac ‑12 basketball and to play with this level with
7 players is almost unheard of. How did you guys maintain and stay in this
game?   
CARISSA CRUTCHFIELD: We got pretty tired, but we kept fighting. As a senior,
you don't want your last game to end, so I just know as a captain, I wanted to
go out there and just play. It was pretty good. We got pretty tired, but we
had to keep fighting.  
KAMA GRIFFITTS: That's something I think we got used to. We didn't let that
bother us, yeah, we had 7, but we still played hard.  
  
Q. Coach, were you worried?  
COACH BUTTS: I thought maybe I'd come in, but I was reminded that my
eligibility was up.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH BUTTS: Yeah, the officials want me to be a little slower, I think. They
told me I was entering their space. But certainly you start to worry about
fouls, but you can't coach entirely scared to get those fouls, because then
you take away the aggressive nature and the aggressive play. I thought that
was the reason why we stayed in the basketball game. So we've been in that
situation so often this season that, you know, this time around I was pretty
confident that we could play through it.  
  
Q. Congratulations. That was a great effort.  
COACH BUTTS: Thank you, I really appreciate that.  
  
Q. Just for background, 7 players, was that due to injuries?  
COACH BUTTS: There are a lot of factors, but certainly a lot due to injuries.
Those are things you can't control. You have to just roll with the punches, so
to speak again, the team battled. I want to continue to say that our team
fought today and I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH BUTTS: Yeah, you know, sometimes things don't work out with other
players. But it's mostly injuries, to be honest with you.

### [Jillian Alleyne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26499)

### [Ariel Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26498)

### [Paul Westhead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17527)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  107  
Oregon  100

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Oregon Ducks. Thank you for being here. Coach
Paul Westhead, Jillian Alleyne, and Ariel Thomas. Coach, I'll have you make
opening remarks and questions from the media.  
COACH WESTHEAD: I think our team played about as hard as they could. I'm proud
of them, and they gave a terrific effort and good for them.  
  
Q. Ariel and Jillian, what have your emotions been over the last week?
Obviously, a lot has gone on, and it was a tough one tonight, really playing
your pace, kind of an up ‑and‑down week for you guys.   
ARIEL THOMAS: Pretty much our emotions were just to get game ready for the
Pac‑12\. We didn't really focus on what happened outside of the court. It was
just we came to play fast‑paced basketball and we came up short.  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: Yeah, what Ariel said, honestly. We were just preparing
ourselves for this game and giving our all for our coaches. Pretty much all
that ws going through my mind, despite the news, we were just pulling together
for each other.  
  
Q. Jillian and Ariel, if you could, now that you've had a moment to kind of
let everything else settle in, how was it, or how does it fit with you right
now to have this be the final game?  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: Right now it's still kind of‑‑ I mean, it hit me pretty hard
at the end of the buzzer, but I'm still kind of taking in everything that's
happened and going to happen. It's really hard for me especially because I
have so much love for my coaches and my teammates, especially the seniors.  
So I'm really just trying to stay positive. I'm kind of just letting
everything come to me right now. It's really a lot. Honestly, it's tough, but
I've got to remain positive.  
ARIEL THOMAS: Like Jillian said, keep a positive mindset. It hit me as well
more in the locker room, the emotions. But I don't think there is time for
that. I think it's just stay in the moment. Can't worry about what's going to
happen next. It's just a matter of taking in the moment right now.  
  
Q. What did Washington State do that frustrated your team, if you will? I
thought if you got into the shootout, you would have preferred that, but is
there anything particular that they did that you felt kind of carried the
day?  
COACH WESTHEAD: Well, I think they shot the ball very well. They minimized
their turnovers, which we do our best to kind of frazzle teams that kind of
turn the ball and get them into awkward positions. So I think those two things
was at least 7 points. Washington State played a good game and they shot the
ball well. So good for them.  
  
Q. What were some of the things that were talked about in the locker room?
Because you did limit Washington State to only 48 points in the second half.
What were some of the defensive adjustments made going into the second half
during halftime?  
COACH WESTHEAD: We were trying to minimize our own turnovers. We thought that
would be a key for us to kind of run our break and minimize turning the ball.  
Unfortunately, we turned it again in the second half. Some the good play of
Washington State and some we just missed some opportunities of people that we
should have given the ball to and we didn't. But that happens in this type of
game. You know, we played that high velocity basketball and turned it, and it
hurts. If you don't turn it, you get easier shots. So we played that way.  
  
Q. Coach, as fast ‑paced as the game is going, it seems you always had them
within your sights. Did you feel confident you'd have the good shot at
catching them?   
COACH WESTHEAD: Yeah, I felt good. I don't know when it looked like the game
got away from us, certainly inside the minute. But I thought anywhere between
two and a half minutes, three‑point game. I thought we were‑‑ I'd have rather
been up three or four, but I never thought the game was out of sight until‑‑ I
mean, inside the minute was tough. We needed some five‑point shots then and we
couldn't get them.  
  
Q. Paul, you'd mentioned that you were interested in staying in basketball.
Do you still want to coach or do you see yourself in some other position?  
COACH WESTHEAD: I know some things I wouldn't be, but that's okay. I won't get
into that in the basketball world. You won't see me with any different colored
shirt on, I can tell you that. But that's all right. Yeah, I'm a basketball
coach.  
  
Q. You guys are eligible for the WNIT. Is that something you'd like to be
part of?  
COACH WESTHEAD: I like my team. I like their spirit. I think they're a game to
play on and they could be successful, so why not? Yeah. I'd be happy for them
if that's the way it turns out.  
  
Q. If the announcement on your job would have come a few days later, do you
think it would have been a different outcome tonight?  
COACH WESTHEAD: Oh, no. No.  
  
Q. Ariel, when you look at Jillian and Chrishae and some of the pieces they
have in place, where do you see the program headed in the future?  
ARIEL THOMAS: Like you said, like Jillian being able to average double‑doubles
and Chrishae being a phenomenal scorer, they have a great upside. I'm excited
for both of their futures and this program. I hope we can stay together.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2014

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [DeNesha Stallworth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24892)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  71  
Kentucky  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Mitchell and then open
it up for questions.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, just extremely proud of our team. They had a great
tournament and worked really hard. Just couldn't be prouder of how they came
together. Just lost a real tough game today.  
I wouldn't trade locker rooms, I can tell you that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jordan Reynolds hasn't been one of Tennessee's most prominent players
this year, but comment on her play down the stretch.  
COACH MITCHELL: She did a good job. We didn't have good coverage. We'd done
such a good job on such a lot of stuff, they went to a high, flat ball screen.
That's my fault for not having the players know what to do there.  
She did a nice job and she's a good player.  
  
Q. Talk us through the free throw, what you wanted to happen there.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were down four. We felt like the only chance we had
was either to make a three and foul or either get fouled on the three‑point
strike. You can make two, then miss one, get the rebound.  
We felt like we still had a chance. So we just had run the play a couple
times, and it worked really well. Got their player up in the air. We were
trying to make the first two and miss the third one. Like I told Jen, we don't
practice missing enough. We didn't miss it, we made it, so...  
Been times we tried to miss it, we made it.  
That's what we were trying to do, get an offensive board and tie the game up.  
  
Q. You scored to go up 59 ‑54 with 5:27 and had two field goals the rest of
the game.   
COACH MITCHELL: Tennessee defense, they got real physical, started riding us
out of the lane. We didn't respond well. We just didn't execute well. That's
100% on me. I'm in charge of the execution.  
It just was a tough, tough game. We just never could get the offensive glass
today. I thought that really, really hurt us.  
Yeah, we were trying. We tried hard. They got real, real, real, real physical
down at the end of the game. We just weren't able to respond to that well
enough.  
  
Q. Coach, now that this one is over, you start to put it behind you, look
towards the NCAAs. Can you speak about preparing your team for that
tournament.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, the good thing for us is we've become a team, so we have
a team heading into the NCAA tournament. That's what we needed to be to have a
chance to get to the Final Four. I think we've accomplished that.  
Now I'm really excited about the NCAA tournament. A lot of people thought we
were dead in the water. We're not. We're here and we're ready to roll. I'm
glad I'm coaching Kentucky.  
  
Q. What did the officials talk to you about on the two double technicals in
a row? How much did you feel like that changed the flow of the game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Changed it a lot. I was talking to them before that, that 11
for Tennessee was starting that kind of activity in the game. If you don't get
control of that, you get competitive players going, I mean, our players wanted
to win today, but we certainly don't want that kind of activity going on.  
So it's not the first time that's happened with that player. So you watch
film. You see how players act. So I noticed it early on. It's a loud arena.
It's a tough game. I guess they didn't see it.  
But I kept talking to them. Finally it bowled over into what it was. Then you
get into double technicals. You're trying to figure out who said something
first. I'm pretty clear what was going on there. I hate our players lost
composure. But it's real, real difficult in this kind of competitive
environment. It should be stopped at the beginning of the activity.
Unfortunately today it was not.  
So I'm proud of our players and how they conducted themselves. But I was very
disappointed in how that affected the game. I think it could have been stopped
much earlier than it boiling over and affecting the game. Certainly got
Samarie upset. Then DeNesha tried to have composure and walk away from the
second incident.  
That's not what I wanted to see in the SEC championship game. I'd rather see
two teams play, not have a bunch of talking, yapping, unsportsmanlike conduct,
but that's what it ended up being.  
  
Q. After a game like that, what do you say to them in the locker room?  
COACH MITCHELL: Proud to coach 'em. Proud to coach 'em. Wouldn't trade locker
rooms right now with anybody in the country. Proud to coach 'em.  
Everybody had us in the coffin and throwing dirt on top of it when we left
Gainesville. Our team has become a team. I don't know what they could have
done other than their coach help them guard a flat ball screen better down the
stretch, just get more physical maybe in the last three or four minutes.  
But it's a great, great feeling to be coaching Kentucky right now because
that's a bunch of players that are very upset, very down. They gave it
everything they had to win the tournament. We came up one point short.  
  
Q. What is your expectation as far as your seeding for the next
tournament?  
COACH MITCHELL: I'm the worst person in the world to ask because I don't pay
attention to any of that because I have zero control over it. We've had our
hands full trying to become a team. So I don't have any idea.  
Somebody told us they had us at a four. I think that's a joke. I don't think
we're a four. Other than that, that would be my only opinion. I guess I would
say we're not a four.  
But I don't have any control over the seeding, so maybe we'll be a four. Maybe
we'll be a five.  
But I'll tell you this, I'm glad I'm coaching Kentucky going to the NCAA
tournament. I don't know if anybody will be jumping for joy if they get the
Wildcats in the first round.  
  
Q. You brought your teams here the last few years and haven't quite been
able to get over the hump. What's missing at this point?  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't know that anything was missing today other than they
came up one point better than us.  
I can't tell you how much respect I have for the Southeastern Conference, to
be a member of it, to get to compete in it. I can't tell you how much respect
I have for this tournament. It's real special to all of us at Kentucky. Our
players wanted to win it bad.  
I don't know what was missing. Didn't look like a lot. We just came up one
point short today.  
  
Q. DeNesha, do you try to use this as something to motivate you going
forward? How quickly do you feel like you can put something like this behind
you?  
DeNESHA STALLWORTH: Definitely it's a motivation. Like coach said, it was a
great day for us to come together. Regardless of what happened on the court,
we stuck together. That's just the most important thing.  
Just going to the NCAA tournament, everybody is focused. We just have to focus
on the task at hand, and that's going to the Final Four. We're just taking it
one day at a time and, like I said, just staying together.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  71  
Kentucky  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Warlick.  
COACH WARLICK: Just say a great game with two I think very athletic teams. My
hat is off to Kentucky. Both teams battled. It was a great competition.  
I'm proud of these young ladies. We fought back all year and throughout this
tournament. We talk a lot about grinding. I think that's what we did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about your performance about four and a half minutes
left, big three ‑point play.   
JORDAN REYNOLDS: Well, I was just thinking in the moment. We worked too hard
not to back down now. We got all the way here. It was a hard‑fought battle.  
I was just trying to help my team out the best that I could.  
  
Q. Emotions were running high. Talk about where it got chippy in there,
tangles. What were you trying to do? I'm sure nobody was trying to hurt
somebody else.  
COACH WARLICK: Did she hurt somebody?  
CIERRA BURDICK: No, I don't remember making contact with anybody.  
It's a physical game. It's physical basketball. It's SEC basketball. One of
the most physical conferences in the country. We compete. That's what we're
going to do day in and day out.  
Chippiness happens. It happens. This is basketball. It happens every single
day. I think the refs did a fine job of avoiding any altercations. Nothing
happened.  
Words were said, but words are words. No actions took place.  
  
Q. Holly, you won an SEC championship as a point guard. How does this feel
first as a head coach?  
COACH WARLICK: It's very, very special, it really is. You got to have players
making plays. It's about talent, I promise you that. You got to have players
step up. I think everybody stepped up. Jordan stepped up and got us ahead.
Cierra had some big rebounds. You can keep going down the line.  
Thankful that I have this opportunity. It's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Holly, you trailed by double ‑digits in each of the three games. Talk
about the resiliency of this team.   
COACH WARLICK: Well, hour halftime talks are very interesting. I would really
like to lead by double‑digits early if we could. I just think it speaks of our
resilience.  
We try to make practice as hard as we can. We talk a lot in the timeouts about
drills that we've run and stops that we need to get. We just keep going back
to things that we've already worked on.  
I think they pull from that. Like Cierra said, they're competitive. Everybody
is. But they've got a little bond here going together and a trust for each
other that is really strong. I attribute to them stepping up, not caring who
gets the credit, who makes the play, but did you make a play and did you win.  
I just would like them to step up a little earlier than, what, seven or eight
minutes to go in each game. I wouldn't be as hoarse and look as bad as I do
(laughter).  
  
Q. Isabelle, it was getting really rough in the paint in the second half.
How did you keep your emotions contained and ride that to victory today?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think the most important thing we did today was stayed
together. There were times there was confusion, but at the end of the day we
consistently talked to each other, no matter whether it was what defense we
were going to be in. We were always talking to each other. There wasn't a
moment that we were quiet on the court.  
Out of everything, the aggressiveness has really helped us.  
  
Q. Holly, Matthew said he sensed tension rising and he had spoken to the
refs before. Did you see things rising? The game was called much tighter
afterwards. Did you have to make any adjustments for that?  
COACH WARLICK: I didn't foresee anything happen before those technicals. I did
not. I thought the officials made the right call. I mean, I don't know if it
got tighter or not. Of course, I want every foul called. I'm acting crazy.  
But I think they do their job. They're human. It's a difficult job. I didn't
feel that. I just wanted us to compete, and I thought that's what we were
doing.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys just won this tournament. Most people think the SEC is
probably the best league in the country. Speak a little bit about how the
strength of this league, the grind every time you play a team, is going to
prepare you and have you ready for the NCAA tournament.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it is a grind. You look at Kentucky's record. That does
not show how strong that team is. You look at LSU. That does not show how
strong that team is. You can just go down the line. Florida. Georgia has 20
wins. It's a battle every night, every night. We go to Ole Miss, we go to
Mississippi. Everywhere we went this year, it was a battle. We were nervous to
go up to Missouri. They beat us up there.  
I think it's an unbelievable conference. You look at the record. You look at
what people have done. We got beat twice on our home court. For us, we feel it
shouldn't happen, but it happened to two very good teams.  
I think we've got great coaching and we've got great athletes who compete.
This conference for women's basketball is special. It has been. I think we
recognize that it's going to continue to be.  
  
Q. 53% for Kentucky first half, 31% in the second. Talk about your
defense.  
COACH WARLICK: We weren't very good defensively the first half consistently.
We talked about that at halftime, just getting stops. We started the game in a
zone and we weren't very good, we went to man. We were okay.  
But I think we gathered ourselves at halftime and talked a lot about getting
stops and locking your player up. We were concerned with Nae Nae Harper who
had a great game, great series, and Jennifer O'Neill, too. Obviously I think
we were kind of worried about everybody.  
We gathered ourselves. We relied on each other to get stops and rebounds.
That's what we talked about.  
  
Q. Given what you said about how tough this conference is, given the fact
that all the pundits have been put back on their heels with what's gone on in
the other conference tournaments, do you think Tennessee has a case to make
for a one seed? If so, what would it be?  
COACH WARLICK: I would think so. I think this is the toughest conference in
the country. I would think if you win the tournament, you would get an
opportunity to have a number one seed.  
Of course, I can't control what the NCAA thinks. But I think we've come on
strong at the end of the year. You can make a case for South Carolina, as
well.  
I think we've put ourselves out there to give us the opportunity to.  
  
Q. Expand on winning your first SEC tournament as a head coach. Pretty good
way to start. This is what's expected at Tennessee. Does it feel that much
different than when you were a player, an assistant coach?  
COACH WARLICK: It is an expectation. I tell these kids every day, it's
expected. When you don't win an SEC regular season, it's a disappointment.  
But this is obviously special to me because it's my first one. But I've been
involved in so many and was very fortunate to have the chance to coach with
Pat Summitt. They all felt special.  
With this team, what I think they've put out there, what they've been through,
just the sacrifices they've made, I'm obviously happy for myself, but I just
love that these guys get to experience it.  
We talk a lot about it. They're part of our history. We talk a lot about the
history, the tradition. They've put themselves as a part of our tradition and
history, so...  
  
Q. Isabelle, talk about being named tournament MVP, what that means to
you.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I mean, my freshman year I didn't really play much. Last
year I was out, so I didn't play again. I mean, this year I just really wanted
to go in with a different mindset, do whatever it took for us to get this win.  
Honestly, I never really thought something like that would ever happen to me.
It helped me a lot because my teammates helped me get there. That's just
something that I've seen every time we win something like this. Freshman year
we all had each other's back, too. I'm glad we were able to carry it out this
year.  
COACH WARLICK: I think Izzy, we talk a lot about doing work in the off‑season.
Izzy was injured last year, didn't play a lot as a freshman. This summer
everybody stayed in school. Izzy went that extra mile, worked out with her
brother. She put in the time.  
I think Izzy herself deserves a lot of credit because she's put in the work,
she's battled. I can't tell you how many shots she's taken on a post move or
in free throws and that.  
I'm just really proud of her because just seeing the result of time put in.
Just really proud of her for being the MVP of the tournament.  
  
Q. For the student ‑athletes, if there were one snapshot or scrapbook moment
you were going to take away from the tournament experience, what would it be
and why?   
ISABELLE HARRISON: My snapshot would be...  
CIERRA BURDICK: I'll go. I think there was 11 seconds left in the game. We all
huddled together. I mean, there was no room for any space. It was all 11 of
us, all four coaches. I just remember thinking in my head, This is what it's
all about.  
Since I've been here, I've never been on a closer team than this team right
here. Just the relationship that we have with our coaches, the relationship
that we have with our teammates. I don't think there's a closer team out there
in this country. I really mean that.  
I think that moment really spoke for how strong we are as a unit. It was like
you couldn't push us because we were just all standing together as one. That
moment I knew we were going to win the game. It was that moment.  
JORDAN REYNOLDS: Cierra took mine so I'm going to have to think about mine.  
I would say, just because this is my first time, just being here, getting off
the bus and being able to be in this SEC tournament with these guys. We worked
so hard off‑season, regular season, just during practices all the time. We
worked so hard to stay together. It just shows.  
I would say my snapshot moment would be just getting here.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: My snapshot would have to be me and Dean's talks before
each game before we got here. He's my post coach. Since I've been here, Dean
has honestly had the most faith in me no matter what was going on. I'm just
blessed I was able to share this experience with him because he really had my
back with everything.  
COACH WARLICK: Mine was seeing these kids put their hats on and smiling and
getting under the confetti, holding up that trophy. It was great to see, great
to see.  
  
Q. Cierra, what went through your mind when you fouled on that three
‑pointer? Looked like you might lose it right there.   
CIERRA BURDICK: I was on the verge of losing it (laughter). But I'm an
emotional player. I think I play with my emotions on my sleeve. A lot of times
my teammates and my coaches, especially Coach Elzy, told me I needed to come
back. They always tell me to play in fast forward.  
I was mad at myself for fouling. It was a dumb play on my part. I looked at my
teammates. They helped me keep my head high. They told me we were going to win
this game. I definitely wouldn't have been able to do it without Bash, Izzy,
Dray, and Meig, telling me it was going to be all right, that we were going to
win.  
I was distraught, I was, but they had my back. That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Holly, Matthew had some discussion about their seeding going forward. He
said he saw somewhere they were a four seed currently. What would you make of
something like that?  
COACH WARLICK: That's crazy. I don't know. Like I said, I know he doesn't, and
I don't have control over the seeding. I would hope that you would look at
where Kentucky's at right now, how hard they're playing, what they've done.  
They just knocked off supposedly a South Carolina, No.1 seed. I think they're
better than a No.4 seed. I don't get it.  
They have a system in the NCAA, and we follow it. But I don't see that. I
really don't.  
  
Q. Isabelle, after you walked up on the podium, you screamed out
'Nashville.'  
ISABELLE HARRISON: We need to have an aggressive mindset on defense. When we
play our best defense, we're unstoppable, honestly. When we don't focus on the
offensive end, we're good, we're going to make our shots.  
I think we need to have the same mindset that we had here, that we're going to
be in the final game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you update Massengale? How close was she for her tournament?  
COACH WARLICK: She was not going to play in this tournament. It's day‑to‑day.
We're waiting on her to be headache‑free. I mean, I'm sitting here and I would
anticipate she may be back for the tournament. But, you know, she's still a
part of our team. We want her back.  
But I cannot say enough about Andraya Carter and Jordan Reynolds, how they've
stepped up and what they've done. We've been tough on those two in practice,
before Massengale ever got hurt. Really tough on 'em just to prepare for
something that may happen. It may or may not. We've put them in situations
where they've had to run their team while Massengale was here. I think you're
seeing two young ladies step up and take up the slack for Massengale, who was
leading us in scoring.  
We hope she's back. I think our number one concern for her is her health, her
long‑term health. So she's still very much a part of this team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you all.

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Aleigsha Welch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23260)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  68  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from coach an then open it up for
questions.  
COACH STALEY: Obviously we're disappointed in losing the basketball game, but
more disappointed in how we played. This is the first I've seen our team play
this poorly all season long. Obviously the first half was one that we couldn't
recover from.  
But we got a few weeks to think about how we get back on track.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Looking at the stats, you didn't play that bad. It's just that initial 12
‑2 run seemed to be too much. What was Kentucky doing to take you out of your
comfort zone?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think they did anything different than they normally do.
I think it was all us. It was all us making really uncharacteristic decisions
with the basketball. It came from everywhere.  
It was not just one person. It came from mainly our starting five, with the
exception of Elem. She really didn't have the ball to make decisions. When she
did, she put the ball in the hole.  
  
Q. Coach, you've not only been one of the best field goal shooting teams in
the country, but you're also the most improved this year over last. In the
first half, I would have thought the problem was shooting, but it wasn't, it
was the turnovers. Address how you got to that improvement and why so many
turnovers.  
COACH STALEY: We agonized through all of them.  
How we did it? Our focus has always been working inside out. When we're able
to work inside out, we are a very efficient basketball team. When we stray
away from that, you get results like today.  
We got to figure out a way in which to come back and play the basketball that
we're accustomed to playing, which is work inside out. It works.  
Our post players I think were 7‑9 or 10 in the first half. At halftime we
wanted to just continue to work the ball inside. That just didn't happen at
the pace that we need in order for us to win basketball games.  
  
Q. The disappointment is obviously there right now. What do you tell your
team to keep their spirits up? A lot left in the season to go.  
COACH STALEY: I don't really want their spirits up at this point. They need to
feel the disappointment of this loss. They need to feel our performance,
because if we perform this way again, it will be a huge disappointment to our
season.  
  
Q. It seemed like every time you would throw the ball inside, they would
collapse on you, force you to think about kicking it back out. Is that what
y'all felt?  
ALEIGSHA WELCH: I think we were playing a little too fast. When we finally did
towards the end of the first half start to execute our game plan, I think
especially Elem and Alaina did a great job of finishing quick moves, putting
the ball in the hole, sparking a little run for us.  
I think for the most part our posts did a good job of not letting it affect
their shots when they got the ball in the paint.  
ELEM IBIAM: I think we did feel the pressure a little bit in the paint. We
were prepared for that. Our coaches talked about that.  
We executed the best we could, but it just didn't come out in our favor
tonight.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday that maybe the free ‑throw shooting was a little
bit part of playing in a strange gym. Going forward, how big of a concern is
that?   
COACH STALEY: It's a huge concern for us obviously the last two games. But we
got a few weeks to figure it out and try to rectify that.  
ELEM IBIAM: We shoot free throws every day in practice, so we're definitely
working on it. We just have to find consistency in the next game and find
consistency.  
ALEIGSHA WELCH: Just got to make them when it counts, especially me. I'm going
to be going to the free‑throw line 10 times a game, just got to lock in and
make them when it counts. We really can't afford to miss ‑ especially me ‑
timely free throws the way I did tonight.  
  
Q. I know you haven't talked about it a lot all season, but looking at a
potential No.1 seed for the NCAAs, do you think you've done enough to grab
it?  
COACH STALEY: At this point I have no idea. It's hard for me to project that
sitting here and not being able to accomplish one of the goals of winning the
SEC tournament championship.  
It really is out of our control at this point. We had control of it if we were
to keep winning. At this point I can't even elaborate on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2014

  

### [Linnae Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26552)

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [DeNesha Stallworth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24892)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  68  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Mitchell and
then open it up for questions.  
COACH MITCHELL: Really proud of our players today. They just played a
tremendous game against a very, very good team. South Carolina is an
outstanding team. Very well‑coached. They have great players.  
You had to play well in this game, and our players did. So real proud of them.
We're excited to be in the championship tomorrow. Intend on getting prepared
to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 12 ‑2 start to the game, how important that was.
  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I just thought the players really listened to what our
plan was, and that was to be in attack mode all day. That was the word that we
wanted to rule the day for us. Don't worry about the outcome, the result, just
get in attack mentality and stay there.  
I thought you saw a heavy dose of that early in the game. We were able to
sustain it for 40 minutes. It was really impressive. I'm extremely proud of
the players. This is a great effort.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the way you took care of the basketball today. Only
four turnovers.  
COACH MITCHELL: They just did a really nice job of keeping their poise. We
probably had more poise and patience today than I've seen in a long time. We
didn't have that in Lexington. We had a lot of quick shots, South Carolina
really put it to us. That was the key to the game.  
It's just a different way for us to get the turnover margin where we wanted
it. We took care of it. We turned them over 16 times, took care of it. That
plus 11 in turnover margin, you're in pretty good shape in a game if you can
get that.  
  
Q. You've won seven of the last eight. What does this say about your team
since that 5 ‑5 start?   
COACH MITCHELL: It says a whole lot. It says a lot about what kind of kids
they are, what kind of character they truly have. I've said it many times. We
could have gone several different ways than the way we've gone.  
So I'm really, really happy about today. But I do want to stay focused on what
we came down here to do, and that's to win the championship.  
I think no matter what happens tomorrow, they've done an outstanding job of
pulling it together in difficult circumstances when things weren't going how
any of us had planned.  
I would really be happy for them if they can prepare and finish the job
tomorrow.  
  
Q. DeNesha, the rebounding margin in Lexington, you called it embarrassing
at one point. What kind of motivation did you walk into this game?  
DeNESHA STALLWORTH: A lot of motivation. We knew that the way we performed in
Lexington was not our best. We just wanted to leave it all out there, no
regrets, no matter the outcome.  
Every single one of us, we left it out there. All credit to my team because we
did a fantastic job.  
  
Q. There was a moment late in the second half when you were crouched on the
sidelines almost in a prayerful pose. What was going through your mind? Can
you speak to Linnae's performance off the bench tonight.  
COACH MITCHELL: I was in deep prayer at the time. I can't share with you why I
was in deep prayer, but I was in deep prayer at the time, trying to get myself
ready to coach those final minutes.  
It was a tough call. The officials really worked hard today. It was a very
physical game. So I was just really wanting to win so bad. At that point in
time I was just trying to, you know, clear my mind of any upset feelings that
I had about a call or whatever was going on. I really tried to get to where I
could coach the last couple minutes there.  
Linnae was really, really tough today. She really played with poise. The two
freshmen have come so far with their defense. I thought she was a really good
defender today. I was really proud of her defense. She just played a terrific
game.  
You know, I thought she was sort of a great example of the entire team. We
played with a tremendous amount of poise and toughness. We got down to the
last seconds of shot clocks a few times and made buckets. So it was a terrific
performance. I was real proud of Linnae today. She played a great game.  
  
Q. I don't want to put you on the spot, but is that something you do often,
turn to prayer during a game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, as a matter of fact it is something I do often.  
  
Q. Linnae, can you talk about your mindset today.  
LINNAE HARPER: Really our coach, he just made big emphasis on attacking the
zone. I think that was my whole mindset, to attack the entire game. I just
took what the defense gave me and attacked the whole game.  
  
Q. Y'all didn't let them any closer than eight points from about 6:47 in the
first half on. Talk about that.  
DeNESHA STALLWORTH: We wanted it. I mean, at the end of the day we just wanted
to win. We knew that we couldn't, you know, have them come close. We tried to
answer back and play incredible defense even if they scored. Just get it back
on offense. Like Linnae said, stay in attack mode. They couldn't stop us when
we were in full force.  
  
Q. What kind of benefit does your team derive from the fact that either
opponent you play tomorrow you've beaten on their home court the last month of
the season?  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't know how much we'll even talk about that. I think what
we've done a nice job in the first two rounds is understanding what we needed
to do to be successful in the game.  
Whoever the opponent is, we'll figure out what we need to do to be successful
in that game, and we'll just focus on tomorrow.  
I told the players today, Don't spend any time in the past today, and don't
worry about the future either. Just stay right squarely focused on the play in
front of you. They did that today. That's what we'll need to do tomorrow, no
matter who we play.  
  
Q. Linnae, last time y'all played South Carolina, you only played five
minutes. Today you played 27 minutes. Do you think being able to sit back on
the bench and watch the South Carolina playing style helped you today?  
LINNAE HARPER: Yeah, I think it helped a lot. Just watching from the side,
seeing how they play, their defense, it was an advantage to me for today's
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Isabelle Harrison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25290)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  86  
Texas A&M  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Tennessee, coach and Cierra Burdick and
Isabelle Harrison. We'll begin with an opening comment from coach Warlick.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a battle. It was a grind. When we needed stops, we got
stops. We got three in a row. We just played hard. Both teams battled.  
We got big‑time rebounds. These young ladies were all over the boards. When
you get 26 points off second‑chance points, you're doing something really,
really, really good.  
So I'm really happy for this group and happy they get an opportunity to play
in the championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Things were tooth and nail. You got 11 straight points from your two
freshmen. Talk about the play of Jordan and Mercedes.  
COACH WARLICK: They've been solid. It's been a learning process for them. I
think the upperclassmen have really, really taken them under their wing and
kept them focused.  
I'll be honest, they're freshmen. They're having fun. They're just having fun.
I don't know if they know to be worried or concerned. But they came up big.  
Those two have been playing together for a very, very long time. I thought it
showed. I thought Jordan looked for Mercedes. I thought Jordan just did some
phenomenal things for us.  
  
Q. Cierra, you got behind against LSU and Texas A &M. Did it feel like this
was maybe a tougher comeback?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Yeah, it definitely did. I feel like once we got the momentum
going in LSU, we had it the rest of the game. It was free‑flowing. We were
playing some of our best basketball. We knew we were going to get that win.  
This game was a grind. Our motto has been 'grind for nine.' It's been that
since day one.  
I commend my team. We continue to battle through adversity. We're so tight. We
never get rattled. We just continue to stay composed, play our game, stay
together.  
  
Q. You were down 15 yesterday and 10 today. What are the keys to staying
composed through those stretches?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: I think as a team we kind of understood that when people
play us, they're going to play their best basketball. Whatever happens, we
stay composed. Our huddles are tight. Y'all are going to get in this stance,
defensive things we have to do.  
I feel like we did a good job of composing ourselves throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you got the Texas A &M bigs in foul trouble early on. Talk about
how that changed the game.   
COACH WARLICK: We're an inside out team. We wanted to get the ball inside,
just kind of let our bigs go to work.  
I thought we attacked their big players. Obviously it did help us to get them
in foul trouble. But that's our game plan. We want to play inside out. When
they're hitting inside, it opens up the outside for us.  
They stuck to the game plan. They really did. Our defense could have been a
little bit better. We gave the two Courtneys 22 and 26. They're phenomenal.
They're great players.  
As we said earlier, within the four‑minute segment, we came up with three big
stops. To me that's the biggest part of the game besides the second‑chance
points.  
Texas A&M are solid. We had to give it our best shot.  
  
Q. Isabelle, y'all started getting the bigs in foul trouble. Do you feel
that's where y'all were able to start your comeback? Obviously it felt like a
home game here. Lots of orange. Is that help pushing y'all?  
ISABELLE HARRISON: It definitely helped us when their posts got in foul
trouble. We could go inside more. We can kick it back out to our guards. That
definitely helped us.  
The crowd environment out here is great. It really feels like we're at home.
The fans help us so much to stay in the game.  
  
Q. I know the foul trouble has been mentioned several times now. Your take
on how you actually managed to be so prolific on the backboards, do so much of
your work inside. You were taking the foul shots, not them?  
CIERRA BURDICK: We struggled with foul trouble early in the season. I think we
learned how the game is going to be called. We're seasoned in that area.  
We make our money off of rebounding. I think that's what separates us from
other teams in this league. We make it a priority. We do it every single day.
We crash as hard as we can.  
Dean always tells us, You got to crash 10 times out of 10. You may not get 10
of those boards, but you may get three or four, we try to keep that mindset.  
  
Q. Holly, you survived two games with Meighan Simmons' jump shot terribly
wayward. Do you think she puts too much pressure on herself in these
tournament games?  
COACH WARLICK: Probably so. I mean, she's a senior. I think she wants to do it
so much for this team.  
But I think you see the depth that we have as far as offensively being able to
score. We don't intentionally run a lot of things to Meighan. We want to get
the ball inside, play inside out.  
You know, I thought she for the most part got some good looks. I thought the
one in the corner, the three, she could have lined it up. It still didn't go
in. It wasn't her day. She stepped up and hit successful big free throws.  
I think this team understands that she may not have a good shooting night, but
I think they're so together and they play so hard together, they don't get
concerned that Meighan doesn't score. I don't think Meighan does, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, not to be overly critical, she really wants to do it as a team.
Tonight she got seven points from field goals out of 17 attempts, shooting
less than 18%. Your other people were shooting better.  
COACH WARLICK: When it's Meighan, you never know when she's going to get a hot
hand. She's been 0‑for‑something, then she gets a hot hand, ended up scoring
in the 20s.  
I'm not going to fault Meighan for taking shots. I think when we needed to get
the ball inside, we got the ball inside.  
That's her game. So everything we drew up in a timeout, we got it inside.
Meighan, I don't know how much she played. 33. I can live with that.  
  
Q. Holly, talk a little bit about tomorrow's game. This is the first time
the team has gotten back to the title game since 2012.  
COACH WARLICK: That was our goal, to get to the finals. Regardless of South
Carolina or Kentucky, we wanted to get in the championship game. I think these
young ladies all year have worked for this moment, really they have. They
worked hard. We've been hard on them, tough on them. Talk about rebounding. We
work on rebounding every day, every day. It's brutal. It is brutal drills,
rebounding every day.  
It doesn't just happen that they're in the championship game in what they do.
It's a battle.  
I'm very proud of them because it's a tough battle, and they step up. They
have the pressure on them, and now they get the opportunity to play in the
championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  86  
Texas A&M  77

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, make an opening comment, then we'll open it up for
questions.  
COACH BLAIR: The country just saw a championship basketball game. To play at
the level we played at and only turn the ball over seven times, the level that
Tennessee played at, that's what the SEC is all about. Same with the first
game with Kentucky and South Carolina.  
I hope you realize how good all four of us are going to be next year, how good
the league is going to be next year.  
The two CWs here, they put on a show. We had to do what we're capable of. When
the two touch fouls were called early on Karla, we didn't have that inside
presence. That's what really hurt us there. I had to protect her through the
second half. As a result, my backup post got four fouls I think in the first
half, but I had to play her.  
It's all part of the growing process. We've got to learn how to stay out of
foul trouble and play defense before our girl gets the ball, not after she
gets the ball.  
Our first‑shot defense was as good as anybody's. It's the second shot and the
third shot that we couldn't keep them off the boards. 26‑4 in second‑chance
points. That's got to stop.  
I heard that they work on rebounding every day. Well, maybe that's what the
rest of all of us in the country. But I've seen Tennessee rebound like that
ever since 1980. That's just a trademark. Give 'em credit. If I'm not
mistaken, you Tennessee folks can look in the record book, I might have the
record when I was at Arkansas. I think you had 39 offensive rebounds on me one
ballgame. I think I'm probably in the record book. I'm not proud of it.  
How about these three guards, along with Jordan Jones? Think about it. They're
just sophomores. You don't see them on any USA teams. They should have been.
They're pretty damn good. They know what a correct jump shot is all about.  
They know how to play hard. They were running on fumes because she could
rotate her bench in, and it was doing better. My bench didn't have their
normal good ballgame. That was 40 minutes and 39. It would have been 40
minutes for Jordan.  
But we've got to have that inside game. Hopefully when we get to the playoffs,
we'll have Karla out of foul trouble, maybe a little bit more mature Rachel in
there, then hopefully we can make a run this year.  
Last year we won it all here. We played well in Georgia. We played well here.
We've got nothing to hold our hats about. We played a damn good ballgame. They
played a better four minutes than we did at the end. But that four minutes,
the reason why it was tied at 75 was because of their rebounding. They did a
great job.  
Appreciate the effort. The crowd was good. Hospitality was good. The SEC
showed why the top four teams all showed up to play a championship game. I
hope Tennessee has a little bit left for tomorrow because Kentucky and
Tennessee, that's a classic matchup.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The score was definitely different than it was the first time you played
this season. What was different about this game? Courtney and Courtney
knocking down their shots?  
COACH BLAIR: I think getting off to a good start, scoring in transition,
making them miss early. Simmons didn't have a particularly good game. 3‑17\.
Walker was on her. She's a good free throw shooter. She's such a threat.  
The difference? We just played a whole lot better this time. First time around
in College Station, Tennessee came in with their A game, we came in with our C
game. Nothing in particular, the team just gets better.  
We're just the same team. Love my team. I'd love to see them again. We see
them again, that means we're probably in the Final Four. I'd love to play
Tennessee again.  
We got a lot of basketball and a lot of teaching to do before that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the touch fouls. The NCAA recently released the statistics
related to the change in rules and emphasis this year. They reflected there's
been a 1.5% improvement in field goal percentage, which was the purpose of
that. There's been more than a 10% increase in personal fouls and 15% in
disqualifications for personal fouls. Given what you just went through here
tonight, do you think the price has been too high for that small increase in
field goal shooting?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we're confusing the basketball fans, okay? If Texas A&M
is playing a members game on Saturday afternoon, they see the game completely
called one way, then on Sunday afternoon they see our game completely called a
different way, it's the growing pains we're going to have to have for the
first couple years, okay?  
But right now the fans are confused. That's when sometimes you get the touch
fouls. But really, they're letting the post players kill each other a lot of
times in there. They're more particular on keeping the thing.  
So the teams that win the Final Four are the same teams that won the Final
Four in 1980, L.A. Tech, Old Dominion, USC. You will win the Final Four on
smart guard play and post players being able to finish under there, and you
better have some backups. Their backups were a little bit better than mine
today.  
But were they touch fouls? They were not hand‑checking fouls, okay? I would
have to see the tape. You had good officials on the ballgame. At the same time
I think the officials are confused because I really believe once the NCAA
tournament starts, you're not going to see very many hand‑checking calls being
called.  
The better officials can call advantage, disadvantage. When you get deep in
the NCAA, you've eliminated all the medium officials. You've got nothing but
the best officials. They do a good job of controlling the game.  
We haven't had a problem in this whole tournament. This was a well‑called
basketball tournament. You haven't seen any technicals, coaches being
ballistic. There's no crying in basketball, unless you're a coach (laughter).  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that, you talked about the importance of the
rebounding. They were plus 22 on you in rebounding. You were plus 10 on the
personal fouls, most of them on your bigs. To what extent did the foul
situation contribute to the rebounding advantage?  
COACH BLAIR: My guards not blocking out from the high post. Here is another
thing that will really scare you. Look who was our leading rebounding? My
point guard was six. I didn't have another starter get five. The next closest
one was four, okay? That's on us. That's not on the officials. That's on us.
That's good for Tennessee for what they did.  
When your point guard is getting six defensive boards, she was tired. She
didn't block out a couple times. Carter hit a couple open jumpers on her.
That's the way it is.  
My kids were dead tired. I didn't have the depth to be able to rest them and
let Tennessee get out to a 10‑point game. I had to roll the dice. If we would
have won this ballgame, which I thought we were, I don't know what we would
have had left for tomorrow, but we might have had to borrow a few of you
sportswriters for tomorrow. I don't like that option at all because none of
you look athletic, have a jump shot. You just got a little pencil (laughter).  
  
Q. Either Courtneys, you had tremendous success on the road in the SEC, 7
‑1\. This being virtually a road game with the crowd so in favor of Tennessee,
did you feed off that?   
COURTNEY: We've been playing good on the road all season. I think it comes
with toughness, not worrying about the crowd really. We know here they had a
big crowd because they're close to Tennessee.  
We just tried to block the crowd out, play our game. When Jordan hit that big
three, our bench was over there cheering. They were cheering the whole game.
That's good. That's our crowd.  
COACH BLAIR: You're seeing 80% zone defenses across the country because of the
new rules. That's why your shooting percentage is up. It has nothing to do
with hand‑checking. We're so worried about fouls, it's the openness. It's the
zone defenses. That's why you're going to shoot better.  
Why do we shoot better? It's because we take the threes we need to take.
That's the most threes we've shot probably in two months, 12. We want to
attack the elbows and try to get that second chance in case we do miss.  
  
Q. First time since 2007 you aren't in a conference championship game. Talk
about switching conferences, still playing Texas A &M basketball from
conference to conference.   
COACH BLAIR: First, go back to 2006. We've been in a semifinal game now for
nine straight years. That's a pretty damn good record, too. So, yeah, we're
not in the championship game. That hurts. But, baby, we help decide who wins
it because that's who we are.  
Switching leagues, they were both good leagues, okay? Why does one league have
to be better, unless you're talking about football? Why does one league have
to be better?  
The Big 12 was good during our time because that was during the Griner era,
Kelsey Bone, Danielle Adams, all the great players. Now look how good the
league is going to be next year.  
You see what South Carolina has recruited? Kentucky? I've got another 6'5"
coming in that's going to be pretty doggone good.  
This league is going to get better and better, the way it was from '93 to '03.
That's when you had six Hall of Fame coaches. These coaches are working hard
on the recruiting trips.  
It doesn't matter who's the best or who has the highest RPI. Who is going to
get it done in the playoffs? Then you've got bragging rights.  
  
Q. First time you guys aren't in a final in a few years. With that being
said, your season is not over yet, with the NCAAs ahead of you. What do you
tell your team now that the conference tournament is done? How do you get them
ready for the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: First, this was the NCAAs. This is the way we played this whole
tournament. We play it because this is the type of teams that you're going to
have to beat to get to the Final Four or to be able to beat in the Sweet 16.
Who we see, this is NCAAs.  
If you go in with that mindset, it takes nine games to win it all. We're going
to try to do it. I remember a couple years ago, Jim Calhoun did 11 because he
had to win five, then he had to win six to win it all.  
We're going to go back. First we're going to rest. Hopefully Jordan is going
to be okay. She was dehydrated. She got hit in the head. The doctors come
running and all that stuff. But, hey, she'll be ready to go.  
We have spring break next week. The regular students are on spring break.
We'll be in the gym trying to rest up, get smarter by watching video, work on
the skill set, the little things, try to develop my bench during this time.  
We'll be ready 'cause we're hosting again for the third year in a row. We're
very proud of it. Why are we hosting? We put butts in seats and we know how to
host championships. Our administration does a great job. Hopefully we'll have
another six, seven, eight thousand coming up, whoever we're going to play. I
hope they let me choose who we're going to play, but probably not.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  75  
Florida  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Mitchell.  
COACH MITCHELL: Terrific game for us. Florida played really, really hard. They
have a very good basketball team. Beat us twice this year. Our players have
worked really hard to improve since the last time we played them. So it was
very gratifying to win this game and also to shake off a very poor first half.  
I thought the players showed a lot by coming back in the second half, finding
a way to win. We are thrilled with this outcome today and looking forward to
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Early in the first half, DeNesha went out with two fouls. You end the
first half down. In the locker room how much did you talk about getting
DeNesha started in the second half?  
COACH MITCHELL: We talked about our post play in general. I thought we sort of
stepped back from the challenge in the first half. We didn't have a lot of
toughness in the post in the second half of the first half. I just didn't
think we were competing very hard in the paint. I thought Florida was much
tougher in the first half.  
We didn't talk about individually DeNesha. We talked about toughness in the
post, that you had to be patient but really, really tough. I thought our play
on the interior really stepped up and battled there and played tougher in the
second half. We made some real tough buckets.  
  
Q. Obviously early in the season y'all lost to Florida twice. What do you do
mentally and physically to prepare?  
COACH MITCHELL: We learned a lot in the second game when Florida really took
it to us in Gainesville. It's almost a month ago. We went to work on our
transition defense, which I thought was much better today.  
We held them to 16 fewer points, so I thought our overall defense was better
than it was in Gainesville.  
It was after that game that we really tried to sit down and figure out which
way we were going to go. They've done a lot of hard work since that Sunday in
Gainesville. I'm real proud of them. It's great to see a tangible result.  
It wouldn't have mattered today whether you won or lost the game. The players
worked really hard to make changes and improve. But it sure is satisfying to
get a tangible result of beating a team that's beaten you twice. We certainly
learned a lot from those games this year.  
  
Q. The game was tied at 53. You had a stretch where Makayla and Linnae
either scored or assisted on eight straight points. For a coach, is it hard to
trust freshmen in a tournament game like that?  
COACH MITCHELL: Their result today was because they've been working so hard
and they're extremely talented.  
Florida is a difficult team to defend. Schematically against man‑to‑man,
they're so active and take advantage of their personnel, it's hard to play
defense against them. It's also hard to stay in the zone because they have
such three‑point shooters, evidenced by their 10 made threes today.  
Defensively this is a challenging game. I've said before those two players
have worked hard on their defense and I thought they had some good moments
there. They are offensively very gifted.  
I thought the pass that Makayla made to DeNesha in transition really energized
our team. I thought it was a game‑changing play. That's a talented player that
made that play on both ends. I thought the freshmen were a big lift to us
today, no question about it.  
  
Q. You talked about beating a team that you lost to twice. You have the same
scenario coming up tomorrow with South Carolina. What do you need to do
differently in this one?  
COACH MITCHELL: We have to play better defense than we did in Lexington. We
didn't have a good defensive night at all. South Carolina really took it to us
that night.  
We're going to have to battle a lot harder. I think this team has worked
really hard since that game as well. It's going to be a really tough game, and
we just have to get our minds ready to battle for 40 minutes.  
Credit our team today, that's what they did. We were not looking real good at
halftime. They just came out and really fought hard.  
This is a real tough tournament to win. I think toughness is at a premium in
this tournament. That's what we'll talk to our players about from now until
whenever we tip off tomorrow. We need to get ourselves ready to be the tougher
team.  
  
Q. DeNesha, you're running out of time in your career. How frustrating was
it to be out for the first half?  
DeNESHA STALLWORTH: It was very frustrating. But my assistant coaches and
Coach Mitchell did a great job of telling me to just stay in the game, not
think. That really helped me in the second half.  
In the past, I'd probably get frustrated and check out. I knew my team needed
me, so I just stayed strong.  
  
Q. You mentioned Wednesday that because you haven't been able to rely on the
press, there's more challenges. As a coach, is it harder to coach because you
don't have the press to rely on?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think it's different to prepare and it's a different
preparation clearly. When we had the press, you didn't really have to focus a
lot on set plays because you took them out of that. Now scouting is much more
important. It is for our players. That's what I credit them for. They've come
in and worked really hard to play a different style. They had to do that in
the middle of a season.  
That's not their fault, that's my fault. To their credit, they've responded to
the challenge. I thought we had some very, very aggressive and active
possessions in the 2‑3 zone today, and they've been working hard at that and
will continue to get better at that.  
But we had some good, good stretches defensively. Giving up 70 points, I don't
know if you'd call that great defense, but it was certainly opportunistic
defense today and I was really proud of our team, how they played.  
  
Q. Kind of a personal reflection about your success spawning a new day at
Ole Miss. Taking you back to when you first got to Kentucky, dominated by
men's basketball, football, women's team not on anyone's radar. Last season
you are scrapping with UConn in the NCAA tournament. Talk about your journey,
who you give credit to. You can give credit to yourself in that.  
COACH MITCHELL: It's been fantastic here at Kentucky. We've accomplished a
lot. I give the credit to all the folks that have come in day after day,
really worked hard. The players just give so much to us. They're up very early
in the morning during the summertime when a lot of people are sleeping in.
They're sacrificing so much different opportunities a normal student gets to
enjoy.  
Really it's been the players who have made it happen. Really, really proud to
be at a place like Kentucky that values women's basketball. They've given us a
great, great opportunity to be a good program. We're trying to become the
best.  
So a lot of people have worked hard to get us to the point where we are now.
I'm real grateful to be coaching there.  
  
Q. After both the Florida losses, I think all three of you said that you
didn't show poise down the stretch. At what point did you feel like you were
showing some poise in this game? Was that a difference ‑maker for you?   
JENNIFER O'NEILL: I felt like we showed a little bit of poise when DeNesha got
her second foul and we knew she wasn't going to be able to come back in the
game.  
The way we responded in the second half showed how much we had going into the
locker room, keeping each other together. Writing down points of improvement,
points we were doing good, and everybody speaking. That's the first time I
heard everybody say something. From that moment, you could just tell that
people were listening to what Matthew was saying about having poise, playing
for the first four or five minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Isabelle Harrison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25290)

### [Meighan Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24840)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  77  
LSU  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Warlick.  
COACH WARLICK: It's a 40‑minute game. We kept telling our young ladies that.
It was a battle. It was a grind. LSU was a lot to handle. They played
yesterday, played today. They put it all out there.  
But proud of these young ladies. We finally settled in and got stops when we
needed to. It was a very good win for us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Even down to the middle of the second half things weren't going your way.
To what would you attribute the turnaround?  
COACH WARLICK: We talked a lot about our defense. We gave up seven threes. You
can't do that. I thought the second half when we made our run, we didn't give
up any threes. We made them take difficult shots.  
We talk a lot about our defensive play. This is an attest to them
understanding why it was so important because that's why we got back into the
game.  
We had steals, we stole the ball from the point guard, shot a lot of layups.
When you get steals, you get great looks.  
We hadn't hit a three in I can't tell you when. We were 0‑8, I think. That
wasn't our game today. It was defense and rebounding and getting all over the
boards. I thought that's what we did today.  
  
Q. You were down by 6 at halftime despite shooting 34%. How much does that
tie into the offensive rebounding?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I thought the first half we didn't get the ball inside. I
thought we had an advantage there. I thought we took some ill‑advised shots
the first half. When we cut it, we went into halftime and talked about getting
the ball inside and making sure that we got all over the boards.  
We just weren't getting good looks. We pounded the ball inside. It kind of
opened up the outside for us.  
We talked about ‑ as we always do ‑ just rebounding and defense, so...  
  
Q. Isabelle, talk about the challenge of playing against someone like
Plaisance. Also, you seemed to get stronger as the game went along. Talk about
that.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: Going against TP, she's a great player. She can play
outside and inside. Being in the post, sometimes it's hard to adjust to
players like that. I really wanted to get focused. I knew when she was going
off, I made a commitment to myself and the team that I was going to lock her
down.  
  
Q. Isabelle, there aren't many teams anywhere that can match up with
Tennessee's height and inside presence. LSU is one of them. Talk about the
physicality of the game.  
ISABELLE HARRISON: They're a physical team. But being a post, things happen.
As a post, you have to be that tough player. You have to be the person to take
the hit, not let it frustrate you.  
Playing against LSU, it was tough. We battled. I think our posts were standing
strong.  
  
Q. Coach, just the way you won the game, how you closed so strong, how does
that carry over to tomorrow's game? Also, how did the crowd factor into this
one?  
COACH WARLICK: The crowd was huge. They're always big for us. They don't ever
give up. I think we feed a lot off the crowd.  
But we knew it was going to be a grind. The first game for us is always very
hard. I know I in particular was concerned just because we haven't been on the
floor, we didn't get a chance to shoot in the arena.  
It's really difficult I think the first game. Once you get that under your
belt, hopefully it's smoother for us.  
Let me talk about Plaisance. She's a difficult person to defend because she
can step out and hit the three, she can duck in, she can post up. She handles
the ball. It was a challenge for us.  
I thought when we needed stops, I thought our post players stepped up and got
big stops. I mean, a credit to her. She's a heck of a player.  
  
Q. Meighan, you started 1 ‑11\. What was that like for you to kind of come
back after a slow start?  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: To be honest with you, the coaches were getting on me about
continuing to shoot the ball. Holly was telling me to get it on the defensive
end, stay within the system.  
Finally after a while, I got a couple steals, some assists later on in the
game, some good defensive stops later on.  
No matter what, sure you're going to continue to shoot. I was very proud about
how my teammates stepped up they lifted me when I got down on myself, when I
felt like I wasn't doing things right. They just stayed on me and told me I
needed to be out there to lead them and help out.  
I feel that's what I did. I played within the system, played my role today.  
COACH WARLICK: She was probably harder on herself for missing a free throw
than she was all her other shots.  
MEIGHAN SIMMONS: I really was.  
  
Q. Does this game speak to Meighan's development as a player? In the past an
off ‑shooting night might have put her off, but tonight she played great
defense in the second half.   
COACH WARLICK: I think that's a fair and good statement. I think Meighan's
game has just continued to grow. Now she's a complete player. Meighan is a
great scorer for us. We're not going to tell her not to shoot the basketball.
When she's not in her rhythm, we're going to get her to spread the ball
around.  
But I just think she focuses. Right now she plays within the team. She
understands the importance of the defensive end. It's a mindset for Meighan.
She's one of the best defenders on the ball. When she puts her mind to it,
she's a tough defender.  
I'm proud of her. This year she's really developed her game. She understands
that her teammates can help her. I think that's what they've done.  
  
Q. Do you think you could have won this game early in the SEC season when
you weren't playing this well, this kind of game?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we lost to LSU our first game in the SEC, so probably
not.  
I think this team has learned to be resilient. They've got a mindset right now
that they're never out of the game. I don't know. They kind of bow up a little
bit when they're behind. I wish they would do that when we're ahead. It would
save me a lot of stress and yelling.  
You're seeing a result of this team staying together this summer, making a
commitment, going to summer school both sessions. We've had to step up. We
lost Ariel. I'm going to tell you what, Andraya Carter and Jordan Reynolds
were huge today. They would not have done that had they not had the experience
and support of the rest of the team.  
Probably the answer to your question is no, but I think it's been a learning
process. I think this team understands the importance of playing together,
sticking to a game plan and knowing that this staff is going to try to put
them in the best possible situation to score and win the basketball game.  
They're just so resilient. I sometimes don't know how they do it.  
  
Q. You brought up Andraya Carter. How much faith do you have in her?  
COACH WARLICK: I think Andraya, she gets better and better each game. Here is
the deal. Andraya is a competitor. She leads by example. She loves the
defensive end of the floor. She's extremely athletic. But she competes.  
I thought today she stepped up. She got in a little foul trouble. She's been
great for Jordan. Jordan sees how Andraya practices and Jordan steps up as
well. I can't say enough about those two. I don't care if Andraya and Jordan
are freshmen. All I care about is they get it done, and they're getting it
done for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Erika Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26508)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

South Carolina  67  
Georgia  48

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from the coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH LANDERS: We got whipped, plain and simple. South Carolina came out and
did the exact things that we talked about not wanting them to do.  
They transitioned us. They got the ball to the basket early in the game and
created the same lead they created in Columbia. They did that off of turnovers
and missed jump shots early in the game.  
At that point I'd be remiss if I didn't say they were terrific. They did what
they wanted to do. They got the ball inside, they got it in transition. They
had a couple big baskets in the first half coming off the bench in the form of
three‑point shots. They should feel very good about what they did today.  
I'm a little bit disappointed with what we did.  
KRISTA DONALD: They're a good team. They were ready to compete. I feel like we
as a team didn't come out ready to play. The score showed that.  
ERIKA FORD: I would agree with Krista and coach. South Carolina is a great
team. We just didn't come out ready to play. You had certain people coming out
and competing, the rest were kind of dull. We didn't come together as a team
and play together well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did you think confidence was in play in this game, having
played them not too long ago and losing? It appeared like some nerves, lack of
confidence.  
COACH LANDERS: It's interesting. That's a fair question. But in reality my
confidence was high because we know what happened at South Carolina. We know
how it happened. We also know that we did a lot of very good things ‑ many
more good things than we did today.  
If we correct the easily correctable mistakes we made, we can play with
Carolina. Didn't happen. We let the exact same thing happen. I'm repeating
myself. The transition baskets, the quick shots from the perimeter. We started
it the same way.  
You say it's a lack of confidence. It's interesting that we're both saying
what we're saying because it's kind of a source of my frustration. We know
what happened at Columbia. We talked about it. We said, Let's not make these
mistakes again. Yet the team that I coach allowed the exact same mistakes to
occur again.  
It had nothing to do with size advantage or any of the other things that
impress you about South Carolina. It was about transitioning, get back on
defense, get under the ball, get it stopped, know where their shooters are.  
We didn't know where Mitchell was the first 10 minutes of the game, and she
got 25 on us last time.  
  
Q. You find yourself in unfamiliar territory. You have to sit back and wait
to see if your season is extended. Do you feel like it should be with a good
win yesterday? And for the young ladies, obviously Georgia has a strong
tradition here, you're supposed to play in the NCAA tournament every year.
Your thoughts on that?  
COACH LANDERS: I think we should be in, but I'm smart enough to understand
that as we go through this piece that we're involved in now, conference
tournaments, et cetera, we don't want a lot of teams that aren't supposed to
win from this point on win.  
When teams whose conference is only going to have one team normally in the
tournament, when the best team gets upset, now they might have two. All of a
sudden the at‑larges start to erode. You could stand a chance of missing out.  
Do I think we should be in? Yes. Are we one of the 64 best teams in the
country? Absolutely. Are we in unfamiliar territory? Yes. I don't think our
players understand that.  
Most of our team wasn't born the last time we didn't play in the NCAA
tournament. Now, this is either 20 in a row or we've set a new streak for not
going.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what your coach already said, what your expectations
are at this point?  
KRISTA DONALD: It's very hopeful. Yes, we deserve to be in the tournament.
It's just reality. You have to accept it.  
Yeah, we're back on our heels, but there's still a chance.  
ERIKA FORD: I would say it's definitely hopeful. We're on the back of our
heels like Krista says. We have to hope for the best and see what happens.  
COACH LANDERS: Let me just say this for the benefit of my players, not for the
benefit of the media.  
You know, hopefulness is what occurs when you don't take care of your
business, then you got to hope somebody else takes care of you, that things
fall your way.  
I want our players to understand that.  
Every team in the NCAA has the ability to create the opportunity and take the
hope out of the hands of those who will decide. We didn't do that. So now we
are hopeful. And hopeful isn't where you want to be day in and day out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Peyton Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26539)

### [Tyrese Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23223)

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  86  
Auburn  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from coach and open it up for
questions.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Credit to Texas A&M. I thought they came out and
played extremely well right as the game began. We didn't start the game like
we wanted to start the game. Just didn't play well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. It seemed like you weren't able to do the same things you did against
them in Auburn. Seemed like they got easy shots.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Maybe so. I mean, Texas A&M is too good of a team.
Gary Blair is too good of a coach. They weren't going to come in and allow us
to turn them over 27 times again. They probably started working on the press
offense a long time ago to make sure we didn't force them into as many
turnovers as we did the first time.  
  
Q. Talk about the shooting night tonight. What was it like out there trying
to score the ball?  
TYRESE TANNER: Pretty tough. We couldn't knock anything down. They started
their transition. It just let them lead the game with a lot of points. If we
weren't scoring, they were scoring.  
  
Q. Peyton, inside, they controlled the boards from the first tip. Looked
like Tra'Cee and yourself were having trouble with Karla. What were they doing
on the rebounding?  
PEYTON DAVIS: We didn't push back on rebounds. Coach told us from the get‑go
we got to push them back. We're not going to win the jumping war with them.
It's obvious they out‑rebounded us.  
I had five. They had eight, seven, six. That can't happen. You can't win a
game like that. They killed us on the boards, so...  
That's just something that we've got to do better.  
  
Q. Been kind of an up ‑and‑down season. Do you anticipate it going on in the
WNIT?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: You always want to play in post‑season, be it WNIT,
NCAA tournament. We're a very young team. As much as you want to say we're in
the second half of our season, regardless, we're a young team. At one point we
had four freshmen and a sophomore on the floor. You're going to have ups and
downs with young point guards, new point guards. It's kind of to be expected.  
Our expectation is always to play hard regardless and always play defense. Two
things we didn't do completely tonight. But we'll get better. The young ones
will grow up and they'll understand our expectations of our women's basketball
program.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how it snowballed right away. It started
quick.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I mean, 33, she was hot as soon as she took her first
jump shot. It's hard to even think about if we would have got stops. You got
to play a little bit harder. You got to understand at that point once she hit
her first two, you got to move a little bit closer, try to defend her a little
bit better.  
But for a player like her, once she's on, she's on.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions right now. You can see it in your face.
To go out in such a lopsided manner, what's going through your head right
now?  
TYRESE TANNER: I'm disappointed in how we played today. I'm looking forward to
the post‑season. Hopefully we can play in the NIT.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

South Carolina  67  
Georgia  48

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening comment from South Carolina
head coach and each of the student‑athletes.  
COACH STALEY: I thought we came out ready to play, especially on both sides of
the ball. Very efficient from the offensive standpoint. Definitely, I thought
our players played with a lot of energy. I thought they were committed to
making sure we chased hard off of screens and contested each shot that Georgia
shot.  
I just thought we played good basketball. Of course, there are things we'd
like to clean up, you know, like offensive rebounding, the free‑throw line.
But a win is a win in our league.  
ELEM IBIAM: I think we just came out ready to play. We had a couple days off
to kind of talk to each other, kind of get prepared mentally. That's what we
did.  
I also think, you know, we played them not too long ago, so they were still
kind of fresh in our minds. That played a big part of us coming into the game.  
ALAINA COATES: We were able to really execute our plays. Everything didn't
obviously go our way, but we were able to do what we needed to do. We prepared
the right way and were able to come out and do what we do.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH STALEY: I think with our bigs, they have done a tremendous job all
season long being very efficient from an offensive standpoint. I will bring up
the Tennessee game where I don't think we were as efficient as we had been all
season long, so it was great to see them get back on track and do the things
that got us here.  
They're able to give those kinds of contributions, I think we can be very
successful.  
  
Q. Last few games the bench has been good. Good again today. Talk about
that.  
COACH STALEY: We're constantly talking to our bench about being able to
perform in a setting like playing in an SEC tournament. I think the bench is
key. We were talking to some players that we felt like could give us an
advantage.  
Of course, Alaina always comes off the bench and gives us a lift. I was happy
to see Tina Roy come off and give us a spark. If we can get her going, again,
we can be very, very successful because she can probably shoot it better than
anybody on our team. If she gets hot, it only stretches the defense out and
allows us to pound that ball inside.  
  
Q. I know the last three games down the stretch not as efficient offensively
as you'd like. How nice was it to see your bigs inside today play as well as
they did, as well as the outside game, too?  
COACH STALEY: I thought it was really key. They know they're going to get the
ball. I just thought they just played with a renewed energy coming off the
Tennessee loss. It was great to get back to playing efficient basketball.  
I thought our perimeter players played a little bit fast today, had a lot of
energy. But it was good to pound that ball and allow our post players to go to
work and let everybody exhale a little bit to get their nerves right.  
  
Q. Normally you see a pretty bad free ‑throw shooting percentage, Tiffany
not doing well from the field. You still win by 19. How do you address those
weaknesses from today?  
COACH STALEY: I think you have to address it by just saying it. I don't want
to go back down the road we were down last year where we were just horrible
from a free‑throw shooting standpoint. We've been pretty good the last couple
of games out.  
It's a new gym. We only got a chance to shoot here for a little bit yesterday.
Just got to get used to the tight rims of the gym.  
  
Q. Talk about getting out to the quick start.  
COACH STALEY: I think that can work two ways. You can come in too relaxed
because you haven't played a competition like you normally do on a Thursday
night, or you can shoot us out of a cannon. I thought we got shot out of a
cannon. Played a little bit too fast. You got to let the game settle down.  
For us, I'd rather coach our team from being too energized than not.  
  
Q. You came out at halftime and put the game away quickly. Was that a
message to the team at halftime?  
COACH STALEY: I think we know what kind of team Georgia is. They're incredibly
streaky. We didn't want them to get on a roll. Once they get on a roll,
they're pretty hard to guard. We just wanted to jump out on them the first
five minutes of the game and see if we could put it away, get some other
players in the game, hopefully plan to win the semifinals game tomorrow.  
  
Q. For the players, the guards seemed to have a rough day to start, but you
were on from the start. After the Tennessee game, how important was it for you
to come out and have that big start today?  
ELEM IBIAM: I think that was very important for us to just establish ourselves
early in the paint. Whenever we're not on our guards, they're there for us.
For us to be there for our guards, be a cushion, bring some confidence out to
the perimeter. It was a good feeling. I think that's what happened today.  
ALAINA COATES: Kind of piggyback off of what El said, it's a confidence
booster when your bigs have your back.  
  
Q. Elem, this is a different experience for South Carolina coming in as the
team with the target on its back. What did the coaches tell you about
maintaining your focus, being in that different position?  
ELEM IBIAM: Our coaches always tell us not to get too high or too low. That
keeps us balanced and focused on the next team, at the task at hand. We know
any night it's any team's battle. Just have to go out and fight.  
  
Q. Coming off a loss in the last regular ‑season game, how did you use that
as motivation to get back on track?   
ELEM IBIAM: We were just kind of telling each other, our teammates, to stay
focused, don't let this get us too down. We have to go into the tournament
confident but knowing that we can be beat any night.  
I think it pretty much humbled us coming into this tournament and going into
post‑season play.  
  
Q. Alaina, the confidence has been there for you all season long. Now that
you have gotten that first post ‑season win, what does this do for your
confidence going forward?   
ALAINA COATES: This is another confidence booster. We really wanted to come
out with another championship. It's a huge honor for our school, I'm sure it's
never been done before, we're trying to make history. That's what the goal is.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the luxury of being able to get
your starters out of there, some rest?  
COACH STALEY: It was a huge luxury. But I think our starters put us in a
position to open the game up, along with Alaina and Tina Roy, who were very
efficient, gave us a boost from an offensive standpoint.  
When you're trying to win a tournament, it's very taxing from a physical and
mental standpoint. Anytime that you can rest your starters, rest the people
that play significant minutes, I think it's huge.  
We didn't want them to get too much rest because we want them to stay in the
flow of what's going on. That's why we played them throughout the second half.
But a huge luxury. Hopefully it will pay big dividends tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  77  
LSU  65

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd make an opening comment, then we'll take
questions.  
COACH CALDWELL: I'm extremely proud to be the coach of these young ladies.
This group has come a long way and they have shown that they are capable. I
thought that it takes a lot of courage. I think it does take a lot of courage
to come into an environment like this and be able to come out and display what
they did, especially in the first half, and play this game very tough against
a very good opponent.  
A lot of credit to Tennessee for executing their game plan, which is to get
transition baskets, which they did that. Then obviously their ability to get
on the offensive glass.  
We will move forward from this game. But again, I'm extremely proud of this
group.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What worked to help you get the 15 ‑point lead? What changed in the
second half?   
JEANNE KENNEY: I think in the beginning what worked was they were
one‑and‑done. We boxed out. Even if we didn't box out, the ball went our way.
Theresa started off hitting threes. I hit a couple. But then we established
inside.  
I thought that our defense generated that offense. It always comes back to
defense.  
In the second half, we couldn't stop Isabelle Harrison. We couldn't get Cierra
off the boards. Boxing out was key for us in the second half, and we didn't
execute that.  
I think shot selection and turnovers always create transition offense for the
other team. I know looking at my stats, I can't have seven turnovers. We had
too many turnovers.  
  
Q. Coach Warlick had high praise for you, Theresa. From your perspective,
could you describe what the battle was like in the paint. How were they
getting inside on you?  
THERESA PLAISANCE: They were just doing a great job taking away basically
everything from me. After I hit those first couple of shots, they denied me
really hard. I got a back door. After that, it was almost impossible to get
the ball inside.  
My teammates kept trying to get me the ball. Graves and Harrison did a great
job of taking that away and denying me at very crucial times. I really
couldn't do anything to get the ball back.  
When that goes away, I have to do other things. I have to rebound and set
better screens. I didn't do that. I felt like I kind of let my team down when
it comes to that, so...  
  
Q. DaShawn, you were on Meighan Simmons a lot.  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: The plan was to limit her touches, and hopefully that would
give us a better chance of winning.  
I think towards the end of the game she got going a little bit too much in
transition, and that hurt us.  
Before that, I mean, I denied her the ball, but when she got it, I had great
help. Shanece got a great block on her. No matter what, there was great help
there, so...  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke a little bit yesterday about the leadership that your
seniors have offered here. In the last couple minutes of the game when you
pulled your starters, the referees pulled them, I was noticing both Theresa
and Jeanne standing up and cheering their teammates on. Talk about that.  
COACH CALDWELL: We talk about even when adversity hits, your true character
will be revealed. Our kids have been great teammates. They've invested in each
other. Theresa and Jeanne and Shanece, they know it's their last go‑around.
They're living in the moment. You can tell.  
I respect them tremendously when they're cheering for their teammates when
they're on the bench or maybe they don't have a good game or when they're in
foul trouble. It doesn't stop them being involved in this team.  
They're going to carry this with them. I know Jeanne is going to be a coach
one day, and Theresa. I just hope they cultivate that within their group when
they're able to be their coaches. As a coach, you want your kids to really
become people of great integrity. It takes a true champion to stand there in
the midst of adversity and still be supportive of their teammates.  
  
Q. Looks like y'all huddled before you left the court. What was said?  
COACH CALDWELL: I just told them, I said, Don't hold your head down. Shanece
had tears in her eyes. We wiped those away. I said, there's nothing to hold
your head down for. You have to hold your head up and walk off this court. We
have more basketball in us. This is not over.  
We know what we have to do. We're going to go back and we're going to work
extremely hard over the next couple of weeks. We're going to see where we are
seeded. We're just going to do everything in our power to be ready.  
I just told them to keep their heads up.  
  
Q. Your staff and many of your fans were in the stands tonight wearing
purple shirts supporting LSU, but at the same time, We back Pat. Talk about
how you can have the rivalry but there's more than that.  
COACH CALDWELL: I think Coach Summitt, I always said this, she was a movement
for our game. The opportunities that these young ladies are receiving are from
a great lady who made a huge sacrifice.  
Obviously her legacy will live on through not only who played for her but
those who played against her and her teams.  
We're fortunate. We get to get up every morning. We know exactly where our
classes are. We know exactly what we're taking. We know what we're going to
eat. We remember it.  
That's a tough thing to live with. Whatever we can do to bring awareness and
raise money to help find a cure for dementia and obviously Alzheimer's, we'll
do it. If people can wear the purple, which represents Alzheimer's, then they
should do it.  
It's not about the purple and gold, it's about bringing that type of
appreciation for a lady who gave so much to our game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH CALDWELL: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  75  
Florida  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from coach and then open it up
for questions.  
COACH BUTLER: Have to give Kentucky a lot of credit for the way they played,
in particular the second half. It was just a great SEC ballgame. Two really
good teams. My opinion, best in the country battling the way you would expect
them to play this time of year. Unfortunately, just came up a little bit
short. Had some critical breakdowns in really timely moments.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you had success against Kentucky during the regular season. What
was the difference in this one?  
COACH BUTLER: Second half we answered a couple times, then we just had some
timely defensive breakdowns. The rebounding battle, one of our goals is to
neutralize that. We're trying to always scratch around and make plays off the
boards as much as we can. We didn't do a good job with that.  
In the second half, that was really what was keeping them afloat. I thought we
were playing great basketball, but kept giving them second chances. A good
team's going to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. Cassie, you stepped up late and hit two really big threes. What was your
mindset at that point?  
CASSIE PEOPLES: Pretty much the same mindset I have every game: hit open shots
that I'm given. Our team needed a little bit of spark. I just felt that was a
perfect opportunity.  
  
Q. How was it inside? Was there something they did different on you?  
KAYLA LEWIS: I don't think there's anything they did different on me. Kentucky
is a great team. They have a lot of people. Not just their post players, but
their guards rebound as well. It's everybody's job when you play a team like
this to rebound, not just the people inside.  
When you don't capitalize like that, you give the other team 13 more
opportunities to score, which we did tonight. I give Kentucky credit for that.
I don't think there's anything special that they did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2014

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Jordan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21757)

### [Courtney Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24886)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Texas A&M  86  
Auburn  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, if you'd make an opening comment, then we'll take
questions.  
COACH BLAIR: That's about as good as we can play in transition basketball. I
was proud of our guard play. We turned it over 27 times against them at their
place against that same press. I think we worked on it because they
embarrassed us at their place.  
We had a lot of zone offense called, but we never had to run it in the first
half because we were breaking it, penetrating, shooting jumpers by Walker and
Williams, and Jordan was just feeling it. She was getting the ball to the
right hand. That wasn't a zone offense we were running. We ran the triple post
a couple times. She hit Karla a couple times on that.  
Other than that, it was hitting gaps after they set up into the press. And
nobody presses as long as they do in a ballgame, probably them and Kentucky
press more than anybody in our league.  
Happy with my team. Happy with my bench. Obviously I was a shooting coach for
Courtney Walker in that ballgame. I take all credit (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What was the defensive plan going in?  
COACH BLAIR: We were trying to stop their right‑handed drives. I wanted to
make sure to start the second half, we opened up in a press when we went to
the line. We don't usually do that. Why I wanted to press, I didn't want us to
get content. We forced a couple early turnovers. I think that took all the
life out of them right there. Then we got out of it.  
I wanted to make sure we were doing what we were supposed to. You had to stop
Tanner from driving at the high post, which she was very effective in the
first half. Muhammad, I thought we did a good job on her. I think she's a
little banged up. She's not the Muhammad we normally know. She's a little
banged up.  
I thought their inside players, they let them play, they let us play inside.
Just a solid, good game plan by Coach Starkey, then the on‑ball defense she
had on their point guard allowed us to get into a lot of the passing lanes.  
  
Q. Courtney, what was working for you tonight?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think we were getting the fast break, pull up, also the
reverse five on their zone they really over‑rotated on their zone, so a lot of
times, a lot of the players would be on one side of the floor, the other side
was open. I think we just took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Coach, I think Karla tied the school season single block record. Jordan
is coming up on the single season assist record. To be setting these kind of
things every couple years, what does that say about the state of the program
overall?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it says a lot about my assistant coaches who are great
recruiters. I think it's the traditions. I think it's our players doing a
great job. When kids come on campus, they want to play with other great
players.  
We're just trying to be consistent while we're at the top. I know who's at the
top. Even in here knows who's at the top. We want to be there where the
Tennessees and the Connecticuts and the Dukes and Notre Dames and Stanfords
and Baylors. They've been there for quite a while. I think it's time for us
and the South Carolinas and the Kentuckys to all be that consistent.  
Three out of the four of us are still chasing Tennessee. But I think the top
four are all playing tomorrow. I challenged my team. I said, Hey, Florida did
a good job of staying with them for a while. I'm getting confused. South
Carolina ran away with their game with Georgia.  
I'm proud to be part of this four. Now, how can we stay there? I've got good
guards that are all sophomores. We need to replace Karla. She'll graduate this
year. We've got those two young post players that were playing and a good
freshman coming in.  
I love my team. I love the tradition. We're going to keep working as hard as
we can to try to stay at that level, to be consistent, to stay with those top
five schools I mentioned.  
  
Q. Being able to get your starters out of there with seven or ten minutes
left in the half, how important is that when you're playing a team like
Tennessee?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's important because we're playing at 2:30. It's going
to be a long night for the assistant coaches breaking down film. It's going to
be a short night for our kids getting in the cold pool to get ready to play
tomorrow. Then you just play on momentum.  
We had the same thing last year. We played well. Last year we had to come from
behind and beat Tennessee. Hopefully we can get off to a better start. They
embarrassed us at our place. They had their A game. Beat us by an easy 21.
We'd like to give a better showing this time.  
They're the best transition team in our league. Harrison is just killing
people on the offensive boards. She's doing such a great job. Simmons, I don't
know what she ended up with, but she loves to play against Texas teams. She's
a Texas girl.  
We have our hands full, but that's what we want. Give Tennessee a lot of
credit. It's going to be a good matchup. It's going to be a good matchup for
the SEC. The whole nation is going to be able to see the top four teams play,
and all of us are in the top 15. I think it's going to be great for SEC
basketball.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk forcing turnovers. What were you doing
defensively?  
JORDAN JONES: It really wasn't so much about what I was doing, rather what my
teammates were doing. They made it very hard for her to get into the ball,
denying the offense by denying the wings. Once I look over my shoulder, it
gives me leeway to pressure the ball.  
By pressuring the ball it rattles them. They start pushing off, fumbling the
ball. By then there's 10 seconds left on the shot clock for them to run their
offense.  
It's about disrupting their offense and I feel like that's what we did
tonight.  
  
Q. Jordan, you talked about wanting to get revenge on the teams that beat
you this week. You get a chance to do that tomorrow. From a player's
perspective, what does getting another crack at Tennessee mean?  
JORDAN JONES: I probably will be with the coaches tonight breaking down film
because that's just how excited I am about this tournament in general.  
Playing Tennessee, it's a great platform because it's a team with so much
history. Just tonight we saw the whole thing was basically, We back Pat, Coach
Summitt. Most of them are legends. For us to be able to step on the floor with
them tomorrow speaks great volumes to this program as well.  
I feel if we keep this momentum, keep on doing what we're doing, it should be
a better game than it was out in College Station.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Tyrese Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23223)

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Auburn  70  
Ole Miss  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I thought we did a much better job defensively in the
second half holding Ole Miss to 17 points. We definitely let McFarland get
away from us in the first half, 20 points in the first half. But we came back
and did a better job in the second half defensively.  
I think we did a better job of getting to the offensive boards.  
THE MODERATOR: Tyrese.  
TYRESE TANNER: I'm just really proud of my team, how we came out. We stayed
focused the whole game, stuck to our game plan and got the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Tra'Cee.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: Like she said, we stuck to our game plan but emphasized
getting the ball inside. That's what we did today and that's what helped us
win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You shot 27% in the second half and outscored them by 15. Is that a
unique statistic?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Shot 46% in the first half and was only up by one
(laughter).  
I don't know. I mean, I thought we did a better job in the second half getting
to the free‑throw line. First half we were standing around, shooting more jump
shots. But we had both bigs in foul trouble in the first half as well. Kind of
messed up our game plan a little bit of getting the ball inside.  
  
Q. What did you do differently from the first half to the second half after
giving up 20 in the first?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: We went over the screens a little bit more. We kept
Tyrese at the top to give her a little bit more lift for her three. We kept
everybody else inside to help on the penetration.  
Valencia McFarland is a very good point guard. We tried to do as much as we
can. At the end of the day she's still good and she's still going to get hers.  
  
Q. Coach, what would you consider the turning point to have been in the
second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I definitely think it was our defense. I thought we
understood the game plan. Certain people we didn't want to go out on that did
hit shots in the first half. Like we told them, just stick with the game plan.  
I thought we rebounded the ball a little bit better defensively in the second
half.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference from tonight's game versus Sunday's
meeting back in Oxford?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I'd like the players to answer that.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: The biggest difference for me is I would say we attacked the
basket a lot more. We finished at the basket. We made most of our free throws
tonight.  
TYRESE TANNER: Also we just played harder this game. I thought at Ole Miss we
didn't play hard. This game we played both halves hard and we got the win.  
  
Q. Talk about Texas A &M, what you've seen from them, what you expect
tomorrow.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Texas A&M is a very good team, another team with a
very good point guard. They can attack you inside, they can go outside. They
have two great wings that have incredible pull‑up jump shots. They're a good
team. We have to control the inside game.  
Defensively I thought they did a really good job at our place defending us and
taking away our point guard. We're going to have to be better at that.  
  
Q. Coach, could you describe how it is when you're in this one ‑day
turnaround format.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It's tough. But you really try not to focus so much
on the other team because at this point there's not much you can do about it.
You've played them before. You try to go back and look at that film, try to
fix some of the things you did wrong.  
But mainly you really try to take care of your team and make sure we're doing
what we need to be doing. You just don't have much time to prepare for it,
like you say.  
  
Q. Tyrese and Tra'Cee, were y'all happy when you found out you were going to
get another shot at Ole Miss? Extra motivation in this game?  
TYRESE TANNER: Oh, yes. We were just watching. Whoever won yesterday, we were
going to come out and play hard. It didn't matter. It was good we got to play
Ole Miss again and got to show who we really were.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: I agree with her. I really think we came out and redefined
ourselves from how we played on Sunday. Today we were a lot more hungry than
we were Sunday. You don't really get a quick turnaround like this to play
against a team you didn't get to play that good against.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Auburn  70  
Ole Miss  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH INSELL: Full credit to Auburn. Auburn, you know, they've got a really
good basketball team, real long and athletic. They really got spread out in
their zone and caused us a lot of problems. So full credit to them.  
But I'm real proud of our basketball team. Our record don't indicate
everything we've accomplished this year. These three seniors here, I have a
lot of respect for them, bringing our program to where we're now back on the
radar, back to where we're being competitive each and every night, showing
what Ole Miss basketball is about.  
I hate that the season's over. But full credit to Auburn and their coaching
staff for beating us tonight.  
DIARA MOORE: As coach said, full credit to Auburn. They are a really good
basketball team. I just want to thank my two teammates right here for helping
me feel like that Ole Miss was a second home to me. I know I wasn't there as
long as they were. But the two years I was there, I'm glad that I got to be a
part of that.  
We didn't come out with the win we wanted to, but I'm very proud of the things
we have accomplished this year as a team. I know that people are noticing us
now. That's all we wanted to accomplish, that people respect us now. I know
that they do. I know next year's team is going to come back and be even
better, be stronger. I'll always be an Ole Miss Rebel, so I'm proud of that.  
KENYOTTA JENKINS: Give full credit to Auburn. They out‑rebounded us. That's
something we talked about, was rebounding. They out‑rebounded us. Watch out
for next year's team because they coming and they ready.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: I'd like to give full credit to Auburn, like they said.
They came out and played a great game.  
I think we played great, too, but we just fell short in the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions.  
  
Q. Talk about your three seniors, what they've meant to the program.  
COACH INSELL: These three seniors, when I first got the job, I think it was
April when I first got to campus, one thing I asked them, I know it's your
senior year, give it all you have. Your seniors have to buy in. I couldn't ask
for a better group of seniors on and off the floor, the way they led our
basketball team, the way that they carry theirself. They got futures ahead of
them hopefully in the game of basketball. I'm going to help them in any way I
can. I got so much respect for them.  
They're the ground floor of what we're building here at Ole Miss. They're
going to come back 10 years from now, a lot of what we're going to accomplish
over the next 10 years is a true credit to them. I'm proud of them, proud to
be their coach.  
Valencia McFarland, her record won't indicate the impact she's made on our
program. Just an incredible, incredible player, one of the best point guards
to ever play in this league. She's put numbers up since she was a freshman and
done unbelievable things. I feel real special to be able to coach her, I'll be
honest with you, all three of them.  
I hate that it ended like this for all three of them. Proud of Valencia for
her leadership and her will to fight every single day. She has a bright future
in the game of basketball.  
  
Q. What do you take from the last five to six games, the way you finished
the season?  
COACH INSELL: There's so much when you're remodeling a program, there's so
much you have to get accomplished, so much you have to do.  
We were kind of late getting going, starting to play the way we played the
last five or six games. I'll tell you, the last five or six games we played
really, really well. If you take out the last eight minutes of tonight's game,
we played as good as anybody in this league over the last five or six games.  
I take from it that I have three seniors that kept fighting every single day.
That will be something I use in the future with all of our seniors and
continue to show examples of what these three girls have done, how they
continue to bring it every single day, which motivated the younger players to
bring it every single day and not quit on their season.  
It's not the way we wanted it to end. We came here to win this tournament.
We'll continue doing that. We'll continue this process. Great days are ahead
because of these three players right here.  
  
Q. Coach, you had an 11 ‑point lead at one point in the first half. When you
got down to the final eight minutes, get a stop, get a score, drill wasn't
working as well as yesterday. How much of that was about the emotional energy
expended on the floor yesterday?   
COACH INSELL: Could have had something to do with it. We got some stops. We
didn't rebound, like Kenyotta said. We knew the key to this game was
rebounding. Auburn is not a great shooting team, but what they are is a great
offensive rebounding team.  
They shoot a lot of shots outside. They go get. We didn't do a good job of
rebounding that stretch, which allowed them two and three opportunities, and
if we could have kept it at one opportunity like we did for the vast majority
of it...  
When we went to the other end, we scored one basket in the last eight minutes,
something like that, maybe two, got good shots. I think a little bit of that
came with the wear and tear on our legs. I think a lot of that comes from
that. We had a lot of players playing a lot of minutes.  
That comes with depth. We've got to do a good job of recruiting more players
so we don't have to get in this situation in the future where you got players
that are playing 40 minutes and 38 minutes and things like that.  
The 11‑point lead in the first half, we were playing really, really good
basketball. We continued to play good ball. Auburn came out after we got up
11, they hit us back, had a good run of their own. We knew that was going to
happen. We continued to play hard and really well. I'm really proud of them.  
We're not going to judge our season what happened the last eight minutes of
this basketball game. We'll judge our season on the progress we made
throughout the whole year. We'll look back on this year, Kenyotta, myself,
Valencia, Diara, we'll pop this tape in and get mad at each other while we're
watching it, but we'll have a good time. We'll pop that Arkansas one in and
really have a good time.  
  
Q. For the younger players coming back next year, what does this do for
them?  
COACH INSELL: We didn't get to participate in the tournament last year. Coming
in it this year, I really enjoyed the experience because just walking in the
first day for practice and seeing the smiles on our players' faces, something
taken away from us last year. When you come to play in the SEC, the SEC
tournament is something you really look forward to.  
To see their smiles, their excitement about playing in this tournament is
something that really, really excited me. We'll take from this experience,
we've got experience. Without even playing in it last year, to come in and win
your first game, that says a lot about these three guys up here, their
commitment, where we want our program to go.  
We got spring break next week. Our girls are going to go home. We're going to
get away from each other. It's been a long year for us. We'll get back
together next Monday and begin the phases to start next year.  
The first thing is we'll watch the selection show two Monday nights from now.
We'll get used to watching that because that's where we're going with our
program. We'll have a good dinner and maybe Kenyotta will be happy with me if
I get some good food over there for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Florida  71  
Mississippi State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mississippi State. We'll take an opening
comment from coach and the student‑athletes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I'd like to have the first half back. I think our kids would.
I'm really proud of how we came out of the locker room, came back, competed.
We took the lead.  
I just loved our resilience, which this team has been all year. Our second
half was very, very good. Again, very competitive. We showed a lot of
toughness, resilience, competitive spirit. That's what this group's had most
of the year.  
We'd just like to have the first halfback.  
Give Florida credit. When we took the lead, they called timeout and answered
with back‑to‑back baskets. You have to take your hat off to those kids for
making those plays.  
Amanda called a couple really good plays for them to run. They made shots. One
of them was Kendra had a good high hand on one of them, the other one was a
three out there on the left wing. We were fairly close.  
But you got to take your hat off to them for that. Again, we didn't go away.
We kept battling.  
Again, it's two times in a row where their 6‑footer has taken my 6'4" away. We
have to find a better way to get Martha more than six touches and clean looks.
We got her some early. But, boy, after that it really got tough. A lot of that
has to do with ball reversal by our guards. It's not going to be a wide‑open,
clean look in there. You're going to have to throw it to half of her body,
she's going to have to pin the other half.  
Give Florida credit and their post players of doing a great job of taking her
away. Ultimately I think that's a big part of why we're standing here the
losing team. She gets 10 less than her average.  
THE MODERATOR: Kendra.  
KENDRA GRANT: Just going on with what coach said. The first half was a bad
half for us. Even though we outscored them in the second half, we were in too
deep.  
We tried what we could to get it back, but we couldn't get over.  
THE MODERATOR: Jerica.  
JERICA JAMES: Yeah, the first half wasn't us. I guess it just feels even worse
when you're that close. We got within one, within two, we should be able to
finish the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, elaborate on your team's resolve.  
COACH SCHAEFER: These two young ladies have had a different coach as freshmen.
We come in as sophomores. You got to take your hat off and give them a lot of
credit. They really bought into a system and learned to play probably a
different way than they've ever played before.  
As a coach, this is why you get into coaching. To watch these young ladies
mature and grow, develop their game, see them really mature as young women as
well as becoming really, really solid basketball players, competitive, tough.
I mean, they're just beautiful kids off the court.  
Just to see them, again, evolve as basketball players on the court with their
competitive spirit, it's really unique as a head coach. It's really rewarding
as a head coach.  
  
Q. Kendra, can you talk about your ankle. Talk about that determination you
played with.  
KENDRA GRANT: It was actually my thigh. I mean, just knowing the game that we
were in, this is a game we know we lost in the beginning of SEC play, and we
just wanted it back. Using that first game as determination. Every time I came
out, I just couldn't stay out, I had to push through it. Anybody would have
done it.  
I just wanted to push through it, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Krista Donald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26451)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Khaalidah Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26450)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  53  
Vanderbilt  43

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH LANDERS: It was the kind of game I think that we thought it would be:
extremely competitive. We just felt challenged defensively by a very good
Vanderbilt team, a team that has skillful players who cannot only make shots,
but make plays and execute extremely well. That was a big challenge for us.  
We felt like our players answered that challenge. I thought we played
outstanding in the first half. Second half missed some pretty good looks at
shots. But Vandy, to their credit, just kept playing, doing the things they do
so well, and cracked us a few times with back‑door cuts especially.  
Hard‑fought game between two very good teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Khaalidah.  
KHAALIDAH MILLER: I thought we played really well as a team tonight. We played
really well defensively. Even at times in the game where we weren't doing as
well as we wanted to do offensively, we stayed the course and guarded them on
their end, which is the best I've seen us play defensively all year.  
Vanderbilt is a very good team.  
KRISTA DONALD: I felt like we stayed focused throughout the game 'cause at
certain points in time we sort of kind of slipped, but we regained that focus
and we stayed to it, got the W.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, end of the first half, probably about last 12 minutes or so, can
you talk about that stretch. You held them down to one point and no field
goals for a long time.  
COACH LANDERS: Defensively that's when a lot of things just came together. We
knew what we wanted to do. We knew how we wanted to defend them. We started
the game that way.  
But we had some cracks. We had some little breakdowns. I think as the game got
played, after about 10 minutes, all five of our kids were on the same page. We
were playing close to exactly the way that we wanted, the way that we hoped we
could play defensively and affect the things Vanderbilt was trying to do
offensively.  
To their credit, I thought they adjusted a little bit in the last three or
four minutes of the half and just pounded it inside to Webb on us because we
really were up on them on the perimeter, which left the inside somewhat
vulnerable one‑on‑one. They got it in on us and I think scored a couple of
baskets there.  
But I think it was a culmination of having played that first 10 minutes,
everybody getting a grip on exactly what it was we wanted to do together that
made us so effectively in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, the first time Lister had 24 against you. What was different this
time?  
COACH LANDERS: We guarded her better (laughter).  
You know, let me just say this about Lister and Foggie. I'm sure they have a
lot of big fans. They don't have too many bigger than I am. I really enjoy
watching them play. I've enjoyed watching them grow and develop as players.
When I've scouted them through the years, it's just been fun.  
Now that said, you have Lister and Foggie. You asked what happened, what was
the difference in Lister. You've got to be almost perfect to guard them both
on the same night. I haven't seen very many times, very many box scores, where
Lister and Foggie both, say, got half their average. Doesn't happen.  
Tonight was a night that for whatever reason we were effective with her.
Foggie still broke us down with some back‑door cuts and a couple of early
threes. Next game it might be just the opposite.  
  
Q. Khaalidah, you talked the other day about their defense, all the
different ways they can confuse you and rattle you. They had turnovers the
first time you played them. What was that like tonight as the point guard?  
KHAALIDAH MILLER: They definitely tried to pressure a lot coming up and down
the court. I think we held our composure as a team as a whole. We did a lot
better with the ball when they were pressuring us, not turn it over so much.  
People were getting open, getting in the gap like we practiced. That's
something we didn't do the first time. I think we executed very well against
them in the press.  
  
Q. Talk about playing South Carolina again after last week.  
COACH LANDERS: I think we'll be excited about it. I know I am. The game at
South Carolina started with a South Carolina run. It put us on our heels. That
lasted about five, six minutes. After that the game was a game.  
Can we repeat and improve on our last performance? I certainly think so. So
I'm excited about playing them again. I look forward to it. I think our
players will look forward to it.  
  
Q. Krista, you looked quite comfortable in the post today. Tell me about
that.  
KRISTA DONALD: I just went out and played hard, which is what I try to do
every game. I just let it come to me. I mean, if I do good, that's what I'm
hoping. But sometimes the game's not always perfect. Just have to go out and
play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Shafontaye Myers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26482)

### [Daisha Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24776)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

LSU  78  
Alabama  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from coach and each of our
student‑athletes.  
COACH CURRY: I just credit LSU. I thought that Shanece and Theresa and Jeanne
just as seniors really willed their team today, did a great job.  
It was kind of role reversal from Sunday. They had great balance. We had
trouble scoring and making plays. Our hats off to those guys.  
I certainly don't want to take it away from the improvement that these kids
sitting next to me have done. We're excited about the future.  
DAISHA SIMMONS: Like coach said, they had a lot of players step up today. We
just needed to do a better job, making sure we found everybody and guarded
everybody.  
SHAFONTAYE MYERS: Same as they said. Feeding off each other's energy, we
didn't come out ready to play like LSU. They was more hungry. The most effort
team won today, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the big picture of looking at your team's growth this
year.  
COACH CURRY: I think one thing we've talked about, three key words: energy
never fails. That's something we've done from day one, is ourself as a staff
have that energy. Our kids have fed off of that.  
We've laid the foundation for a bright future. Shafontaye Myers will be part
of that going down the road. Daisha will be an impact day in and day out.
Every word she says, every action about her.  
We're excited about what's ahead, about our recruiting class from '14 and '15.
The future is incredibly bright. As we build it back, we want to do it the
right way. Certainly this team has the right kind of energy.  
  
Q. Coach, could you describe tactically the difference between Sunday's game
and this game.  
COACH CURRY: I think we made shots on Sunday and missed shots today. When you
look at statistically, they shot 50% and we shot 35%. I think that was the
difference. We made shots on Sunday and didn't today.  
Certainly I think taking care of the basketball today, we had trouble with
that. But it was kind of role reversal. You credit those guys. They had great
balance, four players in double figures. We had four in double figures on
Sunday.  
  
Q. I know shots didn't fall, but were they doing something in particular
that caused that or just a rough day at the office?  
COACH CURRY: I think when we've had success, we've made the same looks we
missed today. I don't think it was anything defensively. We just missed shots.
That's part of the game. You got to make plays.  
  
Q. Daisha, I was almost surprised at the end of the game to see that you
matched them on the boards when they have a substantial height advantage
inside. Talk about your philosophy to rebound the ball so effectively.  
DAISHA SIMMONS: Like coach said, energy never fails. You just got to play with
a lot of energy, a lot of heart no matter what size you are, no matter what
size the people you're playing against. You just got to go out there and
battle, and that's what I try to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

LSU  78  
Alabama  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, it's tough to have to come back and play a great
basketball team like Alabama. They've got some players that are just
hard‑nosed. They propose a defensive nightmare for you.  
But I was very proud of our team for staying disciplined in our game plan, for
executing it. Again, just playing this game with a lot of heart. We saw that
tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Shanece.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: We came into the tournament with the mindset of this won't
be our last 40 minutes together. We just kind of kept that in our heads all
day long and dreamt about the game, just brought it to life that we would come
out and dominate.  
JEANNE KENNEY: To piggyback off of all those, we did have a mindset of this
wasn't going to be our last game. As seniors, it's something that it's very
evident and we realized it's coming down to the end so we wanted to make sure
it wasn't our last game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about specifically your post players. Both had double
‑doubles.   
COACH CALDWELL: I thought McKinney did an exceptional job of just being
accurate. Everything that she put up was pretty much going in. She played very
aggressive. She did so defensively for us.  
She's our clean‑up lady. Her presence on the defensive end, when players are
trying to get to the basket, you got to be aware of her coming over and
blocking shots. She had four of them tonight. It set a tone.  
Then obviously Theresa is one of those players that we have counted on. She
answered the call tonight. We're going to continue to go to these two. We
talked about establishing a power game. We even named an offense 'Power' so we
could play that way, and I thought those two played phenomenal tonight.  
  
Q. Shanece, you said you guys dreamt about this game. Expand on that a
little bit.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Well, last night, I won't go into detail about the dream
(laughter), but I pretty much saw us cheering after the game, going back,
talking to our families about how we won, just stuff like that.  
COACH CALDWELL: You literally had a dream?  
SHANECE McKINNEY: Yeah (laughter).  
  
Q. You hurt your arm on a block.  
SHANECE McKINNEY: I blocked the girl's shot. When I came down, I guess my
triceps caught her shoulder. It kind of caught her shoulder.  
It's good, though.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it would be fair to say that y'all struggled late in the
regular season. You didn't seem to struggle much tonight. What was the problem
and how have you fixed it?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, the SEC is just a tough conference to play in. You look
at our road stretch, the last seven games. At Kentucky, that's a tough game.
At Texas A&M, that's a tough game. At Georgia, that's a tough game. Obviously
we also had South Carolina and Tennessee in that six‑, seven‑game stretch.  
Our team, though, through those losses, I thought we grew up. I thought they
showed resilience and determination, especially in the Tennessee game. We
didn't give up, although we were 21 points down at the half. We could have
went on to win that game. They put themselves in position to do so.  
But this team is going to grow from all of that. Again, we have the strongest
RPI in the country. We have the best coaches and support staff in the country.
I do feel like we have some of the best players in the country. So night in
and night out, it's going to be competitive.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Jeanne's leadership.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, she was a great floor general. The one thing about
Jeanne, we have a unique relationship. I give her her moments and she'll give
me mine. But the other night when we were meeting, you love this when a player
says, Hey, coach, you have 5 or 10 minutes, but we sat and talked about how
we're going to be on the same page, how she's going to be an extension of this
coaching staff.  
Her teammates respond to her. There's not a job too big or too small. She
makes the sacrifice for her team. That's one of the greatest qualities of a
leader, the ability to sacrifice.  
I'm so glad she shot the ball tonight. She looked for her teammates. She did a
nice job of controlling the game for us.  
  
Q. You talked about playing for 40 minutes. Was this a 40 ‑minute effort
tonight?   
JEANNE KENNEY: No, it wasn't. I feel like the reason we didn't play 40 minutes
was because of our defense. I looked up at the scoreboard at one point during
that stretch, we went on that scoring run, but we got defensive stops. We
could have been up 30, yet we come down. They had 39 points at this moment.
Probably seven minutes left. They end up scoring 65 points at the end of the
game.  
I mean, Alabama can shoot threes. We know that. We got burnt by that last week
against them.  
We have to work on our defense. We have to finish out games. We have too much
potential to just play 30 minutes, 35 minutes in stretches. We have too much
to gain to play that way.  
  
Q. Coach, Williams really hurt you last time at Alabama. Tonight you were
able to neutralize her for the most part. And look ahead to tomorrow night's
game.  
COACH CALDWELL: Williams is a tough guard. She plays with a different bounce
about her. She's a great rebounder.  
We did a nice job of really trying to not allow her to establish early
position. So that was good.  
Simmons picked up the slack. We guarded Simmons pretty good at Alabama. I
thought she was really hunting for her shot more.  
Looking ahead, I told the group, Enjoy today, enjoy the moment as far as
having another game. But tomorrow we get to play again for 40 minutes together
as a team. That's what it's going to be about. It's going to be about us
executing our game plan and playing it to the best of our ability.  
We've got to be ready to defend, like Jeanne said. We've got to keep people
off the boards. Those are the two cornerstones of great teams, is their
ability to defend and rebound the basketball.  
Offensively let's just take care of the basketball. When we're taking care of
the basketball, we're pretty efficient offensively.  
I don't want this group to go into tomorrow hoping or wishing, We hope this,
we hope that. I want them to go into that game and make it happen. They're
capable. They've shown they're able. They just got to trust in that, but more
importantly trust each other.  
When they do trust each other, they play the way they're capable of with this
togetherness, they have a strong bond, and it's unbreakable.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 6, 2014

  

### [Jaterra Bonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24807)

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Kayla Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26464)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Florida  71  
Mississippi State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening comment from coach and the
student‑athletes.  
COACH BUTLER: A great win. Mississippi State is just a really tough team to
play against. Vic does a fantastic job. His kids always play hard.  
I'm just proud of mine for the battle and resilience they showed, never
doubting, even when we gave the lead up, to just bounce back, trust their
teammates, their coaches and the process.  
But really, really strong victory today, for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Jaterra.  
JATERRA BONDS: I think it's good preparation for our next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Kayla.  
KAYLA LEWIS: Just like coach said, it's good for us to be in this tournament
and take one game at a time.  
Mississippi State is a good team. They have good players, players that are all
SEC. Fouls were called that kept people out on both sides. It was nice to
survive and win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Kayla's performance.  
COACH BUTLER: I think that Kayla's athleticism is what you see because that's
the most obvious thing. That's much more about Kayla's desire, the plays that
she made. That's what makes me proud of those numbers. It's not can she jump
higher than someone or is she stronger than someone? It's about, I'm not going
to be denied, I'm not going to let you score on this. It comes from a
positive, team‑oriented place.  
  
Q. What adjustments did you make when Mississippi State made the late run?  
COACH BUTLER: The biggest thing was to calm down. Guys, we're fine. We're
doing things that we weren't doing earlier. Why are we doing that? What makes
us good? What got us the lead? Let's do that stuff. There's other stuff we're
doing right now that's not working so well.  
Our leaders, upperclassmen, showed great composure, even though they were
guilty of some of those mistakes.  
Collectively we did a good job of getting back to this is the way we need to
play, these are the things that make us a good team, these are things that
aren't, so let's leave them on the bench.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts when Mississippi State had taken the lead?  
KAYLA LEWIS: Well, in this league, everybody is good, everybody is going to
make a run. You have to be able to weather the storm, that's what we did.
Cassie hit that three‑pointer giving us five straight points at the end.
Putting us back up by one. Just having the mindset of okay, they're going to
be making a run and we just have to answer.  
JATERRA BONDS: I just tried to tell everybody in the huddle to stay composed,
they were going to keep penetrating and get it in.  
Everybody is going to make their runs, but you have to come back and answer.
We made some silly turnovers, I know I was guilty for four of them, in the
second half. Just to be able to bounce back and stay composed together at the
end.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on playing Kentucky for a third time?  
COACH BUTLER: We're playing Kentucky. I think at this point, how many times
we've played them or what those previous outcomes were just really aren't a
factor. That's one of the things we talked about coming into this tournament,
we want to be really, really fresh.  
It should be reflected in our energy and our outlook on whoever our opponents
are going to be.  
We know it will be a great contest. Again, one of the best teams not just in
the league but in the country. Another fantastic opportunity for us.  
  
Q. They have the tournament projections out there. Is it tough for you or
your team to ignore that stuff, the NCAA tournament projections?  
COACH BUTLER: You know, we're in the SEC tournament right now. I don't think
it's hard. That's one of the things I really trust about our team, is our
leadership. They're going to drive the conversations that we're having in the
hotel or in the locker room.  
The NCAA tournament, we'll get worried about that when we're in the NCAA
tournament. I don't think there's any question we're in the NCAA tournament. I
just think it's fun for outside people to talk about that and project, do all
that sort of thing.  
We're in the SEC tournament right now. That's the only thing our team is
worried about. I think it's one of the things special about this group, is
they've had a really, really razor‑like focus on what's important. What's
important right now is Kentucky, and that's it.  
  
Q. Coach, how does this rate in terms of birthday presents you've
received?  
COACH BUTLER: Best ever.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  53  
Vanderbilt  43

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from coach followed by a
comment from the student‑athletes.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think the obvious: Georgia came ready to play and worked
really hard, dominated us on the boards, was more physical, more aggressive,
got a lot more shots. They put up more shots. They got more second and third
shots.  
They earned this victory. They did a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Jasmine.  
JASMINE LISTER: I mean, pretty much like coach said, they came ready to play,
ready to hit first. They got a lot of second and third shots which we pretty
much allowed them to do. We weren't as aggressive as them from the jump,
neither on defense or offense. We let them take us out of our offense and not
continue.  
THE MODERATOR: Christina.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I think coach and Jasmine touched on it. Just being
aggressive from the start and attacking from the start, not being on our
heels. I think Georgia came out with an aggressiveness, and we needed to do
that from the start.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the difference between the time that you saw them in
January and today?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think mentality. We've been on a stretch where we haven't
finished games and we've gotten behind. I don't think our mentality was where
it needed to be.  
They've gotten more aggressive, more physical, were able to take us out of
things that we were able to do against them, especially offensively, last
time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2014&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Mississippi State  73  
Missouri  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Schaefer and then take
questions for he and the student‑athletes.  
COACH SCHAEFER: First all, a great basketball game, hats off to Missouri.
Robin, she does a great job. Those kids play so hard. They're so hard to
handle, so hard to defend. Boy, you talk about kids that make shots.  
But I'm awfully proud of our kids, so proud of my team, the perseverance. That
was the word that was on the board tonight, was perseverance and resilience.  
We didn't play well Sunday. We come off of back‑to‑back‑to‑back overtime
games. Martha played 45, 45, 44 in those overtime games. Our kids play very
hard. We're not out standing around in a 2‑3 zone, we're full court pressing.
It's been a little bit taxing. This time of year everybody is tired. I think
we're a little bit more tired than most because of how we play.  
To see our kids, their resilience tonight. Missouri kept coming at you. Every
time they left somebody open, they made a shot. It's demoralizing to be quite
honest when you go through and talk about guarding them, you know what they
want to do, how they want to do it. It's real easy to lose somebody.  
That's a mental thing, quite frankly. Our kids I know, they've been in so many
close ballgames all year long. We've won our share, lost more than our share.
To see them come out and persevere in that environment, I really am proud of
them.  
That's win number 19 for this team this year, tremendous accomplishment for
them. Not Martha's best night. Our best player, didn't get our best night from
her. We put two freshmen on the floor. That's when we made our run from down 6
to got it tied. The eight‑minute mark we were down 6. We said in the huddle,
We have to win the next four minutes. Next media timeout it was tied.  
Proud of our kids, energy, effort. We're excited about tomorrow. That's why we
came here. Didn't pack one suit. Didn't pack one pair of under clothes. We
came to play. That's kind of been the approach all year with this group.  
So good win for us and we're on to the next one.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kendra's performance.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I'd love to talk about her. I've been waiting for about a
month to talk about her.  
Kendra, she's been so good in practice, but we get her in ballgames, the
lights come on, she'll get in foul trouble for whatever reason. Just wanting
her to work her way out of it. Obviously she does so much for us offensively.
We need her. Offensively we absolutely have to have her. Our twos and threes
have put up some bad zeroes in some games this year. She's not been on the
floor to be a part of it.  
She's hit some big shots for us throughout the course of the year, but this is
Kendra Grant. I need her. We need her to be like this every night. I'm waiting
on it. As I told her now, I'm glad she showed up tonight because we
desperately needed her. The way they were playing us in the first half with
the point four zone.  
The kid can make shots. I'm telling you, come to a practice, there's some
stretches where she doesn't miss anything she's looking at. I need that from
her. We desperately need that.  
I need her with confidence. She's got my confidence right now. Hopefully she
can come back tomorrow and put together another good run. I'm happy as the
dickens that she's with me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 5, 2014

  

### [Bri Kulas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26437)

### [Sierra Michaelis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26438)

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Mississippi State  73  
Missouri  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Missouri. We'll take an opening comment
from coach and ask each of the student‑athletes to talk about this evening's
game.  
COACH PINGETON: I'm proud of our kids. I thought we competed hard. Obviously
got into foul trouble that hurt us having some key players on the bench. I
thought the end of the first half really hurt us.  
Felt like our kids competed hard, played a solid game from start to finish.
Thought we had some key kids come off the bench and do a great job for us.
Just like I told our kids, shoulders back, head high, do things the right way.
I'm really proud of them.  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: It was a tough loss, but we came in here, wanted revenge
from Mississippi State who beat us earlier this season.  
What coach said, like Maddie off the bench did a great job as point guard.
That last shot didn't fall, but it's not her fault. There's a lot of things we
could have done during the game, too.  
BRI KULAS: First off, just want to say good game to Mississippi State. They
played hard. But I thought that our team played hard, as well. I wouldn't
question our effort for anything tonight.  
Definitely not the way I wanted to go out. But I love my teammates and my
coaches. Just going to keep moving forward from here.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your team's fight. Your team is young, showed a
lot of resilience. Talk about the fight of your team being so young.  
COACH PINGETON: I am so proud of them. It starts with Bri Kulas. She's been a
great leader for us all season long.  
With our team and the culture that we've worked hard to create, we have a
group of young ladies that's committed to the front of their jersey, their
approach day in, day out. They have a second‑to‑none work ethic.  
When you're in the building stages, playing in a tough, tough league, you're
going to have some peaks and valleys throughout the course of a season. Our
kids have stayed extremely resilient. Never got too high or too low. Continued
to work hard. Nobody has ever been pointing fingers. It's never about who is
in the lineup. It's about the front of the jersey.  
I think that's pretty amazing for a group of 18‑, 19‑, 20‑year‑olds to be able
to do that consistently throughout the course of a season.  
  
Q. Sierra, can you talk about Bri's leadership.  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: Whenever we're having a tough time in practice or game, she
huddles us up and says we need to regroup, calm down, that we got this.  
She's amazing really.

### [Kenyotta Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26445)

### [Valencia McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21777)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Ole Miss  63  
Arkansas  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
COACH INSELL: What a great win for our basketball program and for our kids. I
told our kids we're playing as good as any team, we have to keep fighting till
the final buzzer.  
As you saw tonight, this team did not give up. Had plenty of chances to give
up when things weren't going our way. They kept fighting and kept fighting. I
got so much respect for our players. I'm proud of them.  
We're going to enjoy this tonight. We beat a very good Arkansas basketball
team and found a way to win at the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Valencia?  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: First of all, I'd just like to thank God. That was an
amazing comeback. When we got down, we never gave up. We just fought till the
very end and were able to pull off the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Kenyotta.  
KENYOTTA JENKINS: I want to thank God. Coach always talks about having
toughness and fight. The whole game we showed our toughness and we fought and
we won.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Take me through the last offensive possession.  
KENYOTTA JENKINS: Well, we missed a shot. Arkansas got the rebound. In the
huddle coach drew up a play. If they miss, somehow we have to get a stop. When
the shot went up, Diara got it going out of bounds, when I saw it there was
still time on the clock and I thought, Thank God. Put it up on the perimeter
and it was going in.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: It was basically just a toughness play from both Diara and
Kenyotta. For Diara to get the rebound and for Kenyotta to be able to finish
the play and put it back in. It was a great play altogether.  
  
Q. The play before that one, they had fouls to give, but you managed to get
the recovery on the inbound play. Describe what went on in that series of
possessions.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: Basically we was trying to get a stop, trying to foul.
Hopefully they would miss at the free‑throw line. Somehow they turned the ball
over and it just fell in our favor.  
COACH INSELL: We do this drill every day that's kind of a score‑stop,
score‑stop. We talked about that in the huddle, to see where we're at, if we
can do that. Score, get another stop, score, get another stop.  
We got that and it just continued on. That's all I kept on telling them, Stop,
score, stop, score. We finished the game on a 14‑2 run. It's amazing how this
team just continues to work hard every single day. We do not worry about our
record. But they work hard every single day to keep fighting till the final
buzzer.  
We worked on that drill a lot. They got tired of me working on that drill half
the time in practice. Tonight it came through for us. I'm proud of them for
that.  
  
Q. Kenyotta, extending your career one more game, what does that mean?  
KENYOTTA JENKINS: It just means we get to keep playing. I told the team before
we went out that I'm not ready to go home. We wasn't. So we fought till the
game. We not going home.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: Basically what Kenyotta said. We weren't ready to go home
yet. We want to continue playing. We're not done yet.  
  
Q. Coach, when you came to Ole Miss, you were taking on a rebuilding
project.  
COACH INSELL: Remodeling.  
  
Q. Talk about how much a win like this means for you in terms of motivating
and inspiring your players but also recruiting.  
COACH INSELL: This is a huge win. Ole Miss basketball, that's why I say
'remodeling,' it's one of the most storied programs in women's college
basketball. I didn't look at it as rebuilding, I looked at it as a process of
getting us back to the top.  
A win like this helps you get there. You beat Auburn on Sunday, you come back
beat Arkansas on Wednesday. Every time you get a chance to take the floor and
you continue to work hard, we're not only working hard for ourselves and our
teammates, we're working hard for the alumni.  
We had several of them here today. Made me proud in to get a win in front of
Peggy, Carol, Jennifer was here also. That's what paved the way for all of us
to be here. We're working hard every single day to live up to their
expectations. Where they want this program to be. We're going to get there.
We're going to get there.  
We talked about, before we came into this tournament, Georgia's men that did
it several years ago at the Georgia Dome where they played four games in four
days and won the tournament. We talked about Connecticut's men, they played
five games in five days and won all five of them, all of them were close.  
We came to this tournament playing to win it. We came here to play to win it.
That's what you come to the tournament before. We know we've been close all
year.  
The first step of our process to get our program back to where it was. We're
competitive. We're tired of being competitive, we want to win some games.  
  
Q. What did you think of Tia's game tonight?  
COACH INSELL: She's an all conference player. She's one of those explosive
players in this league. She battled all night. She had to play 39 minutes
coming off of a concussion. If the doctors would have allowed her, she would
have played Sunday.  
She's a warrior. 8‑10 from the field. I'm proud of her. When you look at that,
she was 1‑15 at Arkansas. She did not play well at Arkansas. She struggled.
She knew she struggled. She wanted to come in here and show Arkansas that she
wouldn't go 1‑14\. She did it, 8‑10\. Battled all night long. I'm proud of
Tia. I'm proud of all these girls. I'm proud of my whole team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Ole Miss  63  
Arkansas  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get an opening statement from coach.  
COACH COLLEN: It was obviously a tough loss for us. I felt like it was a game
that we had in hand, you know. I don't know whether we necessarily let up. I
don't think a team ever purposely lets up at the end of the game, but we
probably made some poor decisions in the latter part of the game that allowed
them to get more possessions on us. Ultimately those possessions probably
caught up with us.  
Give them credit, they made a play at the end of the game. We had a good look
at the end of the game. Probably could have won it.  
It's a tough one for us. I think this team deserves a little bit better fate.
I said all year long I think it's an NCAA tournament team, but you got to earn
the right to get into the NCAA tournament. In order to be able to do that,
you've got to be able to win these close games. We just didn't get that done.  
THE MODERATOR: Jessica?  
JESSICA JACKSON: Well, we went out there to play hard. We made a couple
mistakes, but we fought hard at the end. Just couldn't come up with the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Calli?  
CALLI BERNA: It's tough. I think we did fight hard. But we can't let up at the
end. We can't have those defensive mistakes we had. Ole Miss is a good team
and they're going to take those opportunities.  
I'm still proud of my team. I know how good we are. We didn't show that
tonight, but I know how good my team is. It's upsetting we came up short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
